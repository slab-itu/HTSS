Hidden species diversity in Sylvirana nigrovittata (Amphibia: Ranidae) highlights the importance of taxonomic revisions in biodiversity conservation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accurately delimiting species and their geographic ranges is imperative for conservation, especially in areas experiencing rapid habitat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southeast Asia currently has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, is home to multiple biodiversity hotspots, and the majority of its countries have developing economies with limited resources for biodiversity conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, accurately delimiting species and their ranges is particularly important in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined genetic and morphological variation in the widespread frog species Sylvirana nigrovittata (and its long-treated junior synonym S. mortenseni) with the goal of clarifying its taxonomic content and geographic range boundaries for conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present evidence that the current concept of S. nigrovittata contains at least eight species, two of which are each known from only two localities, but that S. mortenseni is more geographically widespread than currently realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of these species are described as new to science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accurately delimiting species is essential for effective conservation of biodiversity [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not possible to assess the biodiversity conservation status of a given area without knowing which species it contains and how geographically widespread those species are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite increased attention on habitats and ecosystems [24], individual species remain the primary units of conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Funding agencies and government policy continue to focus on species rather than habitats, and therefore accurate understanding of species distributions is imperative for informing conservation policy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worlds biodiversity hotspots are concentrated in the tropics [5], where large numbers of undescribed species, including undetected cryptic species, remain unrecognized [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cryptic species are two or more distinct species that are erroneously classified (= hidden) under a single species name [6].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryptic species are taxonomically widespread, found throughout the animal kingdom [911], and represented by both terrestrial and aquatic organisms [12, 13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such cryptic species pose challenges to taxonomists and conservation managers alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a taxonomists perspective, it can be difficult to diagnose species that exhibit minimal morphological divergence, and non-visual traits such as genetics or vocalizations (usually unavailable from historical specimens) often become the primary means of distinguishing among members of these complexes [8, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a conservation managers perspective, a lack of clarity on diversity and distributions often requires that cryptic species be lumped as their single nominate species during threat assessments, thus down-grading the acute conservation needs of individual cryptic species [8, 15].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amphibians have increasingly been shown to harbor cryptic species diversity [7, 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that amphibians are considered to be the worlds most threatened vertebrate group [16], it is essential to assess the extent of cryptic diversity in this group in order to prioritize conservation actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southeast Asia is a biodiversity hotspot [5] that simultaneously is experiencing the highest deforestation rate of all major tropical rainforest areas [17, 18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that large numbers of amphibian species are threatened by habitat loss, and that species with restricted geographic ranges are especially at risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even amphibian species that are commonly found in human-modified habitats (e.g., the four-lined tree-frog [Polypedates leucomystax], the Asian common toad [Duttaphrynus melanostictus], the grass frog [Fejervarya limnocharis]) are now known or suspected to represent complexes of cryptic species [1921].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana nigrovittata (Blyth 1856) is a notable example of a Southeast Asian frog species that has long been suspected to be hiding cryptic species diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this species (or its species complex) have a pale brown to dark brown dorsum; flank generally darker than dorsum; dorsolateral folds, with a black band (sometimes broken) of variable width extending from the tip of the snout to the groin along the lower margin of the dorsolateral fold; cream venter, sometimes with dark spotting; humeral glands in adult males; visible tympanum; and the upper one-third of the iris lighter in coloration than the lower two-thirds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originally described from Myanmar, this species is currently recognized as having a wide geographic range in mainland Southeast Asia that extends from northeastern India to Peninsular Malaysia [22, 23].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smith [24] provided evidence that S. nigrovittata is distinguishable from, but closely related to, S. mortenseni [25], a species described from Thailand and Myanmar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following year, Smith [26] reversed his assessment and synonymized the two species, treating S. mortenseni as only a geographical variant of S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Smith [26] recognized two additional, unnamed geographical variants of S. nigrovittata, one from peninsular Thailand and one from northeastern Thailand and Laos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of allozymic variation in samples of S. nigrovittata from across Thailand recovered two major genetic groups, one of which contained topotypic samples of S. mortenseni and therein justified its synonymy with S. nigrovittata [27].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ohler et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [28] removed S. mortenseni from the synonymy of S. nigrovittata on the basis of morphology, extended the range of S. mortensensi into mainland Cambodia and northeastern Thailand, and cited unpublished morphological data that suggested the presence of as many as five distinct species within the S. nigrovittata complex in Thailand and Indochina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] found that six samples from Vietnam and Myanmar that morphologically resembled S. nigrovittata failed to form a monophyletic group within the genus in molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly a century of observation on morphological variation, and recent molecular analyses, together provide compelling evidence that S. nigrovittata harbors cryptic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date no comprehensive analysis of variation across the range of S. nigrovittata (herein including S. mortenseni) has been conducted, but such an analysis is required to resolve this long-standing taxonomic uncertainty [30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generic status of S. nigrovittata has been in flux [29], but we follow Frost et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [31] and Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29] in recognizing Sylvirana Dubois, 1992 at the genus rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Herein, we present such an analysis of morphological and genetic variation (representing loci from both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes) in samples of S. nigrovittata obtained from across mainland Southeast Asia that represent most of its currently recognized geographic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We seek corroborated evidence from these multiple, independent datasets that S. nigrovittata consists of more than one distinct evolutionary lineage (= species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further use these findings to clarify the taxonomy and geographic ranges of these species in an effort to facilitate a revised evaluation of the conservation needs of each contained species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimens were collected in the field by the authors during 19982013, temporarily housed in individual plastic bags, humanely euthanized using immersion in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222; [32]), and fixed in 10% buffered formalin after preserving liver in 20% DMSO-salt saturated storage buffer, 95% ethanol, or RNAlater (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were later transferred to 70% ethanol for permanent storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens and tissue samples were deposited at the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM), and the Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, National University of Laos (NUOL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens and tissues were also borrowed from the holdings of these and other institutions (S1 & S2 Tables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_extraction__amplification__and_sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole genomic DNA was extracted from 349 liver or muscle samples (S1 Table) using the 5Prime ArchivePure DNA Cell/Tissue Kit (5Prime).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 467 bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes part of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit III (COXIII) gene, the complete tRNA glycine (Gly), the complete NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene, and part of the tRNA arginine (Arg), a 596606 bp fragment of mtDNA that encodes part of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) gene, and a 1,0581,084 bp fragment of mtDNA that encodes part of the tRNA methionine (Met), the complete NADH deydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene, and part of the tRNA tryptophan (Trp) gene were amplified by PCR (the polymerase chain reaction) following Stuart et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 607613 bp fragment of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) that encodes part of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene was amplified by PCR (94°C 45s, 57°C 30s, 72°C 1 min) for 35 cycles using the primer pair POMC-1 and POMC-2 [33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 9961,002 bp fragment of nuDNA that encodes part of the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) gene was amplified by PCR (94°C 45s, 53°C 30s, 72°C 1 min) for 35 cycles using the primer pair NCX_1F and NCX_3R [34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were cleaned using GELase (Epicentre Technologies) or ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix), and sequenced in both directions by direct double strand cycle sequencing using Big Dye version 3 chemistry (Perkin Elmer) and the amplifying primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were edited using Sequencher v. 4.1 (Genecodes) and deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MG605710MG607352 (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homologous sequences of the outgroup taxa Babina holsti, Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Hydrophylax leptoglossa, Hylarana erythraea, Indosylvirana attigua, Sylvirana cubitalis, and S. maosonensis [following 29, 35, 36] were downloaded from GenBank (S1 Table).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and the newly generated sequences were aligned using default settings in MAFFT [37], followed by visual verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignments were partitioned by gene and by codon position (if relevant), and concatenated mtDNA and concatenated nuDNA datasets were analyzed separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mixed-model Bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed using MrBayes 3.2.6 [38] on the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) Science Gate Way 3.3 [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best partitioning scheme, and best-fitting model of sequence evolution for each partition that is available for implementation in MrBayes 3.2.6, were selected using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in PartitionFinder 1.1.0 [40].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six selected partitions and models in the mtDNA dataset were GTR+I+ for COXIII third codon position, Met, and ND2 first codon position; GTR+ for COXIII first codon position, ND2 second codon position, and ND3 second codon position; JC for COXIII second codon position; GTR+I+ for 16S, Gly, ND3 first codon position, and Trp; GTR+I+ for ND2 third codon position and ND3 third codon position; and K80 for Arg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three selected partitions and models in the nuDNA dataset were SYM+I+ for NCX and POMC third codon positions; HKY+I+ for NCX and POMC first codon positions; and F81 for NCX and POMC second codon positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four independent Bayesian runs were performed on each dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the mtDNA dataset, four chains ran for 10,000,000 generations using the default priors, the chain temperature was set to 0.1, trees were sampled every 2,000 generations, and the first 25% of trees were discarded as burn in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the nuDNA dataset, four chains ran for 30,000,000 generations using the default priors, the chain temperature was set to 0.1, trees were sampled every 3,000 generations, and the first 50% of trees were discarded as burn in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trace plots were viewed using Tracer 1.6 [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An unrooted phylogenetic network of the concatenated nuDNA dataset was constructed using SplitsTree v4.14.4 [42] with uncorrected p genetic distances and the NeighborNet algorithm to visualize overall divergence patterns while accounting for reticulate (non-branching) relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only samples having both POMC and NCX sequence data were included in the phylogenetic network analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphological_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only sexually mature individuals were used in the morphological analyses, as determined by the presence of secondary sexual characteristics (vocal sac openings, nuptial pads, and/or humeral glands in males, and convoluted oviducts or mature ova in females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphometric data were taken only by the first author to minimize inter-observer bias [43, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve measurements were taken using Mitutoyo digital calipers, to the nearest 0.1 mm under a Meiji EMZ dissecting microscope: snout-vent length (SVL), head length from tip of snout to rear of jaws (HDL), maximum head width (HDW), snout length from tip of snout to anterior corner of eye (SNT), eye diameter (EYE), interorbital distance (IOD), internasal distance (IND), horizontal diameter of tympanum (TMP), shank length (SHK), thigh length (TGH), manus length from tip of third digit to base of outer palmar tubercle (HND), and pes length from tip of fourth toe to base of inner metatarsal tubercle (FTL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manus length (HND) and FTL were measured on the left side of the body, and all remaining measurements were taken from the right side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toe disc and phalanx width were also measured in holotypes and these measurements are reported to the nearest 0.01 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reported errors around means are standard deviations (SD; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw morphological data are given in S1 Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This table includes all individuals utilized for discriminant function analysis (DFA), which contains both sequenced and unsequenced individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that data are presented for females of S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., even though there were too few individuals of each to include in DFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Measurements used in discriminant function analysis (DFA) were corrected for differences in ontogenetic composition [45] using the following allometric equation: Xadj = X (SVLSVLmean), where Xadj is the adjusted value of the morphometric variable and X is the original value; SVLmean is the overall mean SVL for a given clade,  is the within-clade coefficient of the linear regression of X against SVL [46, 47].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA was performed on Xadj and SVL values using JMP Pro 9 [48] to determine whether the nominate species overlap in morphospace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were assigned to species in the DFA based on their assignment in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis (below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA was performed only for putative species that had measurement and sequence data for at least three individuals per sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DFA was performed on males of all species but only females of S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phylogenetic_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aligned mtDNA dataset contained 2,183 characters of 351 taxa (344 individuals of the S. nigrovittata complex), and the aligned nuDNA dataset contained 1,617 characters of 342 taxa (335 individuals of the S. nigrovittata complex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard deviation of split frequencies among the four Bayesian runs was 0.007004 in the mtDNA analysis and 0.031448 in the nuDNA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective sample sizes (ESS) obtained in Tracer [41] was  509 in the mtDNA analysis and  374 in the nuDNA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mtDNA Bayesian analysis found strong support for the monophyly of Sylvirana (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of the S. nigrovittata complex were recovered in at least eight major mtDNA clades, but samples referred to this complex from Chin and Mandalay States, Myanmar, rendered the complex non-monophyletic with respect to S. cubitalis and S. maosonensis (Figs 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The nuDNA Bayesian analysis also found strong support for the monophyly of Sylvirana and the non-monophyly of the S. nigrovittata complex with respect to to S. cubitalis and S. maosonensis owing to the same samples from Chin and Mandalay States, Myanmar (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the nuDNA Bayesian analysis revealed much less limited genetic structure among samples of the S. nigrovittata complex, with only four of the eight major mtDNA clades also recovered in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis (those referred to below as S. faber, S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unrooted phylogenetic network of the nuDNA data (Fig 6) revealed more genetic structure than did the nuDNA Bayesian analysis, with considerable admixture between two mtDNA lineages (those referred to as S. mortensensi and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., below), minimal admixture of two additional mtDNA lineages (those referred to as S. nigrovittata and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., below), and no admixture of the four lineages that were also reciprocally monophyletic in the Bayesian mtDNA and nuDNA analyses (those referred to below as S. faber, S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Morphological_analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, DFA of males correctly assigned 85% of specimens to their species (based on mtDNA clades), with correct classifications of species ranging from 69100% (Table 2; Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males of S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) were very distinct in morphospace (100% correct classification rates), but males of remaining species overlapped in morphospace with at least one other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While S. mortenseni slightly overlapped with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below), S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) strongly overlapped with S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.

Species_accounts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We follow Inger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [49] in adopting a conservative operational criterion of recognizing as species only those lineages that are diagnosable in more than one independent dataset, in this case, in morphology, mtDNA and/or nuDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this operational criterion, herein we recognize eight distinct species in the S. nigrovittata complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, S. faber, and five previously unnamed species, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Lectotype  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BMNH 1947.2.2.99 (= BMNH 1893.2.14.4), female, either immature or post-reproductive in having small, immature ova, Mergui, Myanmar, coll.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by W. Theobald.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dubois [56] designated the lectotype as BMNH 1947.2.2.93 = 1893.2.14.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BMNH 1947.2.2.99 is the catalog number that was re-assigned to the original number of BMNH 1893.2.14.4, the specimen BMNH 1947.2.2.99 is listed as one of the types of Rana nigrovittata, and no specimen with the number BMNH 1947.2.2.93 could be located in the catalog or type cabinet (David J. Gower, personal communication, 29 March 2013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assume that the re-assigned catalog number reported by Dubois [56] contained a typographical error, and that BMNH 1947.2.2.99 is the correct catalog number for the lectotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Females lack robust forearms and humeral glands (but often have a dark brown spot where humeral glands appear in males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females are larger than males on average, but there is considerable overlap in size (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal coloration varies from medium to very dark brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most individuals have at least some dark spots on dorsum, but some lack obvious markings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross bands on dorsal surfaces of limbs usually distinct, but are faint in a few individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventral coloration varies from immaculate creamy-white to very darkly mottled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark markings at base of throat are present in a few specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Webbing on Toe IV extends to between tubercles, or reaches distal tubercle, in some specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior rictal gland sometimes absent, but is usually visible, small, and rounded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana nigrovittata was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon of S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., to which it is parapatrically distributed (Fig 11), but was found to be distantly related to S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., the species with which it most closely overlaps in morphospace (Figs 1 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata was admixed in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. mortenseni, and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 5), but clustered in the nuDNA phylogenetic network as a species, with close similarity to S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana nigrovittata is geographically widespread, occurring from southern peninsular Thailand through eastern Myanmar, central and northern Thailand, northern Laos to northern Vietnam (Fig 11), and presumably into extreme southern China (see Remarks below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Males of S. nigrovittata strongly overlap with S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. in morphospace, but can be distinguished from that species by its significantly longer TGH:SVL (0.51 ± 0.04; S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.: 0.47 ± 0.04; t-stat = -4.11, df = 19, two-tailed p less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lack of females (n = 5) of S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. precluded statistical comparisons of females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata differs from S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by having an irregular pattern of dark marbling on light background on the posterior surface of thighs (indistinct pattern in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.), and by lacking an oblique, triangular or teardrop-shaped marking slightly posterior to the tympanum (present in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata differs from S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. in lacking a strong demarcation of dark (upper) and light (lower) coloring on the flank (present in S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males of S. nigrovittata have a smaller HDW:HDL (0.91 ± 0.03) than S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.94 ± 0.03; t-stat = -5.08, df = 120, p less_than 0.001) and a smaller HDW:SVL (0.36 ± 0.01) than S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.37 ± 0.01; t-stat = 5.90, df = 106, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females of S. nigrovittata have a smaller TMP:EYE (0.67 ± 0.05) than S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.73 ± 0.08; t-stat = -3.65, df = 52, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata differs from S. mortenseni by having males with SVL less_than 54 mm and females with SVL less_than 56 mm (the reverse in S. mortenseni), and from S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by the presence of a pineal gland (absent in S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the type locality of S. nigrovittata being near to the only known localities of S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., the lectotype and all all specimens referred here to S. nigrovittata have a pineal gland, but the pineal gland is lacking in all studied specimens of S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.. DFA correctly assigned males and females to S. nigrovittata 80% and 100% of the time, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our samples from Phongsaly Province, Laos, were obtained within approximately 35 air-km from the type locality of Hylarana (Sylvirana) menglaensis Fei, Ye and Xie, 2008 at Mengla County, Yunnan Province, China, on the border with Laos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Phongsaly samples matched mtDNA sequences of S. nigrovittata, and we failed to recover molecular or morphological evidence for more than one species in the S. nigrovittata complex occurring in the northern reaches of Laos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hylarana (Sylvirana) menglaensis was described without the use of molecular data, but was distinguished in its original description from S. nigrovittata on the basis of morphology, based on samples from Pahang, West Malaysia, which we refer to below as a separate species (S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we synonymize Hylarana (Sylvirana) menglaensis Fei, Ye and Xie, 2008 with S. nigrovittata [50].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type locality of Hylarana (Sylvirana) hekouensis Fei, Ye and Jiang, 2008 at Nanxi, Hekou County, Yunnan Province, China, near the border with Vietnam, lies almost equidistant between our nearest sampled locality of S. nigrovittata at Dien Bien Province, Vietnam (approximately 180 air-km away) and our northernmost sample of S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) at Bac Kan Province, Vietnam (approximately 170 air-km away).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No molecular data were provided in the original description of H. (S.) hekouensis [57].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six males in the type series of H. (S.) hekouensis had SVL 34.341.0 mm, with mean 38.2 mm (no measure of standard error provided; Fei et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2008 [57]), 11 males of S. nigrovittata that we examined from Dien Bien had SVL 34.344.8 mm, with mean 39.4 mm, and 16 males of S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (below) from throughout its known range (only a single specimen was available from Bac Kan) had SVL 40.252.0 mm, with mean 45.0 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, on the basis of size, the Hekou specimens are more similar to those from Dien Bien (= S. nigrovittata) than to those described here as S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a complete mitochondrial genome of H. hekouensis (GenBank accession number KX021954) provided by Chen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [59] is genetically more similar to our outgroup sample of S. maosonensis than it is to members of the S. nigrovittata complex (analysis not shown), but unfortunately the provenance of this GenBank sequence of H. (S.) hekouensis is not reported [59].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the taxonomic status of Hylarana (Sylvirana) hekouensis Fei, Ye and Jiang, 2008 remains uncertain, but it is not likely to be attributable to any species being described as new herein (the closest new taxon would be S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To draw attention to this taxonomic problem, we provisionally synonymize Hylarana (Sylvirana) hekouensis Fei, Ye and Jiang, 2008 with S. nigrovittata [50] on the basis of our, admittedly, very limited morphological (SVL) evidence, and urge further investigation into the taxonomic status of H. (S.) hekouensis using vouchered, known locality material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Designated herein, Zoological Museum University of Copenhagen (ZMUC) R072735, adult male, Thailand, Trat Province, Koh Chang Island, coll.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 January 1900 by Dr. Mortensen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The syntype series also included specimens from Yado and Thao, Upper Burma (Myanmar) [25], but the allocation of the Burmese specimens to S. mortenseni seems unlikely based on morphology and verified range of this species (below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Coloration_of_topotype_in_life_(based_on_photograph_by_Attapol_Rujirawan)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unvouchered individual (Fig 10B), Koh Chang Island, Trat Province, Thailand, photographed 29 January 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsum and dorsolateral fold brown with few small dark brown spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Canthus rostralis dark brown, lores brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal region yellow-beige.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limbs pale brown or beige.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hindlimbs with medium brown crossbands, and yellow coloration on anterior and posterior surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lip creamy white.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper one-quarter of iris bronze, lower three quarters of iris dark brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chin and chest creamy white with brown mottling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flank brown, fading to creamy coloration ventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Females lack robust forearms and humeral glands (but often have a dark brown spot where humeral glands appear in males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males and females greatly overlap in SVL [mean SVL is not significantly different (62.7 ± 8.7 and 60.3 ± 6.2 for males and females, respectively; t-stat = -1.28, df = 38, p  0.20)], but males can achieve larger SVL (up to 81 mm, while females reach only 69 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males have larger HDW:HDL ratio (0.94 ± 0.04; t-statistic = 2.92, df = 38, p less_than 0.01) and HDW:SVL ratio (0.37 ± 0.01; t-statistic = 7.33, df = 28, p less_than 0.001) than females (0.92 ± 0.03 and 0.34 ± 0.01, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circummarginal grooves are not visible on the fingers of the lectotype, but are distinctly visible in all recently preserved specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dorsal coloration varies from medium to dark brown, with or without very small dark spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mostindividuals have a thick dark line along ventral margin of the dorsolateral fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most individuals have dark coloration on upper regions of flank, fading to pale coloration ventrally, but the transition from dark to light coloration on the flank is extremely variable, but never with a sharp demarcation: some individuals have minimal dark coloration above and mostly light-colored flanks, while other individuals have mostly dark-colored flanks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most individuals have medium to large dark spots on the flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ventral coloration is extremely variable, ranging from creamy white to nearly black with dark mottling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some individuals have pale throats or bellies, with the remaining ventral surfaces heavily mottled, while other individuals have consistent coloration across all ventral surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underside of thighs may be cream or heavily stippled so as to appear grey or mottled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most often dark ventral coloration is stippled or mottled, rather than concentrated in distinct dark spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spots on rear of thighs vary from about 25% to subequal diameter of the tympanum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior rictal gland is absent or only weakly visible in some individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lip coloration varies from creamy white to very dark brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature males have enlarged forearms, humeral glands, and faint nuptial pads that are sometimes difficult to see with the naked eye, but are visible under a dissecting microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of sexual maturity, males always have dark spots at the humeral gland location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vocal slits are visible in some males, and presence/absence does not seem to correspond with collection locality or body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana mortenseni contained two mtDNA subclades, one containing samples from southwestern Cambodia and southeastern Thailand, and one containing samples from central Cambodia, southern Laos, and eastern Thailand (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon to a clade containing S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 1), the latter of which it also slightly overlaps with in morphospace (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni was admixed in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. nigrovittata, and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 5), but clustered in the nuDNA phylogenetic network with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana mortenseni occurs from southeastern and eastern Thailand through central Laos and southwestern and central Cambodia (Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni occurs in syntopy with S. faber in southwestern Cambodia [60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sylvirana mortenseni can be distinguished from S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by having significantly larger body size (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni can be distinguished from S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by having an irregular pattern of dark marbling on light background on the posterior surface of thighs (indistinct pattern in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) and by lacking an oblique, triangular or teardrop-shaped marking slightly posterior to the tympanum (present in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni differs from S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by the lack of a strong demarcation between dark and pale coloration on the flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni strongly overlaps with S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. in morphospace (Fig 7), but males are approximately 8% larger than that species (Table 1), while females of these two species do not significantly differ in SVL (t-stat = 0.68, df = 27, p = 0.50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, females of this species have a smaller FTL:SVL (0.49 ± 0.03) than S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.50 ± 0.02; t-stat = -2.21, df = 27, p = 0.04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana mortenseni is significantly larger than S. nigrovittata, and the presence of a pineal gland distinguishes this species from S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. DFA correctly assigned males and females of this species 94% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon to S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 1 and Fig 4), but from which it is distinct in morphospace (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana montosa was admixed in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis with S. mortenseni, S. nigrovittata, and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 5), but clustered in the nuDNA phylogenetic network with S. mortenseni (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This species ranges from southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia through central Laos (Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. may be sympatric with S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. in Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area, Laos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Referred_material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional specimens are referred to the new species in S2 Table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Etymology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specific epithet refers to the Annamite Mountains (as Xai Phou Luang in Lao or Day Truong Son in Vietnamese) along the border of Laos and Vietnam that coincide with most of the geographic range of the new species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Coloration_of_referred_specimen_AMNH_A-181996_in_life_(based_on_photograph_by_David_Kizirian)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult male (Fig 10E), SVL 43.3, Phuoc Son District, Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam Province, Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsum reddish brown with paler spots and some darker spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark stripe extending along ventral margin of dorsolateral fold from snout through eye and tympanum to groin, reduced to a narrow stripe posterior to axilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flanks yellowish-brown with dark brown spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal surfaces of forelimbs beige with irregular dark markings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal surfaces of hindlimbs darker beige with dark brown cross bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lip and rictal glands white.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper one-quarter of iris golden, lower part bronze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Females lack robust forearms and humeral glands (but often have a dark brown spot where the humeral gland appears on males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females (SVL 51.2 ± 1.8, n = 5) are larger than males (45.0 ± 2.9, n = 16), but we were unable to test this difference statistically due to small sample size of adult females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dorsal coloration varies from medium-to-dark brown, with variable dark mottling or spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lips grey, brown, or cream, or some combination of darker color anteriorly fading to cream posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coloration on flanks usually with thin dark stripe just ventral to dorsolateral fold, fading to light ventral coloration with distinct spots, but a few individuals have very dark flanks with dark spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventral coloration ranges from immaculate creamy-white to very darkly mottled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few specimens have two small faint stripes just lateral to the midline at the base of the throat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior rictal gland may be ovoid or round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon to S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 1 and Fig 4), from which it is distinct in morphospace (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana annamitica was admixed in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis with S. mortenseni, S. nigrovittata, and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 5), but clustered in the nuDNA phylogenetic network near to S. nigrovittata (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This species ranges from northern Vietnam southward through central Laos and central Vietnam, with most of its distribution coinciding with the Annamite (= Xai Phou Luang or Day Truong Son) Mountains (Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. differs from S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. in having an irregular pattern of dark marbling on light background on posterior surface of thighs (indistinct pattern in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.), and in lacking an oblique teardrop-shaped or triangular marking posterior to tympanum (present in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. can be distinguished from S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by lacking a strong demarcation between dark (upper) and pale (lower) parts of flank (present in S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. differs from both S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. mortenseni by having smaller SVL for both males and females (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males of this species strongly overlap with S. nigrovittata in morphospace, but can be distinguished by the significantly shorter TGH:SVL (0.47 ± 0.05; S. nigrovittata: 0.51 ± 0.04; t-stat = -3.16, df = 19, two-tailed p less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. can be distinguished from S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. by the presence of a pineal gland (absent in S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males were correctly assigned to this species 69% of the time in DFA, and females (n = 5) were correctly assigned to species 100% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type locality of Hylarana (Sylvirana) hekouensis Fei, Ye and Jiang, 2008 lies only approximately 170 air-km away from our northernmost sample of S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. at Bac Kan Province, Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our morphological evidence suggests that the new species is not synonymous with H. (S.) hekouensis, but rather that H. (S.) hekouensis is more likely to be synonymous with S. nigrovittata (see that species account above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sylvirana malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon to a clade containing S. nigrovittata, S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was also recovered as a distinct lineage in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis and nuDNA phylogenetic network (Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution_and_natural_history  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This species occurs from southern peninsular Myanmar and Thailand through the Malay Peninsula (Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Berry [67] noted that it occurs (as Rana nigrovittata) in the Malaysian states of Perlis, Kedah, Perak, and Selangor, all of which are along the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, with the southernmost reference being Batu Caves, Selangor, just north of Kuala Lumpur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strong demarcation of light and dark coloring on the flank distinguishes S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. from all other species in the S. nigrovittata complex (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, females of this species have the smallest HDW:HDL of any species (0.83 ± 0.02; ANOVA F(4,111) = 15.49; p less_than 0.001), but the largest SNT:SVL (0.15 ±0.01; ANOVA F(4,111) = 6.16; p less_than 0.001), and a significantly smaller HDW:SVL than females of other species that were tested (0.32 ± 0.004; ANOVA F(4,111) = 11.38, p less_than 0.001), including S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.33 ± 0.008; t-stat = -3.94, df = 7, p less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA revealed that males of this species strongly overlap in morphospace with S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., but males of this species have larger TMP:EYE ratio (0.74 ± 0.06; t-stat = -2.35, df = 31, two-tailed p less_than 0.02), and a smaller HDW:SVL (0.33 ± 0.01; t-stat = 4.43, df = 28, two-tailed p less_than 0.001) than S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (0.70 ± 0.03 and 0.34 ± 0.01, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFA correctly assigned males to this species 77% of the time, and females to this species 100% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

CAS 229664 (not examined by us; Fig 10G), Thaye Chaung Township, Dewei District, Tanintharyi State, Myanmar (Burma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsum medium brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark stripe extending along ventral margin of dorsolateral fold from tip of snout to groin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventral half of flank mostly cream with dark spots that merge into dark stripe on upper flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper one-third of iris golden brown, lower two-thirds metallic brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lip and rictal glands white.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chin mottled grey-brown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humeral gland dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal surfaces of hindlimbs brown with dark brown cross bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal surfaces of forelimbs medium brown with few small dark spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Females lack robust forearms and humeral glands (but often have a dark brown spot where humeral glands appear in males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female (SVL 49.2 mm) larger than males (SVL 43.6 ± 1.3 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsum varies from beige to medium or dark brown with some darker spotting, although most individuals are nearly uniformly colored without spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lips usually creamy-white, but are dark in a few individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coloration on flank is variable: dark coloration may begin at snout and continue as a thick band through the eye and tympanum to the groin; the lores may be pale with dark coloration beginning posterior to tympanum extending to the groin; or dark coloration may be restricted to the area between the axilla and dorsolateral fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All individuals have at least some creamy white coloration on the ventral half of the flank, but the amount and pattern varies: in some individuals, the flank is mostly white with some dark brown spots, but in most individuals, the light coloration is covered by several dark brown spots that blend into the darker coloration of the upper half of the flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin on flank may be smooth or distinctly glandular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior rictal gland may be absent, or small and round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventral surfaces vary from nearly immaculate creamy-white to very heavily mottled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pair of thin dark stripes at base of throat are absent, extremely faint, or obscured by chin mottling in some individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuptial pads are visible under the microscope in 10 of 12 males that also have some enlargement of humeral glands (the two males without nuptial pads, CAS 229665, CAS 243898, may be very young adults nearing maturity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sylvirana roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was recovered in the mtDNA Bayesian analysis to be the sister taxon to S. nigrovittata (Figs 1 and 2), but to be distantly related to S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. (Fig 1) with which it greatly overlaps in morphospace (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. was also recovered as a distinct lineage in the nuDNA Bayesian analysis (Fig 5), but clustered in the nuDNA phylogenetic network near to S. nigrovittata (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution_and_natural_history  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This species is currently known only from Tanintharyi State in southern Myanmar (Burma; Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

This species is distinguished from all other members of this species group by having indistinct pattern on the posterior surface of thighs (irregular pattern of dark marbling on light background in other species), and by the presence of a small, oblique teardrop-shaped or triangular marking posterior to tympanum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other members of this species group have webbing on Toe IV reaching the base of the disc, although this is variable in S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males can also be distinguished from other members of this species group by the presence of large, well-developed nuptial pads, combined with a size of less than 46 mm SVL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, males of this species are smaller with proportionately smaller features (HDL, TMP, HND, e.g.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than other species in this group (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male TMP:EYE ratio, for example, is smaller (0.63 ± 0.04) than other species (0.700.75 ± 0.030.06; ANOVA F (6,256) = 8.22, p less_than 0.001), as is HDL:SVL (0.36 ± 0.02; ANOVA F(6,256) = 21.64, p less_than 0.001), but SHK:SVL (0.58 ± 0.03) is larger than in other species (0.520.55 ± 0.010.03; ANOVA F(6,256) = 8.91, p less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ANOVA shows that females have a smaller HDL:SVL (0.35 ± 0.01; other species 0.37 ± 0.01; ANOVA F(4, 111) = 6.20, p = 0.001) and TMP:EYE (0.60 ± 0.06; ANOVA F(4,111) = 8.57, p less_than 0.001) than other species tested (0.670.73 ± 0.050.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, females have the largest SHK:SVL (0.59 ± 0.02; ANOVA F(4,111) = 11.99, p less_than 0.001), and TGH:SVL (0.55 ± 0.03; ANOVA F(4,111) = 3.61, p less_than 0.01) of any species examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males were correctly assigned to this species in DFA 100% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females were not included in DFA with other species due to insufficient sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our DFA showed that males of this species are very distinct in morphospace from other members of this species group (Fig 7), with individuals correctly assigned 100% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample size of females was too small for DFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  



Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present evidence to reject the hypothesis that frogs that morphologically resemble S. nigrovittata should continue to be recognized as a single species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we hypothesize that these frogs represent a minimum of eight distinct evolutionary lineages that should be recognized as species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our evidence for their recognition as species is based on three independent lines of evidence, morphology (both qualitative and quantitative measures of phenotype), mtDNA, and/or nuDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial DNA divergence provided us with a framework for initially partitioning up this complex, and those mitochondrial lineages corroborated by morphological or nuDNA divergence were recognized and named herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous subclades of mtDNA (Figs 14) were not recognized herein as species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three previously named species (S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, and S. faber) and two newly-named species (S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) were readily distinguishable using the data that were available to us.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the newly named species (S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. montosa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.) were less readily distinguishable from S. nigrovittata and S. mortenseni, but sufficient evidence existed in our view to support the hypothesis that these three also represented distinct species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three named taxa may be less easily diagnosed because they are younger evolutionary lineages, or incipient species, that continue to share ancestral polymorphisms in nuDNA and morphology with S. nigrovittata or S. mortenseni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We emphasize that our recognized eight species are hypotheses that remain testable with new data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finer-scale, denser sampling at the geographic boundaries of the proposed species, accompanied by the use of multi-locus data sets to delimit species using coalescent-based methods such as *BEAST [68] or Bayesian Phylogenetics & Phylogeography [69], should be employed to further test these hypotheses of species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic data, such as advertisement calls of males, should also be compared at these species boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of more than one species in at least partial sympatry (central Laos) and syntopy (southwestern Cambodia) suggests that isolating mechanisms between at least some of these species probably exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of acoustic variation, and other parameters such as timing of reproduction, mode of reproduction, and microhabitat use of different life stages (larvae and adults) may provide important insight into these isolating mechanisms and further clarify species boundaries in this group of frogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not study larvae in this group, as we lacked sufficient material, and previously published descriptions of larvae from across the geographic range of the species complex have found great similarities in larval shape, size, coloration, and oral characters among populations [30, 66, 70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this study should provide a framework for new, targeted sampling of larvae, with identifications verified with DNA barcoding methods [e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30], that are then studied using tools such as scanning electron microscopy of the buccopharyngeal morphology, a method that has been shown to be useful in revealing differences in larval characters of otherwise morphologically cryptic species [71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The S. nigrovittata complex is taxonomically challenging and ripe with morphologically cryptic species that are difficult to tease apart; for these reasons, S. nigrovittata has been recognized as being polytypic for nearly a century, but without formal description of much of this variation [24, 2630, 72].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our findings are largely consistent with those of others, although the interpretations of the same variation across the range of S. nigrovittata may differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smith [26] noted three distinct morphotypes within Thailand, and these largely agree with our hypotheses of at least three species occurring in the country (S. nigrovittata, S. mortenseni, and S. malayana sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matsui et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [27], using allozymic data, found that populations of S. mortenseni at Koh Chang, Thailand (its type locality) and S. nigrovittata at Phu Wua in northeastern Thailand formed a group that was separate from populations at Phu Luang and elsewhere in northern Thailand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They used these findings to justify treating S. mortenseni as a junior synomym of S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the same general pattern of genetic (and morphological) variation, but instead expanded the range of S. mortenseni into northeastern Thailand [as did 28], and assigned samples from Phu Luang (and elsewhere in northern Thailand) to S. nigrovittata sensu stricto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gawor et al.s [30] recovery of distinct mitochondrial DNA clades in central Vietnam and northern Thailand is also corroborated in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the most compelling justifications for rejecting the hypothesis that S. nigrovittata contains a single species is the non-monophyly of frogs that morphologically resemble S. nigrovittata to other species of Sylvirana [29, this study].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate improved communication, we recommend modifying the concept of the S. nigrovittata complex from that employed at the start of our study [and that by 29] to one that reflects only those lineages that form a monophyletic group with the nominate form, S. nigrovittata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we recommend not continuing to treat S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. as a member of the S. nigrovittata complex, despite the general similarity in its morphology that led to its inclusion in our initial study and that by Oliver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [29].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our hypotheses of species in this complex are likely an underestimate, as anecdotal evidence suggests the high likelihood of additional, unstudied diversity in the group, notably in Myanmar and Sumatra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boulengers [73] syntypes of S. mortenseni from Koh Chang, Thailand, and Mon, Myanmar, were examined by us and cursorily determined to represent two morphologically distinct species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The designation of a lectotype herein from Koh Chang assigns the form from that locality to the name S. mortensensi, but we chose to not include the Mon specimens in our study (or to assign them a name) owing to the unavailability of genetic material from Mon or its vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a single specimen of S. nigrovittata from off of the mainland of Southeast Asia, in Sumatra, Indonesia, was cursorily examined by us (FMNH 210049), but was also not included in this study owing to lack of accompanying genetic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, two species in this complex from southern China that were recently named as new species without genetic evidence, S. menglaensis and S. hekouensis (Fei, Ye & Xie, 2008; Fei, Ye & Jiang, 2008) were synonymized by us with S. nigrovittata on the basis of samples available to us from nearby localities in Laos and Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these synonymies should be verified with additional sampling at, or much closer to, their type localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further sampling in Myanmar, Sumatra, and southern China, and study of the resulting collections, may reveal additional diversity and/or help to clarify species boundaries in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While S. nigrovittata sensu stricto remains geographically widespread in our study, the other members of this group have considerably smaller geographic ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sylvirana nigrovittata is currently listed as a species of global Least Concern [23], in part due to its wide geographic range [74].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, S. mortenseni and the five species newly described here need a reassessment of their conservation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, S. lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov. and S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., are currently known only from two localities each and so may have acute conservation needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, S. mortenseni was listed as Near Threatened [23] based on having a known geographic range of only Koh Chang Island, Thailand, and the adjacent Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia at the time of the assessment [75].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provided evidence that the geographic distribution of this species is much larger than previously realized (Fig 11; and see [28]), and thus S. mortenseni could warrant a downgrade in its conservation assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of size of geographic range, all species here suffer habitat loss, as deforestation rates in Southeast Asia continue to be among the highest globally [18].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threat of habitat loss is particularly acute for those species having known narrow geographic distributions (e.g., Sylvirana lacrima sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., S. roberti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov., and S. annamitica sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nov.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underscores the importance of properly delimiting species in complexes of cryptic taxa, as well as their geographic ranges, in order to accurately assess conservation priorities within countries and across the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
