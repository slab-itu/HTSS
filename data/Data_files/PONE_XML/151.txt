Eight New Species of Charinus Simon, 1892 (Arachnida: Amblypygi: Charinidae) Endemic for the Brazilian Amazon, with Notes on Their Conservational Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight new species of Charinus Simon, 1892 are described for the Brazilian Amazon, from the states of Pará (C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. bonaldoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. guto sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.) and Amazonas (Charinus brescoviti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. ricardoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All new species can be differentiated from the other species of the genus by the number of pseudo-articles in basitibia IV, the presence/absence of median eyes, and the shape of the female gonopod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brazil now becomes the country with the largest diversity of Amblypygi in the world, with 25 known species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the new species described here have a high degree of endangerment: C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. is threatened by the flood caused by the hydroelectric dam of Belo Monte, and C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. are endangered by the iron mining in Carajás municipality and surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Charinus species here described are endemic to the Amazon Region, so in order to assure their preservation, it is strongly recommended a special care with their habitats (type localities) which are facing increasing rates of destruction and deforestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amblypygi is a small arachnid order with a worldwide distribution and the largest number of described species in the Neotropics [1, 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, circa of 170 species are known and several new ones have been described in the last few years from all over the world [316].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this increase in knowledge of whip spider diversity, some countries with recognized enormous diversity of fauna still have few known Amblypygi species described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a 8,514,877 km² territory size [17] and six biomes (Amazon Forest (humid broad leaf forest), Caatinga (small woody and herbaceous deciduous, caducifolious, spiny species [18]), Cerrado (open tree and shrub woodland [19]), Atlantic Forest (costal forest), Pantanal (tropical swampland) and Pampa (grasslands)) Brazil has records of just 17 species of these arachnids in all biomes, except in the Pampa where amblypygids are not found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its presence in all these heterogenic regions shows Brazils potential to harbor high diversity due to proper environmental condition, such as favorable temperature, humidity, and availability of food, each environment in its own way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the different Brazilian biomes, the Amazon region stands out for its huge diversity, enigmatic biogeography, and little knowledge about the species that live there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenced by tectonics [20], marine transgression [2124], climate change [25, 26] paleoenvironmental changes [27], niche conservatism [2830] and dispersal ability [31], several speciation events occurred in Amazonia during the last 53 million years and there is still a lot to be unveiled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after centuries of scientific expeditions to that forest, new species and subspecies of big vertebrates, like monkeys [32], continue to be discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite of its incredible biodiversity, conservative measures are not efficient and several human activities threaten the Amazonian environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current most important are the construction of highways, hydroelectric dams and mining activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highways crossing areas of Amazonia effects the dispersal and migration of many species, causes border effect, allows the entry of squatters and causes deforestation by itself [3335].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroelectric dams kill and force the migration of several species due to floods of large areas; moreover, the reservoir build artificial islands affecting the composition, abundance and richness of the species living on them [36, 37].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, mining is a central issue, once this practice irreversibly destroy unique habitats, like caves; in Brazil the concern regarding conservation versus mining is even higher due to recent changes in laws which allows exploitation of protected areas and indigenous lands [38, 39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the increasing threats towards the Amazon forest it is important to unveil whip spider diversity before they disappear, as most of them are extremely sensitive to environmental changes [2] and could help identifying priority areas for directing conservation efforts [2, 14].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By now only one species of Charinidae is known from this region [7], but in this paper eight new are described and illustrated; moreover, an identification key is provided for all species from the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this, the number of whip spiders' species in the country is almost doubled, and the knowledge of the group morphology is considerably increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Material_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All analyzed material was from zoological custodian collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The name of the collection and their deliberation by the Brazilian government are: Instituto Butantan (IBSP; Coleção Entomológica de Aracnídeos e de Miriápodes; process number 02000.004897/2005-99; Deliberation number 147, published in the Official Gazette of the Union (D.O.U.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on 07.28.2006, Section 1, page 100); Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (MNRJ; Setor Aracnologia; process number 02000.002444/2002-85; Deliberation number 06, published in the D.O.U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on 10.14.2002, Section 1, page 115); Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG; Coleção Invertebrados; process number 02000.001401/2002-82, Deliberation number 02, published in the D.O.U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on 07.26.2002, Section 1, page 141); Museu de Zoologia da USP (MZSP; Coleção de Aracnídeos; process number 02000.001100/2002-59; Deliberation number 02, published in the D.O.U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on 07.26.2002, Section 1, page 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Laboratory_procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, for measurements and nomenclature, we followed the proposals of Quintero [40] and for the nomenclature of the male gonopod we followed Giupponi and Kury [13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pedipalp article, called tarsus by Quintero [40], is here divided in distitarsus and tarsal claw (pretarsus) as the two articles are not fused in Charinidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements of pedipalp articles were taken between the external condiles of each segment in order to establish fixed points and proper length measurements [41].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were taken from several specimens (number indicated as n =) and the median value is given followed by the range in parentheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement accuracy is indicated in the legend of each figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maps were created using ArcMap 10.2 [42], with vector layers for countries and states/provinces and ancillary data including water body data [43].  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative_morphology_and_taxonomy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The female genitalia of whip spiders is considered the most reliable structure to identify and determine species identity [2, 44].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weygoldt [45] defined four species groups of Charinus based on this structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are: Charinus australianus species group, Charinus brasilianus species group, Charinus bengalensis species group, and Charinus seychellarum species group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The australianus group is the most widely distributed, with species in Australia, Brazil, Cuba, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and Peru (C. australianus (L. Koch, 1867), C. acosta (Quintero, 1983), C. koepckei Weygoldt, 1972, C. milloti Fage, 1939, C. neocaledonicus Simon, 1895 in Kraepelin, 1895, C. pecki Weygoldt, 2006, C. pescotti Dunn, 1949 and C. vulgaris) [7, 12, 4652].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group is recognized by the cushion-like gonopod and basitibia IV divided in three or four articles (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All species here described also have a rounded cushion-like gonopod (Fig 4A4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to the only other Amazonian species of Charinus (C. vulgaris), none of the newly described species have basitibia IV divided in four articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. brescoviti sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ricardoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. bonaldoi sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. have basitibia divided in two articles, and C. guto sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. have basitibia IV divided in three articles (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All Caribbean and one of the north South American Charinus species with described gonopod also have rounded cushion-like gonopods, and should be included in the C. australianus species group; they are C. cubensis (Quintero, 1983), C. perezassoi Armas, 2010, C. platnicki (Quintero, 1986), and C. victori Armas, 2010 [3, 53].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the number of species in the australianus species group increases to 22, and this number can get higher once more gonopods of the known and new species are described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another feature of the Amazonian species of Charinus is the small size of their structures and appendages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All species known so far from Amazonia are smaller than those of the western part of South America (C. brasilianus, C. montanus, C. asturius, C. acaraje, C. mysticus, C. troglobius, C. eleonore, C. potiguar and C. jiboassu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides that, the Amazonian species have lower number of teeth on the chelicerae claw (Charinus potiguar, C. eleonorae and C. troglobius, for example, have 11, 10 and 9 teeth, respectively; on the other hand Charinus ferreus has 7; C. brescoviti, C. carajas and C. bichuetteae, 6; C. ricardoi and C. guto, 5; and C. bonaldoi, C. orientalis and C. vulgaris, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conservational_status_of_Charinus_in_Brazil  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Threats_and_protection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Brazilian species of Charinus are considered endemic as the majority of them are only known from their type locality, even after investigation in nearby areas or in places with similar conditions of the type locality [14, 41, 5457].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. mysticus and C. eleonorae, for example, are recorded only from one cave or group of caves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the endemicity of Charinus species, environmental disturbances have a direct effect on the species survivor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first troglobious Charinus described in Brazil (Charinus troglobious) is threatened by the destruction or alteration of the physic conditions of the caves they inhabit; this species is already in the red list of the Brazilian Environmental Ministry (Ministério do Meio Ambiente, MMA) considered as endangered [58].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent meetings between researchers and Brazilian environmental Federal agencies, a document was formalized and will be used as basis to the new official Environmental Ministry list of threatened species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new list will changes the status of C. troglobius from threatened to critically threatened, and will add C. acaraje and C. mysticus as species with deficient data, C. potiguar as vulnerable, C. asturius as endangered, and C. eleonorae as critically endangered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Likewise, of the eight species here described, four are in regions of intense human exploitation or environmental modification; moreover, they are not known from other areas besides of the type locality and have small population size; for these reasons, these species should be considered to be included in the list of threatened species; they are: C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.. Charinus bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. is only found in caves that will be influenced by the lake of the hydroelectric dam Belo Monte, Pará.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies showed that the higher level of the water will have negative influences (biologically [37, 59] and socially [60, 61]) in the region, but these effects were not taken into account by the governmental agencies and the building of the reservoir was authorized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, caves such as Kararaô, China, Paratizão, Sismógrafo and others will be affected [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, specific studies to understand the impact of the environmental alterations on the species populations that inhabit the caves were not made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the flooding, some caves will be completely submerged (such as Assurini shelter, Abutre shelter and Gravura shelter), and others will have its dynamic altered (such as China cave, Kararaô cave, Kararaô Shelter, Paratizão shelter and Sismógrafo/Tatu shelter) [62].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The habitat viability in sustaining these species will be severely compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of constructing dams in Amazonia go beyond threatens to invertebrate or cave animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Brazilian government Program for the Acceleration of Growth started in 2007, a series of environmental unsustainable infrastructure projects were and are being built in Amazonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these counted with non-specialist researchers studying the fauna and flora surveyed to write reports on environmental impacts, generating large criticism on the criteria adopted by the government to evaluate the impact of the projects [34, 63].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that reason, consequences such as long-term extinction induction [64] and block of fish migration [65] by hydroelectric dams are unavoidable problems of powerplants built in the lowlands of Amazonia [34, 64, 65].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same can be said for the mining exploitation in the country, where the laws are being relaxed and soon companies will be allowed to extract ore from inside of preserved areas [39].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of practice directly affects the new species here described Charinus carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region where these species inhabits is a hematite mining area and all three were collected inside iron caves in an area called Canga (Brazilian name to isolated inselbergs on tops of mountains in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará, associated with superficial iron crust, characterized by the presence of iron stone and ferricrete soils, similar to the banded iron formations (BIFs) in South-Western Australia; it is also characterized by high local and regional diversity [66, 67]), and lots of those caves are being destroyed by one of the largest mining companies of the planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therewith, the environment is suffering large alterations [68].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not known whether these species inhabits also outside the caves or in other caves, so the destruction of the Canga presets a real threaten to these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides Charinus, there are two endemic microwhip scorpion (Palpigradi) species known from the region (Leptokoenenia thalassophobica Souza & Ferreira, 2013 and Leptokoenenia pelada Souza & Ferreira, 2013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They occur in the same cave system as C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. (Serra Norte and Serra Leste), highlighting the importance of the preservation of those endemic-species host caves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the Brazilian laws (law decree number 6640), caves that are type locality are considered as highly relevant to protect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, it is suggested that, within the legal parameters used by the Brazilian Environmental Ministry (MMA and ICMBio), four of the new species (C. carajas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. orientalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n., C. bichuetteae sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n. and C. ferreus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n.) be elected and included as critically endangered in the list of species in extinction risk, and their habitats be protected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Outside Para State, in the rest of the Amazon Forest (where the other species of Amazonian Charinus occur), the conservation of the Forest is also debatable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last two years (20132015) there was an increase of more than 90% of the deforestment in the region and comparing January of 2014 and 2015, a decrease of 70% in the forest cover was detected [69].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deforestation affects not only life in Amazonia, but influence the whole continent, changing the climate of South America [70].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, thus, show an urgent need for an active protection measure of the Amazonian forest and its biodiversity, and the most logic way is to start with the type localities of (mainly the) endemic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_distribution_of_Charinus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vasconcelos, Giupponi and Ferreira [14] performed an analysis of potential distribution of Charinus and argued that "Charinus has most of its species represented on islands such as the Antilles, Solomon Islands in the Southwest Pacific, Ilha Bela in Brazil, Saint Thomas and Prince and Seychelles in Africa, or in portions near the continental coastlines, as in Venezuela, Peru, Panama, on the eastern borders of the Mediterranean, and India".  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also add that "this predisposition to occupy coastline portions and islands is also revealed in the Charinus potential distribution".  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a careful analysis of the localities where Charinus species occur shows that its distribution are almost always areas of easy access, such as highways, waterways, and populated and touristic places.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the current distribution of Charinus is biased by the collecting effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, specimens of this genus are casually found, being this probably the main reason why Charinus is not well represented in non-touristic places, such as central areas of Brazil and many other countries (with exception of Cuba) and continents (such as Africa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To efficiently collect specimens of Charinus it is needed a direct expedition or lucky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the potential distribution found by Vasconcelos, Giupponi and Ferreira [14] may pass a biased impression of high diversity in some areas (such as the Southeast region of Brazil) and low diversity in others (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amazonia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis shows, for example, that the probability of presence of Charinus in the Amazonian plain is as small as places where Charinus (or even Amblypygi) do not exist, such as south South America (Chile, Argentina and Uruguay).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, actually, the diversity of Charinus species in Amazonia is highest than thought and predicted, and now eight new species are known from that region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The map presented by Vasconcelos, Giupponi and Ferreira [14] also shows the occurrence of Charinus in the coastal area of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states (southern Brazil), a place with conditions not similar to any other place where Charinus occur, and without a real register of the genus (this is a well collected region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spot in the map is present due to a misunderstanding generated by the homonymy and posterior change of name of two cities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mello-Leitão [71] described C. schirchii from a city called "Therezopolis", which at that time named two cities in different states, Santa Catarina and Rio de Janeiro, but Mello-Leitão [71] did not mention from which state the specimens came from.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterwards, Harvey [1] catalogued C. schirchii from "Theresópolis (now Queçaba), Santa Catarina", and Vasconcelos, Giupponi and Ferreira [14] followed this, generating the occurrence spot in the southern region of Brazil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, it is possible to assure that the "Therezopolis referred to by Mello-Leitão [71] was from the state of Rio de Janeiro, once the collector of the specimens, Dr. Paul F. Schirch, gathered considerable zoological material from Serra dos Órgãos, mainly in the municipality of Teresópolis (currently spelled differently from the time of Mello-Leitão [71]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collection of Dr. Paul F. Schirch was bought by the National Museum (Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, [72]) and was incorporated to the scientific collection afterwards [73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, we conclude that potential distributional maps should be carefully created (with critical analysis of the records inserted) and carefully analyzed after published.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the speed of publication of new species, the addition of species from completely different regions or from different environments turns this kind of study rapidly outdated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
