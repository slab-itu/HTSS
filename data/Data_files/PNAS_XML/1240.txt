Social contagion of ethnic hostility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We provide experimental evidence on peer effects and show that behavior that harms members of a different ethnic group is twice as contagious as behavior that harms coethnics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings may help to explain why ethnic hostilities can spread quickly (even in societies with few visible signs of interethnic hatred) and why many countries have adopted hate crime laws, and illustrate the need to study not only the existence of discrimination, but also the stability of attitudes and behaviors toward outgroup members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interethnic conflicts often escalate rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why does the behavior of masses easily change from cooperation to aggression?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper provides an experimental test of whether ethnic hostility is contagious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using incentivized tasks, we measured willingness to sacrifice ones own resources to harm others among adolescents from a region with a history of animosities toward the Roma people, the largest ethnic minority in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the influence of peers, subjects made choices after observing either destructive or peaceful behavior of peers in the same task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that susceptibility to follow destructive behavior more than doubled when harm was targeted against Roma rather than against coethnics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When peers were peaceful, subjects did not discriminate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed very similar patterns in a norms-elicitation experiment: destructive behavior toward Roma was not generally rated as more socially appropriate than when directed at coethnics, but the ratings were more sensitive to social contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings may illuminate why ethnic hostilities can spread quickly, even in societies with few visible signs of interethnic hatred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 1 (n = 327) was implemented in 2013 in 13 schools (SI Appendix, Fig S1), allowing us to study the influence of real-life peers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We administered a Joy of Destruction game, a money-burning task designed to identify hostile behavior (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two players received an endowment of 2 each and simultaneously chose whether to pay 0.20 to reduce their counterparts income by 1 or to keep the payoffs unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the interaction is one-shot and anonymous and the destruction is costly for the decision maker, selfishness cannot justify destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We denoted the choice to reduce the others payoff as hostile or destructive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure discrimination, we implemented a SAME condition, in which an anonymous counterpart was a coethnic, and an OTHER condition, in which a counterpart was a member of the Roma minority.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, subjects were provided a list of 20 typical majority or Roma names of potential counterparts from an unspecified distant school in Eastern Slovakia, chosen to reliably signal ethnicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To uncover the dynamics of hostility and estimate the susceptibility to follow peers, subjects were matched with two classmates and all three sequentially made the decision whether to destroy the resources of a counterpart from the same name list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the matching of peers and the order of choices were randomly determined, this design allowed us to identify the influence of peers among those who made their choice second or third and thus observed either hostile peers (DESTRUCTIVE PEER) or nonhostile peers (PEACEFUL PEER) before making their own decision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Table S1 shows that the observable characteristics of subjects who made choices in DESTRUCTIVE PEER and PEACEFUL PEER conditions are statistically indistinguishable, indicating that the allocation to social environment was indeed exogenous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater the influence of being in an environment with hostile peers on individual hostility, the greater the extent of spreading of hostile behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, we aimed to explore interaction effectsthat is, whether hostile peers are more influential in OTHER than in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The decision environment in our field laboratories aimed to mimic real-life situations in which hostility may spread within cohesive social groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied the influence of peers in a context where the three matched individuals knew each other well, directly observed each others decision, and faced a common fate in the sense that one of the three individual decisions was randomly chosen to be payoff relevant for all three matched peers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the estimated influence of peers on choices may capture multiple channels: subjects may follow peers because they learn about the prevailing social norm, update their beliefs about the characteristics of counterparts, or take into account peer preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details about the setting and the experimental design are provided in Materials and Methods and SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that peers were influential in shaping individual willingness to destroy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the influence more than doubled when the choices impacted Roma (Fig 1A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started by analyzing the choices of individuals who observed one peer before making their own decision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the subjects observed a peaceful peer, the prevalence of destructive choices in OTHER was 19%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the preceding player was destructive, the prevalence sharply increased to 77% (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is large in magnitude and highly significant statistically (2 test, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peers also affected behavior in SAME, but to a lesser extent: The prevalence of destructive behavior increased from 23% when a peer was nondestructive to 51% when he was destructive (P = 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a regression analysis, we found a strong positive interaction effect between DESTRUCTIVE PEER and OTHER on the likelihood of choosing a destructive action (Table 1; P = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, discrimination against the ethnic minority arose when participants observed classmates hostility, and the gap is large in magnitude (26 percentage points, P = 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when participants observed peaceful peers, we found virtually no differences in behavior across OTHER and SAME conditions (P = 0.62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar patterns emerge for subjects who observed the choices of two peers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the behavior of individuals who observed destructive behavior of both classmates vs. individuals who did not (those who observed one or both classmates being peaceful).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference is 70 percentage points (88% vs. 18%, respectively; P less_than 0.001) in OTHER, and 38 percentage points (67% vs. 29%, respectively; P less_than 0.001) in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the estimated influence of destructive peer behavior is statistically significant across conditions (OTHER*DESTRUCTIVE PEER; Table 1; P = 0.04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, observing one destructive and one peaceful peer is not enough to trigger ethnic discrimination (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we pooled the choices of subjects who observed one or two peers and found that the interaction effect of observing destructive peers and OTHER (Second and third decision makers column in Table 1) is again large and statistically significant (35 percentage points, P = 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further results reported in SI Appendix show that the main pattern is robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings hold across different locations in Eastern Slovakia; are robust to using alternative estimators, controlling for various design features and school fixed effects; and are not driven by a lack of understanding or by individuals from families with low socioeconomic status (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we explored whether the greater influence of peers in OTHER is due to a greater susceptibility to follow destructive peer behavior, peaceful behavior, or both (i.e., general conformism).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze this (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Table S6), we used (as the benchmark) the choices of subjects who decided first among the three matched classmates and thus did not observe peer behavior before own choice (NO PEER).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the NO PEER condition, subjects in the PEACEFUL PEER condition were less likely to be destructive, and the magnitude of this effect is very similar in SAME and OTHER conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, susceptibility to follow destructive peer behavior was strong in OTHER, while we found virtually no effect in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction effect is large in magnitude and highly significant statistically (Table 1, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, as well as additional evidence described in SI Appendix, reveal that the greater influence of peers in OTHER originates in greater readiness to follow unambiguously hostile peers, but not in differences in following peaceful or cooperative peers (SI Appendix, Tables S6S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that in NO PEER, the prevalence of destruction is very similar in SAME and OTHER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Put differently, subjects do not discriminate unless they happen to be in an environment with hostile peers (SI Appendix, Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In study 2, we focused on one plausible mechanism that could explain the observed pattern of the spreading of destruction: whether individual perceptions of social norms are more fragile in OTHER than in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was conducted in 2016 among adolescents (n = 204) from the same region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implemented a coordination game (22, 27), which elicits perceived social (in)appropriateness of destructive behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The participants were described the Joy of Destruction game implemented in study 1 in four situations: the destructive choice was made either in SAME or in OTHER, and it was made either without observing peers (NO PEER) or after observing a destructive peer (DESTRUCTIVE PEER).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of making own choices, subjects rated the social appropriateness of a destructive choice on a six-point scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In task 1, as in previous work (27), subjects were incentivized to match the modal response provided by others (from their school) rating the same choice environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we implemented task 2, in which subjects were incentivized to estimate the rating in task 1 of 10 randomly selected subjects from their school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from task 2 provided information about the distribution of appropriateness ratings at an individual level, which helped us to assess whether individuals believed there was a social norm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that coordination on an action does not necessarily measure social norms, since coordination games have multiple equilibria and subjects may coordinate in ways that have nothing to do with norms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This elicitation method yields a representation of a social norm if there is general social agreement that some actions are (in)appropriate, constituting the social norm, and if such shared perceptions create a focal point which can help subjects to match others responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gauge whether the participants believed a social norm existed, we first analyzed overall distributions of ratings in the NO PEER condition (SI Appendix, Table S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratings in both tasks follow a positively skewed mound-shaped distribution, with a single peak reaching quite socially inappropriate (in one case, there is a second mode at a neighboring option, somewhat socially inappropriate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the peaks are not very high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modal rating was chosen by 27 to 32% of the participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a destructive choice is rated as socially inappropriate (very, quite, or somewhat) in the majority of cases (75 to 83%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When looking at individual-level distributions of ratings from task 2, we also found that in most cases, they have a single mode (65%) or two modes represented by two neighboring options (21%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, these patterns indicate that most participants believed there was a social norm that the destructive choice is socially inappropriate, but the judgements varied about the precise extent of inappropriateness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used two measures of social norms in the analysis: rating of the appropriateness of the destructive choice on a six-point scale and a binary variable indicating whether the destructive choice was rated as socially appropriate or socially inappropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results reinforce the findings from study 1 (Table 2 and SI Appendix, Table S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When evaluating behavior in an environment without hostile peers, the appropriateness ratings are similar in OTHER and in SAME; if anything, subjects perceived harming in OTHER as more inappropriate than in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, however, in OTHER, the destructive action becomes perceived as less socially inappropriate when it follows peer behavior, whereas the normative judgments are quite stable in SAME (SI Appendix, Table S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In task 1, an environment with hostile peers made destructive behavior 11 percentage points more likely to be rated as socially appropriate in OTHER (P less_than 0.01), while the shift was only 5 percentage points in SAME (P = 0.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In task 2, the differences were 8 percentage points in OTHER (P less_than 0.001) and 4 percentage points in SAME (P = 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are qualitatively similar when we use the measure of appropriateness rating on a scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, destructive choices become perceived as less socially inappropriate in OTHER compared with SAME when made after a hostile peer, although for some of the measures, the difference is not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, in a regression analysis (Table 2), we tested whether the sensitivity to social context is significantly higher in OTHER than in SAME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there is a positive interaction effect between OTHER and DESTRUCTIVE PEER on perceived appropriateness of destructive behavior measured on a scale (P = 0.07 for task 1 and P = 0.02 for task 2), as well as on the probability that a destructive choice is rated as appropriate (P = 0.16 for task 1 and P = 0.04 for task 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results do not change or, if anything, they become stronger when we restrict the sample to subjects who were more likely to believe a social norm existed, in the sense that their distribution of ratings in task 2 had a single mode or two modes represented by two neighboring options (SI Appendix, Table S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings provide reasons for optimism and caution at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the optimistic side, subjects do not discriminate when making choices in an environment in which peers are peaceful, which is an encouraging finding in light of the widespread concern about the pervasive nature of ethnic discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the pessimistic side, however, hostile behavior toward Roma is much more socially contagious than toward coethnics, in line with the view that contextual features may magnify or attenuate biases against outgroup members (19, 2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This experiment raises as many questions as it answers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we discuss limitations of our findings and offer some directions for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, this paper studies behavior toward one ethnic group (Roma) among Slavic adolescents in one country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, more research is needed to explore whether our findings generalize to other settings, especially those with more salient interethnic conflicts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, several plausible mechanisms can explain, in principle, the documented differential response to observing peers when the hostile action harms a member of the Roma minority compared with a coethnic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide suggestive evidence supporting the interpretation that peer behavior influences perceptions of social norms regulating hostile behavior toward Roma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, subjects could also take peers preferences more into account when the counterpart was Roma, perhaps because of concerns about future out-of-laboratory punishment for not conforming to peer behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting open question is whether patterns of spreading of hostility would be similar in an environment in which the subjects receive information about the choices of anonymous individuals from own ethnic group, instead of directly observing peers with whom they share common fate and with whom they will interact in the future, as in our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings may also be affected by participants personal experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethnic groups often live segregated, as is the case in the setting we study, and interact relatively less frequently with individuals across ethnic lines, potentially leading to less knowledge about the outgroup members, or greater uncertainty about the attitudes of peers toward outgroup members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such an environment, subjects could learn more from the actions of their peers toward outgroup members than from the same actions toward ingroup members, leading to a differential behavioral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this mechanism, our analysis of beliefs about the behavior of counterparts suggests that subjects held greater suspicion about hostility of Roma (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments could explore whether our findings also hold in settings in which people live in communities that are more ethnically mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Or, researchers could use a similar design to study behavior in minimal groups created in a laboratory, building on refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 and 17, thus eliminating the role of beliefs caused by out-of-laboratory experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, one could leverage the relative advantages of both approaches by studying natural as well as minimal groups within a single sample (20) to assess whether the susceptibility to follow hostile behavior targeting outgroup members is a deep, generalizable response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken at face value, our findings can shed light on several important phenomena and can have policy implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they may illuminate why the ethnic hostilities of masses can spread quickly, even in societies in which there are few visible signs of systematic interethnic hatred (2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, they may help to explain why entrepreneurs of hatred (i.e., individuals who may benefit from causing social unrest and conflict)perhaps aware of the inflammability of ethnic hostilityoften choose minority groups as targets of their aggressive political campaigns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, since ethnic hostility has larger social costs that go beyond the immediate victim by potentially threatening social cohesion, the results can help to explain why many societies have found it desirable to institute hate crime laws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, our results suggest that although the readiness to be hostile may be quite latent and thus harmless in peaceful times, it may gain importance when tensions arise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, early diagnoses seem of vital importance when fighting ethnic hostility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
