title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuron numbers increase in the human amygdala from birth to adulthood, but not in autism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate that the number of mature neurons in the human amygdala increases from childhood into adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trajectory may be due to the incorporation of immature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus in the ventral amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show an initial excess of mature neurons followed by a decline into adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest a degenerative component in ASD and highlight the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the protracted cellular development of the human amygdala for multiple psychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably little is known about the postnatal cellular development of the human amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It plays a central role in mediating emotional behavior and has an unusually protracted development well into adulthood, increasing in size by 40% from youth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation from this typical neurodevelopmental trajectory could have profound implications on normal emotional development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the results of a stereological analysis of the number of neurons in amygdala nuclei of 52 human brains ranging from 2 to 48 years of age [24 neurotypical and 28 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurotypical development, the number of mature neurons in the basal and accessory basal nuclei increases from childhood to adulthood, coinciding with a decrease of immature neurons within the paralaminar nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals with ASD, in contrast, show an initial excess of amygdala neurons during childhood, followed by a reduction in adulthood across nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that there is a long-term contribution of mature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus to other nuclei of the neurotypical human amygdala and that this growth trajectory may be altered in ASD, potentially underlying the volumetric changes detected in ASD and other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Case_Information  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subject-specific information from all 52 subjects is presented in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the neurotypical-subject (i.e., NT) group contained 24 subjects (mean age, 20.17 ± 13.28 y; range, 2 to 48 y), 5 of whom were female.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ASD group contained 28 subjects (mean age, 17.46 ± 11.25 y; range, 4 to 44 y), 4 of whom were female and 11 of whom had seizure disorder (n = 2 overlap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The groups did not statistically differ on age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is not sufficient statistical power to systematically examine sex or seizure status, excluding these subjects from the analysis did not change the pattern of results (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Developmental_Trajectory_of_Neuronal_Numbers_in_the_Neurotypical_Amygdala  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mean estimates of neuron number and SDs across each region of interest are presented in Fig 1 and Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The univariate two-way ANOVA results are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a significant (P less_than 0.05) age group × diagnosis interaction in total amygdala, basal, accessory basal, and central nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These large effects (partial 2 range = 0.12 to 0.25) were further analyzed using a Fisher least significant difference (LSD) post hoc comparison (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the NT group, average total amygdala neuron number gradually increases by 11% with increasing age from youth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overall trend is primarily driven by a significant 30% increase in basal nucleus neurons (P = 0.003) and 17% increase in accessory basal nucleus neurons (P = 0.042).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no significant increase of neuron number with age in the lateral or central nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differences_in_Amygdala_Neuron_Number_in_ASD_Compared_with_NT_Cases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pattern of age-related change in amygdala neuron number is very different in individuals with ASD, in that total amygdala neuron number gradually decreases with increasing age (Fig 1 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By adulthood, on average, there are 17% fewer amygdala neurons in adults with ASD compared with children with ASD (P = 0.007).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same pattern was observed across all nuclei examined: basal, 16% (P = 0.042); accessory basal, 22% (P = 0.003); central, 18% (P = 0.017); and lateral, 12% (P = 0.065).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When comparing the two groups, children with ASD have significantly more neurons compared with neurotypical children in the basal (P = 0.047) and central (P = 0.021) nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults with ASD have significantly fewer neurons relative to neurotypical adults in total amygdala (P = 0.001), lateral (P = 0.009), basal (P = 0.002), and accessory basal nuclei (P = 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Omitting females [n = 9 (4 ASD, 5 NT)] or cases with seizure disorder (n = 11, all ASD) did not influence the pattern of results (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bcl-2_Immunohistochemistry_of_Immature_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bcl-2+ cells in the amygdala have a small, round morphology that is roughly 5 µm in diameter (Fig 2) (6, 1517, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest concentration of these immature neurons occurs in the most ventral aspects of the amygdala bordering subjacent white matter in the paralaminar nucleus near the emergence of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an age-related decline of immature (bcl-2+) neurons within the paralaminar nucleus across the age range examined in both NT ( = 0.80, P = 0.016; Fig 2 B and C) and ASD ( = 0.84, P = 0.003; Fig 2 E and F) cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also intense bcl-2+ immunoreactivity on fibers (Fig 2G) upon which these immature cells may migrate dorsally from the paralaminar nucleus to the overlying amygdala in accordance with other anatomical reports (14, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry for DCX using adjacent tissue sections reveals an almost identical staining pattern to that of bcl-2 in age-related decline of immature neuron numbers (Fig 2 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This extensive stereological study of the amygdala from youth to adulthood in 52 human brains led to three major findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the number of mature neurons in the amygdala of typically developing humans increases, on average, by 11% from youth to adulthood (from 2 to 48 y in the present study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase is primarily driven by a 30% increase in the number of neurons in the basal nucleus over this age range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the number of amygdala neurons in children with ASD is initially greater than age-matched neurotypical children, but by adulthood, there are fewer amygdala neurons in individuals with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of neurons in the amygdala of ASD cases appears to decline from childhood to adulthood by about 17% and is significantly reduced in all regions we examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in the amygdala from both neurotypical and ASD cases, there is a large pool of bcl-2+ immature neurons in the paralaminar nucleus, which declines with age from childhood into adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, our data indicate that as the number of mature neurons increases in the neurotypical amygdala across life, the number of immature neurons in the paralaminar nucleus decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that a gradual maturation and migration of immature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus contributes to the increasing number of mature neurons in the neurotypical amygdala, particularly in the basal and accessory basal nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals with ASD demonstrate a similar decrease in immature neurons in the paralaminar nucleus with age, yet the net number of mature neurons does not increase with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, cases of ASD show a decline in mature neuron number across the life span, suggesting a substantial loss of amygdala neurons throughout life in individuals with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the rationale for this hypothesis below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typical_Pattern_of_Amygdala_Neuronal_Development_from_Youth_Through_Adulthood  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural MRI studies have demonstrated that the amygdala in neurotypical individuals continues to grow in size by 40% throughout adolescence into adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to most of the cerebral cortex, which ceases to grow appreciably after 6 y of age (4, 5, 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was little or no understanding of the neurobiological substrate for this postnatal increase in volumetric growth of the human amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now report that the number of mature neurons in the amygdala increases by 11% from early childhood into adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of neuronal increase varies across the different subregions of the amygdala, where it was greatest in the basal nucleus (30%), more modest in the accessory basal nucleus (17%), and much less so in the lateral nucleus (3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One hypothesis to account for this increase in neuron number is the slow maturation and migration of a large pool of immature neurons within in the paralaminar nucleus produced prenatally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we document a marked reduction in the number of immature (bcl-2+) cells in the human paralaminar nucleus, while mature basal nucleus neuron numbers increase from youth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl-2 immunoreactivity has been used to identify immature neurons in both human (16, 17) and nonhuman primate amygdala (6, 15, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of other immature and migratory neuronal markers, including DCX, polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule, and class III -tubulin (14), confirm their presence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of bcl-2+ and DCX+ cells are found in the paralaminar nucleus ventral to the parvicellular portion of the basal nucleus, the paralaminar nucleus has a broad expanse, wrapping around the rostral amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed bcl-2+ and DCX+ cells in the ventral lateral nucleus, periamygdaloid cortex, and intercalated islands (1517, 21, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data and others indicate that immature bcl-2 immunoreactive cells likely undergo a protracted maturational period well into adulthood (14), with numbers declining during normal aging in nonhuman primates (17, 21) in the paralaminar nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the origin of these cells is debatable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In macaque monkeys, Chareyron et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) found that immature paralaminar neurons, defined morphologically in Nissl-stained series, decreased in number from infancy to adulthood coincident with an increase in mature paralaminar neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the sum of these populations remained constant with age, they suggested that the paralaminar nucleus may contain a reservoir of immature neurons that mature over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we add together neuron numbers in basal and paralaminar nuclei in the monkey from Chareyron et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) to more directly relate to our human measure, we find that macaque numbers increase by 32% from juveniles to adults, similar to humans (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a developmental mechanism shared by both species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second hypothesis is that postnatally generated neurons drive the neuronal increase (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paralaminar nucleus may represent the remnants of the fetal ganglionic eminence, making it plausible that this region retains neurogenic properties postnatally (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, immature neurons could migrate to the amygdala from a nearby neurogenic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adult squirrel monkeys, Bernier et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) observed a stream of pulse-labeled BrdU+ cells near the presumptive subventricular zone of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle that they interpreted as newly generated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis is that newly born neurons migrate into the ventral amygdala, including the paralaminar region, where there is a high density of neurons that express the markers of immaturity previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed many bcl-2+ or DCX+ cells directly contacting immunoreactive fibers that extend dorsally into the basal nucleus, suggesting a substrate for immature neuronal migration from the paralaminar region into the amygdala (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that regardless of the mechanism driving mature neuron increase in primates, similar age effects have not been observed in rats, and the presence of the paralaminar nucleus is debated in this species (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this developmental pattern may be unique to, or more extensive in, primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more detailed comparative research is needed to assess the evolutionary and translational significance of these data and relevance for human susceptibility to diverse mental disorders presenting across the life span.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Atypical_Pattern_of_Amygdala_Neuronal_Development_Across_the_Life_Span_in_ASD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trajectory of neuronal development in the amygdala of individuals with ASD is substantially altered from neurotypical development and suggests that processes that govern postnatal cellular maturation are dysregulated in individuals with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, the number of neurons in the amygdala is elevated in young children with ASD relative to neurotypical children, a finding also observed in the prefrontal cortex (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in adults with ASD, amygdala neuron numbers are reduced relative to neurotypical adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This altered developmental trajectory mirrors findings from MRI studies in which the amygdala is initially larger in childhood, but then does not undergo the corresponding age-related increase in size that occurs during neurotypical adolescence (23, 27, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder of this discussion is divided into two developmental periods: childhood, followed by adolescence to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the number of mature neurons in the typical human amygdala increases over a protracted postnatal period, extending into at least late adolescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this is due to the maturation and migration of immature neurons that are located initially in the paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulus for this slow accretion of mature neurons is currently unclear but appears to be a unique feature of the postnatal development of the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trajectory of neuronal development in the amygdala of individuals who had ASD during life drastically deviates from the typical developmental trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 11% more neurons in the amygdala in very young individuals with ASD, but 20% fewer neurons in adults with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This altered growth pattern may lead to altered amygdala function, manifesting in increased anxiety and further contributing to social impairments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperactivity of the amygdala may also lead to neuron loss through excitotoxicity, especially in instances where the amygdala and its neurons are particularly vulnerable to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the regulation of neuron number at a fundamental level in this brain region will be important for interpreting the normal role of the human amygdala during life and may provide insight into some of the neural disturbances that contribute to the behavioral pathology of multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue series from 52 individuals, aged 2 to 48 y at death, were used for stereological quantification and contained the entire rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala (28 ASD, 24 NT; Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subjects were included from two cohorts, which differed in tissue-processing protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 1 included 19 ASD and 15 neurotypical brains processed in our laboratory obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank or Autism BrainNet (formerly Autism Tissue Program).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial data and diagnostic information from a subset of cohort 1 (n = 19) have previously been published by Schumann and Amaral (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 2 included nine ASD and nine neurotypical brains from the Autism Celloidin Library distributed by Autism BrainNet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohorts 1 and 2 were combined for neuron number estimates and separated for cell volumetric analyses to avoid potential confounding factors due to variation in processing protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed descriptions of tissue processing are available in previous studies from cohort 1 (31) and cohort 2 (49, 50) and in SI Experimental Procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stereological_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amygdala and its lateral, basal, accessory basal, and central nuclei (Fig S2) were delineated using previously published criteria (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paralaminar nucleus was identified using adjacent Nissl-stained sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sampled mature (Nissl) and immature (bcl-2+) neurons (100× objective, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.3) through the entire structure of interest to derive numerical estimates using the optical fractionator as in our prior publications (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stereological design is summarized in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling parameters are presented in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects were classified a priori into three age groups: pediatric [2 to 13 y old; n = 17 (10 ASD, 7 NT)]; adolescent [14 to 20 y old; n = 11 (6 ASD, 5 NT)]; and adult [21+ y old; n = 19 (9 ASD, 10 NT)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Univariate two-way ANOVA was used to test for effects of age group and diagnosis on neuron number, region volume, and neuron somal or nuclear volume within each amygdala nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant age group × diagnosis interactions were further analyzed using a Fisher LSD post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data met parametric assumptions for normality using a ShapiroWilk test (P  0.05), and for homogeneity of variance using Levenes test for equality of variance (P  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
