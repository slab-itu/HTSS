Anti-VEGF treatment improves neurological function and augments radiation response in NF2 schwannoma model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In patients with progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS), radiotherapy is associated with risk of debilitating hearing loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and improve hearing preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bevacizumab improved hearing in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients; however, its effect is not durable and its mechanism of action on nerve function is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides (i) insight into how anti-VEGF treatment improves neurological function, and (ii) critical data that combined anti-VEGF treatment can enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy and help lower its dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings support clinical evaluation of combined anti-VEGF and radiation therapy in patients with VS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hearing loss is the main limitation of radiation therapy for vestibular schwannoma (VS), and identifying treatment options that minimize hearing loss are urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with tumor control and hearing improvement in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients; however, its effect is not durable and its mechanism of action on nerve function is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modeled the effect anti-VEGF therapy on neurological function in the sciatic nerve model and found that it improves neurological function by alleviating tumor edema, which may further improve results by decreasing muscle atrophy and increasing nerve regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide compelling rationale for testing combined therapy in human VS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Improves_Neurological_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we studied the effect of anti-VEGF treatment on neurological function in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To faithfully represent the effect of bevacizumab, we used an antibody (B20.4.4; Genentech) that neutralizes both human (tumor) and mouse (host) VEGF in our animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed rotarod test to evaluate neurological function; starting as early as 6 h after the first B20 treatment, rotarod duration increased and became significantly improved after 24 h (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the effect of different treatments on neurological function, mice bearing same-sized tumors were treated with control IgG, radiation (5 Gy), B20, or combined B20 and radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before treatment, no significant differences were noted from the rotarod test in mice among different groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After B20 treatments, mice showed significantly improved rotarod performance compared with mice in control and RT groups (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following studies, we further examined three aspects that anti-VEGF treatment may affect and thus contribute to this improved neurological function: (i) tissue edema, (ii) muscle atrophy, and (iii) nerve damage/regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Reduces_Tumor_Edema  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue edema may increase interstitial fluid pressure, which can compress nerves and muscles to cause weakness or stiffness (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice and patients with glioblastoma (GBM), anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to alleviate tumor edema by reducing vascular permeability within 6 h and 24 h, respectively (1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that rotarod performance improved after 6 h of anti-VEGF treatment indicates a change in schwannoma edema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that the degree of tumor edema was significantly inversely correlated with rotarod duration (Fig 1B), supporting that edema may impair neurological function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, B20 treatment alone, and in combination with RT (5 Gy) significantly decreased edema (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Decreases_Muscle_Atrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscle atrophy is a common consequence of peripheral nerve lesions such as tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the effect of anti-VEGF treatment on muscle atrophy by measuring: (i) the cross-sectional area of single muscle fibers and (ii) the distribution of muscle fiber size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From both legs, we collected the gastrocnemius muscle, which is distal to the sciatic nerve tumor implantation site and is not directly damaged by tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nontumor bearing mice had large and uniform skeletal muscle fibers, with the average muscle fiber area of 2,123.4 Â± 127.8 m2, and the majority of gastrocnemius muscle fibers had an area in the range of 1,0001,400 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the treatments affected muscle fiber size and distribution in the nontumor-bearing leg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tumor-bearing leg from control and radiated mice, significant muscle atrophy was noted, demonstrating significantly decreased muscle fiber area, and the majority of gastrocnemius muscle fiber area is in the range of 400800 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B20 treatment significantly increased average muscle fiber area and shifted the distribution peak toward the normal range in the tumor-bearing leg (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Enhances_Nerve_Regeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that muscle atrophy occurs after complete denervationwhen the nerve supply to a muscle is interrupted, the muscle no longer receives signals or stimuli from the nervous system (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next evaluated the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on nerve damage and regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tibial nerve in the control group presented with edema, and B20 treatment significantly decreased nerve edema (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under electron microscopy (EM), there is a marked deficit or abnormal appearance of axons in the cross-sections of the tibial nerve from control and radiated mice, demonstrating scattered degenerating axons, macrophage infiltration, and empty Schwann cell stacks, indicating loss of myelinated and unmyelinated axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sections from anti-VEGFtreated animals showed regenerating clusters, thinly myelinated axons, which are consistent with regeneration and remyelination (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the expression of several molecules that are known to mediate nerve regeneration; there is a trend toward up-regulation of these genes by B20 treatment, but only CXCL1 [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1] was significantly induced more than twofold (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Normalizes_Vasculature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abnormal vascular perfusion has been associated with muscular atrophy and nerve damage (1417).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, in the cranial window model, we used intravital microscopy imaging to observe vascular changes in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that control tumors have dilated and tortuous vessels, and B20 treatment makes tumor vessels less tortuous and smaller in diameter (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the image confirmed that B20-treated mice have decreased vessel diameter, vessel number, surface area, and length compared with that of the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes started 2 days after B20 treatment and continued to day 5, but were less pronounced on day 8, indicating the vessel normalization phenomenon is transient, and the normalization window is between day 2 and day 5 (Fig 4 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This vascular normalization effect was similarly observed in HEI-193 intracranial model (Fig S2), and the decreased microvessel density (MVD) was confirmed in the sciatic nerve model (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumor vessels have fewer pericytes, which support the endothelial surface of blood vessel walls, and this structural abnormality lead to abnormal vessel perfusion (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that anti-VEGF treatment increased the fraction of pericyte-covered vessels, indicating the schwannoma vasculature is structurally close to normal vessels (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to determine whether structural normalization of tumor vessels translates into improved functional perfusion, we measured the fraction of perfused vessels by injecting FITC-lectin i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to identify perfused tumor vessels and by staining for CD31 to detect the total number of blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concert with the vessel morphological and structural changes, B20 treatment increased the percentage of perfused vessels more than threefold (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of improved vessel perfusion, we found the hypoxic fraction of the viable schwannomas was significantly lower in B20-treated mice (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our studies show that B20 treatment improves the schwannoma vessel perfusion and alleviates tumor hypoxia, which may contribute to the improved neurological function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Radiation_Therapy_Applied_During_the_Anti-VEGF_Induced_Normalization_Window_Shows_Improved_Efficacy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypoxic cells are more resistant to radiation (20); therefore, we further hypothesized that the improved oxygenation may enhance the cytotoxic effect of RT, and when radiation is applied during the vascular normalization window, it would be most effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the Nf2/ intracranial model, when radiation was applied during the normalization window (2 d after B20 treatment), it significantly extended survival and inhibited tumor growth over B20 or radiation monotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When radiation was applied outside the normalization window (2 d before B20 treatment), the combined therapy had no additive effect compared with each monotherapy (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was confirmed in our sciatic nerve modelcombination therapy induced an 8-d tumor growth delay, more than monotherapy with B20 (4 d) or RT (3 d; Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same effect of B20-enhanced radiation efficacy was observed in HEI-193 intracranial and sciatic nerve models (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies support our hypothesis that radiation applied during the vascular normalization window induced by anti-VEGF treatment is most effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether B20 enhances RT efficacy via direct antitumor effects, we examined the expression and function of VEGF-A in schwannoma cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study showed that although both Nf2/ and HEI-193 cells express VEGF-A and its receptors R1 and R2, B20 treatment does not directly affect: (i) tumor cell proliferation, (ii) DNA damage, (iii) radiosensitivity, or (iv) angiogenic gene expression (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that B20 enhanced the efficacy of radiotherapy through the host vascular remodeling and normalization effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-VEGF_Treatment_Combined_with_Low-Dose_Radiation_Is_as_Effective_as_High-Dose_Radiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether by combining anti-VEGF therapy with RT, we can lower the dose and, thus, the adverse effect of RT, we treated groups of mice with: (i) control, (ii) B20, (iii) 5 Gy, (iv) 10 Gy and (v) B20 + 5 Gy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both Nf2/ and HEI-193 sciatic nerve models, we found that 10-Gy radiation is significantly more effective than the 5 Gy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when combined with B20 treatment, 5-Gy radiation is as effective as 10-Gy radiation in the Nf2/ model (Fig 6E) and significantly more effective than 10-Gy radiation in the HEI-193 model (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that combining anti-VEGF treatment may help lower the radiation dose needed to control schwannoma growth and, thus, may minimize RT side effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we sought to determine: (i) the mechanism of anti-VEGF improved neurological function, and (ii) whether combined anti-VEGF treatment can enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy and help lower its dose and, thus, minimize its toxic side effect on neurological function in schwannoma animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Schwannomas of the cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves originate from the nerve sheath and damage the nerve as they grow, causing neurological dysfunction (1, 21, 22) and any treatment that could relieve these symptoms is highly desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation therapy can further cause hearing loss by inducing local damage to mature nerve tissue, which is partly attributable to microvascular injury (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the role of VEGF on tumor angiogenesis and progression has been well characterized, the role of anti-VEGF treatment on tumor-related neuropathy remains largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reproduced the ability of anti-VEGF treatment to improve neurological performance in the sciatic nerve xenograft model; we showed that anti-VEGF treatment potentially affects the function of nerve and muscle via reducing tissue edema, which may further decrease muscle atrophy and improve nerve regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, it is technically challenging to orthotopically implant schwannomas in the vestibular nerve and performs functional vestibular studies and hearing test (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models for the development of new treatment options in VS are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic and xenograft mouse models of VS have been previously reported in the literature (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of these models replicate the intracranial location of these tumors in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a novel NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2 gene under the control of schwann cell-specific promoter element demonstrated spinal, peripheral, and cranial nerve tumors histologically identical to human schwannomas (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new model would permit testing of the vestibular nerve function and hearing response for VS translational studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot directly translate our findings from a major motor nerve to a cranial nerve, our data pave the road for further study of the molecular mechanisms of the effect of anti-VEGF treatment on neurological function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of VEGF on nerves has been studied in neurodegenerative disease (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) (15), and in acute neurological disease (such as cerebral ischemia) (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these disease models, it has been shown that the effect of VEGF on nerve is twofold: (i) VEGF exerts direct neuroprotective effects on cultured neurons in vitro (15, 31, 32); and (ii) VEGF stimulates angiogenesis, which is thought to provide an angiogenic niche that improves neural perfusion and favors neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation in vivo (1517, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a genetic study where the hypoxia response element (HRE) of the Vegfa promoter is mutated, serum VEGF level decreases, resulting in decreased neural perfusion and spinal cord ischemia, ultimately leading to neuron degeneration and progressive paralysis (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that anti-VEGF treatment, by normalizing schwannoma vasculature, improved tumor blood vessel perfusion and oxygen delivery and, thus, our finding is consistent with the HRE knock-out study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been well documented that although tumors harbor excess blood vessels, the tumor vascular network is highly abnormal, leading to aberrations in local blood flow and oxygenation that, in turn, can fuel tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis while diminishing response to cytotoxic therapies (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown in many preclinical and clinical studies that antiangiogenic therapy prunes tumor vessels and reverts the abnormal structure and function of the remaining vasculature toward a more normal state, abrogating its deleterious effects on the tumor microenvironment (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GBM patients, anti-VEGF treatment-induced vascular normalization alleviated vasogenic edema (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our schwannoma model, whether the improved vessel perfusion and oxygenation induced by anti-VEGF treatment contributes to muscle atrophy and/or nerve regeneration directly or via reducing tumor growth and relieving edema remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-VEGF agents were originally developed to block tumor growth by inhibiting blood vessel formation (19, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bevacizumab failed to improve survival benefit as a monotherapy in a number of tumors, but conferred survival benefit in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential explanation for the success of combined therapies is that bevacizumab normalizes the abnormal vasculature of tumors; the effect is transientleading to a normalization windowduring which, the resulting vasculature is more normal, characterized by increased blood flow and improved delivery of concurrently administered anticancer drugs as well as oxygen (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our schwannoma model, the anti-VEGFinduced normalization window is between day 2 and day 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with previously published vessel dynamic changespreclinical GBM study showed that anti-VEGF treatment decreased vessel density in 2 days, and clinical data in recurrent GBM patients demonstrate that antiangiogenic agents induced vascular normalization within 24 hours (11, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical studies of relative vessel size and permeability, tumor contrast enhancement, and edema-associated parameter are needed to fully elucidate the normalization effect of bevacizumab in NF2 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preclinical and clinical studies showed that vessel normalization improves the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, because both rely on adequate tumor blood flow for the delivery of drugs and radiosensitizing oxygen (19, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an experimental study in mice with GBM, combining anti-VEGF therapy enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase I/II trials reported promising response rates and safety results for adding bevacizumab before and concurrent to chemoradiation therapy in the preoperative treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (3841).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the response rate varied, indicating the importance of a good selection of patients for this combination treatment, as well as prospectively validated biomarkers of response (39, 4246).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study showed that in schwannoma model, when radiation is applied during the normalization window, it is more effective than either therapy alone; providing useful information on the timing and schedule of radiation therapy relative to anti-VEGF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we showed that combining anti-VEGF treatment helps lower the radiation dose needed for tumor control and, thus, may help relieve the toxic radiation side effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers of response and resistance to bevacizumab treatment are needed to improve the efficacy of this approach in patients with schwannomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, this study demonstrated that integrating anti-VEGF with RT in schwannoma models is more effective than either therapy alone and may reduce neurological dysfunction related to tumor growth and radiation (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides the rationale and critical data for the clinical translation of combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy in patients with VS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of anti-VEGF treatment on neurological function and radiation efficacy were studied in two schwannoma models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal procedures were performed following the guidelines of Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For additional information, see SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Lines_and_Reagents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human HEI193 schwannoma cells were a gift from Xandra Breakefield, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nf2/ tumor Schwann cells were maintained in 10% (vol/vol) Schwann cell medium containing Schwann cell growth supplement (ScienCell) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescein lycopersion esculentum (Tomato) lectin (FITC-lectin) was obtained from Vector Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FITC-Dextran [molecular weight (MW) = 2 Ã 106] was obtained from Sigma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-mouse and human VEGF antibody, B20-4.1.1, was provided by Genentech under a Material Transfer Agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific rat IgG control antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animal_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used two xenograft models in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_Protocols  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor_Growth_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used whole body bioluminescence imaging system to measure tumors grew in the sciatic nerve, and used the optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) system to measure tumors grown in the cranial window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor measurement was performed every 3 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rotarod_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurological function of the mice was assessed by using an automated Rotarod (Rotamex 4/8 4-Lane Treadmill Shock Grid; Columbus Instruments, Livoniz, MI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotarod test was performed in animals bearing size-matched tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor size was measured every 3 d by caliper; when tumor size reached 6 mm in diameter, mice were trained on the rotarod every day for 3 d. Three days later, tumor reaches 1 cm in diameter and we performed the rotarod test; three tests were performed for each animal: Each test began with a 30-s acclimation period at 4 rpm followed by acceleration by 4 rpm every 60 s to a maximum of 10 min and 40 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of time that elapsed before the mouse fell off was recorded as rotarod endurance (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid heterogeneity between animals, the average time to fall from the rotating cylinder was normalized to the value from each mouse on the first day and presented as relative rotarod endurance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Angiography_by_Multiphoton_Laser_Scanning_Microscopy_and_Vessel_Morphometry_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice bearing intracranial tumors were anesthetized and in vivo multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) angiography of blood vessels was performed following i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of 0.1 mL of FITC-dextran (MW = 2 million; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each tumor, four to five adjacent 3D profiles (150 m stacks) representing tumor vessels were obtained through the cranial window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same regions identified by using landmarks of the tumor vasculature were recorded on different time points (day 2, 5, and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels were segmented by using a tracing algorithm (48, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microvessel diameter, length density, surface area, and total length were quantified by a semiautomated algorithm that is based on a user-specified threshold (Matlab; Mathworks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTT_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One thousand cells were seeded into 38-mm2 wells of flat bottomed 96-well plates in triplicate and allowed to adhere overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/mL; Sigma Chemical] was prepared in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of metabolically active cells was determined by MTT assay (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clonogenic_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were seeded in triplicate in six-well plates and allowed to attach overnight, then treated with control IgG, or B20 (100 g/mL) the following day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h of treatment, cells were irradiated at room temperature by using a conventional, broad-field 250-kV X-ray machine (Siemens Stabilipan 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose rate was 1.77 Gy/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated for another 48 h, and then the medium was changed every 2 d to allow colony formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks later, cells were fixed with graded ethanol and stained with crystal violet (0.5% wt/vol; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies of more than 50 cells were counted, and surviving fraction (SF) was calculated by the following equation: SF=(no.ofcoloniesformedaftertreatmentno.ofcellsseeded)/(no.ofcoloniesformedinshamirradiatedgroupno.ofcellsseeded) (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microvessel density (MVD, CD31, 1:200; Millipore) and pericyte coverage (SMA, 1:200; Sigma) were determined by staining of OCT-embedded frozen sections (8 m) (18, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the percentage of perfused vessels, 50 L of FITC-lectin (2 mg/kg; Vector Laboratories) was injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to identify perfused vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten minutes later, tumors were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for cryosectioning (20 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cell labeling by FITC-lectin demonstrates perfused blood vessels, and CD31+ staining demonstrates all microvessels in solid tumor, the percentage of FITC-lectin+/CD31+ vessels quantified by using ImageJ software (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure tissue hypoxia, pimonidazole (50 mg/kg, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was injected 1 h before killing the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hypoxyprobe-1 Kit (Chemicon) was used to detect the percentage of pimonidazole+ area in the total viable tumor area (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The determination of the muscle fiber area (cross-sectional area) from a pathologic specimen is the standard for measuring muscle atrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure muscle fiber surface area, gastrocnemius muscle distant to the tumor implantation site was dissected and snap frozen in OCT compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-section of the muscle (6 m) were stained by using commercially available periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining kit (Ventana) following the manufacturers instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten microscopic fields containing muscle fibers were selected randomly, and the area of each muscle fiber in the field was measured by using ImageJ and compared in the treated and control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from cultured tumor cells by using the RNeasy Midi RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was synthesized from one microgram of RNA by using the IScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-specific primers for VEGF, VEGFR1, R2, BNDF, CXCL1, and Actin were synthesized on site and used at a final concentration of 0.5 M. All qPCR and analysis were performed on a Stratagene MX 3000 qPCR System operating MXPro qPCR software (Stratagene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor_Tissue_Edema_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumors tissue edema was measured by dry/wet weight measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end point of the experimentswhen tumors reached 1 cm in diametertumors were dissected, weighted immediately for wet weight, and dried in an oven at 99 Â°C for up to 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weights were collected every 3 d throughout the drying period until the final dry weight was established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor edema index was calculated as follows: Tumor edema index = (wet weight  dry weight)/wet weight (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nerves were placed into electron microscopy fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2.0% paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.025% calcium chloride in a 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) immediately after excision and allowed to fix for 3 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fixative was replaced with cacodylate buffer, and the nerves were stored at 4 Â°C until further processing in a Leica Lynx automatic tissue processor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the nerves were postfixed with osmium tetroxide, en bloc stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, embedded in pure epoxy resin and polymerized overnight at 60 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-micrometer-thick sections were cut by using glass knives and a Sorvall MT-1 (Dupont) ultramicrotome, and floated on water droplets on glass slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were dried in a humidity chamber on a warm hot plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toluidine blue stain (0.5% toluidine blue in aqueous 0.5% sodium borate) was pipetted over the sections and placed onto the hot plate until a slight gold rim could be seen around the stain droplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were rinsed in a stream of distilled water, dried, coverslipped, and examined by light microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative nerves were chosen, and the blocks were trimmed accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin sections were cut by using a diamond knife and an LKB 2088 ultramicrotome and placed on copper grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained with lead citrate and examined in a FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope (FEI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were captured with AMT (Advanced Microscopy Techniques) 2K digital CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significant differences between two groups were analyzed by using the Students t test (two tailed) or MannWhitney u test (two tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined whether growth curves significantly differed from each other by log-transforming the data, fitting a linear regression to each growth curve and comparing the slopes of the regression lines (using an equivalent of ANCOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All calculations were done by using the GraphPad Prism Software 6.0 and Microsoft Excel Software 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
