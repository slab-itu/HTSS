Temperature compensation and temperature sensation in the circadian clock  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circadian clocks in animals, plants, and fungi possess the remarkable property of temperature compensation: the clock has a temperature-insensitive period, while retaining the ability to synchronize to temperature cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conservation of temperature compensation across clades means it is likely critical to the function of circadian clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature compensation also places the circadian clock in contrast to other biological pathways, which generally have temperature-sensitive time scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism of temperature compensation remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a general scheme by which a circadian oscillator can be temperature-compensated while still synchronizing to environmental temperature cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we give experimental evidence that the circadian clock consists of a temperature-insensitive core oscillator coupled to a specific adaptive temperature signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All known circadian clocks have an endogenous period that is remarkably insensitive to temperature, a property known as temperature compensation, while at the same time being readily entrained by a diurnal temperature oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although temperature compensation and entrainment are defining features of circadian clocks, their mechanisms remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most models presume that multiple steps in the circadian cycle are temperature-dependent, thus facilitating temperature entrainment, but then insist that the effect of changes around the cycle sums to zero to enforce temperature compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative theory proposes that the circadian oscillator evolved from an adaptive temperature sensor: a gene circuit that responds only to temperature changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This theory implies that temperature changes should linearly rescale the amplitudes of clock component oscillations but leave phase relationships and shapes unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show using timeless luciferase reporter measurements and Western blots against TIMELESS protein that this prediction is satisfied by the Drosophila circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also review evidence for pathways that couple temperature to the circadian clock, and show previously unidentified evidence for coupling between the Drosophila clock and the heat-shock pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison of tim mRNA concentrations (relative to gapdh) and tim-luc reporter luminescence on the second day in DD at two different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curves are rescaled to have mean 0 and rms deviation 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like luminescence, mRNA concentration oscillations show similar shapes at different temperatures, and the delay between peak mRNA concentration and peak luminescence is about 56 h independent of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temperature_Scaling_in_Some_Simple_Examples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We begin by developing a simple mathematical example of the pathway model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model features three main components: an mRNA X that is translated into a protein Y, which has an alternate modification state Z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each main component actually consists of a pair of reversibly interconverted isoforms, X/X*, Y/Y*, and Z/Z* (diagrammed in Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the kinetics are linear except the repression of X/X* by Z/Z*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the simple limit where each isoform is replaced by a single species, the model is equivalent to the Goodwin oscillator model (47) and is described by the following equations:X=kXZndXXY=kYXdYYZ=kZYdZZ,[1]for some Hill coefficient n, production rates ki, and degradation rates di.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note we have assumed that the MichaelisMenten kinetics in the first term in X are totally unsaturated, a slight modification from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47 that does not affect the behavior because Zn is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  François et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) showed that by a simple rescaling of the units for X, Y, and Z, one can obtain the modified systemx=1zndXxy=xdYyz=ydZz,[2]in which the production coefficients ki have vanished without changing the di and without rescaling time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result implies that a change in any of the ki can be reversed by a rescaling of concentration units, leaving the shape of the orbit and its period unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Goodwin oscillator can thus be made into a temperature-compensated/temperature-entrainable oscillator by making the di independent of temperature and at least one of the ki temperature-sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of changes in temperature will then be described by the simple rescaling given above, just as predicted by the evolved models in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see how the degradation rates di can be rendered temperature-independent in a natural way, we restore the isoform pairs shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adjustment leads to a pair of equations for X/X*:X=kX(Z+Z*)ndXfXX+rXX*X*=kX(Z+Z*)nd*X*rXX*+fXX,[3]where fX and rX represent the forward and reverse rates of conversion between X and X*, respectively (assumed much faster than the period-determining circadian rates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar equations can be written for Y/Y* and Z/Z*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the above equations together gives back the simplified form in 1, except with X and Z replaced by sums (X+X*) and (Z+Z*), and an effective degradation rate given bydX=dK1+K+d*11+K,[4]where K=rX/fX is the equilibrium constant describing the balance between X and X*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective rate dX can be rendered temperature-independent by letting d*/Kd and having K increase with temperature, so that increases in d and d* are cancelled by a shift in the equilibrium toward the more slowly degraded isoform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we can set d=0 always and describe the temperature dependence of rates d* and K=rX/fX by an Arrhenius form exp(E/kT) with energies Ed* and EK=ErEf, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective rate dX will be temperature-independent as long as K1 at room temperature and EK=Ed*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this case, the model will behave exactly as the temperature-compensated Goodwin oscillator discussed above and will show a simple scaling of oscillation shape with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, although the model is abstract, it shares a number of features with the real circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it is known that in Drosophila, per and tim mRNA are present in multiple isoforms (48) and that PER and TIM proteins are subject to reversible biochemical modifications that alter the proteins degradation rates (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model serves as a useful paradigmatic example of the pathway model and additionally shows that independent temperature compensation of all reactions in a biological oscillator can be accomplished without an excessively complicated network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, temperature compensation in the Goodwin model can be achieved by a constraint imposed on the di, but in this case, the shape of the orbits will change with temperature, as is easily seen by simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can extend this example using a simple qualitative argument, which is depicted in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider a time course of TIM protein levels over the course of 24 h in constant darkness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TIM protein will be at a minimum at subjective midday and a maximum at subjective midnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rising phase of TIM concentration corresponds to transcription and translation of tim mRNA during the late day, the peak phase corresponds to nuclear translocation of the PER-TIM dimer, and the falling phase corresponds to repression of TIM production and degradation of the dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all of these subprocesses of the clock have temperature-dependent rates, such that a shortening of one process is compensated by a lengthening in another, then we should expect the shape of the curve of TIM protein oscillation to change with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if at higher temperatures, a shortening in nuclear translocation time is canceled by a lengthening in transcription/translation times, then we should expect a narrowing of the portion of the curve where TIM levels are high (because of more rapid repression of tim transcription) and a corresponding widening of the part of the curve where TIM levels are low (because of slowing in TIM production).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot_and_Luciferase_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for the shape invariance of the circadian oscillations, we measured the oscillations of different components of the circadian clock in D. melanogaster at three different temperatures: 18°C, 25°C, and 29° C. We chose to measure the oscillation in TIM protein levels (by Western blot) and transcription rate (by observing appearance of a luciferase reporter protein) to get a picture of both the positive (transcriptional) and negative (posttranslational) sides of the clock feedback loop (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, WT flies were prepared by synchronization in at least 3 d of a light-dark (LD) cycle at the requisite temperature, followed by transfer into constant darkness (DD) at the same temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made on the second day in constant darkness to minimize the residual effects of light while not allowing too much desynchronization of the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Western blots, yw flies were sampled by flash freezing every hour, and TIM concentrations were measured relative to cadherin (CDH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For luciferase measurements, groups of 3050 flies carrying a timeless luciferase (tim-luc) reporter (shown to recapitulate the dynamics of tim expression reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51) were put into a 35-mm dish filled with luciferin-containing cornmeal food and observed in a Hamamatsu top-counting luminescence detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Representative blot images are shown in Fig 2A, from which it is clear that TIM levels increase at higher temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows samples from two different temperatures (18° C and 29° C) run side-by-side on the same gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quantification combining the data from each of these gels (with three biological replicates) is shown in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This quantification shows that both the amplitude and average of TIM oscillations increase with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2D, the curves are shown after a rescaling by subtracting a linear trend (so that the mean is 0 throughout) and normalizing the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from the mean to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process leads to a precise collapse of the curves onto each other, confirming the simple scaling prediction of the model discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3A, representative raw luciferase data at 25° C are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decaying trend is attributable to depletion of the luciferin substrate (52) but can be easily subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows the same data after detrending by subtracting a 30-h moving average and smoothing in a 1-h window (time points are taken every 15 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C shows the oscillations at the three temperatures, on the second day in constant darkness, after rescaling by mean subtraction and normalization of the rms deviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again the curves collapse onto each other, confirming the simple scaling prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One might object that luciferase activity and stability are temperature dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements of tim mRNA levels at two different temperatures to show that mRNA oscillations scale similarly to luminescence oscillations and that the delay between peak mRNA concentration and luminescence levels is independent of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown in Fig S1, confirming that luminescence and qPCR data are consistent, with a delay of about 45 h at both 18° C and 25° C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is useful in assessing these data to have a control experiment in which one would expect to see changes in the shape of the curve of TIM oscillation at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our arguments in Temperature Scaling in Some Simple Examples imply that any mutant with a temperature-dependent change in rate for some circadian process should show a corresponding change in the shape of its oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perL mutant has a substantial defect in temperature compensation [the period increases from 27 h at 18°C to 31 h at 29° C (53)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A shows the results of Western blots from perL flies, and Fig 4B shows luciferase measurements from perL; tim-luc flies, after rescaling in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shift in the peak of the curves with temperature is evident and has a magnitude significantly larger than what would be expected from the difference in periods alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth pointing out that molecular circadian oscillations in perL are noisier and have lower relative amplitude than in WT (Fig S2 and data in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52 and 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the shift in peaks is statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4C shows the position of the peaks in protein and luminescence oscillations for both WT and perL at all three temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak times are measured relative to the natural period for each strain, so for WT flies, 0.5 corresponds to 12 h. Wedges are centered at the position of the peaks, with widths corresponding to the uncertainty in position of the peaks found from fitting a sine function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, it is clear that in the perL background, there is not only a shift in the peaks at different temperatures, but the phase difference between luminescence and protein peaks is also temperature-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding confirms that a change in shape is present, as predicted by our model, and that our method is able to detect such changes reliably.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to keep in mind that (in WT flies) the peak in luminescence lags peak mRNA concentration by about 5 h (Fig S1), so that the true tim mRNA peak precedes the TIM protein peak at all temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is interesting that a yeast two-hybrid experiment (55), as well as stains of circadian neurons (32), suggests that the defect in perL temperature compensation may be attributable to a temperature-dependent effect on PER-TIM binding, which in turn leads to a delay in nuclear translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increasing delay in nuclear translocation likely explains the progressive delay in the peak of protein and mRNA expression and explains the narrowing of the gap between protein concentration and transcription levels, because a defect in repression of tim transcription by PER/TIM protein would allow relatively high levels of protein and mRNA to be present simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of PER/TIM binding on TIM stability (56) may also play a role in determining how temperature influences the shape of the curves in Fig 4, but in any case it is clear that strong temperature effects are present in the perL background that are absent in WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The other prediction of our model is the presence of a specific signaling pathway for coupling the circadian oscillation to temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As briefly mentioned earlier, a significant amount of evidence for this proposition has already been found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glaser et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (41) and Sehadova et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) have found that mutations associated with the function of mechanosensitive chordotonal organs affect circadian temperature entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, morning anticipation in hotcold cycles is eliminated and luciferase reporter oscillations damp out rapidly under temperature entrainment in mutants of the genes nocte and norpA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals lacking functional temperature-sensitive TrpA channels have been shown to entrain more slowly to temperature cycles and to have noisier molecular rhythms under temperature entrainment (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One experiment has shown that flies carrying a null mutation in the photoreceptor cryptochrome (cryb) show reduced phase shifts in response to a 30-min 37° C heat shock (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experiments performed in our own laboratory (Fig S3) have failed to find this effect, and subsequent work by other groups has cast doubt on the role of cryptochrome in circadian temperature entrainment (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New data from the laboratory of Patrick Emery (39) suggest that calcium signaling is essential for circadian temperature responses and that the above-mentioned neural pathways converge by calcium-dependent degradation of TIM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that there are clearly multiple pathways present for communicating temperature to the clock, it may be difficult to eliminate circadian temperature entrainment in an intact mutant animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, virtual elimination of temperature phase-shifting has been achieved in mouse fibroblasts subjected to pharmacological inhibition of the heat-shock pathway (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been shown that a knockout of the HSF1 transcription factor affects circadian expression in fibroblasts under temperature cycles and that there is a physical association between HSF1 and the mammalian circadian transcription factor BMAL1 (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were therefore interested in looking for an effect of the heat-shock pathway on circadian temperature sensation in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Drosophila heat-shock response is mediated by the single transcription factor HSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSF is required for embryonic development, but viable heterozygous knockouts and a temperature-sensitive mutant (inactive above 30° C) are available (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed phase-resetting curve (PRC) experiments on these mutants, using a temperature step from 18°C to 29° C as the stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown in Fig 5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase shifts are computed relative to the circadian time (CT) 13 sample, rather than a control population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the shape of activity oscillations in WT flies is significantly different at 18°C and 29° C, making a principled phase comparison between temperatures impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CT 13 time point was chosen as a reference because at that time point the phase shift relative to a control appeared small by eye, but the choice is essentially arbitrary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both heterozygous and temperature-sensitive heat-shock mutants show increased phase-shifting in response to temperature steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is different from what is seen in mammalian fibroblasts, and the difference is likely explained by the presence of neural temperature signaling pathways in Drosophila, which presumably interact with the cell autonomous heat-shock pathway in complex ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a control experiment by repeating the above procedure but replacing the stimulus with a temperature step down, from 25°C to 18° C. In this case (Fig S4), the phase shifts are comparable in WT and heterozygous HSF knockouts, as one might expect, because the heat-shock pathway should not be activated at these temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that the shape of the curves are different in the two experiments, suggesting that the mechanisms of circadian temperature sensation are different for warm and cold temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was also suggested by experiments in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60, which found that a specifically cold-sensitive RNA-binding protein influences circadian transcription in mice, as well as prior work examining circadian responses to cold temperatures (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, the heat-shock pathway also appears to have an effect on the daily distribution of sleep at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT Drosophila tend to sleep more during the day and less at night at high temperatures (63), as shown in Fig 5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heterozygous HSF knockouts show a similar distribution of sleep at both 18°C and 29° C (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that, in Drosophila at least, the heat-shock pathway may also have an unexpected role in regulation of sleep by temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_and_Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have presented experimental evidence supporting a pathway model for the effects of temperature on the circadian oscillator based on the theory in reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By observing two components of the core clock which oscillate with different phases (TIM protein and tim expression reported by a luciferase construct), we have shown that only the amplitude but not the shape of the circadian oscillation changes with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel experiments in perL mutant flies whose circadian period varies from 27 to 31 h over the accessible temperature range were an important control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the oscillations changed shape substantially at different temperatures, demonstrating our experiments had sufficient sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a typical nonlinear oscillator, whether mechanical or biochemical, it is completely unexpected to observe oscillations at different parameter values that can be superimposed by shifting means and linearly scaling amplitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45, this property emerged by in silico evolution that favored temperature entrainment and period compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computation began from an initial gene network that responded adaptively to changes in temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the computation registered changes in temperature but returned to the same operating point irrespective of temperature in the absence of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptation is a common property of sensory systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational evolution then built a delayed negative-feedback oscillator around the adaptive temperature sensor and with it the properties selected for, namely temperature compensation and temperature entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is certainly parameter tuning in this model as there is in the network model, which is perfectly reasonable because natural evolution has plausibly shaped the phenotype of the circadian oscillator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no direct computational selection for the linear rescaling of orbits between different temperatures, and that property has to be considered as an emergent consequence of the basic assumptions of entrainment and period compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the simple example we proposed, the scaling of orbits results from the specific form of the model equations, and it would be interesting to understand more abstractly why the same property arose from the evolutionary computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, our results indicate that the linear superposition of orbits at different temperatures is a generic property of circadian oscillators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is much less clear how to experimentally test the starting assumption reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45: that an adaptive temperature sensor is the dominant coupling responsible for temperature entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suppression of the heat-shock pathway was shown to eliminate temperature phase shifting in mouse fibroblasts (38, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an organism may be much more complicated in this regard than single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated a coupling between the heat-shock pathway and the circadian clock in Drosophila but found that heat-shock pathway mutants display increased sensitivity to temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that other pathways are present for temperature signaling in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that heat-shock mutants lack the normal temperature dependence of daily sleep distribution, suggesting a role for the heat-shock pathway in sleep regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that we do not suggest that temperature signaling via the heat-shock pathway is a universal mechanism of circadian clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our own data (Fig S4) suggest that separate mechanisms are present for hot and cold responses even with Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New data from the laboratory of Patrick Emery (39) suggest that the various neural pathways involved in circadian temperature signaling all act via calcium-dependent degradation of TIM through the SOL protease pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that inhibiting calcium signaling significantly reduces circadian phase shifts in response to temperature changes and, most interestingly, that the calcium response to a temperature step appears to be adaptive, just as our model predicts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our claim that each period-influencing process in the circadian clock is independently temperature-compensated raises the question of how such compensation could be achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We presented a mathematical model showing how the pathway model scheme can be implemented in a variant of the Goodwin model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, temperature entrainment was achieved by allowing the production rates of proteins or mRNA to be temperature-dependent, because these rates affect the quantity of oscillating components but not the period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the model does not insist on coupling temperature to the clock via transcription rates, the model is consistent with evidence that transcriptional signaling via the heat-shock pathway is responsible for temperature phase shifting in mammalian fibroblasts (38, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been shown that the period of the circadian clock is buffered against changes in transcription rates in both mammalian cells (64) and Drosophila (65), which is also consistent with the assumptions of our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, our model implements temperature compensation by balancing changing degradation rates against a shifting between paired isoforms for each mRNA and protein in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interconvertible isoforms with varying degradation rates are known to be present in the circadian clock, both in mRNA (48) and proteins (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is also worth noting that the mathematical model predicts that the increase in transcription/translation rates with temperature leads to a change in the amplitude of oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model has the expected feature that when the production rate of the ith variable increases, the corresponding amplitude of oscillation increases as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that sense it, is consistent with the predictions of the amplitude model for temperature compensation proposed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model proposes that an increase in rates at higher temperature can be canceled by a proportional increase in amplitude, without specifying precisely how the compensation occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude model is supported by data on zebrafish circadian transcription (66), as well as by Drosophila phase-resetting curve experiments, both recent (67) and canonical (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for increase in amplitude at higher temperatures has also been found in Neurospora (68) and cyanobacteria (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this increase in circadian amplitude with temperature may also provide a mechanism for seasonal adaptation of the clock in Drosophila (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our own data (Fig 2C) show that the amplitude of TIM oscillations roughly doubles between 18° and 29° C, which is consistent with the typical dependence of biological reaction rates on temperature (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insofar as the amplitude model remains agnostic about exactly how compensation is achieved, the model can be regarded as complimentary to, and in some sense independent of, the pathway model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, our data, combined with model of François et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45), provide the first experimental support to our knowledge for a theory of the complete temperature compensation of a temperature-entrainable oscillator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results have broad implications for future research into the mechanisms of temperature compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that temperature compensation is not a network-wide process but that each period-setting process of the clock must be temperature-compensated on its own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental results on temperature compensation must be interpreted in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work is needed to understand the temperature compensation of nuclear translocation, transcriptional repression, and nuclear export and degradation, among other processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear translocation is a particularly promising avenue for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A great deal about the biochemistry of nuclear translocation has been discovered in the last decade (19), and much of this knowledge can be leveraged into experiments on temperature compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the multifarious network of reversible phosphorylations known to regulate nuclear translocation of the PER-TIM dimer bears an intriguing resemblance to models of temperature compensation in the literature (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another promising avenue for research is single-cell time lapse observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work in Drosophila S2 cells has contributed significantly to the understanding of PER-TIM dynamics (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advent of fluorescent protein-tagging experiments on the circadian clock in Neurospora (74, 75), as well as reporter experiments in mammalian fibroblasts (76), will allow observation of the effect of temperature changes on multiple subprocesses of the circadian clock in a single experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of temperature compensation in the circadian clock remains an open problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Western blots were performed on Drosophila strains yw and perL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase experiments used tim-luc flies obtained from Ralf Stanewsky, University College London, London (51), and perL; tim-luc flies generated by crossing tim-luc to a perL;IF/CyO;sb/TM6 balancer line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature PRC experiments used iso31 and strains hsf1 and hsf4 (59), obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blots_and_qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flies were entrained for at least 3 d in a 12 h:12 h LD cycle at a given temperature, then moved into constant darkness at the same temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements began at CT 0 on the second day in DD (36 h after the last lights off).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flies were flash frozen on dry ice every hour for 24 h (or 30 for perL), and heads were isolated for protein or RNA extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For protein, heads were homogenized in an equal volume of radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X 100 by volume; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 20% glycerol by volume; 0.02% NaN3), supplemented with 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homogenate was mixed with a double volume of dilution buffer (RIPA buffer without Triton-X, sodium deoxycholate, DTT, and protease inhibitor), and centrifuged twice for 10 min at 4° C. Extracts were quantitated and resolved by SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blots were probed with rat anti-TIM (77) at 1:1,000 and rat anti-CDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied at 1:10,000 and imaged with ECL 2 (enhanced chemiluminescence) substrate (Thermo Scientific) on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For RNA, extracts were homogenized with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and then column-purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol, including DNase treatment (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA solutions were quantitated and then reverse-transcribed with iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QCPRs on the resulting cDNA were performed with PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix (Quanta Biosciences) in a LightCycler 480 (Roche) and analyzed by the  Ct method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers for tim were taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78, and the primers for the housekeeping gene gapdh were from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flies were entrained in the manner described above, and during the day on the last day of entrainment, about 50 male flies were placed in a 30-mm plate containing about 12 mL of standard cornmeal/molasses fly food supplemented with 15 mM d-luciferin (potassium salt; Biosynth) layered on top of 7 mL of standard food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of lights out (zeitgeber time 12), the plates were placed in the wells of a LM-2400 photon detection unit (Hamamatsu) for measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting raw data were detrended by subtracting a 30-h moving average and smoothed by averaging time points in a 1-h window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For temperature step phase-shifting experiments, flies in a Drosophila activity monitor (Trikinetics) were entrained for at least 3 d in a 12 h:12 h LD cycle at 18° C and then moved into DD at 18° C. On the second day in DD, monitors were moved at the indicated time to a different incubator at 29° C. Behavior was measured for at least 5 d subsequently, and phase shifts were determined by computing a cross-correlation function between activity traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For heat-shock phase-shifting experiments, WT and cryb flies [the laboratory of Michael Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA (80)] were entrained similarly and then placed in constant darkness in a custom-built small incubator designed to provide rapid and precise temperature stimuli from a Peltier effect heating/cooling element (Custom Thermoelectric).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature was increased from 25° C to 37° C for 30 min at CT 15 on the first day in DD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase shifts were computed as before, by comparing to a control group kept at 25° C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sleep measurements were made in DD using flies entrained in the same manner and judging sleep as beginning after a 5-min period of inactivity (81, 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
