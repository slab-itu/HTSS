Gourds and squashes (Cucurbita spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  adapted to megafaunal extinction and ecological anachronism through domestication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Squashes, pumpkins, and gourds belonging to the genus Cucurbita were domesticated on several occasions throughout the Americas, beginning around 10,000 years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild forms of these species are unpalatably bitter to humans and other extant mammals, but their seeds are present in mastodon dung deposits, demonstrating that they may have been dispersed by large-bodied herbivores undeterred by their bitterness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Cucurbita may have been poorly adapted to a landscape lacking these large dispersal partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study proposes a link between the disappearance of megafaunal mammals from the landscape, the decline of wild Cucurbita populations, and, ultimately, the evolution of domesticated Cucurbita alongside human cultivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genus Cucurbita (squashes, pumpkins, gourds) contains numerous domesticated lineages with ancient New World origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was broadly distributed in the past but has declined to the point that several of the crops progenitor species are scarce or unknown in the wild.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that Holocene ecological shifts and megafaunal extinctions severely impacted wild Cucurbita, whereas their domestic counterparts adapted to changing conditions via symbiosis with human cultivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze complete plastid genomes of 91 total Cucurbita samples, comprising ancient (n = 19), modern wild (n = 30), and modern domestic (n = 42) taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis demonstrates independent domestication in eastern North America, evidence of a previously unknown pathway to domestication in northeastern Mexico, and broad archaeological distributions of taxa currently unknown in the wild.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, sequence similarity between distant wild populations suggests recent fragmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results point to wild-type declines coinciding with widespread domestication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we hypothesize that the disappearance of large herbivores struck a critical ecological blow against wild Cucurbita, and we take initial steps to consider this hypothesis through cross-mammal analyses of bitter taste receptor gene repertoires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directly, megafauna consumed Cucurbita fruits and dispersed their seeds; wild Cucurbita were likely left without mutualistic dispersal partners in the Holocene because they are unpalatable to smaller surviving mammals with more bitter taste receptor genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indirectly, megafauna maintained mosaic-like landscapes ideal for Cucurbita, and vegetative changes following the megafaunal extinctions likely crowded out their disturbed-ground niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, anthropogenic landscapes provided favorable growth habitats and willing dispersal partners in the wake of ecological upheaval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plastid_Genome_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using Illumina shotgun sequencing, we recovered and assembled complete plastid genomes from 12 of the 14 accepted extant Cucurbita species, representing 18 total species, subspecies, and varietal taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our completed assemblies for C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo and C. moschata, we then designed and synthesized biotinylated RNA probes (18) to enrich additional modern and ancient DNA isolates for targeted sequencing of complete plastid genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this enrichment strategy, we tested 32 archaeological Cucurbita samples, yielding 19 ancient plastid genomes sufficiently complete for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sequenced an additional 53 modern plastid genomes using a combination of shotgun sequencing and targeted enrichment, bringing the total sample size to 91 (n = 19 ancient; n = 72 modern) (Tables S1S3), and reconstructed a Cucurbita plastid genome phylogeny from this dataset (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. pepo comprises three subspecies: ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo, ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera, and ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo (zucchini, pumpkins, and summer and winter squashes) appears to have been domesticated in the Oaxaca Valley region around 10 kya (12) and has no known extant wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera contains wild varieties found in patches throughout the southeastern United States, including C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ozarkana, and C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  texana, as well as a wide variety of domestic types (scallop and acorn squashes, ornamental gourds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeologically, it appears that ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera domestication took place in eastern North America (ENA) alongside a suite of other crop species (e.g., 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna is a wild form restricted to a narrow range in northeastern Mexico and unknown as a domesticate (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is genetically similar to ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera and therefore has been hypothesized as an alternate source population of domesticated C. pepo in ENA (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that members of ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera form a well-supported clade that includes modern cultivars and wild gourds from ENA as well as all archaeological ENA C. pepo samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no signal of ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera among ancient samples from Mexico, the alternative possible source region (14), nor in modern free-living ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna in that region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absence strongly supports local evolution of domesticated C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera in ENA, in agreement with archaeological evidence of an increase in seed size over time and molecular data clustering modern ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera cultivars with ENA wild populations (2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna is known only in the wild at present and is absent from the ENA archaeological record, we observed a ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna plastid sequence in an archaeological rind fragment from Romeros Cave in northeastern Mexico.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen shows a thick (2 mm) rind and a furrow typical only of domesticated Cucurbita.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a direct date from the rind of 4,6144,836 calibrated calendar years BP (2 range).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result might represent cross-pollination of native wild ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna by domesticated ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo leading to the expression of some domestic-type characters or an independent domestication trajectory that did not contribute to modern plastid diversity among cultivars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either circumstance, this finding demonstrates a previously unknown role of ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna in the crop fields of ancient Mexico.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we observed archaeological ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo in cave sites ranging from Oaxaca to the southwestern United States, suggesting either prolific human-mediated dispersal following domestication or a geographically widespread evolution of domestic forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we found that three endemic populations spanning the Gulf of Mexico, currently defined as distinct taxa (24), are essentially indistinguishable based on the plastid genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. okeechobeensis is restricted to the Florida peninsula, on the shores of Lake Okeechobee and the St. Johns River basin, C. okeechobeensis ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  martinezii is found on the north coastal plain of Veracruz, and C. lundelliana grows on the limestone plains of the Yucatan Peninsula (24), but the three taxa differ at only six single-nucleotide variants across the 156.6-kb plastid genome (average pairwise nucleotide diversity:  = 0.0043%) despite their geographic separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the undifferentiated plastid genome structure among patchy C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera in ENA (Fig 1), this result may reflect recent fragmentation of a previously contiguous population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we observed a pattern that supports hypotheses for widespread Holocene domestication of Cucurbita and suggests that this process coincided with dramatic habitat and range fractionation and wild plant extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo is thought to be extinct in the wild, but we find seven archaeological examples from this lineage spanning more than 2,000 km and dating back nearly 10,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe at least one other independent domestication episode of C. pepo, that of ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera in ENA alongside a suite of other native crops, and a possible third, arrested domestication trajectory involving ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna in northeastern Mexico.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe genetic similarity between disparate endemic taxa (C. okeechobeensis, C. okeechobeensis ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  martinezii, and C. lundelliana), suggesting recent separation of these populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Ability_to_Detect_Bitter-Tasting_Compounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We screened 46 therian mammal genomes to assess general ability to detect bitter-tasting compounds by analyzing functional TAS2R gene number variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded the poorest quality assemblies [length-weighted midpoint scaffold size of the genomic assembly (scaffold N50) less_than250,000 nt; n = 8] because of unreliable gene detectability (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 38 remaining genomes, we detected a combined total of 851 intact TAS2R genes, ranging from a low of 8 in the genome of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) to a high of 46 in the genome of the common shrew (Sorex araneus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for relationships among TAS2R count, body mass, and dietary breadth (Materials and Methods) while controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When all species are treated as independent, TAS2R count is significantly negatively correlated with both body mass (Pearsons productmoment correlation; r2 = 0.236; P = 0.002) (Fig 2A) and greater dietary specialization (r2 = 0.194; P = 0.0056) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When all variables are analyzed simultaneously with a generalized linear model, body mass and dietary breadth are each significant predictors of TAS2R count when controlling for the other variable (P = 0.0043 and P = 0.0122, respectively), but the significance of this relationship is strongest when both variables are considered together, and explains a substantial proportion of the variance in TAS2R count (P = 0.0004; multiple r2 = 0.363).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When taxonomic nonindependence among our sample is controlled for by using a phylogenetic generalized least squares test (Materials and Methods), the associations of body mass and dietary breadth with TAS2R count are still significantly stronger than expected from chance (TAS2Rsize: P = 0.044; TAS2Rdiet: P = 0.015; overall model: P = 0.007, multiple r2 = 0.246).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TAS2Rbody size association is most pronounced among smaller-bodied taxa; when only the very largest mammal species are excluded from the analysis, the inverse relationships between the number of intact TAS2R genes and both body size and diet are highly significant even when controlling for phylogeny (among n = 35 mammals less_than1,000 kg, TAS2Rsize: P = 0.0013; TAS2Rdiet: P = 0.001; overall model: P = 4.08 × 105; multiple r2 = 0.468).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To summarize, smaller species, and especially those with more diverse diets, tend to have a larger repertoire of functional bitter taste receptor genes, and thus they likely are better able to detect and avoid potentially toxic bitter compounds while foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Holocene_Anachronism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Holocene decline of wild Cucurbita was likely driven, at least in part, by the nearly complete disappearance of herbivores 1,000 kg, with whom they appear to have had an important symbiotic relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild Cucurbita are too bitter for humans and well-fed livestock (10), but larger mammals are much more tolerant of bitter plant compounds than smaller ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger species are likely able to metabolize or pass moderate toxins harmlessly as part of a high daily biomass intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, even if we ignore any additional physiological or behavioral detoxification strategies and the large digestive throughput of hindgut fermenters, a fully-grown African elephant [averaging 4,540 kg (22)] would need to ingest an estimated 7.523 kg of wild Cucurbita gourdsapproximately 75230 whole fruitsover a short timespan (25, 26) to approach a lethal dose of cucurbitacins (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, several bitter species of Cucurbitaceae are eaten and dispersed by African elephants in the present (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As another illustration of these concepts, the one-horned rhinoceros in lowland Nepal [1,5002,000 kg (22)] preferentially feeds on the bitter fruits of trewia (Trewia nudiflora, Euphorbiaceae), daily consuming up to hundreds of fruits that are unpalatable to smaller mammals who are concomitantly incapable of dispersing the 1-cm-diameter seeds (10, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans have reported severe symptoms of cucurbitacin toxicity after consuming only one or two bites of cucurbitacin-tainted squash (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Cucurbita seeds in mastodon dung is clear evidence that, like their extant counterparts, North American megafauna were effective Cucurbitaceae dispersers, physiologically undeterred by cucurbitacin bitterness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Larger numbers of intact TAS2R genes are associated with greater ability to detect and avoid toxins via their bitterness, and interspecific variation in copy number is hypothesized to reflect ecological and evolutionary diversity (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have reported that herbivores have slightly higher TAS2R copies than carnivores, presumably to detect plant-based toxins more acutely (30), and that the common ancestor of modern whales completely lost functional TAS2R copies, probably as a result of feeding behaviors and the switch to a marine environment (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in our analysis, dietary breadth is significantly correlated with TAS2R count, presumably because a wider range of possible food species necessitates sensitivity to a more diverse range of toxic compounds, and because narrow dietary specialists have little need for toxin detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because very large-bodied species are more physiologically resilient to moderately toxic compounds, they too require fewer TAS2R gene copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, bitter compounds signal toxicity to foraging animals, but in the absence of serious toxic threat, large mammals do not benefit by acutely recognizing this danger signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, selection to maintain a broad TAS2R repertoire in larger species may be relaxed, leading to gene loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although we cannot test this hypothesis in the present study, TAS2R pseudogenization could even be adaptive for megafauna if the consumption of bitter fruit was a benefit to survival, i.e., if acuity to bitter tastes would be an unnecessary barrier to herbivory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The now-extinct megafaunal herbivores of the Americas were sufficiently large that they were likely to have been protected against moderate toxins, whereas the smaller surviving mammals are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, smaller mammals, and especially those with broad dietary habits, tend to have larger suites of TAS2R genes to detect and avoid toxic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These smaller species generally would be unable to consume Cucurbita fruits whole and pass the intact seeds in the manner of mastodons; therefore, as seed predators instead of dispersal mutualists, the smaller species pose a threat to Cucurbita.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the toxicity of wild Cucurbita and related species may be, in part, an adaptive strategy to facilitate beneficial seed dispersal by very large mammals while warding off smaller seed predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting unpalatability of Cucurbita to small-bodied mammals, combined with the megafaunal extinctions, would have left the plants lacking plausible dispersal partners and the associated nutrient-rich dung deposits important in seed germination and seedling development (28); thus intergenerational seed propagation would be curtailed and offspring would be more vulnerable to localized stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, Cucurbita prefers field edges, floodplains, and other disturbed habitats and would have thrived in the niche-diverse, mosaic-like landscapes maintained by large herbivores (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wake of these herbivores extinction, large-scale zonal vegetative patterns replaced the fine-grained variation maintained by the megafauna (34), and weedy taxa would have been crowded out as their disturbed-ground niche disappeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these transitions could have been instrumental in driving wild Cucurbita into relict, refugial patches, causing fragmentation of previously contiguous distributions, and ultimately, in some cases, leading to the extinction of wild forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Domestication_as_an_Adaptive_Strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Against the backdrop of these ecological changes, the anthropogenic landscape provided a disturbed habitat readily colonized by weedy species, and humans fulfilled the dispersal role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phylogenetic results support previous hypotheses that the domestication process was widespread, occurring independently many times throughout the Americas, including in ENA (C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera), Mesoamerica (C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepo and C. argyrosperma, possibly C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna, C. moschata, and C. ficifolia), and South America (C. maxima and possibly C. ecuadorensis and C. moschata) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ENA is a long-debated putative source region for Cucurbita pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ovifera, a hypothesis that is strongly supported by the clustering of ovifera cultivars with modern and ancient ENA gourds in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pepounknown in the wildoriginated in the Valley of Oaxaca around 10,000 y B.P (12) but also was prominent among our samples from northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, several hundred miles to the north.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests either (i) a widespread ancient distribution of this subspecies and the emergence of domestic forms across a broad geographic range, illustrating a range-wide shift to human landscapes as an adaptive strategy; or (ii) prolific human-mediated dispersal of this taxon throughout Mesoamerica, illustrating the massive reproductive and dispersal potential for plants under cultivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either possibility underscores the adaptive potential of domestication (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One ancient C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna sample from northeastern Mexico also indicates the possible presence of this taxon in ancient crop fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presently, C. pepo ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fraterna exists only in the wild, suggesting that our ancient fraterna sample may represent a lost domestic lineage or an independent, subsequently arrested, pathway to domestication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reproductive_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fixation of domesticated phenotypes requires a level of reproductive isolation between cultivated and wild forms to prevent the constant back-crossing of unfavorable traits into populations under human selection (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, emmer wheat required removal from its source region to express the phenotypic effects of domestication robustly (39), and it has been suggested that maize flourished into its dramatic, familiar, hyper-domesticated forms only after being transported out of southern Mesoamerica (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requirement may vary by species, with the level of isolation being linked to the genetic configuration and cultural importance of domestication traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cucurbita, the requirement for reproductive isolation is especially pronounced, with cross-fertilization from wild forms producing unpalatable fruits (10), likely through the up-regulation of cucurbitacin production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, without isolation from wild stands, it is unlikely that Cucurbita could have evolved into a form suitable for human consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Holocene, the collapse of wild populations following the onset of a relationship with humans ultimately may have prevented gene flow from wild types constantly recharging crop fields with the allelic predisposition for a tough rind and bitter cucurbitacins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cucurbita species have thrived in the Holocene largely by partnering with humans through domestication as wild populations dwindled and have been bred to lower their natural defenses for human palatability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the fixation of important domestication alleles conferring palatability might have been impossible if wild plants had not largely receded and disappeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
