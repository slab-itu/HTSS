Explaining negative kin discrimination in a cooperative mammal society  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kin selection theory predicts that animals will direct altruism toward closer genetic relatives and aggression toward more distantly related individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our 18-y study of wild banded mongooses reveals that, unusually, dominant individuals target females who are more closely related to them for violent eviction from the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This puzzling result can be explained by selection for unrelated individuals to resist eviction and for related individuals to submit more easily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this idea, we show that kin are targeted for aggression only when individuals are capable of resisting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, where potential victims can oppose aggression, the usual predictions of kin selection theory can be reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kin selection theory predicts that, where kin discrimination is possible, animals should typically act more favorably toward closer genetic relatives and direct aggression toward less closely related individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this prediction, we present data from an 18-y study of wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo, showing that females that are more closely related to dominant individuals are specifically targeted for forcible eviction from the group, often suffering severe injury, and sometimes death, as a result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern cannot be explained by inbreeding avoidance or as a response to more intense local competition among kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we use game theory to show that such negative kin discrimination can be explained by selection for unrelated targets to invest more effort in resisting eviction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our model, negative kin discrimination is restricted to eviction attempts of older females capable of resistance; dominants exhibit no kin discrimination when attempting to evict younger females, nor do they discriminate between more closely or less closely related young when carrying out infanticidal attacks on vulnerable infants who cannot defend themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that in contexts where recipients of selfish acts are capable of resistance, the usual prediction of positive kin discrimination can be reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kin selection theory, as an explanation for social behavior, can benefit from much greater exploration of sequential social interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Explaining_Negative_Kin_Discrimination__A_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consider the interaction between two individuals, the first of whom (player 1) may perform a selfish act at the others expense, such as stealing a food item, killing offspring, or, in the case with which we are concerned, evicting the other from the territory or group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suppose that this act entails some fitness cost to the actor, denoted c1, but that the cost is outweighed by the benefit to be gained, b1  greater than  c1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The act, if carried out, also deprives the recipient, player 2, of a benefit b2 that it would otherwise enjoy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the two individuals are related by a coefficient r, then Hamiltons rule tells us that the act will be favored by selection provided that b1  c1  r b2  greater than  0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, selfishness will never be directed toward a closer relative where it would not also be directed toward a more distant one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suppose, however, that if player 1 attempts the selfish act, player 2 may then choose to resist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance ensures that the act will fail; player 1 will still suffer the cost c1 of attempting the act, but will not enjoy the benefit b1 of success, nor will player 2 suffer the consequent loss of benefit b2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, resistance entails a fitness cost to player 2 of c2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation may be modeled as a two-step, sequential game, as illustrated in Fig 1 (SI Models for a population genetic formulation of the model; Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does relatedness affect the outcome of this game?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying Hamiltons rule once again, if c2  greater than  b2  r b1, then the cost of resistance to player 2 outweighs the benefit of preventing a selfish act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these circumstances, player 2 will submit, and selection once again favors performance of the selfish act provided that b1  c1  r b2  greater than  0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, by contrast, c2 less_than b2  r b1, then player 2 will resist, and selection consequently does not favor the selfish act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a more closely related recipient of the selfish act may prefer to submit where a more distantly related recipient would resist, it follows that selfishness may be directed toward a closer relative where it would not be directed toward a more distant one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be precise, if we consider two levels of relatedness, rhigh and rlow (rlow less_than rhigh), then provided thatb1c1b2 greater than rhigh greater than b2c2b1 greater than rlow,then the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the game features targeting of a selfish act toward a recipient related to the actor by rhigh, but not toward a recipient related by rlow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate, suppose b1 = b2 = 1, c1 = 0.25, and c2 = 0.75; then the model predicts that a recipient of low relatedness (rlow less_than 0.25) would resist a selfish act and hence should not be targeted, whereas a recipient of higher relatedness (0.75  greater than  rhigh  greater than  0.25) will submit and so should be targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unrelated recipients are more likely to resist a selfish act, favoring preferential targeting of more closely related victims, when c2 (the cost of resistance) is small and b2 (the benefit to be retained) is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are illustrated in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If c2 is typically too large, or b2 too small, even unrelated recipients are unlikely to resist, favoring indiscriminate selfishness; only for smaller values of c2 or larger values of b2 is negative kin discrimination predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the main text we analyze a simple, game-theoretical model of selfishness and resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present two population genetic analyses of the same situation, in which we explicitly model the evolutionary dynamics of alleles that influence both traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two models differ in the specific assumptions they make regarding the genetic basis of selfishness and resistance and the nature of mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the two traits are under the control of distinct (unlinked) loci, but in the first, adaptive dynamic model, we assume that evolution proceeds through the successive substitution of mutations of small effect at one or the other locus that slightly alter the probability either of acting selfishly or of resisting such action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second model, by contrast, we assume that there are two alleles present in the population at each locus that determine whether or not individuals act selfishly or resist and focus on evolutionary changes in the frequencies of the possible genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both models confirm the findings of the game-theoretical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An_Adaptive_Dynamic_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We focus on a large (effectively infinite), sexual population with nonoverlapping generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we assume haploid genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each generation, adult breeding members of the population mate at random to produce many offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this offspring generation then collectively engage in pairwise interactions with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each offspring interacts with a single partner, and in any given pairwise interaction, one individual is randomly assigned the role of actor and the other the role of recipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actor may choose whether or not to attempt a selfish act; if it chooses to do so, the recipient may choose whether or not to resist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An individuals genetically determined strategy specifies the probability of selfish action p and the probability of resistance q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We allow, however, for a small degree of error in implementation of actors choices, such that with probability  (where 0 less_than  less_thanless_than 0.5), an individual actor acts contrary to the behavior specified by its strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals (both actors and recipients) receive payoffs from this interaction as specified in the main text: actors incur an additive cost of c1 (relative to the baseline fitness value of 1) if they act selfishly, and recipients incur an additive cost of c2 if they resist a selfish act (where 0 less_than c1, c2  1); at the same time, actors obtain an additive benefit of b1 if they perform a selfish act that is not resisted, whereas recipients obtain an additive benefit of b2 unless they fail to resist a selfish act against them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After offspring have interacted with one another in this way, all compete for breeding opportunities in the next generation, with probabilities of success proportional to their payoffs, and the cycle then repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model the evolution of this population, we take an adaptive dynamic approach, in which the behavioral strategy adopted by members of the population is assumed to change through the successive substitution of mutations of small effect, each of which affects either the probability of selfish action or the probability of resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our focus is on the impact of relatedness on the evolution of selfishness and resistance, we suppose that offspring may interact preferentially with kin, with whom they share a degree of genetic similarity by virtue of common descent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that an individual and its partner share alleles at a given locus that are identical by descent is denoted r. If, for instance, interactions always involve full sibs, then r = 1/2 (compared with r = 0 if interaction occurs at random within the population as a whole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not explicitly model the processes that give rise to interactions among kin, as these might take different forms in different contexts (such as familial interaction, preferential assortment, or limited dispersal); instead, we simply specify the value of r.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suppose, then, that the population currently adopts the strategy (p, q), and consider the fate of a mutant allele that specifies a probability of resistance qmq+q that differs slightly from q. Letp=(1)p+(1p)denote the probability of a randomly chosen individual in this population acting selfishly when the chance of error  is taken into account andq¯=fmqm+(1fm)qdenote the probability of a randomly chosen individual resisting a selfish act, given the current frequency fm of the mutant allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expected payoff from pairwise interaction to an individual in this population bearing a mutant allele is given bywm=1+12(p(1(rqm+(1r)q¯))b1pc1)+12((1p(1qm))b2pqmc2),whereas the expected payoff to an individual bearing a resident allele is given bywr=1+12(p(1(rq+(1r)q¯))b1pc1)+12((1p(1q))b2pqc2).Following competition for breeding opportunities and random mating, the frequency of the mutant allele in the next generation is then given byfm=fmwmfmwm+(1fm)wr,implying thatfmfmfm=fm(1fm)(wmwr),i.e., that the mutant allele will increase (or decrease) in frequency if its bearers enjoy a greater (or smaller) mean payoff from pairwise interaction than do bearers of the resident allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now,wmwr=12pq(rb1+b2c2),which, because p is always positive, implies that ifc2less_thanb2rb1,[S1]then bearers of any mutant allele that specifies an increased probability of resistance (i.e., for which q  greater than  0) will enjoy a greater expected payoff than bearers of the resident allele at all frequencies, and the allele will thus increase monotonically in frequency and spread to fixation, regardless of the value of p. By contrast, bearers of a mutant allele that specifies a decreased probability of resistance (i.e., for which q less_than 0) will suffer a reduced payoff at all frequencies, and the allele will thus be eliminated, again regardless of the value of p. If condition [S1] is not met, then the reverse conclusions hold true.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that when condition [S1] is satisfied, any convergently stable evolutionary equilibrium must feature q = 1, whereas when condition [S1] is not satisfied, such an equilibrium must feature q = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now, consider the fate, if a population currently adopts the strategy (p, q), of a mutant allele that specifies a probability of selfish action pmp+p that differs slightly from p. Letpm=(1)pm+(1pm)denote the probability of a mutant individual in this population acting selfishly when the chance of error  is taken into account,p=(1)p+(1p)denote the probability of a resident individual acting selfishly, andp¯=fmpm+(1fm)pdenote the probability of a randomly chosen individual acting selfishly, given the current frequency fm of the mutant allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the expected payoff to an individual in this population bearing a mutant allele is given bywm=1+12(pm(1q)b1pmc1)+12((1(rpm+(1r)p¯)(1q))b2(rpm+(1r)p¯)qc2),whereas the expected payoff to an individual bearing a resident allele is given bywr=1+12(p(1q)b1pc1)+12((1(rp+(1r)p¯)(1q))b2(rp+(1r)p¯)qc2).It follows thatwmwr=12(12)p((1q)b1c1r(1q)b2rqc2),[S2]which, when q = 1, reduces towmwr=12(12)p(c1rc2).Under these circumstances, therefore, bearers of a mutant allele that specifies an increased probability of selfishness (i.e., for which p  greater than  0) will suffer a reduced payoff compared with bearers of the resident allele at all frequencies, and the mutant allele will thus decrease monotonically in frequency and eventually be eliminated, whereas bearers of a mutant allele that specifies a decreased probability of selfishness (i.e., for which p less_than 0) will enjoy a payoff advantage at all frequencies, so that the mutant allele in this case will spread to fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, at an equilibrium that features resistance (q = 1), actors will refrain from selfishness (p = 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When q = 0, by contrast, condition [S2] reduces towmwr=12(12)p(b1c1rb2).Under these circumstances, therefore, ifb1c1rb2 greater than 0,[S3]then bearers of any mutant allele that specifies an increased probability of selfishness (i.e., for which p  greater than  0) will enjoy a payoff advantage over bearers of the resident allele at all frequencies, and the mutant allele will thus spread to fixation, whereas bearers of a mutant allele that specifies a decreased probability of resistance (i.e., for which p less_than 0) will suffer a payoff disadvantage at all frequencies, and in this case the mutant allele will thus be eliminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If condition [S3] is not met, then the reverse conclusions hold true.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that at an equilibrium that does not feature resistance (q = 0), actors will act selfishly (p = 1) if condition [S3] is satisfied and refrain from doing so (p = 0) if condition [S3] is not satisfied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because r may be interpreted as the coefficient of relatedness between interacting offspring, these results are identical to those of the game-theoretical model presented in the main text and lead to the same conclusion that selfishness may be directed toward a closer relative where it would not be directed toward a more distant one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be precise, if we consider two levels of relatedness, rhigh and rlow (rlow less_than rhigh), then provided thatb1c1b2 greater than rhigh greater than b2c2b1 greater than rlow,selfishness persists at equilibrium when actors interact with a recipient related to them by rhigh, but not when they interact with a recipient related to them by rlow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Classical_Population_Genetic_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We consider a large (effectively infinite), sexual population with nonoverlapping generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we assume haploid genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each generation, adult breeding members of the population mate at random to produce many offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this offspring generation then collectively engage in pairwise interactions with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each offspring interacts with a single partner, and in any given pairwise interaction, one individual is randomly assigned the role of actor and the other the role of recipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actor may choose whether or not to attempt a selfish act; if it chooses to do so, the recipient may choose whether or not to resist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavior in the actor role is determined by an individuals genotype at the A locus; those bearing the A allele typically act selfishly, whereas those bearing the a allele typically do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, behavior in the recipient role is determined by an individuals genotype at the (unlinked) R locus; those bearing the R allele resist a selfish act, whereas those bearing the r allele do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We allow for a small degree of error in implementation of actors choices, such that with probability  (where 0 less_than  less_thanless_than 0.5), an individual actor acts contrary to the behavior typical of its genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals (both actors and recipients) receive payoffs from this interaction as specified in the main text: actors incur an additive cost of c1 (relative to the baseline fitness value of 1) if they act selfishly, and recipients incur an additive cost of c2 if they resist a selfish act (where 0 less_than c1, c2  1); at the same time, actors obtain an additive benefit of b1 ( greater than 0) if they perform a selfish act that is not resisted, whereas recipients obtain an additive benefit of b2 ( greater than 0) unless they fail to resist a selfish act against them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After offspring have interacted with one another in this way, all compete for breeding opportunities in the next generation, with probabilities of success proportional to their payoffs, and the cycle then repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our focus is on the impact of relatedness on the evolution of selfishness and resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suppose that offspring may interact preferentially with kin, with whom they share a degree of genetic similarity by virtue of common descent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that an individual and its partner share alleles at a given locus that are identical by descent is denoted r. If, for instance, interactions always involve full sibs, then r = 1/2 (compared with r = 0 if interaction occurs at random within the population as a whole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not explicitly model the processes that give rise to interactions among kin, as these might take different forms in different contexts (such as familial interaction, preferential assortment, or limited dispersal); instead, we simply specify the value of r.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let fAR, fAr, faR, and far denote the frequencies of the four possible genotypes in the population immediately before pairwise interaction (where fAR + fAr + faR + far = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that a randomly chosen actor in this population acts selfishly is then given byA=+(12)(fAR+fAr),whereas the probability that a randomly chosen recipient resists a selfish act is given byR=(fAR+faR).Expected payoffs obtained by individuals of the four genotypes are thus given bywAR=1+r[12(1)c1+12(b2(1)c2)]+(1r)[12(1)((1R)b1c1)+12(b2Ac2)]wAr=1+r[12(1)(b1c1)+12b2]+(1r)[12(1)((1R)b1c1)+12(1A)b2]waR=1+r[12c1+12(b2c2)]+(1r)[12((1R)b1c1)+12(b2Ac2)]war=1+r[12(b1c1)+12(1)b2]+(1r)[12((1R)b1c1)+12(1A)b2],leading to frequencies of the four genotypes among breeders offAR=fARwARw¯,fAr=fArwArw¯,faR=faRwaRw¯,far=farwarw¯,wherew¯=fARwAR+fArwAr+faRwaR+farwardenotes the mean payoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following random mating, the frequencies of the four genotypes in the next generation (immediately before pairwise interaction) are then given byfAR=fAR2+fARfAr+fARfaR+12fARfar+12fArfaRfAr=fAr2+fARfAr+fArfar+12fARfar+12fArfaRfaR=faR2+faRfar+fARfaR+12fARfar+12fArfaRfar=fAR2+faRfar+fArfar+12fARfar+12fArfaR.Iteration evaluation of the above equations allows us to track changes in genotype frequencies from one generation to the next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Illustrative trajectories are shown in Fig S1, which highlights parameter values for which the system converges (from multiple initial starting conditions) to an equilibrium featuring selfishness and nonresistance for a higher level of relatedness (r = 0.5), but to resistance and nonselfishness for a lower level of relatedness (r = 0), demonstrating that (as we argue in the main text) interactions between closer kin may feature more selfish behavior than between more distant kin or between nonrelatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond the above example, we can further demonstrate a close correspondence between the results of the genetic model and of our game-theoretical analysis from the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The game-theoretical model yields three types of equilibria: (i) When b2  c2  rb1  greater than  0, recipients resist and actors refrain from selfishness; (ii) when b2  c2  rb1 less_than 0 and b1  c1  rb2  greater than  0, recipients do not resist and actors behave selfishly; and (iii) when b2  c2  rb1 less_than 0 and b1  c1  rb2 less_than 0, recipients do not resist but actors nevertheless refrain from selfishness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth possible pure-strategy equilibrium at which recipients resist and actors behave selfishly is never stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the genetic model, because fAR + fAr + faR + far = 1, it is necessary to specify only three frequencies to determine the state of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, therefore, we set far = 1  fAR  fAr  faR and evaluate the stability of the equilibria suggested by the game-theoretical analysis, by calculating the eigenvalues of the JacobianJ=(fARfARfARfArfARfaRfArfARfArfArfArfaRfaRfARfaRfArfaRfaR)at each candidate equilibrium point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Negative_Kin_Discrimination_in_Banded_Mongooses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examine kin discrimination in the context of a conspicuous form of intragroup aggression in cooperatively breeding banded mongooses, Mungos mungo: the violent eviction of males and females from the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Banded mongooses live in highly cooperative groups with limited dispersal and varying levels of relatedness between group members (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study population in Uganda, groups consist of around 20 adults, plus offspring, and breed on average four times per year (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple females give birth synchronously to a communal litter that is cared for by members of both sexes (typically not the parents) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each group contains a cohort of multiple dominant females (median = 4) that are older than the other females, breed more regularly and more successfully, and aggressively evict younger females (7, 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older males monopolize mating with estrus females by mate guarding them and aggressively driving away younger, subordinate males (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work shows that both sexes are capable of kin discrimination in the context of mating, supporting the assumption of our model that such discrimination is possible in this system (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evictions are relatively common, involve intense, targeted aggression, and result in the forcible mass exclusion of groups (median = 6 individuals) of females (female-only evictions) and, in around half of cases, groups (median = 9 males) of males alongside them (mixed-sex evictions) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mass evictions are triggered by high levels of intrasexual reproductive competition: females are evicted when there are many breeding females in the group, and males are evicted alongside females when there are many breeding males (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evictions are very violent, and evictees are often left with serious injuries as a result of the aggression they receive (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among adult female banded mongooses, those more closely related to dominant individuals of both sexes (that is, males and females older than 3 y) in the group were more likely to be targeted for eviction [generalized linear mixed model (GLMM),  ± SE = 9.95 ± 3.36, 21 = 9.51, P = 0.002; Fig 3A and Table S1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Younger females were also more likely to be subject to an eviction attempt (GLMM,  ± SE = 0.003 ± 0.0005, 21 = 39.98, P less_than 0.0001; Table S1), but there was no effect of a females pregnancy status or nonpregnant weight on her probability of being targeted for eviction (pregnancy status, GLMM,  ± SE = 0.61 ± 0.49, 21 = 1.63, P = 0.20; weight, GLMM,  ± SE = 0.002 ± 0.001, 21 = 2.59, P = 0.11; Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a subset of eviction attempts we had data on the identity of primary aggressors (individuals that were recorded as being notably more aggressive than other group members toward potential evictees).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females that were more closely related to primary aggressors were more likely to be targeted for eviction (GLMM,  ± SE = 5.47 ± 2.87, 21 = 3.85, P = 0.0498; Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We did not find evidence that this pattern of negative kin discrimination was an attempt to reduce inbreeding between targeted females and dominant males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that it was relatedness of females to female dominants (not male dominants) that predicted whether they were targeted for eviction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females were more likely to be targeted if they were more closely related to female dominants (females older than 3 y: GLMM,  ± SE = 5.10 ± 2.65, 21 = 4.07, P = 0.044; Table S3), but not if they were more closely related to male dominants (males older than 3 y: GLMM,  ± SE = 3.69 ± 2.55, 21 = 2.09, P = 0.15; Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral data indicate that females are almost entirely responsible for the attempts at eviction of other females: males rarely attacked females in female-only eviction attempts (GLMM,  ± SE = 1.80 ± 0.56, 21 = 12.48, P less_than 0.001; Fig 3B and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work indicates that eviction attempts are triggered when the level of reproductive competition in the group is high, not when the potential for inbreeding is high (13), and that both sexes use kin discrimination during mating to avoid inbreeding (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also did not find evidence for the alternative hypothesis that closer relatives are targeted for eviction because they inflict higher costs on the reproductive success of dominants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dominant females did not suffer greater reproductive costs when cobreeding with more closely related females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the number of emergent pups to which dominant females gave birth when cobreeding with more closely related vs. less closely related females (GLMM,  ± SE = 0.06 ± 0.12, 21 = 0.23, P = 0.63; Table S5); nor was there a difference in the proportion of the emergent litter that was assigned maternity to dominant individuals (GLMM,  ± SE = 0.08 ± 0.14, 21 = 0.27, P = 0.60; Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among males, by contrast with females, there was no effect of an individuals mean pairwise relatedness to dominant group members (males and females older than 3 y) on the probability of being subject to an eviction attempt (mixed-sex eviction attempts: GLMM,  ± SE = 0.84 ± 3.08, 21 = 0.07, P = 0.79; Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no evidence of any discrimination as to which males were targeted for eviction (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also no discrimination of any kind when we restricted our analysis to cases where the identity of primary aggressors was known (Table S2) or when we tested the effect of mean pairwise relatedness to same-sex and opposite-sex dominants (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the case for female-only eviction attempts, both males and females were primary aggressors in eviction attempts directed at both sexes (GLMM,  ± SE = 1.80 ± 0.56, 21 = 12.48, P less_than 0.001; Fig 3B and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Two specific predictions of the model are (i) that selfish acts will be directed preferentially toward closer relatives only when recipients can resist and (ii) that resistance to selfish acts offered by recipients should decrease as their relatedness to the actor increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After we developed the model, we tested these predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the first prediction, we examined how the effect of relatedness varied with the age and weight of potential evictees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reasoning was that younger or lighter females should be less able to resist eviction attempts and that the pattern of negative kin discrimination should therefore be more pronounced when eviction is targeted at older or heavier individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that older females were indeed more likely to be targeted for eviction when more closely related to dominants, but that no such effect of relatedness was apparent for younger females (interaction between relatedness and age: GLMM,  ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.004, 21 = 5.98, P = 0.014; Fig 4A and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong overall positive relationship between the probability of being targeted for eviction and relatedness was thus driven almost entirely by the pattern in older females (SI Methods, Fig S2, and Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar interaction was also found between relatedness and weight (GLMM,  ± SE = 0.03 ± 0.02, 21 = 5.63, P = 0.018; Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with prediction i, therefore, negative kin discrimination was restricted to cases in which the targets of eviction were older or heavier and potentially more capable of offering resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted by our model, we found no discrimination on the basis of relatedness for cases where the targets of eviction were younger or lighter and therefore likely to suffer high costs of resistance (a high value of c¯2; Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found no evidence for the alternative hypothesis that the pattern of negative kin discrimination among older females arises because older, more closely related females inflict higher reproductive costs on dominants (number of emergent pups assigned to dominant female, GLMM, interaction between female cobreeder age and relatedness to dominant female,  ± SE = 0.00002 ± 0.0002, 21 = 0.07, P = 1.00; proportion of emergent litter assigned to dominant female, GLMM, interaction between female cobreeder age and relatedness to dominant female,  ± SE = 0.00005 ± 0.0002, 21 = 0.08, P = 0.78; Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test further whether negative kin discrimination depends on the capacity of recipients to resist, we examined kin discrimination in cases of infanticide of newborn pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1 and 12 females reproduce in each breeding attempt (14) and birth is highly synchronized, with pregnant females giving birth on exactly the same morning in 63% of cases (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental and observational evidence suggests that asynchronous litters are often killed by dominant females (14, 15) and that in asynchronous litters the death of a litter in the first week after birth can be used as a proxy for infanticide (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the pattern of negative kin discrimination in the eviction of adult females, there was no evidence of kin discrimination in cases of presumed infanticide (GLMM,  ± SE = 0.64 ± 2.00, 21 = 0.10, P = 0.75; Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is again consistent with our model, which predicts zero or positive kin discrimination where resistance is impossible or prohibitively costly (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the second prediction, that resistance to the selfish act should decrease as the recipients relatedness to the actor increases, we examined the effects of relatedness to dominants (males and females older than 3 y) and age on the probability of females targeted for eviction overcoming efforts to permanently exclude them from the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being targeted for eviction, some individuals leave the group, splitting into single-sex cohorts and dispersing separately in cases where males and females are evicted together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other targeted individuals, however, actively resist eviction: they persist in following the rest of the group, despite being aggressively driven away, until efforts to expel them eventually cease (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some attempts at eviction may thus be said to fail, largely due to sheer persistence on the part of the potential evictees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted, therefore, that the probability of resisting eviction and regaining entry to the group should decline with increasing relatedness to dominant individuals, particularly among older females who are potentially more capable of resisting eviction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant interaction between the effect of relatedness and the age of targeted females on the probability of regaining entry (interaction between relatedness and age: GLMM,  ± SE = 0.03 ± 0.01, 21 = 5.96, P = 0.015; Fig 4B and Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among older females, individuals that were more closely related to dominants were less likely to regain entry to the group, although this slope was not significantly different from zero (SI Methods, Fig S3, and Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, among younger females, more closely related targets were significantly more likely to regain entry (SI Methods, Fig S3, and Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Genetic_Analyses_and_Calculating_Relatedness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA was extracted from tail tips and genotyped at up to 43 microsatellite loci isolated from a variety of carnivore species, including the banded mongoose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping was conducted following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 or (post-2010) using multiplex PCRs (Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit) with fluorescent-labeled forward primers and was visualized through fragment size analysis on an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For full details of genotyping methods, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned parentage using MasterBayes 2.51 (44), implemented in R 3.1.1 (details in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of pairwise relatedness were calculated from a nine-generation deep pedigree constructed using a combination of parentage and sibship assignments from MasterBayes 2.51 (44) and COLONY 2.0.5.7 (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details of pedigree construction are given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Negative_Kin_Discrimination_to_Avoid_Inbreeding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether the attempted eviction of relatives was in fact the result of inbreeding avoidance, we repeated the first analysis of negative kin discrimination outlined in Methods, i) Negative Kin Discrimination in Banded Mongooses, but instead of including the mean pairwise relatedness to both male and female dominants in the group, we used the mean pairwise to same-sex dominants aged over 3 y and the mean pairwise relatedness to opposite-sex dominants aged over 3 y as the measure of relatedness in separate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other fixed and random effects used in the original male and female analyses remained the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted the female models to data on 198 females in 27 eviction attempts in five groups and the male models to data on 177 males in 15 eviction attempts in five groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Negative_Kin_Discrimination_by_Primary_Aggressors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the effect of relatedness to known aggressors on the probability of a female (or male) being targeted for eviction, we repeated the first analysis of negative kin discrimination outlined in Methods, i) Negative Kin Discrimination in Banded Mongooses, but restricted our analysis to eviction attempts where we had data on the identity of primary aggressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of the female and male models we replaced mean pairwise relatedness to dominants in the group with mean pairwise relatedness to primary aggressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other fixed and random effects used in the original male and female analyses remained the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted the female model to data on 131 females in 19 eviction attempts in four groups and the male model to data on 177 males in 11 eviction attempts in four groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_to_Investigate_Whether_Closer_Relatives_Inflict_Higher_Reproductive_Costs_on_Dominants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined whether dominant females suffered higher reproductive costs when cobreeding with more closely related females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured a dominant females reproductive success in two ways: (i) as the number of emergent pups in a litter to which a dominant female was assigned maternity and (ii) as the proportion of an emergent litter to which a dominant female was assigned maternity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first analysis, we fitted the number of emergent pups to which each dominant breeding female (females over 3 y of age) was assigned maternity as the Poisson response variable with a log-link function in a GLMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included each dominant females pairwise relatedness to cobreeding females (other females that contributed to the communal litter), the age (days) of cobreeding females, and the interaction between these two variables as fixed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included the dominant females age (days), the number of females that contributed to the litter, and mean rainfall (millimeters) in the 30 d before birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We controlled for repeated measures by including dominant female, cobreeder female, litter, and group ID as random intercepts and fitted the model to data on 2,719 pairs of dominant females and female cobreeders, involving 131 dominant females giving birth to 337 litters in 17 groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was checked for overdispersion of the response variable (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second analysis, we fitted the proportion of an emergent litter to which each dominant breeding female (females over 3 y of age) was assigned maternity as the binomial response variable with a logit-link function in a GLMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included the same fixed and random effects as in the first analysis and fitted the model to data on 2,719 pairs of dominant females and female cobreeders, involving 131 dominant females giving birth to 337 litters in 17 groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

JohnsonNeyman_Technique_to_Investigate_Significant_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the nature of the significant interaction (i) between relatedness and age on the probability of a female being targeted for eviction and (ii) between relatedness and age on the probability of a targeted female returning to the group following an eviction attempt we used the JohnsonNeyman technique (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to evaluate the conditional effect of relatedness on each of the respective response variables with respect to age by calculating the region of significance and 95% confidence intervals for the marginal effect of relatedness across all possible ages (47, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown in very general terms that where recipients can offer resistance, individuals can gain from targeting selfish acts at closer, rather than more distant, relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the particular case of violent eviction in banded mongooses, this model may therefore explain why dominant females target closer female relatives and why such discrimination is restricted to cases where recipients can offer most resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patterns of resistance, particularly among younger females, deviated from the model predictions, as we discuss in more detail below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further tests of the model could adopt an experimental approach to manipulate resistance or the costs and benefits of selfishness, which was not possible in our long-term field study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas our findings offer qualified support for the predictions of our model, it is important to consider alternative explanations for our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there has been much recent theoretical interest in the possibility that local competition among kin can erode selection for local helping and instead favor indiscriminate harming behavior (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prediction of these models is that, across groups or species, rates of aggression may be independent of relatedness (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these models cannot explain the targeting of closer kin for aggression when less closely related, but otherwise equivalent targets are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second possibility is that relatedness is correlated with some other factor influencing aggression, such as resource holding potential (RHP) or the level of reproductive competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in sea anemones, higher aggression among closer relatives has been attributed to their greater similarity in RHP (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In banded mongooses, there is no evidence that related females are of higher RHP or represent more of a reproductive threat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, younger females (with lower RHP and who reproduce less often) are more likely to be targeted for eviction overall, regardless of relatedness (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our data show that dominant females do not suffer greater reproductive costs when they cobreed with more closely related females (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also cannot be explained as a nonadaptive side effect of selection to discriminate between species of heterospecific competitor, which has been suggested to explain negative kin discrimination in polyembryonic wasps (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it has been suggested that targeting relatives for eviction could be part of an adaptive forced dispersal strategy by breeders to maximize metapopulation fitness in a structured population (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study we did not find support for this hypothesis as a predictor of eviction at a group level (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is difficult to reconcile this idea with our observations of negative kin discrimination within a given eviction attempt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In classic models such as that of Hamilton and May (19), dispersal entails direct costs for individuals who leave their natal patch, but is nevertheless favored because it reduces local competition among kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because offspring value their own survival more than that of their siblings, whereas parents value all their offspring equally, offspring favor a lower dispersal rate than do their parents, and selection can therefore favor forced eviction of young (2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, eviction by an adult of unrelated young offers equal benefits, in terms of reduced local competition, to eviction of related young, without inflicting the direct costs of dispersal on a relative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, where adults can choose whom to evict, local kin competition alone cannot explain why they should preferentially target more related over less related young for expulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There may be other asymmetries associated with the forced dispersal of kin vs. nonkin, deriving, for example, from variation in local competitive ability or variation in the bet-hedging benefits of dispersal (23), but the effect of such variation on forced dispersal in heterogeneous groups has been little explored theoretically or empirically (13, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In banded mongooses, there is no evidence that closer kin compete more intensely (Table S5) or that forced dispersal of kin yields bet-hedging benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predicted that resistance to eviction should decrease with increasing relatedness to dominants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this prediction, among younger females, closer relatives were more likely to regain entry to the group than older or less closely related females (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result runs directly counter to our assumption that these females are weaker and less able to force their way back into the group and suggests that factors other than strength or the costs of resistance may underlie the pattern by which younger females return to the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, following eviction, dominants may voluntarily readmit closely related, younger females that would otherwise fare very badly outside the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negotiation process by which females regain entry to the group may thus be more complex than the simple two-step sequence of eviction and resistance assumed by our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas our analysis shows that even a two-step game can yield results that diverge from classical predictions, it is likely that many negotiations in family groups may be modeled better as a sequence of three or more steps, something we have not attempted here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Negative kin discrimination was evident only in eviction attempts of females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In males we found no relationship between relatedness and the probability of being targeted for eviction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference between the sexes could reflect differences in the direct fitness incentive for males and females to retain group membership, which in our model is represented by the parameter b2 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females gain greater direct fitness from group membership (i.e., higher b2) than males because there is little or no reproductive suppression, and most females breed from the age of 10 mo (11, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In males, by contrast, most individuals are excluded from mating by the two or three oldest males within the group (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, low values of b2 favor little or no kin discrimination (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relatively low value of b2 in males compared with females may explain why males sometimes disperse voluntarily as a group, whereas females are invariably forced to leave after being subject to violent attack (7, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More generally, our model shows that incorporating even very simple forms of behavioral anticipation can radically change the predictions of kin selection theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where such anticipation is possible, higher relatedness can lead to outcomes that are less favorable on average for all those involved, because the threat of resistance or punishment of selfish behavior is less credible between relatives than between unrelated individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many empirical studies have shown that animals are in fact capable of adjusting their behavior according to the anticipated responses of their social partners in a range of contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples include signaling systems (26), negotiation over care of offspring (27), restraint in competitive growth (28), and audience effects (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, few have considered the possibility that this kind of anticipation might lead to less cooperative outcomes among closer kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example comes from economic studies of human behavior in the context of joint-liability group lending, which have found higher rates of loan default when there are more relatives within a group (30, 31), leading to barring of remaining group members from future borrowing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern has been attributed to the difficulty of group members imposing penalties on relatives to enforce repayment (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that similar patterns might also occur in the behavior of other species and that the influence of kinship on aggression and cooperation within animal groups may be considerably more subtle and variable than predicted by classical kin selection theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Population_and_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were collected from 15 groups of banded mongooses living on the Mweya Peninsula, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (0°12S, 27°54E), between September 1997 and October 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further details of habitat and climate, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups were visited every 13 d to record group composition, life history, and behavioral data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals were easily identifiable by unique shave markings on their back and were regularly trapped to maintain these markings (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On first capture a 2-mm skin sample was collected from the end of the tail for genetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details of genetic analyses and calculating relatedness see SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals were trained to step onto portable electronic scales to obtain weight measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The research was conducted with permission from Uganda Wildlife Authority and Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, and all methods were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the University of Exeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed the attempted eviction of 405 individuals from eight groups in 44 eviction attempts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eviction attempts were conspicuous, violent events and easy to recognize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined an eviction attempt to have occurred if one or more individuals left their group for at least 1 d following a period of intense aggression toward themselves or other group members (13, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 21 of 44 eviction attempts all targeted individuals rejoined their group; in 14 attempts some targeted individuals returned whereas others did not; and in 9 eviction attempts all targeted individuals dispersed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses were performed in R 3.3.0 (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used GLMMs with a binomial error structure using a logit-link function, or a Poisson error structure using a log link function, in the lme4 package (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poisson models were checked for overdispersion (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all analyses, we assessed the significance of each fixed effect by comparing the likelihood ratio of the maximal model to that of the model without the fixed effect (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present parameter estimates and SEs from maximal models, rather than removing nonsignificant fixed effects due to problems associated with stepwise model reduction (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, remove nonsignificant interactions to allow the significance of the main effects to be tested (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
