Molecular basis for the broad substrate selectivity of a peptide prenyltransferase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cyanobactin prenyltransferases serve as a tool kit for regioselective and chemoselective peptide and protein modifications, in which each enzyme can catalyze the same chemistry on an enormous number of different substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Installation of a minimal motif is sufficient to direct modifications on any peptide substrate, which can alter their properties to be more drug-like.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cyanobactin prenyltransferases catalyze a series of known or unprecedented reactions on millions of different substrates, with no easily observable recognition motif and exquisite regioselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we define the basis of broad substrate tolerance for the otherwise uncharacterized TruF family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the structures of the Tyr-prenylating enzyme PagF, in complex with an isoprenoid donor analog and a panel of linear and macrocyclic peptide substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the structures reveal a truncated barrel fold, wherein binding of large peptide substrates is necessary to complete a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket to form the catalytically competent active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic, mutational, chemical, and computational analyses revealed the structural basis of selectivity, showing a small motif within peptide substrates that is sufficient for recognition by the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attaching this 2-residue motif to two random peptides results in their isoprenylation by PagF, demonstrating utility as a general biocatalytic platform for modifications on any peptide substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Biochemical_Characterization_of_PagF_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We carried out a complete MichaelisMenten analysis on PagF using a range of synthetic substrates and the allylic donor DMAPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevant kinetic parameters are reported in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that PagF does not efficiently prenylate l-Tyr or small peptides such as N-boc-Tyr and N-acetyl-Tyr (Km = 15 mM and Vmax/Km = 1.0 min-1M1), in contrast to bacterial and fungal ABBA prenyltransferases that can effectively modify the free amino acid l-Trp (14, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, like LynF, PagF is a good catalyst only for the prenylation on larger peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic efficiency of PagF relative to N-boc-Tyr increases by 40-fold with a linear Tyr-Tyr-Tyr tripeptide substrate (Km = 0.14 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic properties were further measured with a synthetically prepared native precursor to produce the prenylated natural product, prenylagaramide B, revealing a 4,500-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (Km = 2.2 × 104 mM) over N-boc-Tyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all competent substrates, the measured Vmax was nearly identical, so that Km differences dominate changes in the catalytic efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although prenylagaramide B contains two Tyr residues, only Tyr4 is prenylated easily by recombinant PagF (see below), as is also found in the natural product isolated from the cyanobacteria O. aghardii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Tyr residue in all substrates was modified regioselectively only in the forward direction on the phenolic oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is similar to what was found for LynF, where only phenolic reverse O-prenylation was observed in a large series of substrates (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cyanobacterial F family enzymes are distinct from canonical small-molecule prenyltransferases for their preference of amino acid substrates only within linear or cyclic peptides, as well as for their strict regioselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cocrystal_Structures_of_Substrates_with_PagF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To delineate the determinants for substrate recognition, we solved the crystal structure of native PagF (to 1.8 Å resolution), as well as ternary complex structures with the the prenyl donor analog dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate (DMSPP) and boc-l-Tyr (2.1 Å resolution), a Tyr-Tyr-Tyr tripeptide (1.9 Å resolution), and cyclic[INPYLYP] peptide (2.2 Å resolution), the latter of which is one of the physiological substrates for this enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevant data collection and refinement statistics are provided in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall structure of PagF consists of 10 antiparallel -strands surrounded by 10 -helices to form a barrel architecture reminiscent of that observed for aromatic prenyltransferases of the ABBA and indole PTase families of enzymes (Fig 2A) (14, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DMSPP analog is bound at the center of the barrel, where residues Arg65, Lys136, His138, Tyr186, Tyr235, Arg288, and Tyr290 coordinate the disphosphate (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DALI search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) reveals close structural homology to the indole prenyltransferase (FgPT2) from Aspergillus fumigatus (PDB ID code 3I4Z; rmsd of 3.5 over 250 aligned C atoms) (29) and the bacterial ABBA family members NphB (PDB ID code 1ZCW; rmsd of 3.3 over 236 aligned C atoms) (28) and CloQ (PDB ID code 2XLQ; rmsd of 3.5 over 216 aligned C atoms) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the bottom base of PagF is open, resulting in a solvent-exposed channel that transverses the  barrel core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the base of canonical / prenyltransferases is occluded by either the presence of a long  helix (in NphB and CloQ) or an extended aromatic residue loop (FgPT2) (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_the_Binding_of_Peptide_Substrates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of the unliganded PagF structure with those of canonical / prenyltransferases suggests that the solvent-exposed channel must be closed before catalysis to prevent nonproductive quenching of the DMAPP-derived allylic carbocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the PagF cocrystal structures reveals that the substrate acceptor peptide is bound at the base of the active site barrel, resulting in closure of the solvent-exposed channel (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This substrate-mediated plugging of the base results in the formation of a deep, encapsulated hydrophobic cavity where the DMSPP analog of the substrate donor binds, which would shield the allylic carbocation from solvent (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, prenyltransferases that function on small-molecule substrates, such as NphB, which uses indole substrates, are occluded at the base of the barrel by structural elements from the protein (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cluster of hydrophobic residues lines the circumference of the active site tunnel, providing a hydrophobic shield that further protects reactive intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, superposition of the cocrystal structures with the cyclic and two linear substrates results in a nearly identical placement of the isoprene acceptor Tyr, which is sandwiched between a wall composed of Trp271 on one side and Leu67 and Phe69 on the other side (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu51 is located roughly 2.6 Å away from the phenolic oxygen of the substrate and likely serves to deprotonate the Tyr to facilitate the electrophilic addition (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-1 atom of the dimethylallyl group of DMSPP is positioned directly above the phenolic oxygen of the substrate at distances of 2.83.1 Å (depending on the structure), which would favor the reaction on this atom of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance from the phenolic oxygen to C-3 is nearly 1 Å greater, explaining why PagF catalyzes forward, rather than reverse, prenylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar distances and orientations are observed for the dimethylallyl C-1 and the reactive substrate atom in farnesyl diphosphate synthase (3.2 Å) (31), NphB (4 Å) (28), and the indole prenyltransferase DMATS (3.1 Å) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability for free amino acids to plug the bottom of the PagF active site provides a rationale for why TruF family enzymes can function only on peptide substrates or amino acids containing bulky N-terminal substituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Km values for the tested substrates correlate roughly with their volumes, and the macrocyclic substrate that can best enclose the active site has a Km value four orders of magnitude lower than that for boc-l-Tyr (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PagF-cyclic[INPYLYP] structure also provides a rationale for understanding why cyclic peptides are preferred substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg140 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carbonyl following the substrate Tyr, and the substrate residue immediately carboxyl-terminal is anchored in place through van der Waals contact with Gln190 and Leu220, suggesting that any aliphatic/aromatic residue can be accommodated at this position (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residues amino-terminal to the Tyr are supported against a hydrophobic wall composed of Tyr269, Trp271, and Tyr292, and this wall constricts the binding site to favor cyclic peptide substrates over their linear counterparts (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with other F family enzymes, PagF requires divalent cations for activity, but lacks the (N/D)DxxD signature motif used in metal ion coordination in other isoprenoid-using enzymes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cocrystal structure, the diphosphate oxygens of DMSPP coordinate a Mg2+ ion, consistent with the role of the metal in lowering the energy barrier for ionization of the prenyl donor to initiate carbocation formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mg2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activity (45 ± 9 mM; SI Appendix, Fig S4) is much higher than the KD value for formation of a free DMAPP-Mg2+ complex (120 M) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure-based assignments for the roles of several PagF residues were confirmed through kinetic analysis of site-directed variants using the tri-Tyr peptide as a substrate (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations H237L and F222V resulted in relatively fast enzymes for which kinetic values could be estimated and compared with wild type, whereas other mutations resulted in much slower enzymes that were only roughly compared using initial activity estimates at high substrate concentrations (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of R65 or H138, which engages the diphosphate of DMAPP, decreased activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations at residues F222 and Y235 that compose the hydrophobic shield, which is proposed to encapsulate and protect the carbocation from unwanted nucleophilic attack, result in decreases in activity that correlate with the volume created by the mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y290A mutation results in the greatest loss in activity, possibly reflecting the multiple roles that Tyr290 likely plays in solvent shielding, interacting with the pyrophosphate of the isoprene donor, and possibly stabilizing the allylic carbocation through cation interactions, as has been proposed for the mechanism of prenylation by NphB (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adjacent to the active site, His237 acts as a linchpin in supporting the orientation of several residues along one side of the hydrophobic shield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, mutation of His237 into Leu results in a 1.5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, possibly because of greater accessibility of the active site, especially for the slower (interior) Tyr residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Basis_of_Substrate_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biochemical data and the series of crystal structures with various tyrosine substrates suggest that PagF is able to prenylate each substrate with similar kcat values by positioning Tyr in the same conformation in the active site, regardless of the size or other elements in the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our efforts to understand the specificity of the enzyme have been somewhat hindered by the lack of peptide substrates that are not prenylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the three pag products that are known, prenylagaramides A and C each contain a single tyrosine that is prenylated; however, prenylagaramide B (cyclic[INPYLYP]) has one prenylated tyrosine and one free tyrosine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays of PagF with this substrate showed that Tyr4 is prenylated efficiently, whereas prenylation of the Tyr6 is barely detectable even under saturating concentrations of enzyme, except after long incubations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used molecular dynamics and modeling to further analyze the rationale for this substrate specificity (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted two sets of 10 independent pulling molecular dynamics simulations (20 total), in which either Tyr4 or Tyr6 of the peptide was guided into the active site of PagF via distance restraints (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr6 required significantly more restraint energy to enter the active site than Tyr4 (SI Appendix, Fig S14), and in fact Tyr4 was able to penetrate the active site to a greater extent, 2.0 Å on average (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that artifacts introduced by the nonequilibrium pulling simulations did not influence these results, we conducted umbrella sampling to estimate the free energy of each approach (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 and S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, approach of Tyr6 was much less favorable than that of Tyr4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer examination of the simulations reveal that the environment around Tyr6 was sterically crowded compared with that around Tyr4, leading to physically unfavorable interactions (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr4 is able to enter the active site to a greater extent then Tyr6 and to form many favorable interactions with PagF residues, as observed in the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biotechnological_Application_of_Broad_Substrate_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superposition of the cocrystal structures of PagF with each ligand (boc-l-Tyr, Tyr-Tyr-Tyr tripeptide, and cyclic[INPYLYP] peptide) revealed a nearly identical pose for the substrate Tyr, regardless of the length or complexity of the peptide (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpected convergence suggests that F family prenyltransferases can modify Tyr residues in the context of any substrate, as long as the geometric and orientation constraints imposed by the active site can be fulfilled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the structural data suggest that PagF can accept any linear peptide substrate with the primary sequence of N-Tyr--R (where  is any aliphatic/aromatic residue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this hypothesis, we made two peptides beginning with the sequence Tyr-Leu-Tyr and monitored O-prenylation of these synthetic substrates using PagF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Ile-Ala-Arg is an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (35), and Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Trp-Leu-Gly-Ala-Pro-Val is the N terminus of osteocalcin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal Tyr of each peptide was fully prenylated in overnight assays with a 100-fold excess of peptide over enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the same time scale, the second Tyr of Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Ile-Ala-Arg also was almost completely prenylated, whereas the second Tyr of the longer peptide, Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Trp-Leu-Gly-Ala-Pro-Val, was partly modified (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prenylation of each of these peptides results in an increase in their hydrophobicity, which increases with successive prenylation [Fig 5; 1-h trace (red) vs. 5-h trace (green)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the biological consequences of prenylation of these peptides have yet to be established, we recently demonstrated that prenylation can affect the bioactivity profile of the RiPP cyanobactin patellin 2; the prenylated analog of patellin 2 demonstrates neuroactivity, whereas the unmodified analog does not show such activity (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that PagF, and the F family enzymes in general, may be used as a biotechnological tool for enzymatic isoprenylation of peptide substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Basis_for_Site_Specificity_of_TruF1_Prenyltransferase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enzymes of the F family show specificities for a diverse range of substrates, with PagF catalyzing the forward prenylation on Tyr, LynF catalyzing the reverse prenylation on Tyr, and TruF1 catalyzing the reverse prenylation on Ser/Thr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the F enzymes could be clustered by substrate specificity based solely only on primary sequence, we used the Enzyme Similarity Tool (EST) of the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) to generate a sequence similarity network, using the PagF sequence to query the UniProtKB database for sequences with an E-value threshold of 105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, analysis of the 26 retrieved sequences at a cutoff E-value of 1080 revealed a clustering of sequences with similar substrate specificities (Fig 6A); e.g., PagF that prenylates Tyr clusters with other enzymes that have been experimentally verified to function on a similar substrate, as well as others with the same presumed activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second cluster consists of orthologs found in biosynthetic clusters that do not produce a prenylated compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical analysis demonstrates that some of these enzymes are not functional, and neither PagF nor TruF2 catalyzes isoprenylation on any known peptidic substrate with a range of different prenyl donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, nearly all of the proteins that cluster within this group are from clusters that produce nonprenylated cyanobactins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer inspection of the primary sequences reveals that each of these enzymes lacks one or more of the residues necessary for engaging the prenyl donor in PagF (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of activity from these proteins is likely due to the inability to bind DMAPP (or other isoprene donor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two sequences that do not cluster with either of the aforementioned groups, and these two enzymes demonstrate substrate preferences distinct from those of PagF homologs that isoprenylate on Tyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, LynF (40% sequence-identical to PagF) also catalyzes O-prenylation on Tyr, but does so in a reverse manner (i.e., via addition of dimethylallylic carbocation at C3 rather than at C1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, TruF1 (32% sequence-identical to PagF) catalyzes reverse prenylation, but does so on Ser/Thr residues rather than on Tyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand a possible rationale for this change in specificity, we generated a structure-based model for TruF1 using the coordinates of PagF and superimposed the two structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inspection of the two active sites suggests that many of the hydrophobic residues that are necessary for stabilizing the Tyr substrate in PagF are altered to either small aliphatic residues (i.e., Phe69 in PagF is Ser68 in TruF1, and Trp271 in PagF is Ser280 in TruF1) or basic residues (i.e., Tyr292 in PagF is Arg301 in TruF1) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other residues that define the PagF active site contours (Fig 4B) are altered in the TruF1 sequence as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes likely alter both the contour and the charge of the active site in TruF1 to accommodate the smaller, polar Ser residue in the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biochemical analysis of a TruF family member extends the architectural repertoire of / prenyltransferase to a new clade of enzymes that O-prenylate Tyr, Ser, and Thr on linear or cyclic peptide substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical characterization of related F enzymes reveals that a number of members are inactive in their ability to catalyze peptide alkylation, both in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trunkamide cluster contains two F enzymes (TruF1 and TruF2), but only TruF1 is active in reverse prenylation Ser/Thr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the patellamide cluster contains PatF, but the products of this cluster are not prenylated, and the enzyme lacks prenyl transfer activity (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer examination of the primary sequences of these inactive enzymes, in the context of the biochemical and structural data presented here, demonstrates that these enzymes lack at least one of the conserved residues that are required to engage the DMAPP substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the FgPT2, the regiochemistry of the FriedelCrafts type alkylation at C4 of the indole substrate is dictated by steric constraints that preclude -complex formation at the more reactive C7 atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PagF, peptide binding at the base of the active site orients the Tyr hydroxyl in the vicinity of the prenyl donor at a sufficient distance from the allylic carbocation to favor the direct electrophilic attack on the Tyr oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This geometric positioning of reactive atoms and the greater reactivity of the hydroxyl group dictate direct O-alkylation over aromatic substitution of Tyr substrates in cyclic peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural data enable elucidation of spatial and volume considerations for substrate suitability, which we have used to expand the substrate scope to encompass any peptide that contains an amino terminal N-Tyr- motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enzymes catalyze a diverse array of reactions, including forward and reverse Tyr O-prenylation, Ser and Thr reverse O-prenylation, N-prenylation at the N terminus (7), and potentially other modifications, such as addition of geranyl and Trp prenylation (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these enzymes act on large numbers of very chemically disparate substrates without compromising chemoselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, so far PagF has been seen to prenylate diverse substrates only in the forward direction on Tyr, whereas LynF performs only reverse prenylation of Tyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, TruF1 catalyzes reverse prenylation, but has a substrate preference for Ser/Thr over Tyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although sequence analysis suggests a possible rationale for the specificity of TruF1 for Ser/Thr, the basis of forward vs. reverse prenylation is not as obvious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that this preference is not dependent on the structure of the acceptor peptide, it is likely that LynF simply orients the two reactive species differently relative to PagF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a rather unusual feature, in that in some indole prenyltransferases the regioselectivity of reaction appears to be substrate-driven (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As more cyanobactin prenyltransferase family enzymes are described and cataloged, general rules underlying broad substrate specificity will be uncovered, leading to better control over biology to direct specific synthetic organic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
