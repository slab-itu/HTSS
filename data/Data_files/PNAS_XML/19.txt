Laser-based three-dimensional multiscale micropatterning of biocompatible hydrogels for customized tissue engineering scaffolds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we present results on 3D, multiscale laser machining of soft, transparent biomaterials suited for cellular growth and/or implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an ultrafast laser to generate high-resolution, 3D structures within the bulk of a transparent soft-biomaterial formulation that can support cell growth and allow cells to penetrate deep within the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure is created by multiphoton absorption which, thanks to the clarity of the silk gels, is possible nearly 1 cm below the surface of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depth represents an 10Ã— improvement over other materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to create micrometer-scale voids over such a large volume has promising applications in the biomedical field and its efficacy was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Light-induced material phase transitions enable the formation of shapes and patterns from the nano- to the macroscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From lithographic techniques that enable high-density silicon circuit integration, to laser cutting and welding, lightmatter interactions are pervasive in everyday materials fabrication and transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These noncontact patterning techniques are ideally suited to reshape soft materials of biological relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present here the use of relatively low-energy (less_than 2 nJ) ultrafast laser pulses to generate 2D and 3D multiscale patterns in soft silk protein hydrogels without exogenous or chemical cross-linkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that high-resolution features can be generated within bulk hydrogels through nearly 1 cm of material, which is 1.5 orders of magnitude deeper than other biocompatible materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples illustrating the materials, results, and the performance of the machined geometries in vitro and in vivo are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overview of the micromachining process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic of the multiphoton micromachining workstation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) Photograph of the transparent silk hydrogel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Three-dimensional AFM image of one of the lines in D. (C) Graph relating line dimensions with pulse energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent 1 SD (n = 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Microphotograph of lines machined into the upper surface of a silk gel at pulse energies ranging from 0.25 nJ (Bottom) to 5 nJ (Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) End-on view of 30-m-wide lines machined into a silk gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light was incident from the bottom of the image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ruler on right side measures depth from the surface of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the large area involved, this image was stitched together from a series of microphotographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) Detail of the cross-section of one line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Linear absorption spectrum of silk gel with background subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical line at 810 nm indicates the wavelength used for multiphoton micromachining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pump/2 and Pump/3 lines indicate the wavelengths associated with a two-photon and three-photon absorption process, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear absorption is driven by tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the silk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectrum was filtered by a five-point moving average to reduce noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results from the knife edge measurement of the laser spot size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Top) Results in the X direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Bottom) Results from the Y direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Propagation was in the Z direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full width at half maximum spot size was calculated to be 5 m in the X direction and 6 m in the Y direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Light incident from the left of the image was used to micromachine features at various depths in a gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each feature was made by a single pass of the laser scanning into the page at 10 nJ per pulse of power and a rate of 75 m/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large boxes show a zoomed-in view of the outlined area around each individual feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of each feature remains constant at each depth, indicating that self-focusing is not significantly deflecting the beam in the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the large area involved, this image was stitched together from several different photomicrographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amplified laser pulses incident from the bottom were used to create voids in the silk hydrogels at various pulse energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symmetrical features using 1-J pulses (Left) indicate that self-focusing is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong self-focusing effects are evident in the asymmetrical shape from 10-J pulses (Center) and 20-J (Right) pulse energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All features were made by a single pulse at each location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiphoton_Micromachining_Workstation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 100-fs pulses of 810-nm light from a titanium sapphire oscillator (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) at a repetition rate of 80 MHz were passed through a computer-controlled shutter and directed into the rear accessory port of an inverted microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light was focused to an  5 m spot through a 0.3-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  microscope objective with a working distance of 1.03 cm onto the sample, which was placed on a computer-controlled XYZ translation stage (Ludl Electronics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a custom LabView application, complex patterns could be micromachined by inputting stacks of binary images into the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulse energies were manually adjusted via a half-wave plate and polarizer giving continuous control of pulse energy from 0.1 to 10 nJ per pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hydrogel_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silk fibroin was extracted as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 with a degumming time of 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were prepared by adding 10 units/mL type VI horseradish peroxidase and 10 L/mL 1% hydrogen peroxide (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate fluorescence imaging, Rhodamine B-stained gels were prepared after the desired pattern had been micromachined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These gels were soaked in a solution of 0.1 mM Rhodamine B for 4 h and then were rinsed in 10 changes of deionized water over the following 24 h to remove any Rhodamine not bound to the silk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gel_Micromachining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lines were micromachined on the top surface of a thin gel at pulse energies ranging from 0.25 to 5 nJ per pulse and were imaged on an MFP-3D-Bio AFM (Asylum Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were scanned in contact mode under PBS solution using TR800PSA cantilevers with a calibrated spring constant of 0.4 N/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maximum depth of machining was determined by forming a silk gel inside a plastic fluorescence cuvette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-m-thick lines were micromachined in the silk at regular depth intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation speed varied between 100 and 25 m/s depending on the depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A side view of the lines was obtained by rotating the cuvette 90Â° and imaging via bright-field microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Dimensional_Contact_Guidance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silk solutions were filtered through a 0.22-m filter and gelled in a 35-mm Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before removal from the hood, dishes were sealed with parafilm to maintain sterility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines were then micromachined onto the top surface of the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human foreskin fibroblasts were seeded onto the gel and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were imaged via phase contrast microscopy at day 1, 3, and 5 postseeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 8 the cells were stained with a Live/DeadViability/Cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) fluorescence assay and imaged via fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell-Laden_Hydrogels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were isolated from fresh bone marrow aspirate (Lonza) as previously described (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hMSCs were gently mixed into a partially gelled silk hydrogel at a rate of 1,000 cells per mm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred L of the silk/cell mixture was added to each glass-bottomed Petri dish (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After gelation, micromachining was performed on the cell-laden hydrogels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 4 h of machining the cells were stained with a Live/DeadViability/Cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and examined via confocal fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Three-Dimensional_Cell_Guidance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sterile gels were prepared as described in 2D Contact Guidance above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional Y-shaped branching patterns were machined into the gel, with the main branch of the Y intersecting the top surface of the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Main branch diameters were 200 m and 400 m in the small and large features, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human foreskin fibroblasts were seeded onto the surface of the gel after micromachining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were examined via confocal microscopy on day 5, 9, and 14 postseeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The day before each imaging session dishes were stained with CytoTraker Green (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implantation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sterile gels were prepared in 35-mm Petri dishes as described above and a 4-mm biopsy punch was used to remove cylinders of gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Branching patterns (Fig 4B) were machined into each cylinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures involving mice were approved by the Tufts University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation during the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Machined gels were implanted s.c. into the lumbar region of three mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silk implants and adjacent tissues were extracted following euthanasia (carbon dioxide asphyxiation) at 2-, 3-, and 4-wk postimplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were recovered from the mice and fixed in 10% formalin and stained with Phalloidin and DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Scattering_Loss_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silk solution was filtered through a 0.22-m pore size filter to remove dust and other scatterers present in the solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solution was formed into a gel in a plastic semimicro fluorescence cuvette with 5- and 10-mm path lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A green laser was propagated through both the long and short paths and the transmitted intensity measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these measurements we were able to calculate scattering losses in the gel to be 0.6 Â± 0.3 dB/cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This translates to a 1/e scattering length of between 5 and 14 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spot_Size_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spot size at the focus of the microscope objective was measured via the knife edge technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam was focused in the plane of a razor blade which was mounted on a micropositioning stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second microscope objective was used to collect light transmitted past the razor blade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the measurement the razor blade was moved through the focus of the beam and the transmitted intensity measured using a photodiode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derivative of the measured intensity was fit to a Gaussian function to calculate the spot size of the beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement was repeated in both the X and Y directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam profile was found to be a good fit for the Gaussian function with a spot size of 5 m in the X direction and 6 m in the Y direction (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spot size is larger than what would be expected from a diffraction-limited system because the beam did not fill the rear aperture of the objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Self-Focusing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The symmetrical shape of the features along the optical axis indicates that self-focusing effects are not present using low-energy pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain an estimate of the critical power for self-focusing (Pcr), we used an amplified laser system to examine the shape of the features micromachined by a single pulse using the same 10Ã—, 0.3-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective used for oscillator-only micromachining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymmetrical features consistent with self-focusing were observed at pulse energies above 1 J (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a 150-fs pulse, this translates to Pcr on the order of 6 MW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak power of the pulse during micromachining is no more than 60 kW, which is far below the threshold value and explains why self-focusing is avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Implantation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gels with branching features machined into them were implanted in mice for up to 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sizes of branching features were formed, one with a main branch diameter of 200 m and the other with a main branch diameter of 400 m. In addition to the figure in the main text (Fig 4), additional confocal stacks were collected and are presented here (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
