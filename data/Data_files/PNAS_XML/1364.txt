A monumental cemetery built by eastern Africas first herders near Lake Turkana, Kenya  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Archaeologists have long sought monumental architectures origins among societies that were becoming populous, sedentary, and territorial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sub-Saharan Africa, however, dispersed pastoralists pioneered monumental construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eastern Africas earliest monumental site was built by the regions first herders 5,0004,300 y ago as the African Humid Period ended and Lake Turkanas shoreline receded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lothagam North Pillar Site was a massive communal cemetery with megalithic pillars, stone circles, cairns, and a mounded platform accommodating an estimated several hundred burials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its mortuary cavity held individuals of mixed ages/sexes, with diverse adornments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burial placement and ornamentation do not suggest social hierarchy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amidst profound landscape changes and the socioeconomic uncertainties of a moving pastoral frontier, monumentality was an important unifying force for eastern Africas first herders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monumental architecture is a prime indicator of social complexity, because it requires many people to build a conspicuous structure commemorating shared beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining monumentality in different environmental and economic settings can reveal diverse reasons for people to form larger social units and express unity through architectural display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In multiple areas of Africa, monumentality developed as mobile herders created large cemeteries and practiced other forms of commemoration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motives for such behavior in sparsely populated, unpredictable landscapes may differ from well-studied cases of monumentality in predictable environments with sedentary populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report excavations and ground-penetrating radar surveys at the earliest and most massive monumental site in eastern Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery near Lake Turkana (northwest Kenya) constructed 5,000 years ago by eastern Africas earliest pastoralists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside a platform ringed by boulders, a 119.5-m2 mortuary cavity accommodated an estimated minimum of 580 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People of diverse ages and both sexes were buried, and ornaments accompanied most individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no evidence for social stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainties of living on a moving frontier of early herdingexacerbated by dramatic environmental shiftsmay have spurred people to strengthen social networks that could provide information and assistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lothagam North Pillar Site would have served as both an arena for interaction and a tangible reminder of shared identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orthoimage of Lothagam North Pillar Site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The platform is the large, flat elliptical area on the west (left) side of the site; the surrounding boulder ring is eroding into gullies on the northwest side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nine stone circles are visible to the east, on either side of the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six raised features south and east of the stone circles are cairns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower left inset shows locations of contemporaneous pillar sites around the middle Holocene paleo-shoreline of Lake Turkana: 1, Lothagam North Pillar Site (GeJi9); 2, Lothagam West Pillar Site (GeJi10); 3, Manemanya Pillar Site (GcJh5); 4, Kalokol Pillar Site (GcJh3); 5, Il Lokeridede Pillar Site (GaJi23); and 6, Jarigole Pillar Site (GbJj1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All locations are georeferenced except Il Lokeridede.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lothagam_North_Pillar_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The largest pillar site, Lothagam North/GeJi9, lies between the two ridges of Lothagams uplifted fault block (36), which formed a prominent peninsula into middle Holocene Paleolake Turkana (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lothagam North has a 700-m2 platform; nine stone circles and six cairns cover an additional 700 m2 to the east.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from excavations (Fig 2A) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) (SI Appendix, Fig S3) reveal a construction plan that envisioned the platforms dimensions from the outset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People first removed beach sands from a 120-m2 area down to sandstone bedrock, creating a large cavity shored up with sandstone slabs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They capped surrounding beach sands with a stone pavement ringed by boulders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the cavity, people dug closely spaced burial pits into the soft bedrock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After bedrock floor space was exhausted, corpses were added above the pits in a series of mostly individual inhumation events, partially filling the mortuary cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rubble filled the remainder of the cavity until it reached the level of the peripheral stone pavement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire platform was then mounded with 3050 cm of fill and capped with rounded, uniformly sized basalt pebbles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People brought natural columnar basalt pillars (1.5 m tall) across Lothagams western ridge and down to GeJi9, placed the pillars within fill on the platforms east side, and surrounded the entire platform with basalt boulders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within Lothagam Norths platform, the mortuary cavity holds densely arranged skeletal remains of both sexes; ages at death range from neonates to elderly (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the center of the mortuary cavity, a 2- × 2-m excavation unit documented at least 36 individuals, some buried immediately after death with skeletons intact, and others with disorganization of the bones that suggests delayed burial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the edge of the cavity, excavation revealed equally close positioning: Two primary burials lay next to a bundle burial containing three crania and disarticulated, commingled postcrania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such high density required strategic corpse placement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual body position and orientation varied, as if to fit the maximum number of bodies in the space available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most skeletons were in tightly flexed positions suggestive of being bound or wrapped and were marked by boulders on the skull, torso, and/or chest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warping (distortion of bone shape without sharp breaks) suggests that some boulders were placed soon after death, while the bone was still fresh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burials were rarely disturbed by later interment activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolating from the 2- × 2-m excavation, we estimate the 120-m2 mortuary cavity eventually accommodated 580 individuals (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although radiocarbon dates suggest platform construction spanned about 450 (minimum) to 900 (maximum) years, mortuary deposits accumulated over a shorter period (Table 1; see also SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Personal adornments occur with nearly all skeletons (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many individuals had ostrich eggshell or stone beads around the necks, hips, and/or ankles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others had hippo ivory finger rings or forearm bangles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two burials had disintegrated headpieces with intricate latticed arrangements of mammal incisors: Burial 3s headpiece had 405 teeth from 113 individual gerbils (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gerbilliscus) and Burial 4s head/neckpiece had 45 teeth from 25 individual hyraxes (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterohyrax).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another individual was buried with 12 perforated hippo tusks that may have been strung together and worn in life; the burial pit yielded isolated caprine remains, as well as a carved stone palette with a zoomorphic face resembling a cow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adornments were not restricted to any age, sex, or interment type; beads were present with infants and within bundle burials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests ornamentation was the norm, and its absence from a few skeletons may reflect unusual circumstances or poor preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 300 vibrantly colored stone and mineral beads were found, of which 173 were associated with 20 burials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-six raw material types include soft materials such as pink analcimes (45%), dark green talc (6.3%), and purple fluorite (3.3%), and harder minerals such as bright blue-green amazonite (32%) and chalcedony (5.7%, including some carnelian) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many volcano-derived rocks (e.g., amygdaloidal and vesicular basalt, rhyolite, and phonolite) are available locally, whereas Precambrian sources for amazonite and talc lie farther afield but still within the Turkana Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Creative workmanship is evident in diverse forms: incomplete circles worn as earrings or on garments, ribbed pendants, and a curved pendant recycled from a broken round bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ornamentation was universal, time-intensive, and personalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
East of the platform, excavations probed one stone circle and one cairn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lothagam Norths largest cairn (57 m2) has massive sandstone slabs dipping inward: Outermost slabs were placed first, defining its large dimensions from the outset (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stone circle, a 16-m2 low mound of disintegrating sandstone ringed by rounded basalt cobbles, covered a small, central bedrock pit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within it, a bundle burial contained commingled elements from at least three persons of distinct ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps locations or timings of death prevented immediate transport for primary burial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stone circles tight spacing and uniform size echo the compact placement of pits and burials within the platform (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Construction at Lothagam North and other pillar sites ceased by 4,100 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of Lothagam Norths architectural elements (cairns, stone circles, and platform cap) suggest orderly completion of a plan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mortuary tradition is absent among later herding populations around Lake Turkana (25); changing social priorities, migrations, or other factors may have removed the impetus for large-scale construction and communal burial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lothagam Norths initial creation and final closure required heavy labor, but during the intervening decades or centuries people assembled for hundreds of mortuary rituals that may have involved little toil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is inconsistent with nascent elites consolidating authority via recurring large-scale construction initiatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Communal values were emphasized by placing deceased of diverse ages and both sexes in a single location, without spatial or artifactual patterning that would suggest social hierarchies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near-universal yet idiosyncratic ornamentation also argues against sequestration of resources by a social subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absent other evidence, Lothagam North provides an example of monumentality that is not demonstrably linked to the emergence of hierarchy, forcing us to consider other narratives of social change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The social systems that galvanized monumental construction emerged in a singular economic and ecological context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pillar sites are spatially and temporally bounded within the moving frontier phase (37) of initial herding around Lake Turkana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herdersexperienced immigrants and/or novice localshad to juggle the distinct needs of sheep, goats, and cattle in new environments with higher livestock disease risks (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relations between groups emphasizing herding vs. fishing may have been delicate, and social roles within groups adopting livestock may have been contested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these challenges, which are intrinsic to a moving frontier on an ecological transition (37), would have been exacerbated by the sudden drop in regional rainfall as the AHP ended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Availability of terrestrial plants and animals may have become unpredictable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake Turkanas retreating shoreline exposed new plains but demanded constant recalibration of fishing methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is striking that amid all of these tensions people undertook construction of a massive communal cemetery where hundreds of individuals were buried over a span of a few centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a dynamic physical and social landscape, pillar sites may represent deliberate efforts to create stable landmarks or assembly points for dispersed, mobile people to express social unity and continuity through shared ritual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular congregation for mortuary events would have promoted information sharing that improved strategic planning of livestock movements across extended areas, or even fostered networks for long-distance exchange or risk sharing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need to actively propagate such social connections would be strongest during initial stages of the moving frontier and dramatic environmental shifts (39), waning after herding became entrenched into a static frontier with routine networks of interaction, and once rainfall and shorelines stabilized at lower levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chronology of pillar site construction and closure matches these expectations, suggesting that monumentality around Lake Turkana helped mitigate social and economic uncertainties in a frontier situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pan-African comparison shows that monumental mortuary expression in the Sahara, Sahel, Nile, and Turkana often coincided with the local advent of herding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Turkana pillar sites lack obvious material cultural links to monumental sites in other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forms of expression vary: cattle burials in the central Sahara (17), megaliths in the eastern Sahara (18), aggregate cemeteries in the southern Sahara and along the Nile (15, 19, 2123), built mortuary spaces in the Red Sea Hills (20) and around Lake Turkana (described here), and cairn and cremation treatments linked to early pastoralism in central Kenya (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these examples show that distinct forms of commemoration and mortuary treatment arose independently along the arc of herdings spread through Africa, each stimulated by local conditions and needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emerging pattern requires additional investigation and careful comparison, to see whether (or how) similar socioeconomic circumstances may have prompted the emergence of monumentality in different parts of the continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Turkana pillar sites and other cases of African monumentality have potential to reshape global perspectives on the processes of social change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with central Asian pastoralist cases (42, 43), they prove monumentality can develop among mobile and/or dispersed populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pillar sites join a growing number of studies in diverse ecological and economic contexts that decouple monumentality from the emergence of hierarchical social forms (4447).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because monumentality entails the cooperative mobilization of large groups to create durable reminders of shared history, ideals, and/or cultural memory (1), it is a reliable signifier of complex social forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discovering monumentality in these new settingsamid societies that are not hierarchical, and among mobile groups in unpredictable landscapesopens the door to future research that may reveal alternative pathways to social complexity in many parts of the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methods for excavation and spatial data collection are described in SI Appendix, Supplementary Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GPR_Interpretation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research followed standard protocol for GPR field data collection and processing (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48; see also SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correlate GPR signals with depositional elements, the reflection profile running nearest the N04 excavation gridline (SI Appendix, Fig S3A) was compared with strata visible in the 2014 ongoing excavations in the western and central platform, and to records of 2009 test excavations in the eastern platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the depth of the Early Holocene beach sand visible in the western 1- × 5-m excavation trench was correlated directly to the reflections in adjacent GPR profiles to directly tie known stratigraphic horizons to radar reflections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed for an accurate placement in true depth of the Early Holocene beach sand unit and the underlying sandstone bedrock visible between 80- and 100-cm depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These natural horizons were truncated when the pillar site builders created the mortuary cavity, visible in the middle of the reflection profile (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical incisions cutting out these stratigraphic layers were observed in all reflection profiles across the grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflection profiles were then resampled to derive reflection wave amplitudes from all profiles in the 20- × 22-m grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those amplitude values were averaged in a slice generated from between 80- to 120-cm depth and regridded to generate an image of the strength of the reflected waves, with pixels every 5 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A map-view image (SI Appendix, Fig S3B) illustrates that the high-amplitude reflections are produced from the bedding layers where the sediments were undisturbed by burial activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where these sedimentary units were removed to create the mortuary cavity, and homogenized sediments were later placed in the ground during multiple burial episodes that eventually refilled the cavity, the map displays very low amplitude or no radar reflections at all, as there are no layers in those fill units within the mortuary cavity to reflect radar energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human remains that are known to be abundant in these homogenized fill units within the incision boundaries are too small to reflect energy and appear as areas of no or small-amplitude reflections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total area in the grid where the strata were removed for burial is 119.5 m3 (SI Appendix, Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimate_of_Number_of_Individuals_Buried_in_the_Mortuary_Cavity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volumetric calculation of the mortuary cavity was precluded for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the base of the mortuary cavity is too deep for detection via GPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, excavations showed that the burial pits made the base of the mortuary cavity highly irregular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, calculations instead focused on (i) defining the areal extent of the mortuary cavity (AMC) via GPR, (ii) determining the number of individuals typically buried within the mortuary cavity beneath a single square meter of the platforms surface (ISQM) as revealed by excavation, and (iii) estimating the total number of people interred within the mortuary cavity (PMC) by solving the equation PMC = AMC(ISQM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPR data established AMC as 119.5 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excavation of a 4-m2 area within the perimeter of the mortuary cavity yielded numerous inhumations, for which bioarchaeological analysis provided two mechanisms for calculating ISQM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dividing the number of dentitions recovered (n = 20) by the area excavated in the central platform (4 m2) suggests a conservative ISQM of 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dividing the minimum number of individuals, or MNI, (n = 36) by the area excavated in the central platform (4 m2) suggests a more liberal ISQM of 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If PMC = AMC(ISQM), then the number of individuals buried within the Lothagam Norths mortuary cavity is estimated to range from 585 to 1,053.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range should itself be regarded as a minimum for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, excavations in N04E39 identified additional burials outside the depositional incisions detected via GPR, so there may be substantial numbers of people outside the mortuary cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, while we can exclude the possibility of a shallower base anywhere in the mortuary cavity (because higher bedrock surfaces would have come within the range of GPR detection), mortuary cavity deposits may be deeper in some areas than those observed during excavation; these would be even further outside the range of GPR detection and might accommodate a greater number of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Radiocarbon_Dating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight samples (three charcoal and five ostrich eggshell) were submitted to the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory at the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS), Prairie Research Institute, University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign between 2009 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific information on radiocarbon sample collection, preparation, analysis, and date calibration is provided in SI Appendix, Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bioarchaeological_Field_and_Laboratory_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recovery and documentation of human remains followed standard protocols for exposure, mapping, and documentation, with special considerations for high-heat/high-UV recovery situations, high density of burials, state of bone preservation, and future sampling for aDNA, isotope, dental calculus, and other research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed descriptions of these methods are given in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mineral_Identification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cataloging, classification, and preliminary identification of the bead assemblages from Lothagam North took place in August 2015 at the Turkana Basin Institute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full procedures are described in SI Appendix, Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
