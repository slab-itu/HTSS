Structural basis for antibody recognition of the NANP repeats in Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has been studied for decades as a potential immunogen, but little structural information is available on how antibodies recognize the immunodominant NANP repeats within CSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most advanced vaccine candidate is RTS,S, which includes multiple NANP repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we analyzed two functional antibodies from an RTS,S trial and determined the number of repeats that interact with the antibody Fab fragments using isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we also established how the antibody binds to the NANP repeat region in a recombinant CSP construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural features outlined here provide a rationale for structure-based immunogen design to improve upon the efficacy of the current RTS,S vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acquired resistance against antimalarial drugs has further increased the need for an effective malaria vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current leading candidate, RTS,S, is a recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum that contains 19 NANP repeats followed by a thrombospondin repeat domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although RTS,S has undergone extensive clinical testing and has progressed through phase III clinical trials, continued efforts are underway to enhance its efficacy and duration of protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we determined that two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 311 and 317), isolated from a recent controlled human malaria infection trial exploring a delayed fractional dose, inhibit parasite development in vivo by at least 97%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of antibody fragments (Fabs) 311 and 317 with an (NPNA)3 peptide illustrate their different binding modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, one and three of the three NPNA repeats adopt similar well-defined type I -turns with Fab311 and Fab317, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to explore antibody binding in the context of P. falciparum CSP, we used negative-stain electron microscopy on a recombinant shortened CSP (rsCSP) construct saturated with Fabs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both complexes display a compact rsCSP with multiple Fabs bound, with the rsCSPFab311 complex forming a highly organized helical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these structural insights may aid in the design of a next-generation malaria vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In_Vivo_Evaluation_of_Protection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were administered mAbs 311 and 317 at a dose of 100 and 300 g, respectively, and then were challenged 510 min later with P. berghei that was engineered to express full-length CSP from the P. falciparum 3D7 strain (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasite liver load was assessed in the mice at 40 h postchallenge by qPCR for P. berghei-specific 18S rRNA (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mAbs 311 and 317 inhibited parasite development by at least 97% (97.2% and 99.7%, respectively) (Fig 1), compared with only 7582% inhibition for a previously reported anti-NANP antibody, 2A10 (300 g dose) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mAbs 311 and 317 represent functional antibodies that are associated with strong protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Epitope_Mapping_for_Fab_Fragments_of_317_and_311_mAbs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the minimal NANP repeat sequence for binding, a customized peptide array (PepSpot) was designed that contains a series of truncated peptides derived from a 24-mer (NANP)6 peptide, which were spot-synthesized onto a cellulose membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fab311 and Fab317 bind strongly to 10 or more amino acids regardless of the truncation approach, suggesting that a minimum epitope for strong binding consists of around 2.5 NANP repeats (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional weak spots for Fab311 indicate it can still bind shorter peptides, down to 1.5 NANP repeats (Fig 2), whereas Fab317 requires a minimum of two NANP repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore selected a 12-mer Ac-NPNANPNANPNA-NH2 peptide, (NPNA)3, for structural and binding studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Peptide_Affinity_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The (NPNA)3 peptides bind strongly to the antibodies with Kds of 305 ± 60 nM for Fab311 and 78 ± 16 nM for Fab317 (Table 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the minimal epitope for optimal binding, binding affinities for an (NPNA)2 peptide were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kd for (NPNA)2 binding to Fab311 (296 ± 19 nM) is almost identical to that of the (NPNA)3 peptide, whereas the Kd for (NPNA)2 binding to Fab317 increased 2.2-fold (173 ± 8 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NVDP repeats were not present in the RTS,S vaccine, we decided to test whether such a sequence could be accommodated by the antibodies, because they are present in the wild-type CSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fab311 has approximately fivefold lower affinity for peptides Ac-NPNVDPNANPNV-NH2 and Ac-DPNANPNVDPNA-NH2 (Kds of 1.79 ± 0.19 M and 1.37 ± 0.39 M, respectively), whereas Fab317 bound to these same peptides with substantially lower (Kd of 12.09 ± 2.49 M) and fourfold higher (Kd of 0.45 ± 0.07 M) affinity, respectively (Table 1 and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystal_Structures_of_Fab311_and_Fab317_in_Complex_with_the_(NPNA)3_Peptide  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fab311 and Fab317 crystals with the (NPNA)3 peptide diffracted to 2.1 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fab311peptide crystallized in space group P212121 with a single complex in the crystal asymmetric unit (asu), whereas Fab317peptide crystallized in space group P21 with two complexes in the asu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fabs were numbered with the Kabat system, and the (NPNA)3 peptides were numbered from 2 to 13, with the N-terminal acetyl group and C-terminal NH2 group being assigned as residues 1 and 14, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electron density for the peptides in both complexes is generally well defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (NPNA)3 peptide forms largely extended structures in both antibody-binding sites with kinks in the peptide that arise from defined secondary structures (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dihedral angle analysis shows that type I -turns (residues i to i + 3) are found for the NPNA repeats, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the first Asn side chain (residue i) to the backbone amide of the next Asn (i + 2) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal NPNA repeats of both peptides adopt type I -turns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this cadence of type I -turns continues in the Fab317-bound peptide, the Fab311-bound peptide maintains a more extended structure for the second and third NPNA repeats, both of which deviate from canonical type I -turns (Fig 4 B and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of 2Fo-Fc maps contoured at 2.0 and 0.8 (Fig 4 A and D) reveals that the electron density for the peptide bound to Fab311 is weaker after Ala9 and absent for the C-terminal Ala13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the (NPNA)3 peptide bound to Fab317 is well defined for all peptide residues except Ala13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The peptide interaction with the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops is very different in each structure, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fab311, the peptide resides in a groove that runs parallel to the heavy and light chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide N-terminal region is located between CDR H2 and CDR L3, and the peptide then threads between CDR H2, CDR H3, and CDR H1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fab311 CDR H3 (12 residues) helps form the groove in which the peptide resides (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heavy chain contributes 80.2% of the buried surface area (BSA) (574 Å2 on the Fab and 520 Å2 on the peptide) from CDR H1 (17.4%), H2 (30.5%), and H3 (32.3%), while the light chain contributes only 19.3%, mainly CDR L3 (17.3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 0.5% is contributed by a heavy-chain framework residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fab317, the peptide binds in a more perpendicular mode compared with Fab311 and occupies a relatively shallow binding pocket that initially starts between the light and heavy chains and then bends sharply and traverses from the light to the heavy chain (Fig 3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heavy chain contributes 58.2% of the BSA from CDR H1 (5.4%), H2 (21.7%), and H3 (31.1%), while the light chain contributes 39.3% from CDR L1 (10.9%), L2 (7.7%), and L3 (20.7%), with the remaining 2.5% from a light-chain framework residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BSAs on Fab317 and (NPNA)3 peptide are 533 Å2 and 580 Å2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CDR H3 and CDR L3 contribute 30% and 20%, respectively, of the BSA for both Fab311 and Fab317, differences in the binding mode arise mainly from different interactions with light- and heavy-chain CDR1 and CDR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrogen-bonding networks and amino acid BSAs highlight additional differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the hydrogen bonds between Fab311 and peptide are made with the C-terminal half of the peptide (Table S2), although its N-terminal region (Pro3, Asn4, and Ala5) engages Fab311 through a hydrogen-bonding network that includes four interfacial water molecules (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Pro3 and Pro7 of the (NPNA)3 peptide are buried in the Fab311 paratope groove with BSAs of 76 Å2 and 75 Å2, respectively, and engage in CH/ interactions with Phe58H and Trp52H (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide-binding site on Fab317 does not contain any observable interfacial water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen-bonding partners with Fab317 are evenly distributed throughout the peptide (Asn4, Asn6, Ala9, Pro11, and Asn12) (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Pro3 and Pro7 have small BSAs of 22 Å2 and 10 Å2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pro11 has a larger BSA of 78 Å2, compared with only 7 Å2 in the Fab311peptide complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

nsEM_of_CSP_with_Protective_Antibodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-particle nsEM was then utilized to visualize the stoichiometry and overall molecular organization of the CSPFab complexes using an engineered recombinant version of CSP with a reduced number of NANP/NVDP repeats [hereafter, recombinant shortened CSP (rsCSP): 19/3 repeats instead of 38/4 for the P. falciparum 3D7 strain].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual inspection of the 2D class averages for the Fab311rsCSP complex indicate a binding stoichiometry of five or more per rsCSP molecule (Fig 5A), while in Fab317rsCSP up to five Fabs are bound (Fig 5D and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further 3D classification and refinement of the Fab311rsCSP complex data using C1 symmetry revealed up to nine Fabs bound per rsCSP molecule (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at lower threshold values of the negative-stain map, additional Fab densities became visible (threshold values of 0.274, 0.223, and 0.179 reveal five, eight, and nine Fabs per complex, respectively), perhaps as a result of substoichiometric complexes that were averaged with the rest of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Docking the Fab311(NPNA)3 crystal structures into the EM density map shows that the peptides and, by extension, rsCSP adopt an extended, left-handed, helical conformation with a fitted radius of 15 Å when bound to this antibody (Fig 5C and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ala9 and Asn2 C atoms in the crystal structure of two adjacent (NPNA)3 peptides are, on average, 13 ± 2 Å apart when fitted into the EM reconstruction, and about five peptides complete one turn around the helical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we observe two full turns that comprise a distance of 97 Å between the N termini of the first and last peptides in the helical structure (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there is little or no density in the map that would correspond to the N- or C-terminal domains of the rsCSP, which may be the result of intrinsic disorder or flexibility relative to the ordered NANPFabbound repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Fab317rsCSP complex had fewer Fabs bound, and therefore a smaller portion of the structure was resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 2D classification demonstrates up to five Fabs bound, the 3D refinement converged to three Fabs bound per rsCSP, which may be attributable to various stoichiometries, as seen in the class averages (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Fab311rsCSP, the Fabs in the Fab317rsCSP complex are in very close proximity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in overall shape between the two complexes indicate some plasticity of rsCSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not know whether its conformation is influenced by Fab binding, as the unliganded CSP structure is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Minimal_Epitope_for_Binding_Consists_of_Two_or_Three_NPNA_Repeats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The buried surface areas for the (NPNA)3 peptides bound to Fab311 and Fab317 indicate that all residues are engaged in Fab contacts except for Ala13 with Fab311 (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the main epitope of the Fab311-bound peptide is likely smaller than three NPNA repeats, as the last four residues have much weaker electron density and are likely more disordered (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PepSpot epitope and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) affinity measurements (Fig 2 and Table 1) confirm the hypothesis that the minimum epitope for optimal binding is two and three NPNA units for Fab311 and Fab317, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a previous study in which (NANP)3 peptides were able to efficiently inhibit binding of anti-NANP mAbs to P. falciparum sporozoites (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NPNA_Repeats_Can_Adopt_Type_I_-Turns_in_Solution_and_in_Complex_with_Antibody  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies on the NANP repeats focused on the unbound state using NMR spectroscopy (26) and X-ray crystallography (27) in which the NPNA units (residues i to i + 3) within NANP peptides of different lengths were in a dynamic equilibrium between a disordered state and an ordered type I -turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly populated type I -turn is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the side-chain of Asn (residue i) and the backbone amide of the next Asn (residue i + 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our crystal structures reveal that the bound peptides also adopt NPNA type I -turns (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, peptides bound to Fab311 and Fab317 both have their N-terminal NPNA repeat in a canonical type I -turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fab317-bound peptide continues to display type I -turns in a NPNA-like cadence, whereas the additional NPNA repeats in the Fab311-bound peptide have dihedral angles that deviate from a canonical type I -turn (Fig 4 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the dihedral angles for each NPNA repeat in our peptide to the ANPNA crystal structure (27) establishes that the type I -turns in our Fab-bound peptides are nearly identical in conformation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide structures bound to Fabs also agree with NMR solution experiments that the CSP repeat region follows a cadence of NPNA repeats with each repeat having a high probability of forming a type I -turn (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the central NPNA repeat in the peptide bound to Fab311 does not form a canonical type I -turn, the Asn6 side chain still hydrogen bonds to the Asn8 backbone amide (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the relative orientation of this central NPNA repeat to the heavy-chain variable CDR loops is similar to that of the third NPNA repeat in the Fab317-bound peptide, which is expected since their heavy-chain germline genes are closely related (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a high Pearson correlation coefficient between the BSAs of the backbone and side-chain atoms for the second NPNA repeat of the Fab311 (NPNA)3 peptide with the third NPNA unit of the Fab317 (NPNA)3 peptide indicates a striking similarity in their binding mode (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are corroborated by similar hydrogen-bond networks for these residues, although the donor/acceptor residues on the Fab fragment are different (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elicitation of these antibodies may have originated by recognition of a single type I -turn from which the antibodies independently evolved to increase the number of contacts and thus their affinity for the peptide repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_CSP_Antigen_Adopts_a_Collapsed_Conformation_in_Its_Antibody-Bound_Form  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, the handful of studies that have attempted to elucidate the structure of full-length CSP, suggest that CSP exists in two conformations: open and collapsed (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSP is speculated to be present in the collapsed form on the sporozoite surface during migration to the liver and in the open form when it fully extends to engage the host cell receptor for entry (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, determining the structure of full-length CSP has been challenging, which is not surprising since 75% of the CSP sequence, including the entire central NANP repeat region and part of the N-terminal domain, is predicted to be disordered (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we were able to obtain high-quality nsEM images for rsCSP saturated with Fab311 or Fab317.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the proposed intrinsic disorder of free CSP, both complexes display a collapsed state of the antigen with closely apposed Fabs observed in the EM projection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rsCSPFab311 complex, in particular, adopts a large supramolecular structure that appears to form a spiral with the Fabs radiating tangentially from the surface of the CSP repeats (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many questions remain as to whether this same structure is formed on the sporozoite surface or whether antibodies help induce this particular conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C termini of the heavy chains of Fab311 are 90 Å apart (Fig 5B), suggesting that an individual IgG is capable of binding to two adjacent epitopes within a single rsCSP antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, given the avidity effects of having two antigen-binding modules (Fabs) per antibody, antibodies may be able to crosslink CSP molecules on the sporozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, transition between CSP topologies may be important for the infectious lifecycle of malaria, and therefore the antibodies described here and others may be useful probes to further understand its mechanism of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Epitope_Identification_and_Binding_Stoichiometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nsEM reconstructions indicate that up to nine copies of Fab311 are present on rsCSP, compared with only five for Fab317.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our epitope-mapping experiments, the crystal structure of the Fab311peptide complex, and ITC affinity measurements, we established that the minimum Fab311 epitope consists of two NPNA repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the total number of NANP repeats in rsCSP is 19 with three interspersed NVDP repeats, that leaves a stretch of 16 NANP repeats or eight epitopes available for binding, which is slightly less than the nine Fabs that we observe in the nsEM map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two possible explanations for these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Fab311 can also bind with reasonable affinity to at least one of the NVDP repeats on CSP even though these sequences are not present on the RTS,S vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these NVDP repeats were fully available for antibody binding, the number of potential epitopes could increase to 11 [(19 NANP + 3 NVDP)/2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second possibility is that Fab311 can bind with reasonable affinity to single NANP repeats that are flanked by NVDP repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the binding differences observed in the nsEM reconstructions between the antibodies, we performed ITC experiments to measure the binding of Fab311 and Fab317 to peptides that contained both NANP and NVDP repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affinity measurements confirm that Fab311 has a reasonable affinity for the NVDP region, with Kds of 1.37 and 1.79 M for the Ac-DPNANPNVDPNA-NH2 and Ac-NPNVDPNANPNV-NH2 peptides, respectively, compared with 0.45 and 12.09 M for Fab317.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Fab317 is able to bind the peptide tightly when the NVDP repeat is downstream from an NANP repeat, binding is abrogated when the order is reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the different binding stoichiometry for Fab311 and Fab317 can more likely be rationalized by the preferred minimum Fab317 epitope consisting of about three NPNA repeats and probably no binding to the NVDP repeat region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, approximately five [(19 NANP  3 NANP)/3] binding sites are available, which is exactly what we observe with nsEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_Vaccine_Efforts_and_Injectable_Biologics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our crystal structures show both similarities and differences in the way the same peptide is recognized by the two antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibodies recognize the NPNA repeats as well-defined -turns, modified turns, or as more extended structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, nsEM reconstructions show that the NANP repeat region can be further stabilized by antibody interactions in the context of the rsCSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide exciting opportunities for structure-assisted immunogen design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since NMR data suggest that these type I -turn conformations represent a major population of the NPNA repeats in solution, and since we observe NPNA type I -turns in peptides bound to highly protective antibodies, stabilizing these secondary structure elements in next-generation CSP immunogens may elicit an improved antibody response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, attempts to stabilize type I -turns in the NANP repeat go back to 1990 with covalent hydrogen-bond mimics (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five years later, the NPNA type I -turn conformation was stabilized in solution by replacing proline with (S)--methylproline (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both approaches elicited polyclonal antisera in rabbits against the designed/synthetized peptides that recognized intact sporozoites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that rational NANP-based immunogen design may start at the level of stabilizing the NPNA type I -turns and gradually build in more complexity to mimic the superstructure of the repeat units that we observe by nsEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, efforts are underway to determine if mAbs themselves can be used as interventions to prevent malaria parasite infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this goal, the mAbs will need to be optimized to achieve protection at the lowest possible serum concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures presented here provide a good starting point for further mAb engineering and for identifying mAbs with improved binding characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a single sporozoite is covered with hundreds of CSP molecules, which are continually shed (32), it is beneficial to use as little antibody as possible per sporozoite to target all sporozoites that enter the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, Fab317 would appear to be the more promising of the two antibodies in that regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will assess whether other epitopes are available for both immunogen design and for antibody parsimony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
