Stimuli-responsive clustered nanoparticles for improved tumor penetration and therapeutic efficacy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Successively overcoming a series of biological barriers that cancer nanotherapeutics would encounter upon intravenous administration is required for achieving positive treatment outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hurdle to this goal is the inherently unfavorable tumor penetration of nanoparticles due to their relatively large sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a stimuli-responsive clustered nanoparticle (iCluster) and justified that its adaptive alterations of physicochemical properties (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  size, zeta potential, and drug release rate) in accordance with the endogenous stimuli of the tumor microenvironment made possible the ultimate overcoming of these barriers, especially the bottleneck of tumor penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results in varying intractable tumor models demonstrated significantly improved antitumor efficacy of iCluster than its control groups, demonstrating that overcoming these delivery barriers can be achieved by innovative nanoparticle design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A principal goal of cancer nanomedicine is to deliver therapeutics effectively to cancer cells within solid tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are a series of biological barriers that impede nanomedicine from reaching target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a stimuli-responsive clustered nanoparticle to systematically overcome these multiple barriers by sequentially responding to the endogenous attributes of the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smart polymeric clustered nanoparticle (iCluster) has an initial size of 100 nm, which is favorable for long blood circulation and high propensity of extravasation through tumor vascular fenestrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once iCluster accumulates at tumor sites, the intrinsic tumor extracellular acidity would trigger the discharge of platinum prodrug-conjugated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (diameter 5 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a structural alteration greatly facilitates tumor penetration and cell internalization of the therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internalized dendrimer prodrugs are further reduced intracellularly to release cisplatin to kill cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superior in vivo antitumor activities of iCluster are validated in varying intractable tumor models including poorly permeable pancreatic cancer, drug-resistant cancer, and metastatic cancer, demonstrating its versatility and broad applicability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Preparation_and_Characterization_of_the_Clustered_Nanoparticles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prepare the clustered nanoparticles, the polymer components PCL, PEG-b-PCL, and PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt were synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures and molecular weights of PEG-b-PCL and PCL were characterized (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt synthesis, PCL was first reacted with 2-propionic-3-methylmaleic anhydride (CDM) to produce PCL-CDM (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Pt prodrug c,c,t-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OH)(O2CCH2CH2CO2H)] was conjugated to PAMAM to afford PAMAM/Pt, which was further coupled to PCL-CDM through the reaction of the amino groups of PAMAM with the CDM anhydride residue (SI Appendix, Scheme S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant amide bond is acid labile (38) and will be cleaved at pHe to release PAMAM at tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Pt-containing pH-instable clustered nanoparticle (iCluster/Pt) was prepared from coassembly of PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt, PEG-b-PCL, and PCL by nanoprecipitation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weight ratio of PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt:PEG-b-PCL:PCL was optimized as 1:1:1 based on size and size distribution (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the diameter of iCluster/Pt was around 104.1 nm (Fig 1C), which was consistent with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM images showed clearly that iCluster/Pt had a raspberry-like structure, presumably due to the presence of PAMAM dendrimers surrounding the hydrophobic core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each iCluster/Pt contained 108 PAMAM and 719 platinum drugs, as estimated by static light scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we prepared a pH-stable clustered nanoparticle (Cluster/Pt) by replacing PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt with its nonresponsive counterpart PCL-PAMAM/Pt (SI Appendix, Scheme S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Cluster/Pt contained 90 PAMAM and 573 platinum drugs and showed similar morphology, size, and zeta potential as iCluster/Pt (Fig 1 E and F and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One key design of iCluster/Pt is its sensitivity to biological stimuli such as the acidic pHe and elevated intracellular redox milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test its response to pHe, we incubated iCluster/Pt in a tumor-acidity mimic phosphate buffer (PB) solution at pH 6.8 over predetermined time and observed its morphological evolution under TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 4-h incubation, the raspberry-like morphology of iCluster/Pt was partially deformed and small particles appeared in the solution (Fig 1D, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an additional incubation for 24 h, the raspberry structure was almost completely disintegrated (Fig 1D, Right and SI Appendix, Fig S5) and changed to a smooth surface that was analogous to nanoparticles formed by PEG-PCL and PCL (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, plenty of small nanoparticles were observed in the surroundings, with size comparable to PAMAM (SI Appendix, Fig S6B), suggesting that small PAMAM dendrimers were released upon cleavage of the amide bond at pH 6.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Cluster/Pt maintained its initial morphology and size under identical conditions (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to monitor and compare the release kinetics of PAMAM from fluorescein (Flu)-labeled clustered nanoparticles (iClusterFlu and ClusterFlu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pH 7.4, iClusterFlu could generally maintain its stability with 12% PAMAM release after a 4-h incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, incubation at pH 6.8 resulted in 60% cumulative release by another 4 h (Fig 1G) and 90% release by 24 h (SI Appendix, Fig S6C), indicating much faster release of PAMAM at acidic pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ClusterFlu showed minimal release at either pH 7.4 or 6.8 (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanoparticles are designed to release cisplatin specifically in the redox environment (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the release of cisplatin, we incubated the nanoparticles in PB solutions (pH 7.4 and 6.8), and ascorbic acid solution (5 mM, pH 7.4), an intracellular redox environment mimic solution (40), respectively, and quantified Pt drug release via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both nanoparticles showed minimal drug release in PB solutions regardless of pH, but rapid release in the redox environment (Fig 1 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood plasma showed minimal effect on the stability and pH responsiveness of iCluster (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Penetration_and_Cell_Apoptosis_in_Multicellular_Spheroids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chose multicellular spheroids (MCSs) derived from BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells as an in vitro tumor model to evaluate the penetration and cell killing efficacy of the clustered nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with single-layer adherent cells, MCSs have been proposed as a versatile 3D model to study tumor biology and to screen therapeutic agents (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iCluster and Cluster were dual labeled with two dyes (denoted as RhBiClusterFlu and RhBClusterFlu), in which PAMAM was labeled with fluorescein (Flu, green), whereas the PCL component of the hydrophobic core was labeled with rhodamine B (RhB, red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCSs were incubated with RhBiClusterFlu or RhBClusterFlu for 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h at pH 6.8, then washed and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RhBiClusterFlu treatment, the red fluorescence from the hydrophobic core attached to the periphery of MCSs, and no noticeable fluorescence was detected in the internal area by 24 h. Instead, the green signals from PAMAM inside MCSs clearly increased over time, demonstrating the improved penetration of PAMAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, both red and green fluorescence signals from nonresponsive RhBClusterFlu were on the peripheral region of the MCSs by 24 h, revealing limited penetration of larger particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis indicated that more than 10-fold higher green fluorescence was detected in RhBiClusterFlu-treated MCSs than in RhBClusterFlu-treated ones (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide clear evidence that the size-changeable iCluster has better tumor penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, cell internalization of both nanoparticles was studied by flow cytometry (FACS) and ICP-MS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FACS analysis, MCSs were treated with iClusterFlu, ClusterFlu, or PAMAMFlu at pH 6.8 for 4 h and 24 h. Compared with ClusterFlu treatment, the population of positive cells treated with iClusterFlu was 1.7-fold higher and 3-fold higher at 4 h (P less_than 0.05) and 24 h (P less_than 0.001), respectively (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ICP-MS analysis, Fig 2D shows that iCluster/Pt treatment resulted in significantly higher intracellular accumulation of Pt than Cluster/Pt treatment (2.6-fold, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DNA of MCS cells were isolated after a 24-h incubation, and the amount of Pt binding to these DNA in MCS cells receiving iCluster/Pt treatment was significantly higher than that receiving Cluster/Pt treatment (3.6-fold, P less_than 0.001, Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apoptosis results indicated that iCluster/Pt treatment showed 38.6% total cell apoptosis, which was significantly higher than Cluster/Pt treatment (14.3%, P less_than 0.001, Fig 2F and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in all experiments, iCluster treatment showed comparable efficacy to PAMAM treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antitumor_Activity_and_Tumor_Penetration_in_a_BxPC-3_Pancreatic_Tumor_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The superior performance of iCluster/Pt in MCSs further compelled us to study its in vivo activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first studied the pharmacokinetic profiles of the clustered nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, both iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt exhibited prolonged half-life time (T1/2  greater than  10 h) in the bloodstream compared with PAMAM/Pt and cisplatin, which is reasonable because iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt are PEGylated nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other pharmacokinetic parameters also revealed better performance of the two PEGylated nanoparticles (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we studied the antitumor activity of iCluster/Pt in nude mice bearing BxPC-3 human pancreatic tumors, which is recognized as a notoriously poorly permeable and intractable tumor model (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, free cisplatin and PAMAM/Pt displayed modest therapeutic efficacy, with 38% and 45% tumor inhibition versus PBS control, whereas Cluster/Pt showed 57% tumor inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, iCluster/Pt exhibited significant suppression of tumor growth, reaching 88% tumor suppression (P less_than 0.001, versus Cluster/Pt treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average weight of the tumor mass excised at the end of treatment also demonstrated the same trend (SI Appendix, Fig S11A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end (TUNEL) staining, also indicated that iCluster/Pt treatment markedly reduced proliferative cells while increasing apoptotic cells (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate dose effect of iCluster/Pt on the inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors, a separate set of in vivo studies with injection dose varying from 1.5 to 6.0 mg/kg was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3C, compared with PBS control, all of the iCluster/Pt treatments showed dramatic tumor growth suppression, with inhibition rate of 71%, 92%, and 107% for the dose of 1.5, 4.5, and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that tumor shrinkage was observed for the 6.0 mg/kg treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slight weight loss was observed for mice receiving free cisplatin and the 6.0 mg/kg treatments, whereas no obvious weight loss from other treatments was observed (SI Appendix, Fig S11 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, tissue staining and blood tests revealed that the clustered nanoparticles did not cause detectable toxicities to the mice (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 and S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distribution of the Pt drug in other major organs was not significantly different between iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt treatments (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, iCluster/Pt was able to significantly enhance Pt drug accumulation in tumor tissues compared with other treatments, with 2-fold higher drug concentration than Cluster/Pt (P less_than 0.01 for 12 h, and P less_than 0.05 for 24 h) and at least 7-fold higher than free cisplatin and PAMAM/Pt (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To get more details, we digested the tumor mass into individual cells and quantified Pt content in these cells by ICP-MS. iCluster/Pt showed two to three times higher internalization of Pt than Cluster/Pt (P less_than 0.05 for 12 h and P less_than 0.001 for 24 h; Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further distinguish tumor cells from other stromal cells in the heterogeneous tumor tissue, we established tumor models by subcutaneously injecting green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing BxPC-3 cells in nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injecting these drug-containing formulations, GFP-positive tumor cells were isolated and sorted by FACS and subjected to ICP-MS to determine Pt content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these GFP-positive tumor cells, iCluster/Pt still showed significantly higher Pt content than Cluster/Pt at 12 h (2.7-fold, P less_than 0.05) and 24 h (3-fold, P less_than 0.001) (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt have similar size, surface property, and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced deposit of iCluster/Pt in tumor tissues and tumor cells is presumed to be associated with its superior tumor penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test our hypothesis, we used immunofluorescence staining and real-time CLSM observation to study the intratumoral microdistribution of RhBiClusterFlu and RhBClusterFlu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the immunofluorescence staining study, for RhBiClusterFlu treatment, the green fluorescence from PAMAM showed a uniform perfusion in the tumor interstitium, whereas the red fluorescence was highly colocalized with the blood vessels (yellow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that RhBiClusterFlu can release PAMAM at tumor sites and the released PAMAM enables efficient extravasation and penetration into deep tumor space, whereas the larger residual nanoparticles are mainly restricted in the blood vessels or the peripheral areas (Fig 4A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the nonresponsive RhBClusterFlu, both green and red signals were colocalized with the blood vessels, indicating its inability to diffuse into tumor space (Fig 4A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative analysis of overlap coefficient of red and yellow, as well as green and yellow also showed the same trend (SI Appendix, Fig S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results substantiate previous observations that smaller nanoparticles are more advantageous for deep tumor penetration than larger ones because of their reduced diffusional hindrance (23, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further visualize real-time extravasation and tumor penetration of these nanoparticles, intravital CLSM was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RhBiClusterFlu injection (Fig 4B), strong green and red fluorescence signals were confined in the blood vessels at 10 min postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 90 min, the green fluorescence in the blood vessels weakened, whereas more green signals extravasated from the blood vessels and distributed dispersedly in the surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the red fluorescence still remained within the blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the fluorescence, we normalized the fluorescence intensity of each color to its initial intensity at 10 min to afford the time and penetration depth-dependent profiles (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 90 min postinjection, nearly 50% of the original intensity of green fluorescence from PAMAM could be detected until 70 m from the blood vessels, whereas red signals from the larger residual nanoparticles were not detectable beyond the blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend became even more evident by 240 min postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green fluorescence inside blood vessels diminished markedly while spreading more uniformly in the tumor interstitial space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative data showed that 25% of the original intensity was still detectable at 160 m from the blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red fluorescence inside the blood vessels weakened as well, but no red fluorescence was observed beyond the vascular wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both the green and red signals from the RhBClusterFlu were confined to the blood vessels over 240 min, suggesting poor tumor penetration of large RhBClusterFlu nanoparticles (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antitumor_Activity_in_Drug-Resistant_and_Metastatic_Tumor_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the broad applicability of iCluster/Pt in cancer chemotherapy, we further investigated its antitumor activities in cisplatin-resistant A549R human lung cancer and 4T1 metastatic murine breast cancer models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the A549R model, different formulations showed remarkable differences in antitumor activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PBS control, free cisplatin exhibited minimal tumor growth inhibition (only 10% inhibition), whereas PAMAM/Pt showed a slightly better effect (20% inhibition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the long-circulating Cluster/Pt showed considerable enhancement in tumor growth inhibition (60% inhibition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the most effective antitumor effect was achieved by iCluster/Pt treatment, reaching 95% inhibition (Fig 5A, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the significance between iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt appeared as early as day 9 postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No obvious body weight loss was observed for the nanoparticle formulations (SI Appendix, Fig S18), and histological staining also confirmed the improved therapeutic effect of iCluster/Pt, showing reduction in proliferation while increasing the apoptosis of tumor cells (SI Appendix, Fig S19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further extend the applicability of our strategy to combat metastatic cancer, we established a highly invasive and metastatic 4T1 orthotopic tumor model, which is known to be more aggressive and more refractory to chemotherapy than a s.c. tumor model (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were treated with varying Pt-containing formulations, and their survival curves were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PBS and blank iCluster control groups, all other treatments showed improved median survival time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the iCluster/Pt treatment improved survival time by 74.2%, with significantly longer time to end point than that of Cluster/Pt (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of intratumoral microdistribution of RhBiClusterFlu and RhBClusterFlu in A549R and 4T1 tumor tissues also demonstrated that iCluster showed much better tumor penetration than Cluster because of their pHe-activated PAMAM release at the tumor site (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20 and S21), once again indicating that the improved antitumor activities of iCluster are highly associated with enhanced tumor penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the fact that nanoparticle-based therapeutics are amenable to preferential accumulation in solid tumors by taking advantage of the EPR effect, they encounter a series of sequential biological barriers upon i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration, which severely impede the achievement of optimal therapeutic outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To adequately address these barriers and achieve effective therapy, nanoparticles must be rationally designed to overcome substantial interstitial transport hindrance brought about by their inherently large sizes to realize deep and uniform tumor penetration (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, our iCluster system enables its basic physicochemical properties to adaptively change in response to the endogenous stimuli of the tumor microenvironment to accomplish improved therapeutic efficacy by successively increasing blood circulation and tumor vascular extravasation, improving tumor penetration, facilitating cell internalization, and accelerating intracellular drug release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate that the decisive step for the effectiveness of iCluster is its robust tumor penetration achieved through pHe-triggered shattering of small PAMAM dendrimers at tumor sites (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been validated that the penetration of nanoparticles in tumor space relies heavily on particle size, with the consensus that smaller particles have improved tissue penetration (26, 33, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such progress has recently inspired interest in developing size-shrinkable anticancer drug delivery systems (15, 34, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previous studies, our strategy has several unique features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, previous delivery systems simply focused on size-shrinkage medicated tumor penetration, whereas our system is devised to systematically overcome a series of barriers including tumor penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving this goal is vitally important because these barriers are interconnected, and simply overcoming one individual barrier is not adequate to produce proper therapeutic outcomes (42, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the stimuli that were used to trigger size shrinkage previously were either by enzyme or UV light, whose applicability, to a certain extent, would be restricted to only a subset of cancer types owing to either the heterogeneous expression levels of target enzymes in a specific cancer type or the superficial penetration depth of UV light (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we used acidic extracellular pH, a more general hallmark of the microenvironment of most solid tumors (36, 48), as the stimulus to activate the release of small particles at tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endows our strategy with much broader specificity and applicability, which has been partially justified by the superior antitumor activities in multiple tumor models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, it should be noted that it is the postshrinkage size rather than the property of size shrinkage that is the pivotal determinant of therapeutic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly important for treating poorly permeable solid tumors, because only the sub30-nm micelles could penetrate the poorly permeable pancreatic tumors to achieve an antitumor effect (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For previous systems, their final sizes after shrinkage were still as large as 4070 nm (34, 45, 46), which is likely to offset the usefulness of size shrinkage for treating poorly permeable tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, the released small PAMAM dendrimer prodrugs have a size of around 5 nm, which is highly potent in penetrating the intractable tumors to reach cancer cells that are far away from the blood vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, our design strategy may open up a new avenue for the creation of the next generation of nanotherapeutics, representing a paradigm shift in nanoparticle-based drug delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
