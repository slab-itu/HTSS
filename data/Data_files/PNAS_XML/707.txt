Inducing protein aggregation by extensional flow  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins are inherently sensitive to environmental factors that include hydrodynamic flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow-induced protein remodeling is used in vivo and can also trigger the aggregation of therapeutic proteins during manufacture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the relative importance of shear and extensional hydrodynamic flow fields to aggregation remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we develop a flow device that subjects proteins to a defined and quantified flow field that is dominated by extensional flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that extensional flow is crucial to induce the aggregation of globular proteins and that flow-induced aggregation is dependent on both protein structure and sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations rationalize the diverse effects of hydrodynamic flow on protein structure and aggregation propensity seen in both Nature and in protein manufacture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Relative to other extrinsic factors, the effects of hydrodynamic flow fields on protein stability and conformation remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow-induced protein remodeling and/or aggregation is observed both in Nature and during the large-scale industrial manufacture of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its ubiquity, the relationships between the type and magnitude of hydrodynamic flow, a proteins structure and stability, and the resultant aggregation propensity are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we assess the effects of a defined and quantified flow field dominated by extensional flow on the aggregation of BSA, 2-microglobulin (2m), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the device induces protein aggregation after exposure to an extensional flow field for 0.361.8 ms, at concentrations as low as 0.5 mg mL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we reveal that the extent of aggregation depends on the applied strain rate and the concentration, structural scaffold, and sequence of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally we demonstrate the in situ labeling of a buried cysteine residue in BSA during extensional stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that an extensional flow readily unfolds thermodynamically and kinetically stable proteins, exposing previously sequestered sequences whose aggregation propensity determines the probability and extent of aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Design_and_Computational_Characterization_of_Extensional_Flow_Device  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extensional flow can be generated by methods including a cross-slot (2325), a four-mill-roller (11), opposed jets (26), or by introduction of a constriction in a pipe while maintaining laminar flow conditions (18, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplicity of the latter method led to the design of a reciprocating flow device driven by a linear actuator comprising two gas-tight 1-mL syringes (bore diameter 4.61 mm) connected via a glass capillary (75 mm long, inner diameter 0.3 mm) using compression fittings (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid reduction in tube diameter at the square-edged constriction (15:1) produces a 238-fold increase in linear velocity at each syringe:capillary connection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CFD was then used to characterize the type, magnitude, and timescale of the hydrodynamic forces generated by this device (Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D axisymmetric domain used to represent the physical flow device is shown in Fig 1D, together with the contraction geometry from which it is derived (note: only one contraction was modeled).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the velocity and strain rate experienced by the fluid depends on its initial radial position, the centerline strain-rate values are reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a plunger speed of 8 mm s1, CFD analysis (Fig 1 D, iiiv and SI Appendix, Fig S1) shows that distal to the constriction, the mean flow velocity is constant (8 mm s1 and 1.9 m s1 at the extremity of each pipe), but increases rapidly (i.e., accelerates) over 2 mm in the vicinity of the constriction (blue line, Fig 1 D, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that as a protein transits a constriction, it will experience high strain effects due to hydrodynamic extensional flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions the residence time of a particle within the syringe barrels, the capillary, and the constriction is 5, 40 × 103, and 18 × 106 s (SI Appendix, Fig S1B), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeating CFD using the same geometry but at various inlet velocities (i.e., the velocity at which the plunger moves down the syringe barrel) revealed that the length of the extensional region is independent of the plunger velocity, but that the maximum strain rate (along the centerline) is directly dependent on plunger velocity (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the exposure time of fluid to the high strain regime decreases exponentially with plunger velocity (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the flow exponent for this device was calculated as n = 0.905 (SI Appendix), which is consistent with a dominant laminar flow regime across the contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, as the geometry of the device is fixed throughout this study, we report the plunger velocity and number of passes, allowing recovery of the fundamental fluid mechanical parameters by reference to SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Defined_Flow_Fields_Can_Aggregate_BSA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The all-helical, 583-residue protein BSA (Fig 2A) was used for our initial studies as it has well-characterized intrinsic aggregation pathways (2830) and its behavior under shear and extensional flow fields has been investigated previously (11, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether our extensional flow device can induce protein aggregation, 500 L gel-filtered monodisperse BSA (Methods) at a concentration of 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg mL1 was passed through the capillary 500, 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 times at a plunger velocity of 8 mm s1 (equivalent to total exposure times to extensional flow of 9, 18, 27, and 36 ms, respectively, at fixed centerline strain- (11,750 s1) and shear- (52,000 s1) rates (Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of soluble protein was then quantified after ultracentrifugation (Fig 2B) and any aggregates present in the unclarified sample visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that the designed device can induce protein aggregation, with the amount of insoluble material increasing with increasing pass number in a protein-concentration-dependent manner (Fig 2B, black to magenta bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM images (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S2) revealed that the aggregates which form as a result of extensional flow are amorphous in nature and show greater compaction and demarcation with increasing pass number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our extensional flow device comprises two constrictions connected by a capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the observed aggregation could be induced, at least in part, by the shear flow present in the glass connector capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, 5 mg mL1 BSA was subjected to 1,000 or 100 passes at 8 and 16 mm s1, respectively, through the same extensional flow device fitted with a half-length (37.5mm) connecting capillary, reducing the exposure time of the protein to shear by half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yield of insoluble material was found to be unaffected (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S3), identifying extensional flow rather than shear flow as a key trigger of aggregation for BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dissecting_the_Dispersity_of_Extensional_Flow-Induced_Aggregates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine how the dispersity of BSA changes with increasing pass number, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, Fig 2E and SI Appendix, Fig S4) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6) were used to analyze samples subjected to between 20 and 2,000 passes at 8 mm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NTA visualizes particles with hydrodynamic diameters of 102,000 nm, allowing the sizing and numeration of polydisperse colloidal solutions (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrodynamic diameter frequency histograms for BSA solutions (5 mg mL1) show an increase in particle size (ranging from 40 nm to  greater than 1 m) with increasing pass number (SI Appendix, Fig S4) whereas unstressed BSA, or BSA stressed for fewer than 50 passes, yielded no detectable particles [monomeric BSA has a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 3.5 nm, see below].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of aggregates was also found to increase with increasing pass number and with increasing BSA concentration (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the width of the error bars also increases with the number of passes, suggesting an increase in sample dispersity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data were then corroborated using DLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of regularization plots (14, 33) for BSA before and after 2,000 passes showed a reduction in intensity for monomeric BSA (Rh = 3.2 ± 0.9 nm) and the appearance of a range of particles with Rh values  greater than 100 nm (SI Appendix, Fig S5 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although accurate determination of the size and relative amount of each particle type in polydisperse solutions is difficult by DLS (34), polydispersity can, nonetheless, be assessed qualitatively by calculation of the z-average radius and polydispersity index (PDI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z-average radius (the average size of a particle within a disperse solution based on the averaged intensity of all species within the solution) is obtained directly from the raw autocorrelation data using cumulants analysis (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDI (where values of 0.1 and  greater than 0.6 reveal monodisperse and highly polydisperse species, respectively) is calculated from the z-average radius (SI Appendix) and is used to assess polydispersity (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the z-average radii (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Table S3) and PDI (SI Appendix, Table S3) for 5 mg mL1 BSA before (3.5 ± 0.1 nm and 0.1) and after (87.9 ± 66.3 nm and  greater than 0.6) 2,000 passes through the device clearly demonstrates that exposure to extensional flow has induced aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polydispersity of various concentrations of BSA (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg mL1) after 02,000 passes assessed by regularization (SI Appendix, Table S2), z-average radii (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Table S3), and PDI (SI Appendix, Table S3) all showed that the mean hydrodynamic radius increases with increasing pass number and that aggregates appear at lower pass numbers upon increasing BSA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the soluble protein assay, NTA, and DLS provide evidence for extensional flow-induced aggregation and indicate that 50 passes are required to observe any visible aggregates for BSA at concentrations 1 mg mL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Investigating_Early_Events_in_BSA_Aggregation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absence of aggregates before 50 passes suggests that BSA must either display a history effect (some threshold of damage must be attained before aggregation occurs) or that NTA and DLS are insensitive to the (presumably) low concentration of aggregate present at low pass numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the latter possibility, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to measure the effect of pass number on the diffusion time of a 110 mg mL1 BSA solution doped with 2% (vol/vol) Alexa 488-labeled BSA (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the solubility, NTA, and DLS data above, the autocorrelation functions for BSA solutions exposed to  greater than 50 passes deviate from that expected for a monodisperse monomeric species (SI Appendix, Fig S7 and Table S4) and that the aggregates increase in size with increasing pass number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast with NTA and DLS, however, FCS is able to detect the presence of smaller oligomers after as few as 10 passes at 5 mg mL1 (Rh increases approximately threefold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 or more passes, correlation functions could not be fitted to a single-component model but fitted to a two-component model (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that the Rh of the larger species increases with increasing pass number (23.3, 34.9, and 52.0 nm after 20, 50, and 100 passes, respectively; SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with the observations above, increasing protein concentration was found to lead to the detection of polydispersity after fewer passes (SI Appendix, Table S4), as expected for an aggregation reaction of high molecular order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_of_Other_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of extensional flow on the aggregation behavior of a range of other proteins that differ in size, secondary structure content, and topology (SI Appendix, Table S5) were next examined to assess whether the behavior of BSA is typical for globular, folded proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each protein was subjected to 20 or 100 passes at 8 mm s1 and the resulting aggregation quantified by UV spectrophotometry and the dispersity characterized by NTA and DLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2m (100 residues, Rh = 2.3 nm) was selected as fluid flow has been implicated previously in the aggregation of the protein into amyloid fibrils in the joints of patients undergoing long-term dialysis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five mg mL1 2m was found to be more sensitive than BSA to extensional flow as assessed by the pelleting assay (2% and 10% was insoluble after 20 or 100 passes, respectively, compared with 1% and 1.5% of BSA, Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, NTA and DLS measurements (SI Appendix, Fig S8) detected aggregates of 2m after 100 passes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of these aggregates by TEM revealed short, needle-like fibrils (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of 2m contrasts starkly with that of the C3 variant of G-CSF (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 175-residue, 4-helical, all -protein was found to be extremely sensitive to the effects of extensional flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After only 20 passes of 0.5 mg mL1 G-CSF C3 through the device (a 10-fold reduction in concentration relative to BSA and 2m), heterogeneous amorphous aggregates as large as 8 µm were observed by NTA and DLS (PDI  greater than  0.6, SI Appendix, Fig S9) with 20% of G-CSF C3 rendered insoluble (Fig 3 A and C), increasing to 40% after 100 passes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, three model IgG biopharmaceuticals [MEDI1912_WFL (38), MEDI1912_STT (38), and mAb1)] were subjected to extensional flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These IgGs were chosen as they have known, but different, aggregation propensities (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEDI1912_WFL and MEDI1912_STT differ by only six residues ([WFL substituted by STT in CDR1 (W and F) and CDR2 (L) in each VH domain], yet the former IgG has poor pharmacokinetic and biophysical properties, whereas its rationally engineered variant displays the same pM affinity for its target, but low self-association and enhanced serum persistence (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third mAb (mAb1) was chosen as it has low sequence identity to MEDI1912_WFL and displays aggregation behavior in line with a typical bioprocessable IgG (e.g., greater than 95% monomeric purity post-protein A purification with a degradation rate of less than 2% monomer loss per year in solution by HPLC-size-exclusion chromatography) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three IgGs (at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL1) were found to be sensitive to the effects of extensional flow; aggregates were detected by NTA after 20 passes for mAb1 and MEDI1912_WFL (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10A and S11A) and after 100 passes for MEDI1912_STT (SI Appendix, Fig S12A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these three proteins display markedly different sensitivity to extensional flow, despite their structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregation-prone MEDI1912_WFL was so sensitive to extensional flow that only 45% and 15% of protein remained in solution after 20 and 100 passes, respectively (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sensitivity is remarkable given the low concentration of protein used (0.5 mg mL1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, mAb1 yielded significantly less insoluble material (15% and 25% after 20 and 100 passes) with MEDI1912_STT exhibiting still less susceptibility [2% and 5% insoluble material after 20 and 100 passes, respectively (Fig 3A)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that biopharmaceuticals with diverse structures (G-CSF C3 is all- and mAbs are all-; SI Appendix, Table S5) are prone to extensional flow-induced aggregation and, surprisingly, that the aggregation propensity of IgGs that differ only at three positions in the CDR loops of each VH domain show remarkably different responses to hydrodynamic flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

What_Drives_Aggregation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have suggested that hydrodynamic forces can induce conformational changes in proteins (10, 39) but how these changes result in aggregation remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the mechanism of extensional flow-induced unfolding, 5 mg mL1 BSA was subjected to 10, 20, 50, or 100 passes at 8 mm s1 in the presence of 5 mM 5-[2-(Iodoacetamido)ethylamino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS, a sulfhydryl reactive fluorophore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the native state, all but 1 of the 35 cysteine residues of BSA form disulfide bridges and the only free cysteine residue available for labeling (Cys34) is buried (13.8-Å2 solvent accessible surface area, Fig 2A) and recalcitrant to labeling (Fig 3F, lane 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to extensional flow, however, renders BSA sensitive to labeling, the extent of which increases with increasing pass number (quantified in Fig 3F, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the change in solvent accessibility of Cys34 occurs during extensional flow rather than conformational changes upon aggregation, BSA was subjected to 10, 20, 50, and 100 passes, allowed to relax for up to 10 min (Methods), and then incubated with IAEDANS for a time equivalent to that of the extensional flow experiment (100 passes 10 min, Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No labeling was evident under these conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the effect of the unusually dense disulfide network present in BSA, which may limit the extent of flow-induced unfolding, the labeling experiments were repeated by applying the extensional flow in the presence of 0.5 mM TCEP (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show an approximate twofold increase in labeling, together with a twofold increase in insoluble material produced in the presence of a reductant [Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)] (SI Appendix, Fig S14) when BSA is subjected to extensional flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when IAEDANS was added 10 min after stressing the protein in the presence of 0.5 mM TCEP, BSA was again labeled (SI Appendix, Fig S13), indicating that breakage of the disulfide bridges under extensional flow in the presence of reductant yields aggregates comprising unfolded monomers with sulfhydryl groups exposed to the solvent, by contrast to the aggregates formed in the absence of reductant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data accord with experimental and theoretical investigations using proteins, DNA, organic polymers, and coarse-grained models which suggest that flow applies a stretching force to molecules along the flow field that is proportional to the strain rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the hydrodynamic drag of the protein increases as it unfolds, the already destabilized protein has a greater susceptibility to unfold further and interact with other proteins (4044), which increases its size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extensional force or tension experienced along a protein represented by two globular domains with a diameter of 2.34 nm connected by a 44.3-nm linker to form a dumbbell (3) is of the order of 10 fN for plunger velocities up to 20 mm s1 (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is 23 orders of magnitude lower than that required to mechanically unfold a protein using atomic force microscopy over a similar timescale (45), suggesting that a protein cannot be globally unfolded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of the force exerted, the global energy requirements for a protein-sized fluid packet (3.5-nm radius) to pass through either the extensional flow-dominated acceleration region or the shear-dominated capillary region was calculated (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis (Fig 4A) shows that even the global energy available (2.7 and 1.1 kBT at 8 mm s1 for the extensional- and shear- dominated regions, respectively, is not sufficient to completely unfold the protein, noting that only a very small proportion of this energy will be absorbed into the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global energy requirement of the shear-dominated capillary region is similar to that of the extensional flow region, despite the latter having been shown to be responsible for the aggregation of BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more appropriate parameter to consider may thus be the rate of energy transfer to the fluid packet E/(kBT t) (s1) where t is the time to transit the capillary or the extensional flow region (Fig 4B) because this better represents how quickly energy is added into the protein solution, noting that any perturbed structure will also dissipate energy at a finite rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling by t also removes the dependence of capillary length on (E/kBT) for the shear flow as observed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis shows that the rate of energy transfer by extensional flow is orders larger than that for shear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the effect of plunger velocity on the extent of aggregation, the insoluble material generated after subjecting 5 mg mL1 BSA to 100 passes at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 mm s1 was quantified (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At velocities below 10 mm s1, BSA aggregation was found to be independent of strain rate, yielding only 12% pelletable material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, at plunger velocities between 1016 mm s1, formation of insoluble protein increased with strain rate, so that at 16 mm s1 15% of BSA was rendered insoluble after only 100 passes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the degree of aggregation was found to be similar for full- and half-length capillaries at 8 and 16 mm s1 (Fig 2D), in accord with the simulations shown in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that at lower extensional strain rates, the transient unfolding force exerted onto the protein is insufficient to trigger full unfolding, or that this force triggers partial unfolding close to equilibrium (hydrodynamic force countered by folding energy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher strain rates, however, partial unfolding of BSA (the extent of which is limited by the disulfide network) triggers aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas prior work has demonstrated that hydrodynamic flow can induce the unfolding of supercoiled plasmid DNA (20, 27), polymers (26), von Willebrand factor (21, 46), and other proteins (11), the relative ability of shear and extensional flow to induce aggregation for these different systems has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we designed a device to generate an extensional flow field that would subject natively folded globular proteins to high and well-defined strain rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this device, we demonstrated that extensional flow has the ability to induce the aggregation of BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, together with previously published studies, suggests that while shear and extensional flow fields can both induce aggregation (11, 31), their ability to do so is protein dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, both spider silk and von Willebrand factor have been observed to undergo shear-induced remodeling [which nonetheless are exposed to mixed shear/extensional flows in vivo (22, 46)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both of these proteins are evolved to respond to low levels of hydrodynamic force, it may be that their response to shear is atypical for globular, stably folded proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter proteins are relatively insensitive to shear flow where the presence of an interface is often required to induce aggregation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Repeating our experiments on a variety of proteins demonstrated that the extent of aggregation caused by extensional flow depends on the structure, topology, concentration, and precise sequence of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to delineating these determinants, we have shown using in situ cysteine labeling that extensional flow can induce conformational remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical considerations and data discussed above (Fig 4), suggest that extensional flow can catalyze the partial/full unfolding of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical rate of energy transfer must, however, be reached to allow the unfolding barrier to be traversed during exposure to the flow force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superficially, hydrodynamic forced unfolding is similar to mechanical unfolding of single protein molecules using optical tweezers or the atomic force microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These single-molecule forced unfolding studies have shown that mechanical strength is related to the ability of regions local to the points of force application to resist extension by contrast with traditional measures of stability such as thermal or chemical denaturation (45, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If flow-induced aggregation occurs from a partially or fully unfolded state, then the threshold strain rate (i.e., that required to bring about exposure of an aggregation-prone region) will be protein dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, natively folded globular proteins will be generally recalcitrant to shear flow, whereas inherently extensible unstructured proteins are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial partial unfolding step, the likelihood of two (or more) unfolded molecules interacting productively is dependent on the affinity of the exposed aggregation-prone regions, the protein concentration, and the rate at which the protein regains its native structure, rationalizing the diverse sensitivity observed for the highly homologous IgG pair (MEDI1912_WFL and STT, Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as both the unfolding and aggregation steps are likely to dependent on factors such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength, even the same protein may display different extensional flow behavior in different environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have shown the utility of characterizing the behavior and dispersity of protein solutions subjected to well-defined hydrodynamic flows to deconvolve the effects of shear, extensional flow, protein topology, and sequence on their unfolding and aggregation properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results have revealed the sensitivity of proteins to unfolding and consequent aggregation under extensional flow in a manner dependent on the protein sequence and structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach adopted will aid the rational redesign of protein sequences that are more robust to bioprocessing and help to understand how flow has been used by nature in biological processes as diverse as silk spinning and blood clotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Characterization_of_Flow_Geometry_Using_CFD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CFD (using the general finite-element simulation package Comsol Multiphysics) was used to visualize and quantify the flow field generated by the extensional flow device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed the velocity, strain rate, and exposure time, among other parameters, to be calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A description of the CFD model, along with details of how to obtain the strain rate, is given in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extensional_Flow_Apparatus_and_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two 1-mL gas-tight syringes with inner bore diameter of 4.61 mm (Hamilton Syringes model 1001 RN Valco SYR) were modified to take a glass capillary tube of inner diameter 0.3 mm with a compression fitting (Hamilton Syringes RN 1 mm) producing an abrupt contraction with diameter ratio 15:1 producing a 238-fold increase in velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein solutions were stressed for a defined number of passes at a given plunger velocity, then the rig stopped, dissembled, and the solution expelled slowly from the syringe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control samples were incubated at ambient temperature for the duration of a given stress experiment (e.g., 10 passes at a plunger velocity of 8 mm s1 takes 1 min to complete).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed at least twice unless otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) was purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 (26/60) gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.1 and stored in aliquots at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before stressing experiments, the protein was concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with a 30-kDa cutoff filter (Merck Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After filtration through a 0.22-m membrane (Merck Millipore), the concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy (SI Appendix, Table S5) and adjusted as necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G-CSF C3 (37) was overexpressed in BL21[DE3]pLysS cells transformed with a pET23a_G-CSF C3 vector and purified as described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensional flow experiments with G-CSF C3 were performed in filtered (0.22 m) and degassed 25 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2m was purified as described (48) and extensional flow experiments performed in filtered (0.22 m) and degassed 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies were provided by MedImmune Ltd. Antibodies were prepared by dialyzing into 0.22 m filtered and degassed 150 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, diluting before stressing experiments as appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insoluble_Protein_Pelleting_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After stressing for the desired number of passes, the apparatus was dissembled and 200 L of protein solution ultracentrifuged using a Beckmann Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA100 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 150 L of supernatant was removed and diluted to 2 mL (BSA) or 250 L (all other proteins) in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn HCl) 25 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet and remaining supernatant were diluted in the same buffer to 2 mL (BSA) or 250 L (all other proteins) and incubated overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of protein in the pellet was then calculated by measuring the protein concentration of this solution, the supernatant after ultracentrifugation, and the protein solution in the absence of extensional flow using UV-visible spectroscopy (see SI Appendix, Table S5 for extinction coefficients).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was performed in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

IAEDANS_(5-[2-(Iodoacetamido)Ethylamino]Naphthalene-1-Sulfonic_Acid)_Labeling_of_BSA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 5 mg mL1 BSA solution (25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.1) was mixed with 5 mM IAEDANS and stressed for 0100 passes at a plunger velocity of 8 mm s1 (strain rate = 11,750 s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCEP at 0.5 mM was added to the tube before stressing as required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another experiment 5 mg mL1 BSA was stressed for 0100 passes in the presence or absence of TCEP (this protein was left for the same length of time as the extensional flow experiment above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, this protein was mixed with 5 mM IAEDANS and incubated for the same time as the protein was stressed for in the presence of IAEDANS above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IAEDANS labeling was quenched with SDS/PAGE loading buffer containing 200 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diluted samples (100 µg) were then analyzed by SDS/PAGE [using a 12% wt/vol (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) gel].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent bands in the gel were excited by UV light provided by a UV-trans illuminator (Syngene Gel documentation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensities of the fluorescent bands were analyzed with the Gene Tool software supplied with the instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
