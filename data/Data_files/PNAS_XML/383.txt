Trading experience modulates anterior insula to reduce the endowment effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trading experience has been shown to reduce the endowment effect, a decision-making bias that distorts market prices and reduces trade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the mechanisms underlying how experience changes this bias will provide important insights for developing interventions to improve market efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that market experience causes a reduction in right anterior insula activation during selling, which mediates a decrease in the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that trading mitigates negative affective responses in the context of selling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
People often demand a greater price when selling goods that they own than they would pay to purchase the same goodsa well-known economic bias called the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endowment effect has been found to be muted among experienced traders, but little is known about how trading experience reduces the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that when selling, experienced traders exhibit lower right anterior insula activity, but no differences in nucleus accumbens or orbitofrontal activation, compared with inexperienced traders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, insula activation mediates the effect of experience on the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results are obtained for inexperienced traders who are incentivized to gain trading experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that frequent trading likely mitigates the endowment effect indirectly by modifying negative affective responses in the context of selling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample stimuli from the scanner paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each task, participants first made slider valuations for the four different products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, in the offer phase, participants saw 4 blocks (1 per item) of 31 prices at which the participants could choose to buy the item (WTP) or sell the item (WTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tasks were counterbalanced between participants and randomized sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We computed the endowment effect for each consumer good as the difference between WTA and WTP indicated using the slider, normalized by WTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in previous studies (1, 16, 18), participants in Study 1 showed a significant positive endowment effect on average [51% of WTP; t (29) = 2.83, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was particularly pronounced in inexperienced traders [86% of WTP; t (11) = 2.40, P less_than 0.05] but not experienced traders [28% of WTP; t (17) = 1.62, P = 0.12].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In regression analyses, experience trended toward decreasing the endowment effect, controlling for demographic variables and task order ( = 0.56, P = 0.079; Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants in Study 2 had a significant positive endowment effect [21% of WTP; t (14) = 2.50, P less_than 0.05; averaged over both sessions].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, being asked to trade over a 2-mo period decreased the endowment effect from 30% [t (14) = 2.59, P less_than 0.05] to 12% of WTP [t (14) = 1.34, P = 0.20].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change was significant after controlling for the set of items subjects saw in each session ( = 0.51, P less_than 0.01; Table S2), suggesting that selling experience, and not endogenous characteristics of professional traders, reduces the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brain_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A whole-brain mixed ANOVA was conducted with study (Study 1, Study 2), experience (recruited based on experience in Study 1, pre- vs. post-training in Study 2), task (WTA vs. WTP), and offer (greater vs. less than slider value) as factors, using the sandwich variance estimator to account for repeated-measures covariance (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task vs. baseline contrast revealed frontoparietal, occipital, and mesolimbic activation but also deactivation in the medial OFC region, bilateral temporal poles, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus [false-discovery rate (FDR), P less_than 0.05; Fig S1 and Table S3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OFC activation did not vary as a function of any factor, so we did not investigate this region in subsequent region of interest (ROI) analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant main effect of study was observed, with greater overall activation for Study 1 in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effect of study did not interact with any other factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant task by offer interaction emerged in bilateral occipital and parietal clusters, including middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior parietal extending into left superior parietal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, clusters in precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area extending into dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were observed bilaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other significant clusters included thalamus, precuneus, bilateral anterior insula, left NAcc, and right putamen (Table S3 and Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was driven by a difference between conditions that were favorable (Table S4), including high prices during selling (WTA, above slider value) and low prices during buying (WTP, below slider value), and the unfavorable conditions, such as low selling prices (WTA, below slider value) and high buying prices (WTP, above slider value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other effects reached significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ROI_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Planned analyses were conducted using NAcc and anterior insula ROIs to test whether positive and negative affective responses (9) mediate the relation between trading experience and the endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the whole-brain differences between our studies, 2 (experience) Ã— 2 (task) ANOVAs were conducted for each study and ROI, controlling for demographics and order variables (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the insula, an experience main effect was observed in Study 1 [F(1,55) = 4.43, P less_than 0.05], whereas a significant task by experience interaction emerged in Study 2 [F(1,54) = 7.08, P = 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the NAcc, an experience main effect was found in Study 2 [F(1,54) = 4.83, P less_than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other effects were significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We followed up these ANOVAs with regression analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Study 1, insula activation during the WTA task, but not WTP, was greater in inexperienced compared with experienced participants ( = 0.045, P less_than 0.05) and was positively related to the endowment effect ( = 4.58, P = 0.005; Fig 4) controlling for demographics and task order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we tested whether insula and NAcc activation changed after participants gained selling experience in Study 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After controlling for item set order, decreased activation was observed in the right anterior insula during the WTA condition ( = 0.050, P less_than 0.05) and NAcc during the WTP condition ( = 0.047, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, age was marginally negatively associated with WTA insula ( = 0.002, P = 0.058) and positively associated with the WTA insula change score ( = 0.003, P less_than 0.005), indicating a significant interaction with training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the WTA insula change remained significant ( = 0.046, P less_than 0.05) after controlling for median-centered age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mediation_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given our a priori hypotheses about loss aversion and the specific role of the insula, we tested the indirect effect of experience, through subject-averaged insula activation during the WTA task, on the subject-averaged endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the method of Preacher and Hayes (19), which relaxes the requirement of significant direct effects (20), to estimate a 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval (CI) based on 5,000 bootstrap samples for the indirect effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indirect effect differed significantly from 0 [point estimate: 0.368; 95% CI: 1.287 to 0.016; Fig 4], controlling for demographics and task order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For Study 2, we estimated the endowment effect, insula, and NAcc change scores controlling for item set order and median-centered age by taking the residuals and adding the constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we used the path-analytic method of Montoya and Hayes* to estimate the indirect effects of insula and NAcc with a bias-corrected bootstrap CI based on 5,000 bootstrap samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Study 1, change in insula signal mediated the effect of trading experience on the endowment effect (point estimate: 0.148; 95% CI: 0.359 to 0.025; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indirect effect of NAcc change did not reach significance (point estimate: 0.102; 95% CI: 0.230 to 0.008).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does economic experience affect economic decision biases that appear to be a characteristic of human decision-making (1, 21)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research (24) has suggested that extensive experience in buying and selling goods can reduce the size of these biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present research, we tested specific hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which trading experience modifies consumer decision-making processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In two studies, we find convergent evidence that the influence of trading experience on the endowment effect is mediated in part by lower sensitivity of the right anterior insula during selling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was robust over both of our studies despite the different populations, procedures, and incentives used, as well as corresponding differences on behavioral effect size and other whole-brain effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Study 1 mediation results are susceptible to bias because of their cross-sectional nature (22), Study 2 used experimentally induced trading experience and time-series variation to estimate mediation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that current human in vivo techniques do not permit more continuous measurement or direct manipulation of the insula, which would be ideal for estimating the insula indirect effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of the right anterior insula and dACC during consideration of unfavorable offers in the whole-brain analysis coheres with work demonstrating involvement of these regions in processing salience (2325) and the role of the insula in anticipating and rejecting aversive outcomes in particular (13, 15, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased insula activity suggests that trading experience causes agents to experience less loss aversion during selling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the observation that most inexperienced traders have substantial buying but not selling experience and dovetails with the intuition that routine exchanges are likely to be evaluated in aggregate (i.e., as a profitable operation overall) instead of independent gains and losses (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our interpretation of the insula results rely on reverse inference, we queried Neurosynth [version 0.3.4 (29)] using the insula voxels that were most sensitive to variation in experience in our studies (Study 1: 48, 11, 1; Study 2: 36, 14, 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurosynth is a meta-analytic database with a corpus of 11,406 neuroimaging studies, which provides estimates of posterior probabilities that a term will appear in a study, conditional on that study reporting activation in a given voxel, and z scores associated with that voxel in the posterior probability map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the two peak voxels, terms related to pain had the largest reverse inference z scores and posterior probabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak voxel in Study 1 had a z score of 7.07 for pain, and posterior probability P(pain|activation) = 0.75 (the next two nonanatomy terms were preparation: z = 4.53, P(preparation|activation) = 0.75, and noxious: z = 4.52, P(noxious|activation) = 0.79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in Study 2, the first three nonanatomy terms were pain: z = 7.98, P(pain|activation) = 0.75, noxious: z = 7.77, P(noxious|activation) = 0.84, and heat: z = 7.45, P(heat|activation) = 0.85.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, as evidenced by the large z score and posterior probability for preparation for the Study 1 peak insula voxel, this result is not completely conclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear how preparation, which clusters with task switching and response inhibition in Neurosynth (30), might generate variability in the endowment effect in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, experience was not associated with performance on a working memory task [operation span (31)] in Study 1 [t (26) = 0.41; not significant].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, NAcc activation in the task by offer interaction appeared to be driven by greater activation for high selling offers and low buying offers, consistent with previous results demonstrating increased NAcc signal during anticipation of gain (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased NAcc signal when buying, together with the decreased insula signal when selling in Study 2, might suggest lower preferences overall posttraining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only insula signal significantly mediated the change in endowment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect we observe in Study 2 is particularly striking given the briefness of our intervention, suggesting that novice traders may reach criterion levels on the endowment effect quite quickly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results do not appear to be an artifact of repeating the scanner task, because our results were robust across people with diverse professional trading backgrounds who did not undergo repeated scanning in Study 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other work indicates that whereas fMRI signal in the amygdala habituates over repeated scans in emotion processing tasks, the anterior insula has good testretest reliability (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Study 2 data suggest that the reduction in insula signal and the endowment effect scales in part with the number of items sold as well as items listed (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signs of the coefficients indicate that actual selling experience, and not just effort, is required for the results we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, more extensive efforts are needed to determine the specific aspects of experience that most effectively reduce decision biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sign of the moderating influence of age on the relation between training and insula activation in Study 2 suggests less treatment-induced reduction in insula signal in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may be explained by lower anterior insula responsiveness to loss anticipation in older adults (15, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a marginal negative relation was observed between age and insula activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, market experience may not be as efficacious for older adults to overcome decision biases because of insensitivity of the insula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our results are consistent with the hypothesis that trading experience reduces loss aversion in the context of selling, other alternatives are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For one, trading experience may reduce uncertainty about costs or risks associated with selling activities (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because anxiety about selling may elicit insula activation, we might observe the same results without any decrease in loss aversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selling task in our experiment was designed to be free of possible sources of friction such as risk, transaction costs, and human trading partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, we cannot definitively rule out this explanation without measuring perceived costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another possibility is that trading experience causes agents to reappraise selling activities (6, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, expert traders may learn to frame selling goods as opportunities for monetary gain vs. nongain, rather than from the reference point of loss of ownership vs. nonloss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A related possibility is that experience may induce a wider framing, such that prospects are evaluated in the context of an overall portfolio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these explanations, experience facilitates strategies for circumventing loss aversion, rather than reducing sensitivity to loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study did not include measures of how framing changed with experience to test these alternatives, but the fact that only one decision counted suggests against the portfolio strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inductions such as taking the perspective of a trader (38) may be used in future research to directly explore the strategies that experienced traders bring to bear on selling and how these strategies interact with variability on loss aversion to modulate the strength of the endowment effect in inexperienced and experienced traders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endowment effect contradicts standard economic theory and distorts market transactions (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When WTA is generally greater than WTP, buyers and sellers are less likely to agree on a price, resulting in undertrading in real markets (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that even a modest amount of trading experience may help eliminate such inefficiencies in part through reducing the influence of loss aversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Self-Reported_Pricing_Strategies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As part of the product rating survey, participants were asked to describe the strategy they used when pricing items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Study 1 sample, three authors (K.J.Y., S.E., and A.H.) independently rated participant responses; for the Study 2 sample, two authors (K.J.Y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and L.C.P.T.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  independently rated the responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raters used the following description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buy low sell high is a pricing strategy in which an agent attempts to make a profit by acquiring items at a price below what he perceives to be the market price of the item and selling these items at a price above the perceived market value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy differs from others in that the agent does not view the items in the context of personal consumption and, instead, chooses to extract as much payment as possible from the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We excluded participants who used a buy-low-sell-high strategy, because the strategy produces a behavioral pattern resembling the endowment effect but invokes mechanisms that cannot explain the endowment effect in other commonly used trade asymmetry paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify these participants, we used the intersection of the ratings (responses that all raters agreed as fitting the buy-low-sell-high criteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other pricing strategies were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2_Selling_Experience  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants in Study 2 could vary on several endogenous variables, such as the effort they put into selling and selling ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the effect of effort, we use the number of listings participants posted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not have the resolution to cleanly identify the effect of selling experience independently of selling ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this caveat, we ran exploratory regression models using items listed and items sold to model what aspects of experience might be contributing to the observed reduction in the endowment effect as well as the insula signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our regression results (Table S7) suggest that the number of items sold decreases both the endowment effect ( = 0.092, P less_than 0.05) and the insula signal ( = 0.012, P less_than 0.01), whereas the number of listings tend to have the opposite effects (endowment effect:  = 0.055, P = 0.07; insula:  = 0.014, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coefficients suggest that simply making an effort to comply with the experiment may not explain our effects, but completing sales may be particularly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship may be attributable to the mere accrual of selling experience, which could blunt the affective impact of trading outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the relationship may be explained by selling ability, because individuals develop strategies such as cognitive framing that may change affective responses as well as increase sales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our eBay data do not have high enough resolution to identify which aspects are most important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
