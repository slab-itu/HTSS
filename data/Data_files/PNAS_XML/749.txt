Sex-specific early survival drives adult sex ratio bias in snowy plovers and impacts mating system and population growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sex biases are widespread in nature and represent a fundamental component of sexual selection and population biologybut at which point in life history do these biases emerge?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a detailed individual-based demographic analysis of an intensively studied wild bird population to evaluate origins of sex biases and their consequences on mating strategies and population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio, which is consistent with behavioral observations of female-biased polygamy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, sex-biased juvenile rather than adult survival contributed most to the adult sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex biases also strongly influenced population viability, which was significantly overestimated when sex ratio and mating system were ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study, therefore, has implications for both sexual selection theory and biodiversity conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult sex ratio (ASR) is a central concept in population biology and a key factor in sexual selection, but why do most demographic models ignore sex biases?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vital rates often vary between the sexes and across life history, but their relative contributions to ASR variation remain poorly understoodan essential step to evaluate sex ratio theories in the wild and inform conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine structured two-sex population models with individual-based markrecapture data from an intensively monitored polygamous population of snowy plovers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a strongly male-biased ASR (0.63) is primarily driven by sex-specific survival of juveniles rather than adults or dependent offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding provides empirical support for theories of unbiased sex allocation when sex differences in survival arise after the period of parental investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a conventional model ignoring sex biases significantly overestimated population viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that sex-specific population models are essential to understand the population dynamics of sexual organisms: reproduction and population growth are most sensitive to perturbations in survival of the limiting sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our study suggests that sex-biased early survival may contribute toward mating system evolution and population persistence, with implications for both sexual selection theory and biodiversity conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted this study at Bahía de Ceuta, a subtropical lagoon on the coastal plain in northwestern Mexico (23°54 N, 106°57 W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 2006 and 2012, we uniquely marked and monitored 1,259 individuals (436 females and 390 males initially marked as chicks and 221 females and 212 males initially marked as adults).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our marking methods were limited to breeding adults and chicks, we detected no sex difference in the proportion of this marked population that was nonbreeding (paired t test: t=0.429, df=4, P=0.69) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this marked subset of the population represents a broadly representative sample from which to draw inferences about the dynamics of the population at large and elucidate the contributions of sex- and stage-specific survival toward ASR bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mating_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the ASR in the context of mating system, we quantified sex-specific mating strategies of snowy plovers at our study site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both sexes can be polygamous, female snowy plovers desert broods to seek serial mates, leaving males to provide parental care alone (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expected that females would acquire, on average, a greater number of mates per year than males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on behavioral observations of 456 families with known identities of both parents, female-biased polygamy is precisely what we found (Fig 1) (MannWhitneyWilcoxon test: W=3,264, P0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the mating system index in the mating function (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) was polyandrous (h=0.82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sex-Biased_Survival_and_ASR_Bias  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated stage- and sex-specific survival rates using markrecapture analysis to control for imperfect detection in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markrecapture modeling revealed sex differences in encounter probability for juveniles and adults that would confound simple estimates of survival and ASR based solely on return rates or uncorrected counts of males and females (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparent survival was strongly male-biased across all life history stages, with male survival being 11.5% higher than female survival at the chick stage, 51% higher for juveniles, and 0.5% higher at the adult stage (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hatching sex ratio was slightly female-biased but did not significantly deviate from parity [average =0.486 (95% CI=0.4350.536), P=0.588, n=340 hatchlings from 116 full broods].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our model indicated a strongly male-biased ASR [mean=0.632 (95% CI=0.4600.785)] (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contributions_to_Male-Biased_ASR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the stage-specific contributions of sex differences in survival to ASR bias, we conducted a life table response experiment (LTRE), which revealed that all vital rates contributed in the same direction (i.e., male-biased) but differed in magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sex difference in juvenile survival made the largest overall contribution to ASR bias (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the contribution of sex-biased juvenile survival toward ASR was 3.3 times higher than sex-biased chick survival and 17.6 times higher than sex-biased adult survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hatching sex ratio and mating system made negligible contributions (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Consequences_of_ASR_Bias_and_Polygamy_on_Population_Viability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biased ASR and polygamy create conditions whereby reduced survival of the limiting sex can compromise population viability, which has important implications for conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our perturbation analysis showed that population growth was most sensitive to adult survival under all hypothetical scenarios of ASR and mating system (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult female survival elasticities were highest under scenarios of male-biased ASR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, there was no sex-specific sensitivity of vital rates under an unbiased ASR and monogamous mating system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, elasticity was highest for adult males under an unbiased ASR and polyandry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the conservation consequences of disregarding sex biases, we compared the predictive accuracy of a detailed two-sex model incorporating polygamy with a conventional one-sex model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the 7-year study period, average population growth was below replacement (=0.859±0.28 SD) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observed rate of decline was captured by the uncertainty distribution of the two-sex model [=0.849 (95% CI: 0.8020.897)] (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the one-sex version of the model exhibited greater uncertainty and significantly overestimated population growth [=0.947 (95% CI: 0.8831.01)] (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present a comprehensive demographic model based on detailed individual-based life history data from an intensively monitored bird population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By incorporating sex-specific feedbacks between survival and frequency-dependent reproduction, our model predicted a strongly male-biased ASR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was complemented by our behavioral observations of a polyandrous mating system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our findings build on recent empirical and theoretical studies linking ASR to the evolutionary origins and consequences of mating system variation (1012) and also provide insights into the sex- and stage-specific demographic components that contribute to ASR bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males had consistently higher apparent survival than females across all life stages, but a sex difference in the apparent survival of juveniles had the largest impact on ASR bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, population growth was most sensitive to perturbations in adult female survival under the male-biased ASR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results uncover the demographic pathways linking individual-level variation in survival and sex roles to population-level dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Obtaining reliable survival estimates from natural populations is challenging because of sex differences in behavior and life history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study addressed this uncertainty through markrecapture models and bootstrapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central assumption of our model is that our marked subset of the population is representative of the entire population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is appropriate given that we marked the vast majority of chicks and breeding adults in the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we did not find a sex difference in the proportion of breeders vs. nonbreeders (Fig S1), indicating that our ASR estimate is not confounded by an excess number of unmarked nonbreeding females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Females had higher rates of polygamy than males, which is in line with most published records from other snowy plover populations (32, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This female-biased mating system complemented a strongly male-biased ASR (0.63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASR in this species has previously been reported to be less extreme (34) than found here, although the previous study was unable to incorporate sex-specific chick and juvenile survival, which made the greatest contributions to the ASR bias in this population (this study) and others (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASR bias is a widespread phenomenon in wild vertebrate populations, with mammals typically being female-biased (mean ASR=0.37 ± 0.15 SD) and birds typically being male-biased (mean ASR=0.55 ± 0.09 SD) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ASR estimate for snowy plovers, therefore, is within the natural variation observed in other avian taxa (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importance_of_Early_Sex-Specific_Demographic_Processes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several hypotheses can be put forward to explain the observed pattern of male-biased early survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing first on the chicks, male hatchlings are significantly larger than their sisters in this population (38), potentially providing males with an advantage during early development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another mutually nonexclusive possibility is that male chicks could achieve faster growth rates, which has been observed in Kentish plovers Charadrius alexandrinus (38), for example, either by virtue of sex-specific parental care (39) or as a consequence of sex-specific immunocompetence (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, predation could act sex-specifically, although male and female chicks do not differ appreciably in appearance and behavior, and we did not detect a sex difference in encounter rates (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the sexes might differ in premature investment in sexual traits (41), although this seems unlikely: sexual ornamentation is moderate, and body size differences at maturity are small (31) (about 4%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sex bias during the juvenile stage made the largest contribution to the ASR bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding corroborates the results of earlier avian studies showing that sex-specific first-year survival may lead to an ASR bias (25, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study goes further than previous works by decomposing the contributions from the first-year stage into chick and juvenile contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juvenile survival contributed most toward ASR bias, probably because these naïve individuals face multiple challenges during the transition from parental independence to sexual maturity, potentially including predation, harsh winter climates, and food shortages, all of which could disproportionately affect either sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in sexually sized dimorphic species, including red deer Cervus elaphus and great bustards Otis tarda, male young are less able to cope with severe winter weather (42) and food shortage (43), probably owing to the metabolic demands of large body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In snowy plovers, such a mechanism is unlikely given the moderate size differences between males and females (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another possibility is that sex-biased dispersal behavior could contribute toward sex differences in apparent juvenile survival because natal dispersal is typically female-biased in birds (44), with snowy plovers being no exception (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dispersal and survival are not necessarily independent phenomena because dispersal often entails survival costs, such as increased predation risk and unfamiliarity of novel environments (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, chicks are unable to disperse beyond the breeding site, and therefore, their survival estimate approximated true survival and thus, implies a role of intrinsic sex differences in early survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, over the 7 years of this study, few adults were resighted in adjacent populations, and these sightings are unbiased with respect to sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, an independent study of snowy plovers in Monterey Bay, California found that survival was male-biased, even after accounting for sex-specific dispersal (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Negligible_Effect_of_Sex_Allocation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hatching sex ratio, based on 340 hatchlings, was unbiased and served as a proxy for the secondary sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite popular interest in sex allocation theory (48, 49), relatively few studies have convincingly shown offspring sex ratio biases in wild populations (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Düsing (51), Fisher (52), and others (5355) reasoned that, if sex biases in survival emerged after the period of parental investment, sex allocation should not deviate from parity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposition is precisely what we found, with ASR being strongly influenced by the sex-biased survival of independent juveniles rather than deviations in the hatching sex ratio (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although the sex-biased survival of dependent chicks provided a noteworthy contribution to ASR bias (Fig 2), fathers provide uniparental care of chicks in this species, and therefore, the period of maternal investment typically ends at hatching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this parental care system, our result further confirms theoretical expectations of an unbiased hatching sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolutionary_Feedbacks_Between_ASR_and_Mating_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mating systems are influenced by the availability of mates (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A biased ASR creates conditions whereby one sex is in limited supply, thus forcing the other sex to compete for access to mates (7, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In shorebirds, ASR is a strong predictor of mating and parental strategies (13), with the limiting sex tending to have greater mating opportunities and reduced parental investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sex differences in the costs and benefits of parental care may facilitate polygamy (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the relationship between sex ratio and mating system represents a causality dilemma because of the positive feedback that polygamous mating systems impose on ASR bias and vice versa (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, polygamy entails sex-specific costs caused by sexual selection that could drive the ASR bias, whereas on the other hand, ASR bias creates uneven mating opportunities and thus, facilitates polygamy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that sex biases originate before maturity (Fig 5i) and are, therefore, likely influenced by natural selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, genotypesex interactions could impact chick survival during development (57) rather than during adulthood, when sexual selection is expected to have a strong impact on survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, ASR bias seems to drive the mating system rather than vice versa (Fig 5ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot discount the possibility that sexual selection contributes toward sex biases in early survival [for instance, via differential early investment in secondary sexual traits (41)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this explanation seems unlikely because sexual dimorphism in plovers is negligible, and if anything, males are more ornamented than females (31, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Consequences_of_Mating_System_and_ASR_on_Population_Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vertebrates, adult survival is often the most important parameter influencing population growth because adults have the greatest reproductive potential (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon was the case in our population, but the effect of adult survival was sex-specific because of ASR bias and polygamy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under a male-biased ASR, adult female survival had the highest elasticity to population growth, meaning that a small perturbation to adult female survival has a larger effect on population growth than an equivalent perturbation in all other parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempting to dissect the effects of ASR and mating system, we found that sex-specific elasticities of adults were greatest under scenarios of male-biased ASR compared with scenarios of polyandry (Fig 5iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in scenarios of unbiased ASR, both sexes had the same elasticities for all parameters under monogamy, but under polyandry, adult male survival had the highest elasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contrasts highlight the reproductive constraints imposed on populations with a biased ASR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When ASR is male-biased, polyandrous mating strategies optimize individual fecundity and thus, maximize population growth (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reproduction is dependent on the availability of gametes, and thus, a population with female-biased ASR and a polygynous mating system may not be limited in the same way because a single male can produce many more gametes than a single female and hence, father more offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, similar studies of polygynous populations are needed to critically test the predictions of mating system, ASR, and population growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_of_Two-_Versus_One-Sex_Modeling_for_Biodiversity_Conservation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeling population trajectories is an important tool for conservation and management (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex biases could potentially play an important role in population dynamics, particularly for polygamous species, but sex-structured models remain uncommon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we compare a conventional one-sex model with a two-sex model incorporating frequency-dependent reproduction and sex-specific survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that our two-sex model provides a better fit to the observed data than a one-sex model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although both models indicate negative population trajectories, the one-sex model substantially underestimates the rate of population decline and exhibits greater uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has important conservation implications, especially for sex-biased populations of threatened or endangered species, where failing to incorporate sex-specific vital rates could lead to erroneous conclusions and overestimated population viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the rise of conservation-based monitoring of individually marked populations (61), a wealth of demographic data presents new scientific horizons for ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in sex-specific modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining extensive individual-based sex- and stage-specific vital rates and structured population models, we show that a male-biased ASR in a natural population is driven by male-biased survival of early life history stages (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that ASR likely drives the mating system (Fig 5ii), although additional experimental and/or comparative studies are needed to establish the causal link.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ASR and mating system facilitate sex-specific sensitivities to population growth (Fig 5iii), with ASR having the strongest effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male-biased survival in snowy plovers is consistent with recent comparative studies (56, 62) suggesting that many bird species may exhibit male-biased ASR (9, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study makes an important contribution to understanding a widespread phenomenon in natural populations and highlights that ASR variation likely acts as an important catalyst of mating system dynamics and population viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field_and_Laboratory_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fieldwork permits (01717/10, 01367/11, 02898/12) were granted by the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) to M.C.-L. and C.K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study was performed in accordance with the approved guidelines outlined by SEMARNAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the 7-year study period, we collected markrecapture and individual reproductive success data during daily surveys of the study site over the breeding season that typically spanned from mid-April to mid-July.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plover chicks were captured by hand and adults were captured using funnel traps on broods or nests (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned adults a unique combination of three color rings and an alpha-numeric metal ring, allowing the use of both captures and noninvasive resightings to estimate survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular brood resightings combined with regular recaptures aided analyses of daily survival for chicks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our intensive nest search and capture efforts, we are confident that we ringed the vast majority of chicks ( greater than 95%) and breeding adults ( greater than 85%) in the local population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nests and broods were frequently monitored every 27 days to assess daily survival and identify tending parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During captures, 2550 L of blood was sampled from the metatarsal vein of chicks and the brachial vein of adults for molecular sex typing with the Z-002B marker (64) and verification with the Calex-31 marker located on the W chromosome (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our PCR conditions see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantifying_Mating_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the mating system of the population using a dataset that only included individuals for which we (i) were confident of the identity of their mates and (ii) had observed them in at least two reproductive attempts that were either within the same season or in different seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex differences in the per capita number of annual mates were evaluated using a nonparametric MannWhitneyWilcoxon test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_Sex-_and_Stage-Specific_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our structured population model considered sex-specific survival across three key stage classes in avian life history: chicks, juveniles, and adults (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chick stage was defined as the 25-day period between hatching and fledging, during which offspring are dependent on parental care (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The juvenile stage was defined as the 1-year transition period spanning from fledging to recruitment into the adult population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adult stage represented a stasis stage in which individuals were annually retained in the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used markrecapture models to account for sex, stage, and temporal variation in encounter (p) and apparent survival () probabilities because they allow for imperfect detection of marked individuals during surveys and the inclusion of individuals with unknown fates (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the term apparent survival, because true mortality cannot be disentangled from permanent emigration in this framework (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, only a few nearby populations are regularly monitored, and we have limited evidence that marked individuals disperse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Materials and Methods has additional details of our survival analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Matrix_Model_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We built a two-sex postbreeding matrix model for the population that incorporated all three stages of plover life history into two annual transitions denoting first-years and adults (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitions of projection matrices are required to have equal temporal durations (67), and thus, the chick stage (25 days) was combined with the juvenile stage (11 months) as lower-level matrix elements to describe the transition of premature individuals to adulthood (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projection of the matrix for one annual time step (t) is given by(t+1)=(t),[1]where n is a 4×1 vector of the population distributed across the two life stages and two sexes:=[1st yearAdult1st yearAdult],[2]and M is expressed as a 4×4 matrix:=[0R(1)0R(1)CJA000R()0R()00CJA],[3]where transition probabilities () between life stages are the survival of chicks (C), juveniles (J), and adults (A) for females () and males ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hatching sex ratio () describes the probability of hatchlings being either male (i.e., ) or female (i.e., 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Per capita reproduction of females (R) and males (R) is expressed through sex-specific mating functions used to link the sexes and produce progeny for the following time step of the model given the relative abundances of each sex (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use the harmonic mean mating function, which accounts for sex-specific frequency dependence (68):R=knn+nh1R=knn+nh1,[4]where k is the modal clutch size (three in the case of snowy plovers), h is an index of the mating system (h greater than 1 signifies polygyny, h=1 signifies monogamy, and hless_than1 signifies polyandry), and n and n are the densities of adult females and males, respectively, in each time step of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the predominantly polyandrous mating system, h was defined as the inverse of the average annual number of mates per female:h=11Ni=1Nmibi[5]where N is the number of breeding females in the marked population, b is the total number of years female i was seen breeding, and m is the total number of mating partners female i had over b years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for potential sex biases arising before the chick stage (i.e., sex allocation), we evaluated if the hatching sex ratio deviated significantly from parity (SI Materials and Methods has details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_the_ASR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated ASR from the stable stage distribution (w) of the two-sex matrix model:ASR=wAwA+wA,[6]where wA and wA give the proportions of the population composed of adult males and females, respectively, at equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate uncertainty in our estimate of ASR caused by sampling and process variation in our survival parameters, we implemented a bootstrapping procedure that resampled our markrecapture data (SI Materials and Methods has details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Life_Table_Response_Experiment_of_ASR_Contributions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perturbation analyses provide important information about the relative effect that each component of a matrix model has on the population-level response (in our case, ASR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess how influential a sex bias in parameters associated with each of the three life stages was on ASR dynamics, we used an LTRE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An LTRE decomposes the difference in response between two or more treatments by weighting the difference in parameter values by the parameters contribution to the response (i.e., its sensitivity) and summing over all parameters (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we compared the observed scenario (M) with a hypothetical scenario (), whereby all female survival rates were set equal to the male rates and the hatching sex ratio was unbiased (i.e.,  = 0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our LTRE identifies the drivers of ASR bias by decomposing the difference between the ASR predicted by our model and an unbiased ASR (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The contributions (C) of lower-level demographic parameters () were calculated following Veran and Beissinger (25)C()=()×ASR,[7]where ASR/ is the sensitivity of ASR to perturbations in the demographic rate  in matrix M, which is a reference matrix midway between the two scenarios (67):M=+2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8]The two-sex mating function makes our model nonlinear in the sense that the projection matrix and specifically, the fertility elements (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) depend on sex-specific population structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perturbation analyses must, therefore, accommodate the indirect effects of parameter perturbations on population growth via their effects on population structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the sensitivities of the vital rate parameters to ASR, we used numerical methods that independently perturbed each parameter of the matrix, simulated the model through 1,000 time steps, and calculated ASR at equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These computations produced parameter-specific splines, from which ASR/ could be derived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach appropriately accounts for the nonlinear feedbacks between vital rates and population structure, although it does not isolate the contribution of this feedback (26, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_Growth_Consequences_to_ASR_Bias_and_a_Polygamous_Mating_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biased ASR and polygamous mating systems can restrict the reproductive potential of a population because of a scarcity of the limiting sex (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, population viability can be indirectly affected by ASR and mating system via the sex-specific effects that vital rates have on population growth under a biased ASR, a polygamous mating system, or both (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the relative influence that a biased ASR or a polygamous mating system has on population growth, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of all sex-specific parameters using four scenarios of the two-sex model: (i) polyandrous and male-biased ASR (i.e., the observed scenario), (ii) polyandrous and unbiased ASR, (iii) monogamous and male-biased ASR, and (iv) monogamous and unbiased ASR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In polyandrous scenarios, h was set to the value from field observations, whereas in monogamous scenarios, h=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In scenarios of unbiased ASR, male survival rates were assigned to both sexes (i.e.,  above), whereas the original sex-specific structure was retained in male-biased scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under each scenario, sensitivities of  to perturbations in each parameter () were estimated numerically as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivities were rescaled into elasticities (e), which describe the proportional response of  to a proportional perturbation of a demographic parameter (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the sensitivity of parameters becomes directly comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elasticities were calculated ase()=×,[9]where / is the sensitivity of  to perturbations in parameter .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Two-_Versus_One-Sex_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-sex population models are rarely used in conservation biology because of the detailed data required to correctly parameterize them (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, vital rates are typically estimated for only one sex or generalized across both sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in polygamous species, reproductive success varies according to the relative abundances of mates (71), which is dictated by ASR and sex-specific survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ignoring sex-specific vital rates in polygamous species could misinform conservationists and wildlife management of population viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore how population growth varies under a two-sex model and a conventional one-sex model, we compared deterministic population growth of the two-sex model (M) with that of a one-sex model in which rates were averaged over both sexes (A):=[0FCJA],[10]where F is the average annual per capita fecundity of females (expressed as hatchlings), and  is the sex-averaged survival of chicks (C), juveniles (J), and adults (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deterministic growth () was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of A and the asymptotic value of t/t1 for M. To acknowledge uncertainty, we used the bootstrapped survival analysis described above by estimating the  of each iteration under the structure of A or M. We contrasted the central tendency and spread of these distributions to one another and the arithmetic average  of the actual population trend over the 7-year study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of our modeling and statistical analyses were conducted using R version You Stupid Darkness (72), with significance testing evaluated at =0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide all computer code and documentation as a PDF file written in Rmarkdown together with all of the raw datasets needed to reproduce our modeling and analyses (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MarkRecapture_Survival_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate daily chick survival (DCS), we used CormackJollySeber models with 1-day encounter intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is a strong nonlinear age effect on DCS in plovers (73, 74), our design matrices included chick age as a quadratic covariate (i.e., age2) with sex and year as factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the probability of survival from hatching to fledging was calculated simply as the product of all 25 age-specific estimates of DCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we used CormackJollySeber models to estimate juvenile and adult survival but with 1-year encounter intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juvenile and adult survival models were constructed from design matrices that included sex, year, and stage as factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we were interested in stage- and sex-specific estimates of survival, all models included a sex×stage component in the case of juvenile and adult analyses or a sex×age2 component in the case of chick analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way interactions between all variables were assessed for encounter probability modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed survival models with the R package RMark (75) and estimated demographic parameters via maximum likelihood implemented in program MARK (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated whether our data was appropriately dispersed (29) (i.e., c-hat  3) by using the median c-hat goodness-of-fit bootstrap simulation in program MARK (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimating_Hatching_Sex_Ratio  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for potential sex biases arising before the chick stage (i.e., sex allocation), we evaluated if the hatching sex ratio deviated significantly from parity using a general linear mixed effect model fit with binomial error and a logit function (R package lme4) (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the response variable was chick sex, and brood identifier was included as a random factor to control for the nonindependence of siblings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance was inferred from the intercept estimate, with =0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the precocial nature of plover chicks, posthatch brood mixing can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, our dataset for analyzing hatching sex ratio included only complete broods (i.e., no missing chicks) that were captured at the nest on the same day of hatching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluating_Uncertainty_of_the_ASR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate uncertainty in our estimate of ASR caused by sampling and process variation in our survival parameters, we implemented a bootstrapping procedure in which each bootstrap (i) randomly sampled our markrecapture data with replacement, (ii) ran the survival analyses described above, (iii) derived stage- and sex-specific estimates of apparent survival based on the model with the lowest corrected Akaikes information criterion (AICc), (iv) constructed the matrix model of these estimates, (v) derived the stable stage distribution through simulation of 1,000 time steps, and (vi) calculated ASR from the final stage distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach ensured that parameter correlations within the matrix were retained for each bootstrap and that the nonlinear mating function reached equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran 1,000 bootstraps and evaluated the accuracy of our ASR estimate by determining the 95% confidence interval of its bootstrapped distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our bootstrap procedure showed that variation in encounter probability of juveniles and adults was best explained by sex, year, and stage [model pyear+stage×sex: median AICc=0 (95% CI=07.58), mean wi=0.43 (95% CI=0.020.99)] (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the encounter probability of chicks was the same for males and females but varied among years and as a quadratic function of age [model pyear×age2: median AICc=0 (95% CI=01.97), mean wi=0.94 (95% CI=0.181)] (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our markrecapture data were not overdispersed [median c-hat=1.36 (95% CI=1.111.62)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
