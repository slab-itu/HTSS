Aurora kinase-induced phosphorylation excludes transcription factor RUNX from the chromatin to facilitate proper mitotic progression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Runt-related transcription factors (RUNX) are critical regulators of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation or dysregulation of RUNX genes have been associated with diverse cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of the strictly conserved threonine 173 (T173) residue within the Runt domain of RUNX3 disrupts DNA binding activity, which facilitates the recruitment of RUNX proteins to mitotic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, RUNX3 deficiency is associated with delayed mitotic entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tight conservation of T173 and its flanking residues from unicellular organism to human, and the fact that mitosis is indispensable to all metazoans, strongly indicate that T173 phosphorylation is fundamental to the role of RUNX in these divergent organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer-associated mutation T173I further corroborates the critical role of RUNX phosphorylation in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Runt-related transcription factors (RUNX) are master regulators of development and major players in tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, unlike most transcription factors, RUNX proteins are detected on the mitotic chromatin and apparatus, suggesting that they are functionally active in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify key sites of RUNX phosphorylation in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the phosphorylation of threonine 173 (T173) residue within the Runt domain of RUNX3 disrupts RUNX DNA binding activity during mitotic entry to facilitate the recruitment of RUNX proteins to mitotic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, knockdown of RUNX3 delays mitotic entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RUNX3 phosphorylation is therefore a regulatory mechanism for mitotic entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer-associated mutations of RUNX3 T173 and its equivalent in RUNX1 further corroborate the role of RUNX phosphorylation in regulating proper mitotic progression and genomic integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

RUNX_Proteins_Are_Hyperphosphorylated_at_Mitosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The localization of RUNX proteins at mitotic structures suggests direct involvement of RUNX proteins in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mitosis is regulated by phosphorylation events, we investigated RUNX phosphorylation using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In asynchronously (Asyn) growing cells, different migration patterns of phosphorylated RUNX1, -2, and -3 suggest unique phosphorylation signatures for each RUNX protein (Fig 1A, lane Asyn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then arrested with nocodazole (Noc), released from nocodazole block, and analyzed for RUNX phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During prometaphase, which was associated with high levels of cyclin B1 and activated mitotic kinases (Fig 1B, lane Noc), we detected marked reduction of RUNX mobility (Fig 1A, lane Noc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retardation of RUNX mobility indicated multiple phosphorylation sites in RUNX during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removal of nocodazole resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of RUNX proteins (Fig 1A, lane 1 h) as cells progressed to telophase (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T173_and_T14_Are_Critical_for_Mitotic-Specific_Hyperphosphorylation_of_RUNX3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because RUNX3 is believed to be the evolutionary founder of the human RUNX family (17), we focus on RUNX3 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify phosphorylation sites of RUNX3 in mitosis, we transiently expressed truncated forms of RUNX3 in COS7 cells and examined their phosphorylation state in the presence of nocodazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In asynchronously growing cells, both the N and C terminus of RUNX3 were phosphorylated, as indicated by slower migrating forms (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mitotic cells, there was an increase in the phosphorylation of the N terminus of RUNX3 (amino acids 1234) (Fig 1C, lane 4 from Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphatase treatment led to the collapse of the two prominent slower migrating bands, whereas the remaining rapidly migrating band indicated completely dephosphorylated RUNX3 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are multiple phosphorylation sites in the N terminus of RUNX3, where differences in mobility reflected the degree of phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For untreated cells, the C terminus (amino acids 182415) separated into two main bands, suggesting that 50% of the C terminus construct was phosphorylated (Fig 1C, lanes 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nocodazole treatment resulted in an additional upward shift in mobility, indicating mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the C terminus domain (Fig 1C, lanes 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with studies that showed that the C termini of RUNX1 and RUNX2 harbor mitotic kinase CDK1 phosphorylation sites (1316).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify phosphorylation sites in the RUNX3 N terminus, we introduced individual point mutations to abolish putative phosphorylation sites in the truncated RUNX3 protein (amino acids 1234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two mutants, threonine 14 alanine (T14A) and threonine 173 alanine (T173A), exhibited reduced phosphorylation during nocodazole treatmentinstead of the two slower migrating bands, there was only one of intermediate mobility, aside from the unphosphorylated RUNX3 (Fig 1D, lanes T14A and T173A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double mutant T14A/T173A showed severe dephosphorylation (Fig 1D, lane T14A/T173A), indicating that residues T14 and T173 are major phosphorylation sites in early mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate any artifact arising from truncation of the RUNX3 protein, these point mutations, either individually or in combination, were introduced into the full length RUNX3 cDNA (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In exponentially growing cells, the intensities of the two fastest migrating bands are reminiscent of the migration patterns of the RUNX3 C terminus truncation (compare Fig 1C and Fig 1E, Noc lanes), indicating that 50% of the RUNX3 protein is phosphorylated at the C terminus domain (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the multiple bands in the wild type and T173A mutant reflected multiple phosphorylation sites at the N terminus in untreated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, phosphorylation of the T14A mutant was notably diminished (Fig 1E, second lane from left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior phosphorylation at T14 is therefore important for subsequent phosphorylation events at the N terminus, even in nonmitotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon nocodazole treatment, wild-type RUNX3 was hyperphosphorylated, relative to T14A and T173A mutants (Fig 1E, compare lanes WT, T13A, and T173A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double mutant T14A/T173A (AA) showed a significant loss of phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding highlights the importance of both phospho-T173 and phospho-T14 for RUNX3 hyperphosphorylation during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T14 residue is conserved in RUNX1 but present as serine in RUNX2 (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both were previously shown to be phosphorylated (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T173 phosphorylation has not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T173 residue is conserved in all RUNX family members, including Runx1 and 2 of the unicellular holozoan Capsaspora owczarzaki and RNT-1 of the simple metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aurora_Kinases_Are_Involved_in_RUNX_Phosphorylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Computational prediction based on the phosphorylation site database (PHOSIDA) algorithm (21) suggests that T173 is a putative Aurora kinase phosphorylation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation of cells cotransfected with RUNX and Aurora kinases showed that all RUNX proteins interacted with Aurora kinases (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas both the N and the C terminus of RUNX3 interacted with Aurora kinases, the C terminus bound activated Aurora kinases with higher affinity (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the C terminus of RUNX3 is either (i) a possible docking site for active Aurora kinases or (ii) promotes activation of Aurora kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, coexpression of RUNX3 with Aurora A or B kinase led to a marked increase in RUNX3 phosphorylation (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding small molecule inhibitors of Aurora A or B kinases during nocodazole treatment resulted in decreased phosphorylation of RUNX3 (amino acids 1234) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in vitro kinase assays using recombinant proteins showed that Aurora A and B directly phosphorylated RUNX3 (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorylated_T173_RUNX_Is_Located_at_Mitotic_Structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain if T173 is phosphorylated in vivo, we generated an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated T173.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phospho-T173 antibody immunoprecipitated wild-type RUNX3 (amino acids 1234), but not the nonphosphorylatable T173A mutant (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the phospho-T173 antibody binds preferentially to full-length RUNX3 from mitotic cells (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody was unfortunately not suitable for immunoblot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these results indicate that T173 is preferentially phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the cellular distribution of T173-phosphorylated RUNX by performing immunostaining with phospho-T173 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the sequence of the synthetic phosphopeptide used as antigen is highly homologous for all RUNX proteins with only one amino acid difference in RUNX1 (Fig 1G), the antibody staining likely reflects the subcellular localization of all RUNX proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 (Fig 3C), as well as competition with excess phospho-T173 peptide (Fig 3D), significantly reduced staining intensity, thus validating the antibody for immunostaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lines COLO201, DLD1, and SNU5, with predominant RUNX1, RUNX2, or RUNX3 expression, respectively (Fig S2A), were also prominently stained by the phospho-T173 antibody during mitosis, compared with neighboring interphase cells, thus indicating that the antibody detects all three RUNX proteins specifically in mitosis (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells at early mitosis were strongly stained by phospho-T173 antibody (Fig 3E for COS7; Fig S2C for DLD1 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining intensity was strongest at regions not stained with DAPI (Fig 3C), suggesting that T173 phosphorylation might inhibit RUNX association with chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we detected phospho-T173 staining at the centrosome (indicated by -tubulin in Fig 3D) and midbody (indicated by -tubulin in Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phospho-T173 staining was detected at the centrosomes early in mitosis; as the cells progress to telophase, the phospho-T173 staining diminished and was mainly detected at the midbody (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevated levels of phospho-T173 at the centrosome, midzone, and midbody are reminiscent of the respective locations of Aurora A and B (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutation_of_T173_Results_in_Impairment_of_DNA_Binding_and_Transcription_Regulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed the effects of T14 and T173 mutations on RUNX3 DNA binding ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In electrophoretic mobility assay, the T14A and T14D mutations did not affect DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, T173A and T173D mutants were defective in DNA binding (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the T173I mutation was found in RUNX3 in the colon carcinoma cell line LS411, whereas its equivalent mutation in RUNX1 (T196I) was detected in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) (2325); the equivalent residue in RUNX2 was found to be mutated, also to isoleucine, in the disease cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that the T173 residue is important for the function of the Runt domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallography studies showed the T173 residue at the RuntDNA interface, where it contacts the phosphate backbone of the DNA helix through polar interactions (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacing threonine with a negatively charged (i.e., mimicking phosphorylation) or a neutral amino acid led to defective DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated the transactivation potential of the mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their DNA binding properties, T14 mutants showed comparable abilities to induce a RUNX responsive promoter (p14ARF) fused to firefly luciferase reporter (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation at T173 resulted in impairment of transcriptional activation of the p14ARF promoter, similar to other cancer-derived mutations of the Runt domain (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strong conservation of T173 and its flanking residues suggest that T173 phosphorylation altered the role of the Runt domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subcellular fractionation studies showed increased accumulation of T173 mutants in the cytosolic fraction, whereas wild-type RUNX3 was predominantly nuclear (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R143Q and G145E mutations, which affect DNA binding (29), also showed cytoplasmic accumulation, indicating that the cytoplasmic localization of the T173 mutants could be due to their inability to bind DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed pronounced localization of T173D mutants at the centrosome, relative to the wild type (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, immunoprecipitation of cytoplasmic RUNX3 revealed increased binding of the T173 mutants to the centrosomal marker -tubulin, compared with the wild type (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data indicate that T173 phosphorylation is a molecular switch that dissociates RUNX3 from DNA, inhibits its transcriptional regulatory role, and promotes relocalization to the cytoplasm and centrosome during early mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RUNX3 suppresses tumor formation through DNA binding and transactivation of growth inhibitory genes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the tumorigenic potential of the T173 mutants, stable wild-type RUNX3 and T173 mutant-expressing cells (Fig 4G, Left) were subjected to colony formation assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type RUNX3 inhibited colony formation, in contrast to the T173 mutants (Fig 4G, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA binding and transcription activation are therefore critical for RUNX3-mediated tumor suppression, whereas mutation at T173 might promote cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RUNX3_Is_Involved_in_Regulating_Mitotic_Entry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Aurora kinases promote RUNX3 phosphorylation, we investigated the effects of inhibiting Aurora kinases on RUNX3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Aurora B activity by siRNA-mediated depletion (Fig 5 A and B) or Aurora B-specific inhibitor (Fig 5C) resulted in down-regulation of endogenous RUNX3 protein levels, suggesting that Aurora B enhances RUNX3 protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that Aurora B stabilizes RUNX3 to ensure proper mitotic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, RUNX3 depletion in three cell types, namely U2OS osteosarcoma, HeLa cervical, and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells, was associated with reduced cyclin B1 levels during nocodazole treatment (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked if abrogation of other RUNX family members affected cyclin B1 accumulation during nocodazole treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U2OS cells were depleted of RUNX proteins by siRNA and treated with nocodazole (Fig 5E and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control siRNA-treated cells, individual depletion of RUNX1, RUNX2, or RUNX3 was associated with reduced accumulation of mitotic markers such as cyclin B1, phosphorylated Aurora, and PLK1 kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the effects of individual RUNX depletion were not uniform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with RUNX1 knockdown, RUNX3 knockdown showed a more severe reduction in cyclin B1 and phospho-PLK1 (Fig 5E and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RUNX2 depletion also revealed higher accumulation of cyclin B1, relative to RUNX1 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because RUNX3 knockdown also reduced RUNX2 expression (Fig S3), we were unable to evaluate the relative contributions of individual RUNX proteins to mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, depletion of all three RUNX proteins (siR123) resulted in a more pronounced reduction of mitotic markers such as phospho-Aurora kinases and phospho-Histone 3 (Fig 5E and Fig S3), suggesting functional redundancy for RUNX proteins in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RUNX deficiency is either associated with (ii) failure to enter mitosis or (ii) premature mitotic exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked whether RUNX3 deficiency affects mitotic entry by knocking down RUNX3 in HeLa fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) cells (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were synchronized at S phase by double thymidine block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After release from the block, time-lapse microscopy was used to follow the progression of cells from early S phase (i.e., cells with green fluorescence) to mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RUNX3 depletion delayed the onset of mitosis, suggesting that RUNX3 promotes mitotic entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether T173 phosphorylation contributes to mitotic entry, we subjected cells stably expressing wild-type RUNX3 and T173 mutants to thymidine block and monitored cell cycle progression following release from block (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of wild-type RUNX3 resulted in a drastic delay in cell cycle progressiona large population of cells remained at the G1 phase (Fig S4A, WT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with RUNX3s transcriptional activity in suppressing cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the T173 mutants did not delay cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and progressed to mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the vector control and T173A mutant, the T173D mutant accelerated entry into mitosis, as shown by increased numbers of phospho-Histone 3 (Ser 10)-positive cells at 9 h postthymidine release (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect of T173D indicates a role for T173 phosphorylation in facilitating mitotic entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we uncover a key phosphorylation site that endows RUNX3 with an unexpected role in the regulation of mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of T173 inhibits the DNA-binding function of the Runt domain, which in turn facilitates the redistribution of RUNX proteins to mitotic structures such as the centrosome and midbody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallography studies previously showed that T173 and its flanking residues constitute one of the key structural elements integral to the function of the Runt domain (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disease derived-mutation T173I (26, 31) (cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) resulted in drastic destabilization of the Runt domain and impairment of DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the ability of T173 mutants to form colonies on soft agar is indicative of a loss of growth suppressive function, suggesting that T173 phosphorylation must be tightly confined to mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequent overexpression of Aurora kinases in cancer might nullify RUNX3 transcription activity during nonmitotic phases and promote tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier, we identified an acetylation site at lysine 171 (K171), which promotes interaction between RUNX3 and BRD2 to mediate transcription (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolutionary conservation of the phospho-site T173 and acetyl-site K171, coupled with the strong preference of Aurora kinases for a positively charged residue at the 2 position (20), suggest cross-regulation between both types of modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One might expect acetylation/deacetylation of K171 to influence T173 phosphorylation during G2/M transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The localization of RUNX proteins at the chromatin, centrosome, and the midbody reflects multiple roles during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that only a subset of RUNX proteins is phosphorylated at T173 for recruitment to the mitotic structures, whereas another population of RUNX proteins (i.e., non-T173 phosphorylated) is retained at the mitotic chromatin for epigenetic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centrosome has been proposed to serve as a scaffold where regulatory proteins interact to determine cell cycle progression (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How RUNX3 interact with other centrosomal proteins is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the association of RUNX proteins with Aurora kinases indicates close relationships with regulators of mitotic progression and spindle assembly checkpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation that Runx3+/ mice develop intestinal adenoma after long latencies of 16 mo after birth (35) is reminiscent of other mice models with mitotic checkpoint deficienciesMad2 heterozygous mice develop lung adenocarcinomas at 1819 mo of age (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon carcinogenic insult, Runx3+/ and Runx3/ mice show accelerated tumor development compared with wild-type mice (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased incidence of tumor formation in Runx3+/ mice may, in part, be due to the role of RUNX proteins in regulating mitotic fidelity or DNA repair (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our work highlights the strong influence of posttranslational modification on RUNX function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tight conservation of T173 and K171 residues through divergent evolution indicates that all RUNX proteins possess non-DNA binding functions, which must be tightly regulated during cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More in-depth studies of RUNX posttranslational modification will enhance our understanding of RUNXs pleiotropic activities in the cell cycle as well as cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To ascertain binding of RUNX proteins with Aurora kinases, HEK293T cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes and transfected with Aurora kinase (7.5 µg) and EF-BOS RUNX (7.5 µg) expression vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed for immunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Flag immunoprecipitation or GFP immunoprecipitation, M2 Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and GFP Trap beads (Chromotek) were used, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates (400 µg) were incubated 500 µL of binding buffer [25 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)] with the respective beads for 3 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP beads were washed copiously with binding buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elute Flag-tagged proteins from M2 beads, 3× Flag peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound proteins were analyzed by 10% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE and immunoblot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunoprecipitation of the cytosolic extract, COS7 cells were transfected with the GFPRUNX3 constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, cell fractionation was performed and 200 µg of cytosolic extract was incubated with GFP beads in binding buffer (conditions as described above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 80% (vol/vol) ice cold ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS (Sigma) before incubation with phospho-Histone 3 (Ser 10) antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate) (9708, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature (dilution of 1:65 in blocking buffer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two washes with blocking buffer, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 µg/mL propidium iodide, 20 µg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry was conducted using a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analyzed by FlowJo software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lambda_Phosphatase_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
COS7 cells were transfected with Flag-RUNX3 (amino acids 1187) or Flag-RUNX3 (amino acids 182415).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCL pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.4 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates (30 µg) were incubated with 20 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C and analyzed by 12% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE (supplemented with Phos-tag).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Reporter_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293T cells were seeded on a 24-well dish and cotransfected with 100 ng p14ARF promoter linked to firefly luciferase and 500 ng pEGFP-RUNX3 constructs and 50 ng of -gal vector as internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, luciferase activities were analyzed with Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reactions were performed in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Beta-Glo assay (Promega) was used for the quantification of -galactosidase to normalize luciferase readings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Colony_Formation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa Tet-On cells were infected with pRetro-Tight-puro 3× Flag RUNX3 constructs, selected with puromycin for 4 d and cultured in media containing 0.5 µg/mL of doxycycline and 0.25 µg/mL of puromycin for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies were stained with 0.01% crystal violet (wt/vol) and photographed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies (at least 2 mm radius) were counted with the OpenCFU program (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subcellular_Fractionation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell fractionation was performed as described (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 15 µg of cytoplasmic, nuclear, or total cell extract was analyzed by 10% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
