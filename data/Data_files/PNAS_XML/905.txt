title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prolactin-responsive neurons in the medial preoptic area project widely throughout the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After targeted deletion of prolactin receptors in the preoptic area of adult female mice, mice were able to get pregnant and give birth normally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mothers lacking prolactin receptors in the medial preoptic area abandoned their litters soon after birth, establishing a critical role for prolactin/placental lactogen action in this area for establishment and maintenance of normal parental care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pregnancy hormones, such as prolactin, sensitize neural circuits controlling parental interactions to induce timely activation of maternal behaviors immediately after parturition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the medial preoptic area (MPOA) is known to be critical for maternal behavior, the specific role of prolactin in this brain region has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluated the role of prolactin action in the MPOA using complementary genetic strategies in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized prolactin-responsive neurons within the MPOA at different hormonal stages and delineated their projections in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that MPOA neurons expressing prolactin receptors (Prlr) form the nexus of a complex prolactin-responsive neural circuit, indicating that changing prolactin levels can act at multiple sites and thus, impinge on the overall activity of a distributed network of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional KO of Prlr from neuronal subpopulations expressing the neurotransmitters GABA or glutamate within this circuit markedly reduced the capacity for prolactin action both in the MPOA and throughout the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these manipulations, however, produced only subtle impacts on maternal care, suggesting that this distributed circuit is robust with respect to alterations in prolactin signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, acute deletion of Prlr in all MPOA neurons of adult female mice resulted in profound deficits in maternal care soon after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mothers abandoned their pups, showing that prolactin action on MPOA neurons is necessary for the normal expression of postpartum maternal behavior in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data establish a critical role for prolactin-induced behavioral responses in the maternal brain, ensuring survival of mammalian offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_MPOA_Forms_the_Nexus_of_a_Prolactin-Sensitive_Neural_Network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MPOA contains a large number of neurons expressing Prlr mRNA (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolactin typically activates transcriptional responses through the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway mediated by phosphorylation of STAT5 (pSTAT5) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the number of MPOA neurons showing prolactin-induced pSTAT5 was relatively low in nonpregnant mice but markedly increased during lactation (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest considerable plasticity in the MPOA during lactation, with enhanced transcriptional responses to prolactin, although there is no change in Prlr mRNA expression in this region at this time (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the role of prolactin-responsive neurons specifically in the MPOA, we next developed a mouse line in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the Prlr promoter using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We inserted the IRES-Cre construct immediately downstream of exon 10 of the Prlr gene, resulting in Cre expression in cells that express the long form of the Prlr (Prlr-iCre).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then crossed the Prlr-iCre animals with mice expressing a Cre-dependent GFP reporter (ROSA26-CAGS-GFP; eR26-GFP) (16) to fluorescently label prolactin-responsive neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because GFP associates with microtubules, it effectively labels neuronal processes of Prlr neurons as well as their cell bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GFP expression was restricted to areas known to express Prlr in the adult brain (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we detected high levels of GFP-positive cell bodies in the MPOA, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), arcuate nucleus (ARN), and medial amygdala (MeA) (Fig 1 and Fig S1), all regions that have previously been implicated in the neural circuitry governing parental behavior (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also detected GFP-positive fibers throughout the brain, including a number of areas, such as the supramammillary region and ventral tegmental area (VTA), that were devoid of Prlr-expressing cell bodies (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To specifically trace the projections of MPOA Prlr neurons, we stereotaxically injected a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Cre-dependent mCherry into this brain area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mCherry is anterogradely transported within neuronal processes labeling axons of the Cre-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After unilateral AAV injection into the MPOA of Prlr-iCre/eR26-GFP mice, we found that a subset of the Prlr neurons (green in Fig 1B) expressed mCherry (red in Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While mCherry-positive cell bodies were restricted to the side of the injection, we identified extensive mCherry-positive projections from the MPOA Prlr neurons (Fig 1), predominantly but not exclusively on the ipsilateral side (quantified in Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the major projections connected to regions that also showed high levels of GFP in cell bodies, indicating prolactin-responsive neurons, such as the BNST, PVN, ARN, and VMH (Fig 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, few of these areas showed mCherry-positive staining in the cell bodies, which would have been indicative of retrograde transport of the marker, suggesting that the observed fiber staining was localized almost exclusively in projections from the MPOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that MPOA Prlr-expressing neurons form the nexus of a complex prolactin-responsive neural circuit, indicating that changing prolactin levels may significantly impinge on the overall activity of a distributed network of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conditional_KO_Mice_Lacking_Prolactin_Receptors_in_Glutamate_and_or_GABA_Neurons_Display_Mild_Perturbations_of_Maternal_Behaviors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the functional role of prolactin in GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neuronal populations, we deleted the Prlr gene from GABA and/or glutamate neurons using VGat-Cre and VGlut2-Cre mouse strains (17) in combination with Prlrlox/lox animals (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Prlrlox/lox/VGlut2-Cre mice, there was a 25% loss of prolactin-induced pSTAT5 in the MPOA (P = 0.028), confirming successful deletion of Prlr in glutamate neurons in this area (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these animals showed an almost complete loss of prolactin-induced pSTAT5 in the PVN and VMH, suggesting that all prolactin-responsive neurons in these regions are glutamatergic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional deletion of Prlr in GABA neurons (Prlrlox/lox/VGat-Cre) resulted in a 50% decrease in prolactin-induced pSTAT5 in the MPOA (P = 0.038) (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice also had an almost total loss of pSTAT5 in the MeA as well as reduced STAT5 activation in the ARN and BNST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall change in numbers of neurons responding to prolactin in each of the prolactin-responsive nuclei in the maternal circuit is illustrated schematically in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both conditional KO strains were fertile and able to carry a pregnancy to term, although an increased number of the animals abandoned their litters (two or fewer pups alive on day 3 of lactation) compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this difference for Prlrlox/lox/VGlut2-Cre mice (3 of 12 abandoned litters) was not significantly different from controls (1 of 18; P = 0.274), Prlrlox/lox/VGat-Cre mice showed higher levels of litter loss (7 of 20; P = 0.045) (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the majority of animals in each genotype was able to maintain their litters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice with surviving litters, we completed a pup retrieval experiment both in the home cage on day 3 postpartum and in a novel cage [a slightly more rigorous test of maternal behavior (18)] on day 5 postpartum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant effect of loss of Prlr in either GABA or glutamate neurons on pup retrieval in the home cage of postpartum female mice (Fig 2 F and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the novel cage compared with the home cage, all mice took significantly longer to retrieve their pups and crouch over them in a newly constructed nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prlrlox/lox/VGlut2-Cre mice were not significantly different from control animals in performing this task in the novel cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, while Prlrlox/lox/VGat-Cre exhibited normal retrieval of the pups, they took significantly longer to crouch over the pups and exhibit full maternal behavior (P = 0.041) (Fig 2 G and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining both Cre alleles to generate mice lacking Prlr in both GABA and glutamate neurons resulted in approximately additive effects in terms of loss of prolactin responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animals had markedly reduced prolactin-induced pSTAT5 in the MPOA (75%; P = 0.004) as well as almost total loss of responses in the PVN, VMH, and MeA (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, the animals were no worse off in terms of maternal behavior, and most of them were able to care for their litters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, however, none of the manipulations above generated a complete loss of Prlr throughout the circuit, raising the possibility that the few remaining prolactin-responsive neurons in the MPOA were sufficient to sustain maternal behavior that was only mildly impaired compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acute_Deletion_of_Prolactin_Receptors_from_the_MPOA_in_Adults_Abolishes_Maternal_Nursing_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this hypothesis and specifically investigate the role of prolactin action in postpartum maternal behavior, we used an AAV to deliver Cre recombinase into the MPOA of adult female Prlrlox/lox mice (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Prlrlox/lox construct is designed such that Cre-mediated recombination will activate GFP expression and thus, report successful Prlr deletion (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV-Cre injection into the MPOA of Prlrlox/lox mice completely removed functional prolactin responses from this region (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect was highly localized, as there was little or no expression of GFP in the nearby PVN, and prolactin-induced pSTAT5 was unaffected in that and other nuclei (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three days after injection, animals were mated and monitored throughout pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no effect of treatment on the time taken to get pregnant or the duration of pregnancy (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals gave birth to normal-sized litters and initiated the normal pup-directed activities (19), retrieving the pups to a nest, cleaning and grooming the pups, and eating the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having initiated these behaviors, however, the animals failed to establish full maternal care defined as crouching over the pups in a nest and assuming an arched back posture (kyphosis) to facilitate nursing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals failed to crouch over the pups, and over the course of the next 24 h, all of the mothers lacking Prlr in the MPOA abandoned their litters, resulting in death of all pups (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no evidence that the Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre animals ever suckled their young after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examined in the first 6 h after birth (in the cross-fostering study; see below), the pups showed no signs of a milk band in their stomachs, and the mothers did not have elongated nipples or matted fur around the nipples, the normal signs of suckling seen in the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, control animals injected with AAV-Cre or saline-injected Prlrlox/lox animals showed normal maternal behavior and successfully raised their pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-fostering of pups confirmed a deficit in maternal care rather than in pup viability, with pups from two Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre litters surviving after cross-fostering to control Prlrlox/lox dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, pups from control Prlrlox/lox dams did not survive after cross-fostering onto Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre dams, despite apparently normal retrieval (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, after initiation of normal pup-directed behaviors, the animals never established full maternal care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that prolactin (or placental lactogen) action in the MPOA of the postpartum female, via the Prlr, is absolutely essential for normal expression of maternal care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data establish a critical role for prolactin in mammalian reproduction that is more comprehensive than simply milk production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolactin-induced behavioral responses in the maternal brain are equally important in ensuring survival of mammalian offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maternal behavior can be broadly classified into two components that are mediated by separate but interacting neuronal circuits (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One circuit, involving structures such as the MeA and VMH, controls pup-directed avoidance and aggression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This must be inactivated to promote attraction and retrieval of pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second circuit, focused around the MPOA, is associated with the expression of parental care and must be activated to promote actions, such as nest formation, pup retrieval, grooming, and nursing of the pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that prolactin can influence both of these circuits, with Prlr expression detected in multiple regions within these distributed neural networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this widespread distribution of Prlr, it was surprising that conditional deletion of Prlr in GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons, which markedly reduced the number of neurons responding to prolactin, had only a subtle effect on maternal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, pup retrieval was relatively normal after all manipulations, raising the possibility that this function may be independent of prolactin action in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was noteworthy that the most significant impact of the conditional deletion experiments came when Prlr were deleted in GABAergic neurons, which are the largest population of neurons normally activated during expression of maternal behavior (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, however, the relatively subtle effects suggest that the maternal behavior circuit is very robust and that prolactin action within this circuit is somewhat redundant under normal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be a consequence of the distributed nature of the network, with prolactin able to act on the circuit at multiple sites, or developmental compensation after constitutive loss of Prlr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the subtle effects seen in the conditional KOs, complete deletion of Prlr from the MPOA in the adult profoundly impaired maternal nursing behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether similar adult-onset KO of Prlr in the other parts of the distributed network might have specific effects on different components of maternal behavior remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When pups from the mothers lacking Prlr in the MPOA were cross-fostered onto control mothers, they were able to suckle and appeared completely normal, showing that the deficit was a maternal one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that specific deletion of Prlr in the MPOA caused a failure of lactation or milk ejection and that the mothers abandoned the litters because of an inability to feed the pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of these animals to maintain a pregnancy, however, suggests that prolactin (and placental lactogen) was adequate to sustain the corpus luteum (6) and therefore, likely sufficient for mammary gland development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the ability of the animals to give birth normally suggests at least some level of function of the oxytocin system (20), meaning that milk ejection would likely have occurred had the animals suckled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to maternal behavior, the MPOA has a number of important homeostatic roles, including thermoregulation, sleep, and social reward (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, maternal behavior could be impacted if losing the influence of prolactin on these functions also impaired pregnancy-related adaptations in the maternal brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these possibilities warrant additional investigation, the observation that the animals never properly initiated nursing of the pups suggests that the observed deficits were more likely to directly result from a lack of prolactin input into the circuitry controlling maternal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MPOA has a critical role in linking the multiple regions involved in maternal behavior and in integrating the various hormonal and sensory inputs that influence the behavior (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies have traced connections from the MPOA to other structures involved in the maternal circuit, and have demonstrated a major output of the system to midbrain effector regions, such as the VTA (and nucleus accumbens) (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that some of these projections are derived from prolactin-responsive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After deletion of Prlr in the MPOA in adult females, the mothers initially showed appropriate pup-directed behavior, grooming the pups after birth and consuming the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these interactions were not sustained, and the mothers never exhibited full maternal care and abandoned their pups within 24 h of birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems that prolactin action in the MPOA is necessary for the normal function of the maternal network, possibly altering the key output of the network to regions that reinforce the behavior (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be mediated by prolactin itself but also by the closely related placental lactogens that act on the Prlr and are elevated in the blood throughout the second half of pregnancy (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, unlike some recent reports that have used cell ablation approaches (26, 27) or blockade of neurotransmitter production (28, 29) to identify critical cell types mediating maternal behavior, in this model, the neuronal circuitry is completely intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The profound deficit arises specifically from the lack of appropriate hormonal input into these circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generation and genotyping of Prlr-iCre and Prlrlox/lox mice (11) are detailed elsewhere (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prlr-iCre mice were crossed with ROSA26-CAGS-GFP reporter animals (16), generating mice that express GFP specifically in Prlr-expressing neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VGat- and VGlut2-IRES-Cre mice, originally developed by Brad Lowell (17), were purchased from Jackson Labs [Slc32a1tm2(cre)Lowl/MwarJ (stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  028862) and Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl/MwarJ (stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  028863), respectively].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were crossed with our Prlrlox/lox mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Cre-mediated inversion deletes the Prlr gene and knocks in EGFP in its place (11), EGFP expression in the brain was used as a marker for both successful recombination and for the normal pattern of receptor expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, double-Cre animals were generated initially by breeding male VGat-Cre +ve mice with female VGlut-Cre +ve mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a number of double-Cre males had been produced, the breeding strategy was changed to cross double-Cre male mice with homozygous Prlrlox/lox females (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups of WT C57BL/6J (B6) mice were used as additional control groups in some experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were used as adults (814 wk) and were group-housed under conditions of controlled temperature (22 °C ± 1 °C) and lighting (12-h light and 12-h dark cycles with lights on at 0600 hours), with ad libitum access to food and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal experimental protocols were approved by the University of Otago or the University of Saarland animal ethics committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stereotaxic_Injections_of_AAV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult mice (812 wk old) were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tract tracing experiments, Prlr-iCre/eR26-GFP females received unilateral 1-µL injections of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-pA (5 × 1012; UNC Vector Core) into the MPOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gene KO experiments, Prlrlox/lox animals received bilateral 1-L injections of AAV2-CMV-PI-Cre-rBG (2.27 × 1013; Penn Vector Core) into the MPOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All injections were given at a rate of 100 nL/min, and the syringes were left in situ for 3 min before and 10 min after injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates for the MPOA were 0.07 mm anterior to Bregma and 0.3 mm lateral to midline, and depth was adjusted for age (8 wk: 4.7-mm depth; 10 wk: 4.9-mm depth; 12 wk: 5.0-mm depth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control group of WT C57BL/6J mice received bilateral AAV-Cre injections, and a control group of Prlrlox/lox mice received saline injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tract_Tracing_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two to four weeks after viral injection, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were prepared for immunohistochemistry for mCherry and GFP (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were imaged using the Axio Imager M2 microscope with AxioVision software (Zeiss) and then ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were split into single channels, regions of interest were assigned to individual brain regions, and percentages of each area occupied by mCherry-positive signal above threshold, as calculated by the Triangle method (30), were obtained (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monitoring_of_Maternal_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seventy-two hours after AAV-Cre injection, females were individually housed with a WT C57BL/6J male mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful mating was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug, the male was removed, and day of parturition was recorded as day 1 of lactation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pup survival was monitored daily, and total number of live pups was recorded on day 3 of lactation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal behavior in the home cages (with their own pups) was recorded 624 h after parturition in groups of Prlrlox/lox (n = 4), B6/AAV-Cre (n = 2), and Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre (n = 4) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of time that the dam spent over the pups in the nest, elsewhere in the cage, and eating were calculated during both the light and dark periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of time that pups were gathered in a nest was also calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether any deficit in maternal care was caused by pup-related factors, pups from two Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre mothers were cross-fostered onto Prlrlox/lox control dams, with control pups placed with the KO mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pups were collected as soon as possible after birth (within 6 h) and were checked for general health and the presence of milk bands in their stomach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the mothers were assessed for evidence of suckling (matted fur around the nipples and/or elongated nipples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pups were then placed with the new mother and observed for the next 48 h. Pup retrieval behavior was tested in home cages on day 3 of lactation (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate Prlr expression in the MPOA of Prlrlox/lox mice, brains were processed for the presence of EGFP immunoreactivity (to indicate Cre-dependent recombination in the Prlrlox/lox mice and therefore, represent cells that expressed Prlr before recombination) and prolactin-induced pSTAT5 [a sensitive and reliable marker of activated Prlr (12)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pups were removed from dams on days 710 of lactation at 0900 hours, and at 1215 hours, dams were administered with ovine prolactin (5 mg/kg injection i.p.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially 45 min after prolactin administration with 4% paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were removed, postfixed for 1 h in the same fixative, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three sets of 30-m-thick coronal sections through the forebrain from each animal were cut using a sliding microtome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One series of tissue each was used to examine pSTAT5 and EGFP expression by chromagen immunohistochemistry as previously described (11, 12) (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of pSTAT5 labeling in the MPOA of lactating Prlrlox/lox (n = 48) mice was undertaken by counting the total number of pSTAT5-labeled nuclei in two sections per animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were anatomically matched between each different animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images were collected with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10× objective (or 20× for the inset figures in Fig 1 DF) using the Axio Imager M2 microscope with a motorised stage and filters for fluorescent dyes (Zeiss Fs 43, AHF Analysentechnik F36-526, and F36-500 for Cy3, Alexa488, and Hoechst, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MozaiX module in the AxioVision software (Zeiss) was used to acquire whole brain images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the area containing a brain section was defined, focus was adjusted manually, the area was scanned with three filters, and individual images in the area were stitched together automatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prlr Cre mice were generated using homologous recombination in mouse ES cells (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The targeting construct was designed to insert an IRES and the sequence for Cre recombinase immediately after exon 10 in the Prlr gene (specific for the long form of the Prlr), with a flippase recognition target (FRT)-flanked neomycin resistance cassette for selection of clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeras that were backcrossed to C57BL/6J animals to give Prlr-iCreneo+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove the neomycin resistance cassette, Prlr-iCreneo+ animals were bred to Flp recombinase deleter mice (31) to result in Prlr-iCreneo (Prlr-iCre) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flippase (flp)-mediated excision of the selection cassette was verified by Southern blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prlr-specific expression of Cre was validated by crossing Prlr-iCre mice with ROSA26-CAGS-GFP reporter animals (32), with expression of GFP restricted to regions known to express the long form of Prlr (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Double-Vgat/VGlut Cre animals were generated initially by breeding male VGat-Cre +ve mice with female VGlut-Cre +ve mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To genotype the double-Cre animals, it was necessary to use a strategy that specifically distinguished the presence of Cre within the VGat or VGlut gene (as opposed to a generic Cre genotype) using the following combinations of primers to generate bands of 300 bp in WT animals or 800 bp in the presence of the IRES-Cre cassette:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunohistochemistry for GFP and pSTAT5 was conducted as previously described (11, 12) using 30-µm sections cut on a sliding microtome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To label GFP, sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP (1:10,000; A-6455; Life Technologies) for 48 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To label pSTAT5, an antigen retrieval procedure was performed on all tissue before immunohistochemistry for pSTAT5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-pSTAT5 primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-pSTAT5; Tyr-694, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) for 72 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GFP and pSTAT5 labeling, sections were incubated for 90 min in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 for GFP, 1:200 for pSTAT5; Vector Laboratories) followed by a 90-min incubation in Vector Elite avidinbiotinHRP complex (1:100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peroxidase labeling was visualized with nickel-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride using glucose oxidase to create a black nuclear precipitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP and prolactin-induced pSTAT5 labeling in the MPOA were assessed in all AAV-Cre administered mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only mice showing widespread GFP labeling and the complete absence of pSTAT5 labeling throughout the MPOA were included for analysis of maternal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tract tracing experiments, brains were removed and frozen in tissue freezing medium (Leica); 14-µm coronal sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect mCherry and GFP expression, sections were incubated in rabbit anti-DsRed (1:1,000; catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  632496; Clontech) and chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000; A10262; Invitrogen) antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by goat anti-rabbit Cy3 and anti-chicken Alexa 488 (1:400; A10520 and A11039, respectively; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Pup retrieval behavior was tested in home cages on day 3 of lactation in groups of Prlrlox/lox (n = 8), Prlrlox/lox/VGlut-Cre (n = 8), Prlrlox/lox/VGat-Cre (n = 12), B6 (n = 10), Prlrlox/lox (n = 8), B6/AAV-Cre (n = 4), Prlrlox/lox/saline (n = 3), and Prlrlox/lox/AAV-Cre (n = 7) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 0900 and 1100 hours on postpartum day 3, all pups were removed from the dams home cage, and 5 min later, three age-matched foster pups were placed into the cage at the opposite end from her nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All pup-directed and other behaviors were recorded for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time taken to retrieve each pup and to place it into her nest was assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After pup retrieval assessment, the dams own pups were returned to her.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On postpartum day 5, pup retrieval in a novel cage was tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dams were moved into a clean, novel cage and allowed to settle for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of her own pups were then placed into three corners of the cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time taken to retrieve each pup and the time taken to form a nest with the three pups were recorded over a 3-h testing period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After testing, dams were returned to their home cage with their pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are reported as mean ± SEM; all statistical analyses were undertaken using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad), and P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVAs and unpaired t tests were used to statistically compare the time taken from mating to presence of plug and gestation length between genotypes, and a Tukey post hoc test was used where appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analyzing numbers of neurons expressing pSTAT5 in specific regions, unpaired t tests were performed between control and Cre-expressing groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Home cage maternal behavior 624 h postpartum was assessed by two-way ANOVA, and Sidaks multiple comparisons test was used to identify statistically significant changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVAs were used to compare pup retrieval behavior between MPOA AAV-Cre or saline-injected groups, and unpaired t tests were used to compare pup retrieval behavior in the home and novel cage tests between control and Cre-expressing groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pup survival was assessed by Fishers exact test to compare the number of litters with fewer than two live pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
