Exceedingly small iron oxide nanoparticles as positive MRI contrast agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are currently the mainstream clinical MRI contrast agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some GBCAs have shown a long-term toxicitynephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)and Gd depositions in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NSF has triggered a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black-box warning and a contraindication of some GBCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of Gd depositions led to an ongoing FDA investigation to monitor their possible long-term adverse effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging and angiography using zwitterion-coated exceedingly small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ZES-SPIONs) in mice and rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Renal clearance and biodistribution results further demonstrate that ZES-SPIONs are qualitatively different from previously reported SPIONs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work may open up opportunities to develop exceedingly small SPIONs that show effective T1 contrast as Gd-free alternatives to GBCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Medical imaging is routine in the diagnosis and staging of a wide range of medical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for visualizing soft tissue and organs, with over 60 million MRI procedures performed each year worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About one-third of these procedures are contrast-enhanced MRI, and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are the mainstream MRI contrast agents used in the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GBCAs have shown efficacy and are safe to use with most patients; however, some GBCAs have a small risk of adverse effects, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), the untreatable condition recently linked to gadolinium (Gd) exposure during MRI with contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Gd deposition in the human brain has been reported following contrast, and this is now under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address a perceived need for a Gd-free contrast agent with pharmacokinetic and imaging properties comparable to GBCAs, we have designed and developed zwitterion-coated exceedingly small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ZES-SPIONs) consisting of 3-nm inorganic cores and 1-nm ultrathin hydrophilic shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ZES-SPIONs are free of Gd and show a high T1 contrast power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the potential of ZES-SPIONs in preclinical MRI and magnetic resonance angiography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Air-sensitive materials were handled under dry nitrogen atmosphere with oxygen levels less_than0.2 ppm in an Omni-Lab VAC glove box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All solvents were purchased from EMD Biosciences and spectrophotometric grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the SPIONs were obtained with a JEOL 200CX electron microscope operated at 120 kV and a JEOL 2010 electron microscope operated at 200 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Potential measurements were performed on a Malvern Instruments Nano-ZS90.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetization measurements were performed on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice for urine study were acquired from Charles River Laboratories International, and they were housed in the Division of Comparative Medicine at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were studied in accordance with approved institutional protocols at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice and rats were anesthetized by either i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of ketamine and xylazine or inhalation of isoflurane and oxygen gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional experimental details about synthesis, characterizations, relaxivity measurements, and MR imaging are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthesis_of_SPIONs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using 3-nm SPIONs as an example, 0.900 g of Fe(oleate)3 and 190 µL of oleic acid were added into a mixture of 4.0 mL of 1-tetradecene and 1.0 mL of 1-hexadecene at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30-min degassing at 100 °C, the temperature of reaction mixture was rapidly increased to a final temperature of 270 °C, and then kept constant for 1 h. Then the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to RT upon the completion of the reaction, followed by the addition of 0.113 g of (CH3)3NO oxidizing agent (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction temperature was then increased to 130 °C and held constant for 1 h to fully oxidize the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 40 mL of acetone was added, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was then discarded and the SPION pellet was dispersed and stored in hexane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results show that 3-nm SPIONs have 18.33% Fe and 81.67% O (by weight), where the excess amount of oxygen should be from organic ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Organic_Ligands_and_Ligand_Exchange  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zwitterionic dopamine sulfonate (ZDS) (Mr: 300 g/mol) was synthesized and ZDS-coated SPIONs were prepared according to the protocol in the supporting information in a previously published manuscript (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -potential of ZDS-coated 3-nm SPIONs was measured to be 5.02 ± 0.20 mV, which is almost neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gel_Filtration_Chromatography_and_Hydrodynamic_Diameter_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gel filtration chromatography (GFC) measurements with a size-exclusion column were done by using the protocols in our prior publications (35, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being filtered by Whatman 0.02-µm filter, ZDS-coated 3.0-nm core SPIONs [zwitterionic dopamine sulfonate-coated exceedingly small SPIONs (ZES-SPIONs)] in PBS (pH 7.4) have a narrow size distribution with a retention time peak of 35.2 min, as shown in Fig S3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S3B, after calibrating the size-exclusion column with protein standards (Bio-Rad; catalog #151-1901) containing thyroglobulin [P1, hydrodynamic diameter (HD) = 18.8 nm], -globulin (P2, HD = 11.1 nm), ovalbumin (P3, HD = 6.1 nm), myoglobin (P4, HD = 3.8 nm), and vitamin B12 (P5, HD = 1.67 nm), it can be found that the relationship between retention time (in minutes) and HD (in nanometers) is as follows: HD = 80.6291 + 11.79692*time  0.43275*time2 + 0.00473*time3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a retention time peak of 35.2 min corresponds to an averaged HD of 4.7 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the ZDS ligand only contributes 1 nm to the overall radius, and the size change induced by the ZDS ligand and their stability are consistent with our prior study (35, 37); in particular, these ZDS-coated SPIONs can have a HD smaller than the 5.5-nm threshold for efficient renal clearance (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_MR_Relaxivity_Measurements_at_7_T  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The r1 and r2 relaxivities of our ZDS-coated SPIONs were measured on a 7-T MRI scanner to evaluate their performance as T1 contrast agents (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were linearly diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) to span concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPION dilutions were then added to the center of a 384-well microtiter plate (BD Falcon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remaining wells were filled with PBS to reduce susceptibility-based image artifacts and improve shimming efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relaxivity data were collected at ambient temperatures on a Bruker Avance III 7T MRI scanner with a 20-cm bore and using a Bruker Biospin MRI coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2-mm horizontal slice was imaged through the center of the filled wells with a spin echo pulse sequence using a 10-ms echo time (TE) and a 73-ms to 3-s repetition time (TR = 73, 116, 186, 298, 477, 763, 1,220, 1,953, and 3,125 ms) to collect T1 relaxation times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, TE = 10 ms, 30 echos, and TR = 3,125 ms were used to collect T2 relaxation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty time points of 2D CarrPurcellMeiboomGill (CPMG) echo images (TE = 10300 ms with 10-ms interval) were collected as 256 × 256-point matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were subsequently analyzed using custom Matlab (Mathworks) routines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The echo time vs. integrated intensity from imaged wells was fit to an exponential to obtain transverse (R2) and longitudinal (R1) relaxation rates for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported relaxivities, r1 and r2, are computed from the slope of the relationship between relaxation rate and iron concentration for each sample dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table S1, the r2/r1 ratio of our ZDS-coated SPIONs can be tuned between 11 and 18 at 7 T, and the r2/r1 ratio of Feraheme is 22 at 7 T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MR_Relaxivity_Measurements_at_15_T_and_Mouse_Urine_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relaxivity measurements were performed on a 1.5-T (clinical magnetic field strength) bench-top Bruker minispec relaxometer, and the results were averaged based on three batches of ZES-SPIONs that were individually synthesized using the same protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After relaxivity measurements, ZES-SPIONs were digested by hydrochloric acid and their iron concentrations were determined by bathophenanthroline assay according to the protocols in our previous publication (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table S2, batch  (e.g., used for MRI and MR angiography): r1 = 5.0 mM1s1, r2 = 9.9 mM1s1, r2/r1 = 2.0; batch  (e.g., used for 59Fe-labeled biodistribution): r1 = 4.1 mM1s1, r2 = 7.8 mM1s1, r2/r1 = 1.9; batch  (e.g., used for mouse urine study): r1 = 6.6 mM1s1, r2 = 13.8 mM1s1, r2/r1 = 2.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, on average, the relaxivities of ZES-SPIONs at 1.5 T in PBS are as follows: r1 = 5.2 mM1s1, r2 = 10.5 mM1s1, r2/r1 = 2.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in a mouse urine study, ZES-SPIONs (batch ) were i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injected into four mice separately, and their urine was collected after 2.5 h. The relaxivities of ZES-SPIONs in urine (after renal clearance) were again measured on a 1.5-T bench-top Bruker minispec relaxometer, and their iron concentrations were also determined, yielding the results: r1 = 4.7 mM1s1, r2 = 9.1 mM1s1, r2/r1 = 1.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the iron determination process of urine samples, we note that the acidified mouse urine generally forms white precipitates and has a brown color of supernatants, upon the addition of hydrochloric acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the as-determined iron concentrations of urine samples may include some systematic errors, and therefore we use the r2/r1 ratio, which is independent of iron concentration results, for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_MRI_of_Rat_(Fig_S4A)_and_Mouse_(Fig_S4B)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MRI studies were accomplished using small-animal MRI systems at 7 T (Bruker) with a mouse body coil and at 9.4 T (Bruker) with a rat body coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dosage was 0.2 mmol [Fe]/kg animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice and rats were anesthetized by the inhalation of 98% oxygen and 2% isoflurane (500 mL/min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respiration rate was maintained at 30 beats per min by adjusting the concentration of isoflurane, and mice and rats were kept warm at 37 °C in the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respiration gating on MRI was enabled by the use of a pressure pad (SA Instrument).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the 7-T scanner, sagittal 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence (FLASH) was used: field of view (FOV), 50 mm × 29.7 mm; matrix, 256 × 152; number of slices, 10; slice thickness, 220 µm; TR = 6 ms; TE = 2 ms; flip angle, 30°; number of average, 1; dynamics, 40; resulting in a scan time of 30 min by a temporal resolution of 46 s per 3D volume and a voxel size 195 × 195 × 220 µm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scanning at 9.4 T, the following parameters were used: multi slice multi echo sequence (MSME); FOV, 120 mm × 120 mm; matrix, 256 × 256; spatial resolution, 469 × 469 µm; number of slices, 12; slice thickness, 2 mm; TR = 298 ms; TE = 10.7 ms; flip angle, 166.5°; number of averages, 2; scan time per image, 2 min, 32.6 s. Eight scans were collected and were spaced 5 min apart for the total experiment time of 1 h. By using MRI scanners, the T1-weighted MR images of rat and mouse injected with ZES-SPIONs are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen in Fig S4A that ZES-SPIONs first circulate in the blood vessels and that, beginning at 10 min postinjection, ZES-SPIONs begin to accumulate in the bladder (red oval) showing strong positive contrast, indicating a renal clearance and a high T1 contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenomenon was observed in mouse with a 7-T MRI scanner: in Fig S4B, at 6 min postinjection, ZES-SPIONs are observed in the heart (blue oval) and kidney (yellow oval), showing positive contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 12 min postinjection, ZES-SPIONs begin to accumulate in the bladder (red oval).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the ZES-SPIONs are cleared from heart and kidney, a second injection of ZES-SPIONs was introduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 5 min post-second injection, ZES-SPIONs are again observed in the heart (blue oval) and kidney (yellow oval).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNR was measured by the mean signal intensity of a region of interest divided by the SD in air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNR is the difference of two SNR values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative signal enhancement is the signal intensity change due to the injection divided by the signal intensity before the injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4 angiography data, the brightness in the images was adjusted by using the auto window function of ImageJ by putting a region of interest over the aorta descendants and the surrounding tissue: baseline images were averaged and used to be subtracted from the images to produce background-free images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next step, maximum intensity projections under various view angles were produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Analysis_of_Mouse_Urine_with_Contrast_in_the_Bladder  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A quantitative analysis was performed on the MRI scan in Fig 4 AJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a specific time point, the area of urine (region of interest with positive contrast) was first calculated for each sagittal slice and then multiplied by the thickness of one sagittal slice (220 m); the volume of urine with contrast is given by the sum of the results of all sagittal slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5A shows that iron oxide nanoparticles begin to accumulate in the bladder at 5 min, increasing until the last time point at 23 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of urine with contrast is expected to decrease upon the excretion of urine at later time points, as shown in Fig 4K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5B reports that the blood half-life of ZES-SPIONs in mice is 19 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Biodistribution_of_ES-SPIONs_by_59Fe_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incorporation of 59Fe into the PEG-coated ES-SPION (intermediate ligand during ligand exchange) was performed according to previously published methods (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59Fe incorporation into the ES-SPION inorganic core was confirmed by GFC, which showed radioactivity solely in the fraction containing ES-SPIONs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five mice received tail vein injection of 0.02 mmol [Fe]/kg of radiolabeled ES-SPIONs followed by whole-body and cage radioactivity measurement at 4 and 24 h, during which time mice were awake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, mice were euthanized in accordance with approved institutional protocols at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and organs were harvested for individual organ radioactivity measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

XRD_of_Ferumoxytol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
XRD measurement was performed on ferumoxytol ( greater than 2-y shelf life) by using a PANalytical XPert Pro platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its composition was analyzed by PANalytical HighScore Plus software, yielding the result of 68% magnetite and 32% maghemite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the majority of ferumoxytol is magnetite, which remained stable in air over an extended period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
