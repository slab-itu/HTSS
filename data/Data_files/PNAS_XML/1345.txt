title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preordering of water is not needed for ice recognition by hyperactive antifreeze proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antifreeze proteins have evolved to inhibit ice growth in organisms living at subfreezing temperatures; the mechanism by which these proteins recognize and bind ice is not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that antifreeze proteins recognize ice by preordering water at the ice-binding site already in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use multiresolution molecular simulations to demonstrate that preordering of interfacial water is not needed for ice recognition by antifreeze proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that preordering could emerge on the large ice-binding surfaces of aggregates of ice-nucleating proteins, where it may assist with ice nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) inhibit ice growth in organisms living in cold environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperactive insect AFPs are particularly effective, binding ice through anchored clathrate motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized that the binding of hyperactive AFPs to ice is facilitated by preordering of water at the ice-binding site (IBS) of the protein in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antifreeze protein TmAFP displays the best matching of its binding site to ice, making it the optimal candidate to develop ice-like order in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use multiresolution simulations to unravel the mechanism by which TmAFP recognizes and binds ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that water at the IBS of the antifreeze protein in solution does not acquire ice-like or anchored clathrate-like order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice recognition occurs by slow diffusion of the protein to achieve the proper orientation with respect to the ice surface, followed by fast collective organization of the hydration water at the IBS to form an anchored clathrate motif that latches the protein to the ice surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations suggest that anchored clathrate order could develop on the large ice-binding surfaces of aggregates of ice-nucleating proteins (INP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute the infrared and Raman spectra of water in the anchored clathrate motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signatures of the OH stretch of water in the anchored clathrate motif can be distinguished from those of bulk liquid in the Raman spectra, but not in the infrared spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus suggest that Raman spectroscopy may be used to probe the anchored clathrate order at the ice-binding surface of INP aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure of TmAFP and its binding to ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Side view of TmAFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threonine residues at the IBS are shown inside the dotted region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydroxyl and methyl groups of the threonine at the IBS are shown with blue and red balls, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein backbone is shown with a silver ribbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances aOH-OH and bOH-OH between the hydroxyl groups at the IBS are used to compute the lattice mismatch (a, b) between hydroxyl groups at the ice-binding surface and ice: a = [(aOH-OH  aice)/aice] × 100%, and b = [(bOH-OH  bice)/bice] × 100%, where aice and bice are the ice lattice parameters at the ice surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average lattice mismatch of TmAFP to the basal plane of ice, a = 7.2% and b = 6.7%, is the lowest among hyperactive insect AFPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orange ball shows a channel water occupying the trough between two rows of threonine residues (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Snapshot of TmAFP bound to the basal plane of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AC motif that binds TmAFP to ice is shown with orange sticks (10), the ice with cyan sticks, and liquid water is not shown, for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IBS_of_the_AFP_Does_Not_Induce_Ice-Like_Order_in_Solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We model water with three levels of resolution: the fully flexible atomistic polarizable many-body MB-pol model (1315), the rigid atomistic nonpolarizable TIP4P/2005 model (16), and the coarse-grained many-body mW model (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TmAFP is modeled with the fully atomistic flexible CHARMM22 force field with CMAP correction (18) when combined with the TIP4P/2005 and MB-pol water models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TmAFP in the simulations with mW water is modeled as a rigid body at the united atom level (i.e., no hydrogen atoms) with parameters that reproduce the solvation structure around the protein and the structure of the AC motif (Fig 1B) of the atomistic model (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigate the structure of water around TmAFP in solution through metrics designed to quantify tetrahedral order and to identify ice and the AC motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tetrahedral order of the first shell of water in contact with the ice-binding surface of TmAFP, measured through Sg (19) or qtet (20), is significantly lower than for ice or the AC, and slightly diminished with respect to bulk water for both the mW and TIP4P/2005 models (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with prior simulation studies for TmAFP and CfAFP using the TIP4P (21), TIP4P/2005 (22), and TIP5P (8) models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find the bond order parameter q3 (23) of water at the IBS, which also provides a measure of ordering, to be slightly larger than in bulk liquid but significantly smaller than in the AC or ice (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the degree of ordering is identical for the MB-pol, TIP4P/2005 and mW models (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that water at the IBS of TmAFP in solution does not display ice-like or AC-like order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) share with TmAFP the presence of TxT repeats in their ice-binding surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeats in the INPs, however, are much longer than in AFPs (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monomer of the INP of Pseudomonas syringae, PsINP, has 67 loops that contain the TxT sequence and nucleates ice with modest efficiency, at 26 °C (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregates of this protein in the cell membrane, however, can nucleate ice at temperatures as high as 2 °C (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows the evolution of the ordering of interfacial water at 273 K as a function of the area of the IBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Square-like TCT surfaces modeled as rigid bodies (red filled circles) order water more prominently than those in which the groups at the IBS fluctuate with the same magnitude as in the fully flexible atomistic TmAFP model in solution (red empty circles) (10), consistent with previous results on the role of flexibility in water ordering at ice-nucleating alcohol monolayers (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the experimental flexibility of membrane-bound INPs is not yet known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since assemblies of large bacterial INPs are anchored to the cell membrane, we expect that these protein aggregates experience far less conformational fluctuations than small AFPs in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preordering of liquid water at the IBS of P. syringae, which is predicted to form multimeric aggregates with 50 PsINP monomers in the cell wall (2932), will be pronounced only if the protein aggregates exhibit structural rigidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental characterization of the conformational fluctuations of membrane-bound protein assemblies is therefore necessary to accurately predict the degree of water ordering induced by bacterial INPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that the extent of water ordering on rigid peptide surfaces is quite insensitive to the length of surfaces that have a single row of TCT (rectangular surfaces, cyan line in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aggregation of the TCT peptides to produce square-like IBS results in a steady increase of water ordering with area (solid red line in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand this difference, we note that interfaces typically impact water ordering over length scales of 1 nm (3336), which is the width of the rectangular peptide surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We indeed find that the ordering of water over the outermost rows of threonine on the square-like peptide surfaces is lower than in the middle region and comparable to that on the rectangular TCT surfaces (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note, however, that even rectangular surfaces that do not induce significant ordering of interfacial water, e.g., the monomer of PsINP, can nucleate ice (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AC_Cannot_Be_Distinguished_from_Protein_Hydration_Water_Through_OH-Stretch_Infrared_or_Raman_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the frequencies of the OH-stretching vibrations of the water molecules are extremely sensitive to the surrounding environment, vibrational spectroscopy represents a powerful tool to investigate the structure and dynamics of water in different phases, from bulk liquid water and ice to aqueous interfaces (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrational sum-frequency generation spectra of the OH-stretch region of water at the IBS of DAFP-1, a homolog of TmAFP, did not reveal signatures of ice-like ordering (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that experiment the protein was studied at the water/vapor interface, where it accumulated with the amphiphilic IBS oriented toward the vapor phase (12), consistent with the hydration free energies computed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our atomistic simulations indicate that the IBS of TmAFP at the liquid/vapor interface is partially dewetted, retaining only the channel water (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that to elucidate the structure of water at the IBS, the protein must be studied in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish the signatures of the AC motif that binds TmAFP to ice through OH-stretch infrared or Raman spectroscopies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 present the infrared and (unpolarized) Raman spectra of hydration water at the IBS and non-IBS of TmAFP, the AC motif, ice, and liquid in the OH-stretch region computed with the MB-pol water model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OH stretch of the hydration water at the IBS and non-IBS of TmAFP are nearly indistinguishable in both the IR and Raman spectra (Fig 4), consistent with the lack of ice-like or AC-like order at the IBS in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IR spectra of the AC cannot be resolved from that of liquid water; both are broader and more blue-shifted than the spectrum of ice Ih.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that infrared spectroscopy will be unable to resolve the binding of AFPs to ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The AC is clearly distinguishable from bulk liquid in the Raman spectra, showing traces of the stronger frequency of ice Ih at 3430 cm1, which can be attributed to antisymmetric stretching modes (41, 42), ormore accuratelyto modes displaying strong intermolecular interactions (4345), albeit with the characteristic broad lineshape of liquid water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both the infrared and Raman spectra of the AC motif are still strongly overlapped with the spectra of the protein solvation shell in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that it would also be challenging to establish whether the AFP is ice-bound or in solution from Raman spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Mechanism_of_Ice_Recognition_and_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lack of ice or AC order around TmAFP in solution indicates that the IBS must build the AC order concurrent with its binding to the ice surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomistic and united atom simulations that start with TmAFP in solution show that the protein tumbles as it approaches the ice surface, until it finds the orientation and distance that allows the formation of the AC motif (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the protein aligns with its IBS parallel to both the ice surface and one of the three degenerate a axes (a1, a2, or a3) of the basal plane, the water molecules between the protein and ice order into the AC motif within a few nanoseconds in atomistic simulations and within 0.1 ns in the united atom model [the ratio of these two time scales is consistent with the ratio of the diffusion coefficients in the respective water models at the corresponding temperatures, DmW(273 K)/DTIP4P/2005(246 K)  16] (17, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the binding of TmAFP to ice is a cooperative, all-or-nothing mechanism in which the 10 threonine residues bind simultaneously to ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Achieving protein orientations conducive to recognition and binding of the ice surface is a slow and diffusive process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine at which stage of the approach of the protein to the ice/water interface the AC motif is formed, we investigate the process of binding with the center of mass of TmAFP restrained at a distance of 14.5 Å from the ice surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this distance the surface of ice needs to grow two bilayers (7.1 Å) to bind to the IBS of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that TmAFP binds to ice only when the IBS is aligned to one of the a axes of the basal plane (  0°, 60°, 120°) and the plane of the IBS is parallel to the plane of ice (  0°) (Fig 5 B and C and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the binding and unbinding of the protein in Fig 5 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S8 is a result of the distance restraint between the center of mass of the protein and the ice surface, which strains the ice-binding motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of TmAFP to ice is irreversible in unconstrained simulations (10) and experiments (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that preordering of interfacial water at the IBS of hyperactive AFPs is not a requisite for ice recognition and binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, ice recognition occurs by collective reorganization of the water between ice and the IBS, after the protein achieves the required orientation for binding to ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions_and_Outlook  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we use molecular simulations with three levels of resolution to elucidate the mechanism by which TmAFP recognizes ice, and the spectroscopic signatures of the AC motif that binds the protein to ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that water at the ice-binding surface of hyperactive AFPs does not have ice-like or AC-like order in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, ice recognition is achieved by slow diffusion of the protein to find the proper orientation with respect to the ice surface, followed by fast collective organization of the hydration water at the IBS of TmAFP to form the AC motif that seals the protein to the crystal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that preordering of interfacial water at the IBS is not required for ice recognition by hyperactive AFPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most potent synthetic ice recrystallization inhibition molecule, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), has been recently shown to bind ice through a cooperative zipper mechanism (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooperativity is found to arise from a different scaling in the loss of entropy and gain of enthalpy upon binding of each monomer: Binding of the first monomer results in loss of the center-of-mass translational entropy, while binding of subsequent monomers results in progressively smaller losses of configurational entropy of the polymer chain (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TmAFP is conformationally rigid (12, 48), the entropy loss upon binding is even smaller than for PVA, which explains its stronger binding to ice (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conjecture that evolution has favored rigid IBS for hyperactive AFPs and INPs because it results in stronger binding to ice, which for INPs leads to higher ice-nucleation efficiency (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study directly probes infrared and Raman spectroscopic signatures in the OH-stretch region of the AC motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the AC could be distinguished from bulk liquid in Raman, but not in the infrared spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the AC with vibrational spectroscopy would still be challenging, as both the infrared and Raman spectra of the AC motif overlap with that of water hydrating the IBS of TmAFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that Raman, as well as other advanced vibrational spectroscopic techniques, could be used to probe the structure of water at the ice-binding surface of extended aggregates of INPs, which may achieve AC-like ordering already in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Model_and_Simulation_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The all-atom model of TmAFP is built from its crystal structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 1EZG), using CHARMM22 force field with CMAP correction (18) as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water is modeled at the rigid nonpolarizable atomistic level with the TIP4P/2005 model (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infrared and unpolarized Raman spectra of water are computed from many-body molecular dynamics (MB-MD) simulations in which the interactions between water molecules are computed with the MB-pol potential (1315, 49), which has been shown to exhibit chemical and spectroscopic accuracy (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intraprotein and waterprotein interactions are modeled with the same parameters as that in atomistic simulations performed with the CHARMM22 force field for protein and TIP4P/2005 model for water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water in the united atom simulations is modeled with the monoatomic water model mW (17), which reproduces the structure and thermodynamics of liquid water and ice at a fraction of the computational cost compared with the atomistic water models (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The united atom model of TmAFP is built from the crystal structure 1EZG (Protein Data Bank ID), and modeled as a rigid body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each heavy atom of the protein interacts with mW water through a StillingerWeber potential (52) with the parameters of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same united atom proteinwater interaction parameters of TmAFP are used to model the INP PsINP (10), TCT peptide surfaces, and TmAFP-like proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the flexible TCT peptide surfaces, intramolecular flexibility is added to the threonine residues at the IBS through a harmonic restraint that lets the methyl and hydroxyl groups vibrate around their initial positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force constant of the harmonic spring, k = 8 kcal mol1 Å2, reproduces the intramolecular flexibility of the fully flexible atomistic TmAFP in TIP4P/2005 water (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculations_of_Infrared_and_Raman_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The infrared spectra are calculated from the dipole moment surface (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the system dipole moment, the 1B + 2B + NB MB-µ dipole moment surface treatment is used, combining explicit 1-body and 2-body terms with inductive contributions from higher N-body terms (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly for the (unpolarized) Raman spectra, the 1B + 2B + NB MB- approximation to the polarizability tensor is used to calculate the system polarizability tensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system dipole moments and system polarizability tensors are then used to calculate the appropriate time-correlation functions from which the desired spectra are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the water molecules included in the dipole moment and polarizability tensor calculations are given in SI Appendix, Supporting Methods S1.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Constrained_Simulations_of_TmAFP_Binding_to_Ice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To perform the constrained simulations of binding of united atom TmAFP to mW ice we use a simulation cell of ice/water coexistence containing an ice slab with six bilayers in contact with liquid water on one side and vapor on the other side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the water molecules in the two bilayers in contact with vacuum are fixed (equations of motion not integrated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations we control two variables at the same time: (i) the distance between the center of mass of the protein and ice/water interface, and (ii) the amount of ice and liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We control the distance between the center of mass of the protein and ice/water interface with a harmonic spring, with force constant of 50 kcal mol1 Å2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The harmonic spring is allowed to fluctuate only in the direction orthogonal to the ice/water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of ice and liquid is controlled by constraining the global value of the bond order parameter Q6 (10, 53), where the equilibrium value of Q6 is determined from the initial configuration of the two-phase system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restraint to maintain the amount of ice is applied to all of the mobile water molecules, i.e., all except those in the two fixed ice bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the restrain to maintain the amount of ice is determined from the force constant equal to 20 kcal mol1 multiplied by the number of mobile water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
