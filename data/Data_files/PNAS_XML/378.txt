Conformational dynamics of a G-protein  subunit is tightly regulated by nucleotide binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G proteins are molecular switches for cellular signaling induced by G-proteincoupled receptor activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G subunit is the central timer of signal transduction regulated by GTP hydrolysis, which returns the system to its inactive state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous work has characterized the structural states of G during the GTPase cycle, we show here that G is highly dynamic in the apo and GDP-bound states but in complex with GTP is completely rigid and is locked in a defined domain orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These insights help demonstrate that the conformational plasticity of G proteins is a central feature of their switching functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heterotrimeric G proteins play a pivotal role in the signal-transduction pathways initiated by G-proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agonistreceptor binding causes GDP-to-GTP exchange and dissociation of the G subunit from the heterotrimeric G protein, leading to downstream signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we studied the internal mobility of a G-protein  subunit in its apo and nucleotide-bound forms and characterized their dynamical features at multiple time scales using solution NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering, and molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that binding of GTP analogs leads to a rigid and closed arrangement of the G subdomain, whereas the apo and GDP-bound forms are considerably more open and dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we were able to detect two conformational states of the G Ras domain in slow exchange whose populations are regulated by binding to nucleotides and a GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these conformational states, the open state, binds to the GPCR; the second conformation, the closed state, shows no interaction with the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to the GPCR stabilizes the open state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides an in-depth analysis of the conformational landscape and the switching function of a G-protein  subunit and the influence of a GPCR in that landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Active_Gi1_Can_Be_Produced_in_Escherichia_coli_for_NMR_Structural_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To produce human Gi1 (UniProt accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P63096) for biophysical studies and NMR spectroscopy, we constructed a fusion protein containing Gi1 and GB1 (protein G B1 domain) serving as an expression and solubility tag (16) during expression in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-temperature cell growth and application of low concentrations of isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for induction (see Methods and previous protocols in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) allowed us to obtain 510 mg of active Gi1 per liter of cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified protein was free of bound GDP as probed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial NMR experiments performed with full-length Gi1 resulted in poor spectral quality, so we designed a truncated variant lacking the N-terminal 31 residues (Gi131).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deleted part of the protein is not resolved in the crystal structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code: 1cip (18)] and is unfolded in solution as shown here by NMR and elsewhere (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This truncated protein variant resulted in high-quality NMR spectra as probed with 2D [15N,1H]-TROSY and TROSY for rotational correlation times (TRACT) experiments (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the nucleotide-binding activity of Gi131, we used FRET assays with methylanthraniloyl (MANT)-labeled nucleotides (MANT-GDP and MANTGMP-PNP) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon excitation of protein tryptophan side chains at 280 nm, the emitted light leads to excitation of the MANT moiety and finally emission at 445 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent titration of protein to a 1-µM MANTnucleotide solution led to a proper binding curve that permitted the extraction of binding constants in the order of 10 µM with slightly tighter binding of the GTP analog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we characterized the secondary structure, content, and thermal stability of Gi1 in the presence of different nucleotides and inhibitors (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minima in the CD signal of Gi131 at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of the -H secondary structure, are markedly increased in the presence of GTP analogs and are less pronounced in complex with GDP and the G-protein inhibitor NF-023.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, the thermal stability of these complexes as monitored with CD is highest with guanosine 5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTPS) and lowest in the apo form, indicating a strong stabilizing effect of GTP analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences can be partly explained by the formation of additional hydrogen bonds between the -phosphate of the GTP analog and Gi131 (Fig 1D and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the structural and internal mobility details of these different structural states using solution NMR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gi1_Displays_Ligand-Dependent_Changes_as_Probed_with_NMR_Chemical_Shift_Perturbations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the structure and dynamics within Gi1 upon binding to various nucleotides, we produced U-[2H,13C,15N]labeled Gi131 and prepared a sample with a protein concentration of 250 µM, either in the apo form or in the presence of 3 mM GDP, guanosine 5-[,-imido]triphosphate (GMP-PNP), or GTPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the following TROSY-based 3D triple-resonance NMR experiments (20) on these samples: HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and 3D-15Nedited TROSY-NOESY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 3D experiments were recorded with Poisson-gap nonuniform sampling (NUS) data acquisition (21) and iterative soft threshold (IST) reconstruction (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could obtain backbone assignments of 89% (288/323) of the residues for the GMP-PNPbound (Fig 2A), 88% (284/323) for the GTPS-bound, 78% (252/323) for the GDP-bound, and 77% (259/323) for the apo state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shift-based estimation of the secondary structure based on differences in random coil chemical shifts in C and C nuclei (23) correlates well with the secondary structure elements in the crystal structure of Gi1 in complex with GMP-PNP (PDB ID code: 1cip) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further analyzed the NMR spectral changes in Gi131 upon the addition of various nucleotides and the Go/i-selective Suramin-based small-molecule inhibitor NF-023 (Fig 2C) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that GDP induces relatively small (up to 0.15 ppm) chemical shift perturbations within Gi131.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These chemical shift changes cluster specifically to the Ras-like domain with little effect on the helical domain (gray and orange coloring in Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitor induces a similar pattern of chemical shift changes but in addition leads to the disappearance of 18 resonances, most likely because of exchange broadening (negative black bars in Fig 2C) located around the nucleotide-binding site and along the GPCR-binding site in the Ras domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the addition of GTP analogs (GMP-PNP and GTPS) leads to the appearance of 38 additional resonances (red negative bars in Fig 2C and red color in Fig 3 D and E), which again are clustered around the nucleotide-binding site and all over the Ras-domain of Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of additional resonances points toward the quenching of exchange processes and a more rigid structure of Gi131 in the GTP-bound form, in line with crystallographic studies (5) in which the electron density of parts of the Ras domain could not be observed in the GDP-bound form, presumably because of increased flexibility (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, GTP analogs induce larger chemical shift perturbations than GDP clustered around the docking site of the two subdomains (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions around residues 204217 and residues 233239 are not resolved in the crystal structures of Gi1 in the GDP-bound form but are visible in the complex structure with GMP-PNP (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gi1_Interacts_with_an_Activated_GPCR_in_Phospholipid_Nanodiscs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied the interaction between uniformly 2H,15N-labeled Gi131 with a thermostabilized (25, 26), signaling-competent (27) variant of rat neurotensin receptor subtype 1 [HTGH4 L167R (28)], which was purified from E. coli as described previously (27, 29) and then incorporated in phospholipid nanodiscs (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding process was monitored by 2D-[15N,1H]-TROSY experiments with 2H,15N-labeled Gi131 in the apo, GDP-, or GMP-PNPbound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded NMR experiments with Gi131 samples alone and after the addition of empty nanodiscs assembled with 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids and membrane scaffold protein 1D1 (MSP1D1) and finally in complex with nanodiscs containing neurotensin-activated HTGH4 (Fig 3 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in NMR resonance positions in these experiments were used to calculate chemical shift perturbations of Gi131 upon GPCR binding (color coding in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a weak effect between empty nanodiscs and Gi131 that was more pronounced in the apo and GDP-bound states and was weaker in the closed GMP-PNPbound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites in Gi131 affected by binding to the phospholipid bilayer are located in sheets 2 and 3, in switch III, and around helix G and helix 5 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the addition of GPCR-containing nanodiscs induced more pronounced chemical shift perturbations in the fast chemical-exchange regime within Gi131 in the apo and GDP-bound states but not in the GMP-PNPbound state (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are most prominent for the apo state and are located in sheets 1, 2, 3, and 5, helix G, helix 4, sheet 6, and the C-terminal helix 5 in the Ras domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal helix previously has been shown to undergo translational and rotational motion upon GPCR binding and represents one of the main sites of interaction with the activated GPCR (3, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction might be more pronounced in the presence of the G subunit and with myristoylated G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relative_Gi1_Domain_Orientation_Is_Dependent_on_Nucleotide_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain further structural insights about the orientation of the two subdomains in Gi1, the Ras-like domain and the helical domain, we performed SAXS experiments on the apo, GDP-, and GTPS-bound forms of Gi131 (Fig 4A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAXS data yield the overall shape and radius of gyration of the biomolecule of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For an independent determination of the domain orientation in more structural detail, we recorded NMR TROSY and semi-TROSY experiments using Pf1 phageinduced aligned Gi131 samples to extract backbone amide residual dipolar couplings (RDCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the semi-TROSY experiment, the signal position is shifted in the 1H dimension by the 1H,15N coupling constant plus the residual dipolar coupling (1J + 1D) compared with the TROSY experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RDCs are well suited for determining the relative orientation of protein domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RDC data were used to refine the structural models obtained with SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 4B, the overall correlation between the experimental RDCs and the RDCs back-calculated from the refined structures is very good, yielding correlation coefficients of at least 0.95.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitted components of the alignment tensor are shown in each subpanel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting overall structural model fitted to the SAXS-based envelope in each case is shown in Fig 4C, and the corresponding structural statistics are reported in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main differences between these structures are slight changes in distance and rotational angle between the two subdomains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in subdomain orientation lead to an overall opening of the nucleotide-binding site in the apo state and the GDP-bound state compared with the closed GTP-bound conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GTP-bound model is basically identical to an existing crystal structure of GMP-PNPbound G [PDB ID code 1cip (18)] in which the two domains are docked tightly against each other and the secondary structure elements are formed at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural picture is in line with the thermal stabilities measured with CD spectroscopy in which the GTP-bound form shows an 25 °C higher melting point than the apo and GDP-bound forms, indicating better domain docking in the presence of GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the degree of freedom in relative domain orientation, we further used MD simulations of apo-Gi131 at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4D, the distance between the centers of mass (COM) of the Ras and -H domains is plotted against simulation time, and representative snapshots are shown above the plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations show that Gi1 is very dynamic, with distances between the two COM ranging from 2532 Å, leading to varying positions of the two domains with respect to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, imperfections in correlation between the SAXS envelopes and the refined structures are most likely caused by the inherent dynamics of the two domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This aspect was investigated further by fluorescence spectroscopy with MANT-labeled nucleotides (MANT-GDP and GMP-PNP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first probed the environment of MANT-GDP and MANTGMP-PNP provided by Gi131 using this assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence spectra of MANT are sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the surrounding environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a reference, we measured a spectrum of MANTGMP-PNP in buffer solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without bound protein, the two MANT nucleotides give identical spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 5A, there are pronounced changes in the fluorescence emission spectra of MANT-GDP and MANTGMP-PNP after binding to Gi131.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission intensity of MANTGMP-PNP is higher, and its maximum is blue-shifted compared with MANT-GDP, a strong indication that Gi131 entraps MANTGMP-PNP more tightly than the GDP adduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe direct contact between the MANT-nucleotides and the protein, we used FRET; we irradiated the protein at 280 nm and recorded emission spectra from 350600 nm (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FRET peak of the bound MANT dye appears around 425 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the lack of protein in the reference MANTGMP-PNP sample in buffer, no FRET signal was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Gi1-MANT-GDP sample showed only slightly increased FRET efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the FRET emission of the Gi1MANTGMP-PNP sample was around three times higher than that of the MANTGDP sample, again indicating tight binding between MANTGMP-PNP and the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the kinetic properties of nucleotide association and dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used MANT-labeled nucleotides and observed the buildup of FRET intensity over time after the addition of Gi131.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5C, the association of 5 µM MANT-GDP with 20 µM Gi131 is a single-exponential process with an observed association rate constant (kon) of 1,340 1/(s·M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complex can be dissociated rapidly, and rebinding is prevented by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled GDP or GMP-PNP, following the same observed rate constant (koff) of 0.022/s (Fig 5D), yielding a calculated Kd (Kd = koff/kon) of 16 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same associationdissociation experiment conducted with MANT-labeled GMP-PNP yields an observed association rate constant (kon) of 260 1/(s·M) (Fig 5E), which is considerably slower than the GDP association rate and most likely is caused by structural rearrangements within Gi1 to accommodate the GTP fully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociation of this tight complex is slow and is dependent on the nucleotide type used as a competitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociation in the presence of excess GDP is characterized by a koff of 0.00065/s, whereas with GMP-PNP as a competitor slightly faster dissociation is observed with a koff of 0.00075/s (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated Kd for GMP-PNP is 3 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments confirm not only that the Gi1-GTP complex is tighter than the GDP complex but also that it is characterized by markedly reduced association and very slow dissociation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nucleotide_Binding_Strongly_Alters_Gi1_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the nucleotide-dependent dynamics of the Gi1 subunit in the nanosecond-to-picosecond, millisecond-to-microsecond, and slower time scales, we performed various NMR experiments in the apo, GDP-, and GTPS-bound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, {1H}15N-heteronuclear NOE experiments, reporting on dynamics in the nanosecond-to-picosecond time scale, were recorded on the three samples (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments showed that GMP-PNPbound Gi131 is very rigid throughout the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the apo or GDP-bound forms show greater flexibility at the N-terminal 1-strand and more pronounced fluctuations in dynamics throughout the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe dynamics in the millisecond-to-microsecond time scale, we performed 15N and 13C CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments, which are particularly suitable for probing conformational changes such as protein-folding events (32) and motions associated with enzyme catalysis (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we recorded 15N CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments on the apo, GDP-, and GTPS-bound forms on backbone amide resonances in the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting data indicate chemical exchange in the apo and GDP-bound but not in the GTPS-bound form, where only flat dispersion profiles could be observed, as shown for His188 in Fig 6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dispersion profiles of the apo and GDP-bound forms differ slightly, indicating alterations in the chemical-exchange properties of these two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the chemical-exchange processes of the apo and GDP sample further, we made use of the enhanced NMR signal intensity of methyl groups suitable for studying dynamics of large protein systems (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D [13C,1H]-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments of selectively Ile1, Leu2, Val2, Ala 1H,13C-methyl-, and otherwise 2H,12C,15N-labeled Gi131 were of excellent quality and thus are suitable for extracting chemical shift perturbations upon ligand binding and for conducting 13C-CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore measured single-quantum 13C-CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments at static magnetic field strengths of 600 and 900 MHz and obtained dispersion profiles of sufficient quality for data analysis (Fig 6 B and C), except for parts that are severely exchange-broadened in the apo and GDP-bound states (sheet 1, helix 2), as labeled in Fig S6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methyl groups in Gi131 showing chemical exchange in the millisecond-to-microsecond time scale are color-coded in the apo and the GDP-bound form, respectively (Fig 6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues involved in fast exchange, residues involved in slow exchange, and residues that are severely exchange-broadened are shown as blue, red, and yellow spheres, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions exhibiting chemical exchange cluster around the nucleotide- and GPCR-binding sites but also are present in the -H domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Switch regions (switches I, II, and III) are exchange-broadened or show slow chemical exchange in the apo and GDP-bound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, differences in exchange rates between the apo and the GDP-bound form can be detected only in the Ras domain, where the average exchange rate drops from 900 to 740 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamics of the -H domain is not affected by GDP binding, indicating that binding of GDP to the Ras domain does not induce its docking to the -H domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with thermal denaturation analyses of Gi131 in both forms that showed only a slight increase in the transition temperature in the GDP-bound form versus the apo form (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further analyzed populations of the ground and excited states in the millisecond-to-microsecond time scale for helix 5, the main interaction site with GPCRs, in the apo and GDP-bound forms in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the two forms shows that the population of the ground state (pA) of residues in and surrounding helix 5 is around 5% lower in the GDP-bound state than in the apo state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we speculate that GDP stabilizes the excited state, which possibly is similar the GTP-bound closed state in which helix 5 is tightly bound to the Ras domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible effects of the G- subunit on the overall dynamics of the G subunit remain to be shown in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A closer look at the 2D TROSY spectra of the different states provides additional evidence for the existence of two conformational states of the G subunit in very slow exchange (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a second signal set for a subset of residues located in the Ras domain in both the apo and GDP-bound forms but not in the closed GTP-bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -H domain was not affected, as shown exemplarily by the single signal of the amide resonance of Gly112.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other resonances in Fig 7A are located in the Ras domain and give rise to a second signal set in the apo and GDP-bound form, except for F191, which shows one signal in the apo form and two in the GDP-bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonance position that most likely corresponds to the GTP-bound closed conformation is indicated by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical dashed lines, implying that the closed species is also populated in the apo and GDP-bound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the relative peak intensities suggests that GDP binding leads to a markedly higher population in the excited state than present in the apo form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these effects cluster to the Ras domain in general and to helix 5 in particular, and the chemical shift differences between the two states are more pronounced in the GDP-bound form than in the apo form (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 5 is the main interaction site with a GPCR, and inherent changes in its conformation therefore are crucial for the binding event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the relative heights of the corresponding NMR signals and calculated the populations of the ground state, which are 65% for the apo form and 35% for the GDP-bound form (Fig 7C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next we investigated the influence of an activated GPCR on the relative population of the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used nanodiscs incorporating rat neurotensin receptor-1 variant HTGH4 L167R (28), performed 2D [15N,1H]-TROSY experiments, and analyzed the change in NMR signal intensity of the ground and excited states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population of the ground state in the apo form is increased by 5% upon GPCR binding; this increase is less pronounced than the 20% increase determined for the GDP-bound state (Fig 7C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments show that interaction with an activated GPCR is mediated by the G ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of nucleotides leads to the preferred or complete formation of a second conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of a GPCR enhances the population of the ground state, and this effect is more pronounced with the GDP-bound G subunit, thus favoring the nucleotide-exchange process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, the closed G-GTP complex does not interact with a GPCR, and, in turn, the apo state shows the most pronounced binding effects upon the addition of a GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the presence of the G subunit will lead to a more defined conformational state of the G subunit in complex with GDP, and the GPCR might shift the conformational equilibrium toward a low-affinity ground state that also is present in apo G. However, because of current limitations in investigating such a large complex with solution-state NMR, this question remains to be addressed in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study our goal was to conduct a detailed survey of the structure and internal mobility of Gi1 in complex with different nucleotides and an activated GPCR in phospholipid nanodiscs by solution NMR, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy, SAXS, and MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to assign the NMR backbone resonances of apo Gi131, as well as the GDP- and GTP-bound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These NMR assignments could be used in combination with SAXS experiments to extract differences in chemical shift and to obtain NMR RDCs for the refinement of the relative orientations of the Ras and -H domains of Gi1 in the various ligand-bound forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed a nucleotide-dependent conformational change in Gi1, in which GTP induces a very tight and stable domain-docked state (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the apo form both domains adopt a more open topology that permits binding of GDP or GTP to the nucleotide-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative changes in domain orientation of Gi1 domains shown here are less pronounced than described in a previous crystal structure of a stimulatory G protein in complex with 2-adrenergic receptor (3), which also contained a nanobody bound to the GG interface, but are in better agreement with more recent studies based on molecular modeling and DEER spectroscopy (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these earlier studies, we were able to probe the dynamics and the populations of the associated conformational states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could clearly show that the populations of these states change upon the addition of GDP and that binding of GTP completely abolished internal dynamics as measured by our assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could detect these effects in the millisecond-to-microsecond as well as in the minute-to-second time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is the finding that the major conformational state of the apo state is less populated in the GDP-bound state and is completely absent in the GTP-bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the appearance of this ground state correlates well with the binding behavior of G to an activated GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative intensity of NMR signals corresponding to this state increases when G is in complex with a GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that only one conformational species of G, highly populated in the apo form but also present to some extent in the GDP-bound form, is capable of high-affinity binding to an activated GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of GDP pushed the equilibrium toward the excited (lower-affinity) state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tendency can be reverted by binding to a GPCR, providing evidence that a GPCR promotes nucleotide exchange by stabilizing the nucleotide-free conformation of a G subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the GTP-bound form is present in a single closed and rigid conformation whose population cannot be altered by a GPCR because of a lack of interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate a tight interplay between nucleotide and GPCR binding mediated by allosteric structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues that show two conformations in slow exchange cluster to the upper face of the Ras domain (Fig 7B), and basically the same interface is affected by GPCR binding (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformational changes in the G subunit upon binding to a GPCR have been reported in a previous EPR study (12) and crystal structure (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reports suggest that helix 5 must undergo a translational and rotational motion to interact with the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more recent MD simulation study provides further insights, suggesting that this motion is restricted by GDP binding (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction with a GPCR leads to a disorder-to-order transition within the C-terminal part of helix 5, as recently summarized for existing G-protein structures (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings can be included in the well-explored activation cycle of a heterotrimeric G protein mediated by GPCR in which, as a first step, GDP-bound heterotrimeric G protein interacts with an activated receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor then pushes the G conformation slightly toward a low-affinity state for GDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GDP-bound G subunit is quite flexible, and we speculate that even in the complex with the  subunit there would be enough conformational space to mediate such slight structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting apo heterotrimeric G protein eventually binds to GTP, leading to subunit dissociation and loss of affinity with the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in affinity in the G subunit can be directly correlated with its conformational states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apo form showing the highest affinity for the receptor is present mostly in the ground state, as determined by NMR (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the GDP-bound form, both, the ground and the excited state occur, resulting in a reduced affinity for the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in complex with GTP, the G subunit lacks any dynamics and exists exclusively in the excited state, thus losing affinity with the GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Protein production was done in E. coli as described previously (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were purified with NiNTA and size-exclusion chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a FRET assay to extract binding affinities between G and MANT-labeled GDP or GMP-PNP nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure estimation and thermal stability screens of G preparations were done with CD spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR assignment experiments with U-2H,13C,15Nlabeled G were recorded in a NUS manner (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamical parameters were extracted from 15N- and 13C-CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural changes upon nucleotide binding were detected with SAXS, and the conformational flexibility of G was further determined with MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More experimental details can be found in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cDNA of the human Gi1 gene (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC026326) was inserted into an in-housemodified pQE30 vector (Qiagen) using PCR methods, resulting in a DNA construct encoding (N terminal-to-C terminal) a His6-tag, GB1, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, and Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NMR optimization, another construct, Gi131, was made in which the first 31 amino acids were deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein expression was achieved in the E. coli Tuner (DE3) pLacI strain (Novagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were shaken at 37 °C until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached, at which point the temperature was lowered to 20 °C before the addition of 150 µM IPTG for the induction of protein production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were shaken for additional 20 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM NaPi (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol (buffer A) plus protease inhibitor (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were lysed by lysozyme treatment and sonication and were spun down at 50,000 × g for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell extract then was applied to an Ni-NTA column, was washed first with buffer A with 0.5% Triton X-100 and then with buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole and no Triton X-100, and was eluted with buffer B [50 mM NaPi (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole, 20 µM GDP].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was buffer exchanged into 20 mM NaPi (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and was digested with TEV protease (1 A280 for 100 A280 protein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After TEV digestion, the buffer was replaced with 20 mM NaPi (pH 7.8), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol and was reapplied to an Ni-NTA column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collected flow-through and wash fractions were pooled, concentrated using 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal devices (Millipore), and applied to a S75 Hi Load 16/600 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM NaPi (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein typically elutes from the column at 70 mL (124 mL column volume).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neurotensin-bound, activated neurotensin receptor 1 variant HTGH4 L167R (28) was produced and purified as described (27, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanodisc incorporation was achieved by adding decyl maltoside solubilized receptor (concentration = 20 µM) to the nanodisc assembly mixture consisting of 200 µM MSP1D1 (38) and 5 mM POPC lipids solubilized with 20 mM sodium cholate in 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanodisc assembly then was initiated by dialysis using a 20-kDa MWCO cassette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPCR-containing nanodiscs were isolated with SP Sepharose and S200 size-exclusion chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurotensin peptide (1 µM) was added to the size-exclusion chromatography buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT] to keep the receptor in an activated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD spectra and thermal melting curves were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer using a cuvette with a 1-mm path length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein concentration was 10 µM in 10 mM NaPi (pH 7.0), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand concentration was 50 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm using five scans for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response time was 1 s, and the bandwidth was 1 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal scans were run with a heating rate of 60 °C/h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curve fitting was done with an equation described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence experiments were conducted with a Horiba-Jobin Fluoromax-4 instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the apparent Kd between GDP and GMP-PNP to Gi1, we performed a FRET-based binding assay in which 1 µM of MANT-labeled nucleotides (Invitrogen) in buffer [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT] were titrated with increasing amounts of Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the course of the titration, protein aromatic residues were excited by irradiation at 280 nm (2-nm bandwidth), and the FRET emission signal intensity of the MANT label was detected at 425 nm (5-nm bandwidth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence emission and FRET spectra were recorded between 350 and 600 nm and between 320 and 550 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAXS_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements in SAXS experiments were performed with Gi131 samples on a Rigaku BIOSAXS-1000 instrument using a Pilatus 100K detector (at a distance from the sample of 480 mm) with a HF007 microfocus generator equipped with a Cu target at 40 kV and 30 mA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmissions were measured with a photodiode beam stop, and q-calibration was made by a silver-behenate measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of 10, 5, and 2 mg/mL protein containing 1 mM of GTPS, GDP, or no nucleotide were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were filtered using a 0.1-M filter (Whatman) immediately before data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty microliters of each sample were loaded in a capillary (1-mm diameter) and exposed to an X-ray beam for 30 min at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular averaging was done with the Rigaku SAXSLab software v 3.0.1r1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background subtraction was done within the Origin program (Microcal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of different concentrations were normalized to exclude concentration-dependent effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10-mg/mL samples then were used for the rigid body modeling with CORAL, ATSAS package v 2.5.0-2 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the crystal structure of GTP-bound G (PDB ID: 1cip) for our modeling calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow the unrestricted domain movement required to optimize the correlation between experimental and back-calculated SAXS scattering curves, two flexible linkers (five and six amino acid residues in length, respectively) were defined between the Ras and -H domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five independent structural models were calculated, and the model with the lowest 2 value was used for further RDC refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR_Assignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence-specific assignment of backbone 1HN, 15N, 13C, 13C, and 13C resonances was first carried out with a 200 µM Gi131 + 3 mM GMP-PNP sample labeled with 2H, 13C, and 15N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple-resonance experiments used for this purpose include TROSY-based HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the assignments were validated with a 3D [1H,1H]-NOESY-15Nedited TROSY spectrum recorded with an NOE mixing time of 200 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments were recorded in an NUS manner using Poisson-gap sampling (21) at 30 °C on a 600-MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic TXI probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Processing of NUS spectra was done with NMRPipe (40) and IST reconstruction (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonance assignments were obtained for 85% of all backbone and 13C resonances of the GMP-PNP complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same set of experiments was applied to assign resonances in the apo and GDP-bound forms and in the GTPS complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis was done with Sparky 3 software (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shift perturbations for both 15N and 13C correlation experiments were calculated using the empirical formula av= [(dH2 + (N/5)2)/2]0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RDCs_and_Calculation_of_Structural_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Weak alignment of 2H,15N-labeled Gi131 was induced by the addition of 8 mg/mL Pf1 phage medium (Asla Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RDCs were measured with TROSY and semi-TROSY experiments in the isotropic and aligned state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RDC values were extracted with the software Sparky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For RDC refinement, we used the best (lowest  value) structural model obtained with SAXS in the apo and the GDP-bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used the obtained SAXS structural models to back-calculate NOE restraints between heteroatoms in the protein to fix the secondary and tertiary structures of the individual domains during subsequent structure-calculation steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No restraints between the two domains (Ras and -H) were included at this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed structure calculation runs using XPlor-NIH (41) and standard protocols for refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RDC back-calculation and fitting of the alignment tensor was done with the program Pales (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures showing the best RDC correlations, i.e., R-factor, were further ranked by their agreement with the initial SAXS scattering curve using Chimera (University of California, San Francisco) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlay between the final structures and the envelope determined with SAXS using the program DAMMIN [ATSAS package, European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg (EMBL Hamburg) (36)] was done with the program SUBCOMB [ATSAS package, EMBL Hamburg (36)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR_Relaxation_Dispersion_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Backbone 15N single-quantum CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments were performed on 600-MHz and 700-MHz Agilent DD2 spectrometers equipped with a third-generation cryogenic probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CPMG dispersion experiment measures the modulation of the transverse relaxation rate [R2 (1/cp)] as a function of the delay (cp) between 180° rf pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the data analysis, the R2 versus cp data can be fitted to determine equilibrium populations (pa, pb), kinetics (kex = k1 + k1), and chemical-shift differences () between the two interconverting conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CPMG experiments use a 20-ms constant-time 15N relaxation delay with cp spacing corresponding to CPMG-based rf field strengths, (CPMG), ranging from 100900 Hz (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spectra were recorded at 30 °C with 0.25 mM [2H,15N]-labeled Gi131 in the apo form or in complex with 3 mM GDP or GTPS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred twenty-eight complex data points were recorded in the indirect dimension with 96 scans per increment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For probing side-chain dynamics, a 13C single-quantum CPMG constant-time (20 ms) relaxation dispersion experiment featuring HMQC-based indirect chemical shift evolution optimized for large proteins (35) was recorded on selectively Ile1, Leu2,Val2, Ala [1H,13C]-methyl- and otherwise [2H,12C,15N]-labeled Gi131 in the apo and GDP-bound forms on Bruker Avance III or HD spectrometers with cryogenic probes operating at proton frequencies of 600 and 900 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPMG-based RF field strengths ranged from 75 to 975 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For methyl spectra, 96 complex data points were recorded in the indirect dimension with 64 scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra with different cp values were recorded in an interleaved fashion, and duplicate datasets were recorded at two cp values for error analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CPMG data were analyzed using the program Relax (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial starting values were determined by grid search, and data subsequently were fitted to motional models [no exchange, fast exchange (46), and a general two-site exchange model (47) for all time scales, and to a two-site numerical solution (44)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each spin system was assigned to the best-fitting model based on 2 calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the statistical significance of each model was estimated with Monte-Carlo simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MD simulation setup with Gi131 in its apo form was done with VMD (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An MD simulation of 1-µs duration was carried out at 310 K with the program NAMD (49) using standard parameters settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the trajectory was performed with VMD or Gromacs (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures were prepared with VMD or Chimera (University of California, San Francisco) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
