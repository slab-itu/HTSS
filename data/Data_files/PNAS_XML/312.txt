Carryover effects drive competitive dominance in spatially structured environments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Communities do not exist in a vacuum; instead, they are connected to each other through dispersal of interacting species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, understanding how changes to the quality of habitat patches affect communities across the whole landscape is critical in our human-dominated world and changing climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When individuals disperse, they carry traits shaped by their natal environment to their destinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using replicated laboratory landscapes with two competing species, we show that these historic effects of natal habitats have dramatic influences on community structure at all spatial scales and multiple dispersal rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such historic effects are ubiquitous in nature, suggesting that changes to local habitat quality can have important effects on regional community structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding how changes to the quality of habitat patches affect the distribution of species across the whole landscape is critical in our human-dominated world and changing climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although patterns of species abundances across a landscape are clearly influenced by dispersal among habitats and local species interactions, little is known about how the identity and origin of dispersers affect these patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because traits of individuals are altered by experiences in their natal habitat, differences in the natal habitat of dispersers can carry over when individuals disperse to new habitats and alter their fitness and interactions with other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated the presence or absence of such carried-over natal habitat effects for up to eight generations to examine their influence on two interacting species across multiple dispersal rates and different habitat compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that experimentally accounting for the natal habitat of dispersers significantly influenced competitive outcomes at all spatial scales and increased total community biomass within a landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the direction and magnitude of the impact of natal habitat effects was dependent upon landscape type and dispersal rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, effects of natal habitats increased the difference between species performance across the landscape, suggesting that natal habitat effects could alter competitive interactions to promote spatial coexistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that heterogeneity in habitat quality is ubiquitous in nature, natal habitat effects are likely important drivers of spatial community structure and could promote variation in species performance, which may help facilitate spatial coexistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results have important implications for conservation and invasive species management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested how carryover effects influenced the distribution of competing species across multiple habitats using laboratory microcosm landscapes populated by two competing species of flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire life cycle of a flour beetle can take place in milled grain, although beetles can eat many small or soft food items, such as small animal prey, including their own young and the young of other Tribolium species (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two species therefore compete largely through intraguild predation in maintained environments (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The flour type in which beetles develop determines the phenotype of adults, leading to long-lasting habitat-mediated carryover effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oat media is a relatively low-quality (nutrient poor) habitat (LHL, low-, high-, then low-quality habitats) for both beetle species, whereas wheat media is the standard high-quality habitat (HLH, high-, low-, then high-quality habitats) for both species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development in oat flour reduces adult body size, alters adult lifespan, reduces fecundity, and increases cannibalism/predation rates relative to development in wheat flour (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both species are influenced by the flour type in which they develop, T. castaneum is more negatively affected by low-quality (oat) habitat, but performs better in high-quality (wheat) habitat than T. confusum (34, 35, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the offspring of beetles who developed in oat flour have prolonged development times and continue to exhibit higher cannibalism/predation rates, indicating transgenerational effect of natal habitat quality (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, populations of both species founded by individuals from wheat flour grow faster to higher population sizes in either habitat, whereas individuals who come from oat are better competitors who are less likely to be excluded by the other species (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For additional details on how carryover effects alter both species behavior and performance, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, 35, and 44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine how carryover effects of natal habitat quality influence species distribution across different habitat patches, we factorially manipulated three factors: (i) frequency and spatial arrangement of patches with high- (wheat) vs. low- (oat) habitat quality (i.e., habitat heterogeneity) to create the potential for phenotype-environment mismatch, (ii) dispersal between these patches, and (iii) whether carryover effects matched the natal or new habitat of dispersing individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These treatments result in a 2 landscape (HLH and LHL) (Fig 1) × 3 dispersal treatments (low, 5%, medium, 10%, and high, 40%, of individuals in each patch emigrate to the adjacent patches month1) × 2 carryover effects (phenotype matches natal vs. new habitat) factorial design for 12 total treatment groups (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each landscape had three patches, each consisting of a 7-dram vial with 3.6 g of oat or wheat flour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two landscape types differed in their configuration of oat (L, low-habitat quality) vs. wheat (H, high-habitat quality) habitat patch, representing a landscape where either patches with high (HLH) or low (LHL) habitat quality were more frequent (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replicated the 12 treatments 6 times for 72 independent sets of experimental landscapes with a total of 72 × 3 patches per landscape = 216 habitat patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The six replications of the experimental design were divided into blocks with associated stock populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each block of treatments, we assigned eight stock populations, two oat and two wheat stock colonies per species (which were placed next to their experimental populations in that block), for a total of 48 stock colonies across the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stock colonies were maintained as standard laboratory stocks in 80 g of oat or wheat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block of landscapes with associated stock colonies was placed into one of three environmental chambers, which were kept at 30 °C (±1 °C) and 30% relative humidity (±5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of our experimental methods and the initiation of the experiment can be found in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three landscapes of configuration HLH, all in different treatments and blocks, were lost as a result of experimental error, leaving a total of 69 landscapes for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We manipulated whether carryover effects matched the natal or new habitat by removing dispersers from their natal habitat patch and replacing them with individuals from a stock colony, which either matched the natal or the new habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When carryover effects of the natal habitat were allowed to persist (matched natal habitat), we replaced dispersing individuals with individuals from a stock colony that had the exact same habitat (flour type) as the natal habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the treatment preventing carryover effects from natal habitats (i.e., matched new habitat), we used individuals from stock colonies that had the same habitat (flour type) as the new environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used individuals from the same groups of stock containers for dispersal in both carryover and no-carryover treatments to standardize conditions (i.e., control for any unexpected stock effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work indicates that natal habitat quality strongly affects beetle traits, but neither normal ranges of population density nor experience with other species comparably alter beetle traits (34, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, phenotypes of individuals from stock colonies closely matched phenotypes of individuals in experimental patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This carryover-effect treatment allowed us to test how historic effects of natal habitats on dispersers influenced community dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the treatment in which carryover effects matched the natal environment represents the correct natural scenario where the condition in the natal habitat of dispersers are allowed to carry over and continue to influence their fitness and interaction in the new environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment where the natal habitat effects matched the new environment essentially assumes that the past environment of dispersing individuals has no influence on their current fitness or interactions; that is, individuals immediately reset their phenotype to match the new environment (which is typically the default assumption of current theory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any significant difference among carryover-effect treatments indicates that we need to account for the developmental history and natal habitat of dispersers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any significant interactions with habitat configuration treatment (landscape type) or dispersal indicates that these carryover effects are influenced by the dispersal rate and frequency of high- vs. low-quality habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used generalized linear mixed models in R [GLMM, package MASS, function glmmPQL (46, 47)] to determine how carryover effects altered (i) the total abundance (sum of adults of both species) and (ii) species interactions (i.e., relative abundance of species) across the entire landscape (i.e., summed across all three patches) and in a given patch within a landscape, and how these carryover effects are influenced by landscape configuration and dispersal rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all tests we only used the densities of adult beetle species recorded during the last time step of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamics were relatively stable during the last 34 mo in most treatment combinations of landscapes (see Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2 for full dynamics), so using the last time step is conservative and ensures that we are examining the long-term effects of our treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our GLMM investigating relative abundance at the patch level were performed separately for each landscape type because the order of habitat qualities was opposite in configuration (i.e., the patch habitat-type factor was confounded with its relative location in the landscape).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used block identity as a random effect in all models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our response variables were discrete counts of adults or proportions of relative counts of adults, we matched the variance structure of our data by using Poisson-distributed error in our model for total abundance and binomial-distributed error for our models of relative abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for overdispersion of the data, we used quasilikelihood for all tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more detailed description of our statistical techniques is presented in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focal_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tribolium species have typical holometabolous beetle life cycles in which the immature stages develop to adulthood in approximately 1 mo under optimal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults usually live for 3 to 12 mo, depending on crowding, habitat, species, and strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two flour media types known to influence development and adult phenotype for flour beetles: wheat and oat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wheat media consists of 94.5% white wheat flour, 5% brewers yeast, and 0.5% fumagillin B. Oat media consists of 99.5% oat flour and 0.5% fumagillin B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added fumagillin B to prevent pathogenic parasites from infecting Tribolium castaneum colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We acquired T. castaneum and Tribolium confusum from the US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service station at Kansas State University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before being used in this experiment, the beetles were maintained on wheat flour in stock containers in environmental chambers (2931 °C and 1530% humidity) for at least two generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting 1 wk before and ending concurrently with the start of the experiment, we repeatedly collected eggs from five haphazardly selected groups of hundreds of beetles (two T. castaneum and three T. confusum groups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these eggs we established stock colony populations from either oat or wheat flour to provide dispersing individuals for our carryover effect treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggs collected on the same date were mixed (within species) and added to 80 g of either oat or wheat flour with 500 eggs per species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced 12 stock colonies for each species in each flour type this way, for a total of 48 stock colonies, with 2 stock colony populations of each species and habitat type matched to each of the six blocks of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Landscape_Configuration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate variation in habitat quality, we constructed simple three-patch landscapes with different combinations of oat and wheat flour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each patch consisted of a 6-dram plastic vial filled with 3.6 g of oat or wheat flour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each landscape was linear: that is, a middle patch was connected by dispersal to one patch on either side of it and no other dispersal routes existed (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The landscapes were only connected through controlled dispersal treatments (see next section), and not connected in any physical sense, although they were kept in close proximity to each other during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created two landscapes types that differed only in the arrangement and frequency of oat and wheat habitat patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In landscape HLH, middle patches were oat and both side patches were wheat, and in landscape LHL middle patches were wheat, and both side patches were oat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each species started in one side patch and the other species started in the opposite side patch (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dispersal_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We controlled dispersal by manually moving fixed proportions of beetles around the landscape during each check of the experiment (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dispersal rates were set at three levels, 5% (low), 10% (medium), and 40% (high) of total adults in a patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 5% dispersal, for example, 5 of 100 individuals would disperse from a population within a given patch, leaving 95 behind, whereas at 40%, 40 would leave and 60 would stay behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dispersing individuals were haphazardly selected from their population, removed, and then immigrants were added in equal proportion to all neighboring habitat patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of an odd number of dispersers from the middle patch, the final individual moved away from its own starting patch and toward the other species starting patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dispersal was calculated and performed separately for the replicate populations of each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low and medium dispersal rates are meant to simulate fairly steady levels of connectivity between patches, with the importance of within-patch dynamics and individual phenotypes perhaps at their highest when dispersal is lowest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High dispersal, in contrast, represents a mass-effects situation where local processes may have a much reduced effect (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tribolium sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are highly dispersive, and connectivities such as these could results from grain mills separated by various distances, for example (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Natal-Habitat_Carryover_Effects_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prevent or allow natal habitats to influence phenotypes of dispersing individuals, we removed individuals assigned to disperse in the experimental landscapes from their patch and replaced them with individuals with known phenotypes from assigned stock containers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals removed from the landscape were never reused.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stock containers were managed equally through flour replacement and the initiation of new colonies to replace older ones as needed after each monthly check of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the much larger size of stock containers (80-g stock vs. 3.6 g for experimental patches), it was logistically impossible to formally census their populations; they numbered in the hundreds to thousands of beetles each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, local population density and species interactions generally do not have the same level of effect on individual traits as natal habitat quality for flour beetles (34, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although some conditions varied among stock vs. experimental patches, these differences should not significantly affect the phenotype of individual beetles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature wheat-habitat stock colonies also always contained higher densities than oat-habitat stock colonies, because carrying capacity in these two habitats is different, especially for T. castaneum, but this was consistent between blocks, and the same stock colonies were used for treatments with and without carryover effects within a block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Initiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To initiate the experiment, we started populations of each species of beetles in opposite end patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed four adults of a given species, two male and two female all from wheat stock colonies, in the respective T. castaneum or T. confusum starting patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did this for the first experimental block on May 1, 2013, and completed this for the rest of the blocks over the next 7 d. All further work with the experiment was completed in block order over multiple days so that every block ran on the same schedule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We allowed these first individuals in each starting patch to reproduce freely for 10 d. We then removed these four adults from each patch and allowed development of juveniles to proceed for an additional 37 d, which assured that even the slowest developing population (T. castaneum in oat) had enough time to produce adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These offspring, born in their starting patch, were then used to start the metacommunity experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On June 17, 2013 we started counting the individuals that had emerged and began the dispersal treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This marked the first check of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further checks occurred every 30 d until the seventh and final check on December 21, 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During all checks we followed the protocols outlined in the description of the dispersal and carryover effects treatments, above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During each check, we counted all adults in each patch, examined the juvenile stages to ensure that no pathogens were affecting dynamics, and counted and removed dead adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We only recorded adult numbers because juvenile stages are not identifiable to species (35, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We removed all dispersing adults, discarded them, and completed dispersal with adults taken from stock colonies as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining resident adults, juvenile stages, and immigrants were then all placed back into the appropriate vial with fresh flour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven monthly checks allowed for 6 mo of interspecies dynamics to take place in the middle patch and 5 mo in each starting patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, this is enough time for five or more egg-to-adult generations in wheat flour and up to three egg-to-adult generation times in oat flour in all landscape patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total_Landscape_Abundance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the presence of natal habitat effects for dispersers could conceivably have either positive (silver spoon), negative (mismatch), or no effects on total abundance across a landscape, we found that they generally increased adult densities across species in our experiment (Fig 2, black lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allowing effects of natal habitats on dispersers significantly increased the total density of adult beetles across landscapes by 9% on average, compared with treatments where phenotypes were only influenced by their current habitat (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantial part of this difference occurred because at the highest dispersal rates 31% (169.5 beetles) more adults persisted in landscapes with more high-quality habitat than in the second-most populous dispersal × landscape combination (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This positive effect of high dispersal rate on total abundance was not present in landscapes dominated by low-quality habitat, leading to a significant interaction between dispersal rate and landscape type (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, carryover effects from natal habitats generally allowed more adult animals to persist within metacommunities, but this depended on habitat patch configuration and dispersal rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The positive influence of carryover effects from natal habitats on total abundance indicates that their positive effects across species and habitat transitions outweighed any negative influences of carryover effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern likely arises from the fact that high-quality habitat produces far more offspring in a shorter amount of time than low-quality habitat; consequently, more dispersers will receive the silver spoon effect of development in high-quality natal habitat, assuming all else is equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even if the magnitude of positive (from high-quality natal habitat) and negative (from low-quality natal habitat) carryover effects on individual fitness are equal, more individuals will be positively affected by their natal habitat because of this asymmetrical numerical response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In treatments that prevented natal habitat effects, individuals moving from high- to low-quality habitat patches immediately assume the phenotype of individuals born in low-quality habitat, which prevents the beneficial silver spoon effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many systems, development in high-quality habitat increases fecundity, indicating that silver spoon effects are common in nature (18, 34, 37, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that predictions that ignore carryover effects of natal habitats may often underestimate the density of organisms in metacommunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_on_Interspecific_Competition_at_the_Landscape_Scale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to increasing total abundance, carryover effects from natal habitats altered competitive outcomes across patches, but the effects were opposite between the two landscape configurations, leading to a significant interaction among carryover and landscape treatments (Fig 2, blue and red lines, and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the landscape was dominated by high-quality habitat, T. castaneum was always the dominant species and received small benefits from natal habitat effects overall (Fig 2 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in landscapes where low-quality habitat dominated, allowing natal habitats to carry over and influence phenotypes of dispersers gave T. confusum a large advantage at low and medium dispersal rates (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low dispersal rates, allowing carryover effects of natal habitats lead to a switch from a landscape slightly dominated by T. castaneum (1.18-times more abundant than T. confusum) to one clearly dominated by T. confusum (1.81-times more abundant than T. castaneum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At medium dispersal rates, allowing carryover effects from natal habitats more than doubled the dominance of T. confusum relative to T. castaneum from 1.61 to 3.88 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when low-quality habitat was more frequent, the presence of carryover effects from natal habitats strongly increased the relative competitive dominance of T. confusum (T. confusum 1.7-times more abundant than T. castaneum across dispersal rates) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because T. castaneum always dominated in landscapes with more high-quality habitat, carryover effects of natal habitats had to be present for T. confusum to have any landscape configuration where it was competitively superior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with previous studies that indicate that changes in natal habitat of dispersers can alter density-dependent competitive interactions between these species in new habitats and help T. confusum to become competitively dominant over T. castaneum (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that when habitats differ among patches, effects of the natal habitats of dispersing individuals can dramatically alter the relative abundance and dominance of species across a landscape, but which species benefits depends on dispersal rates and the composition of habitat types across a region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_on_Interspecific_Competition_at_the_Local_Scale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of carryover effects from natal habitats also altered relative species dominance at the local patch level, revealing further patterns that were not always apparent across the whole landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant higher-order interactions in both models indicate that within-patch dynamics were strongly influenced by the presence or absence of carryover effects from natal habitats (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, when natal habitats were allowed to influence the phenotype of dispersers, this reduced the ability of T. castaneum to invade the T. confusum starting patch in high-quality landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of T. castaneum in their competitors starting patch was on average 45% (low dispersal) and 55% (medium dispersal) lower than in treatments where dispersing individuals were not affected by their natal habitat (i.e., instantly matched the new habitat) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, T. confusum invaded the T. castaneum starting patch in landscapes with more low-quality patches much more effectively in the presence of carryover effects from natal habitats, to the point that T. confusum dominated every patch at medium dispersal rates (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, dispersal altered how carryover effects influenced species abundances within a given patch (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low and moderate dispersal rates, carryover effects of natal habitats differed among individual patches within a landscape, but at high dispersal rates they had largely the same effect regardless of patch identity (Fig 3 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern can be explained by the fact that high dispersal quickly redistributed individuals and thereby lead to equal distribution of individuals across all patches (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this redistribution, carryover effects were also equally partitioned across individual patches and generally benefited both species in a proportionally equal way, especially in landscapes where high habitat quality was more frequent (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when dispersal rates were moderate to low, individual differences in patch dynamics were possible and carryover effects differed across patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicate that carryover effects not only altered relative and total abundance of species within a landscape, but also their distribution across individual habitat patches within a landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Carryover_Effects_in_Nature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies in more natural field settings indicate that natal experience can significantly affect individual traits and population dynamics in a variety of taxa [roe deer (50), choughs (48), bryozoans (27), parrots (51), bluebirds (15)], suggesting that patterns similar to our laboratory system are likely across the landscape in natural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecologists, conservationists, and wildlife managers alike should be aware of the quality/type of habitat that individuals come from and the possibility of unexpected dynamics in focus areas caused by carryover effects of natal habitats on immigrating individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This aspect highlights a possible difficulty in identifying carryover effects in nature, given that it could be critical to know where dispersing individuals come from and what conditions they experienced to identify potential carryover effects when natal and new habitats differ (16, 30, 48, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, carryover effects can alter dispersal decisions and capabilities (16, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work on condition-dependent dispersal and its implications for population dynamics is addressing this question already, although there seems to be little focus on multispecies impacts as of yet (44, 5459).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, we standardized dispersal to isolate carryover effects on species interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is already clear evidence that carryover effects alter dispersal decisions in this system (44) and exploring the consequences of such changes in dispersal behavior for multispecies dynamics is an important next step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carryover effects can thus alter both the processes of dispersal between communities and the interactions between species within communities, suggesting that they can shape metacommunity dynamics in multiple ways (2, 60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of the influence of carryover effects on natural metacommunity dynamics are beginning to appear (15), but more work is needed to find patterns in the frequency and strength of carryover effects in natural communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Carryover_Effects_and_Spatial_Coexistence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial coexistence in metacommunities for species that cannot coexist locally is based primarily on trade-offs along habitat-specific fitness and dispersal-related trait axes (1, 9, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carryover effects may represent a novel trade-off, because their impacts on relative species performance vary depending on the interplay between the relative abundance of habitat types in the landscape and dispersal rates (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, each species in this experiment benefited from allowing natal habitats to influence phenotypes of immigrants under different combinations of dispersal rate and landscape types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These carryover effects of natal habitats led to T. confusum dominating across some landscapes, including in high-quality habitat patches, in which it is usually an inferior competitor (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When natal habitats were not allowed to influence the phenotypes of immigrants, one species alone, T. castaneum, had higher relative abundance across almost all landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because preventing the effects of natal habitat on disperser phenotype is actually the unrealistic treatment in our experiment, it seems possible that natural systems may also experience enhanced spatial coexistence as a result of carryover effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carryover effects across heterogeneous landscapes can thus promote variation in relative species performance within a given habitat type and lead to cascading effects across landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although their effects may be context-dependent, increased understanding of carryover effects and their interaction with heterogeneous habitat quality may improve ecological forecasting and benefit spatial coexistence theory in natural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although heterogeneity in habitat quality and dispersal across landscapes are known to be key drivers of spatial diversity, carryover effects on the traits of dispersing individuals caused by these two factors have been largely neglected (1, 3, 16, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that variation in the natal habitat of dispersing individuals can lead to carryover effects that significantly influence landscape and patch-level patterns of the total and relative abundance of interacting species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas theory and previous experiments suggest that carryover effects could alter metacommunity dynamics, this study is, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence of this from a controlled experiment (4, 16, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that carryover effects did not consistently promote the same species across landscape and dispersal treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the presence of carryover effects magnified differences between species in their performance across different landscapes, indicating that they could promote variation in species performance and potentially facilitate spatial coexistence (10, 11; see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 for a recent example in a natural system).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that we cannot accurately predict the dynamics of metacommunities simply based on the number or rate of dispersers; considering the origin of dispersers and their traits may be necessary as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
