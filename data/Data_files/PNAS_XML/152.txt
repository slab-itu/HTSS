Identification of a mammalian glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase: Role in metabolism and signaling in pancreatic -cells and hepatocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) lies at the crossroads of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism in mammalian cells and is thought to participate in glycolysis or in gluconeogenesis, lipid synthesis, and Gro3P electron transfer shuttle to mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now report a previously unidentified pathway of Gro3P metabolism in mammalian cells with the identification of Gro3P phosphatase (G3PP) that can directly hydrolyze Gro3P to glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that G3PP expression level controls glycolysis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, cellular redox, and mitochondrial energy metabolism in -cells and hepatocytes, as well as glucose-induced insulin secretion and the response to metabolic stress in -cells, and in gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G3PP is a previously unknown player in metabolic regulation and signaling and offers a potential target for cardiometabolic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Obesity, and the associated disturbed glycerolipid/fatty acid (GL/FA) cycle, contribute to insulin resistance, islet -cell failure, and type 2 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flux through the GL/FA cycle is regulated by the availability of glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) and fatty acyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe here a mammalian Gro3P phosphatase (G3PP), which was not known to exist in mammalian cells, that can directly hydrolyze Gro3P to glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified that mammalian phosphoglycolate phosphatase, with an uncertain function, acts in fact as a G3PP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that G3PP, by controlling Gro3P levels, regulates glycolysis and glucose oxidation, cellular redox and ATP production, gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation in pancreatic islet -cells and hepatocytes, and that glucose stimulated insulin secretion and the response to metabolic stress, e.g., glucolipotoxicity, in -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo overexpression of G3PP in rat liver lowers body weight gain and hepatic glucose production from glycerol and elevates plasma HDL levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G3PP is expressed at various levels in different tissues, and its expression varies according to the nutritional state in some tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Gro3P lies at the crossroads of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism, control of its availability by G3PP adds a key level of metabolic regulation in mammalian cells, and G3PP offers a potential target for type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dichotomy_in_Orlistat_Effect_on_Glycerol_and_FFA_Release_in_-Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of a mammalian G3PP started from the fortuitous observation of a dichotomy of inhibitory effects of the panlipase and lipolysis inhibitor orlistat on glycerol and FFA release at various glucose concentrations from -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, orlistat inhibited lipolysis at high glucose concentrations in INS832/13 -cells and in rat islets as evidenced by the reduction in FFA release; however, the increased release of glycerol in the presence of elevated glucose concentration was not inhibited (Fig 1 A and B and Fig S1 A and B), indicating that not all glucose-derived glycerol arises from lipolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rat islet cells, at medium concentration of glucose (10 mM), orlistat showed moderate inhibition of glycerol release, indicating that, at this glucose concentration, a small amount of glycerol does arise from lipolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in -cells, there must exist an alternate mechanism for the production of glycerol besides lipolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct hydrolysis of glucose-derived Gro3P by a hypothetical G3PP is a plausible source of glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Similarity_Between_PGP_and_Bacterial_G3PP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A BLAST analysis of various known G3PP enzymes against mammalian sequences led to the identification of PGP (17), whose function in mammalian cells is uncertain and which belongs to the class of haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type hydrolases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently PGP was suggested to possess protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and was called aspartate-based, ubiquitous, Mg2+-dependent phosphatase (AUM) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the catalytic efficiency of AUM/PGP toward the generic protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenolphosphate was 1,000-fold higher than the activity of the well-established HAD-type protein tyrosine phosphatase Eya3, its activity was 1,000-fold less than that of classical tyrosine phosphatases like PTP1B, TCPTP, or SHP1, raising the possibility that PGP/AUM may also dephosphorylate other low molecular weight substrates/metabolites in addition to those reported previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An amino acid sequence comparison and structural overlay showed high similarity of the murine PGP/AUM cap with the cap domain of the recently described mycobacterial G3PP, Rv1692 (13), in residue orientation and composition, and suggested that PGP is indeed a bona fide G3PP (Fig 1 C and D and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PGP belongs to the subtype of cap-domain containing HAD-phosphatases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This domain features a specificity loop with evolutionarily highly conserved residues that are required for proper substrate coordination in the active site of the hydrolase (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence alignment of Rv1692 and mPGP revealed conservation of a number of those amino acid residues that were recently identified to be important for proper substrate positioning in murine PGP/AUM (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is near-perfect alignment of the cap domains of PGP and Rv1692 and of the critical leucine residue at positions 204 in mPGP (18) and 155 in Rv1692, as revealed by structural overlay (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A zoom in the substrate binding pocket shows that the critical and evolutionarily conserved cap domain residues involved in substrate coordination are identical between PGP and the mycobacterial G3PP, Rv1692 (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PGP_Acts_as_a_Specific_G3PP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified recombinant murine PGP, expressed as described before (18), showed activity with Gro3P, with a Km of 1.29 mM and kcat of 0.1 s1 (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At saturating substrate concentration, mPGP showed specific activity of 100 nmol/min/mg protein with Gro3P, whereas its activity toward other related substrates such as DHAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, creatine phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and ribulose-5-phosphate was much lower (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity with inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and lysophosphatidic acid was seen only with very high nonphysiological concentrations of these compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpressed human PGP in 293T cell extracts showed similar Km (1.4 mM) for Gro3P as the purified murine PGP and a Vmax of 150 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human PGP in whole-cell extracts showed similar affinity for 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG; 1.5 mM) but higher Vmax (500 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating that this enzyme has higher capacity to hydrolyze 2-PG (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the same incubation conditions, activity with glucose-6-phosphate was negligible (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In INS832/13 rat -cells, there was a significant amount of native PGP/G3PP enzyme in terms of Vmax, which was 47 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High glucose concentration stimulated glycerol release in INS832/13 -cells was reduced by RNAi knockdown of native PGP (Fig 1 I and J and Fig S1D), greatly elevated by overexpression of human PGP (Fig 1 K and L), and the decrease caused by RNAi knockdown was reversed by overexpression of hPGP in the same cells (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the data demonstrate that PGP acts as a G3PP in vitro and in intact cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3PP_Activity_Controls_Insulin_Secretion_and_Glucolipotoxicity_in_Pancreatic_-Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Gro3P is one of the starting substrates for the GL/FA cycle that produces lipid signals for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), alteration of Gro3P levels by G3PP should influence insulin secretion (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three different G3PP-siRNAs reduced G3PP expression effectively (Fig S1D), and we selected G3PP-siRNA-1 and control siRNA-1 for rest of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with this prediction, RNAi knockdown of native rat G3PP in INS832/13 -cells elevated GSIS (Fig 2A), whereas overexpression of hG3PP reduced GSIS (Fig 2B) without affecting basal secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained in isolated rat islets infected with lentiviral shRNA-G3PP for RNAi knockdown or adenoviral hG3PP for overexpression (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of G3PP activity in regulating GSIS was confirmed by the observation that overexpression of hG3PP in INS832/13 cells curtailed the increased GSIS caused by RNAi knockdown of endogenous G3PP (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic elevated glucose exposure of -cells without or with high concentrations of exogenous FFA cause glucotoxicity and glucolipotoxicity, respectively, as indicated by caspase-3 activity, an index of apoptosis (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism involves enhanced glucose metabolism and esterification of FFA (23), resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing G3PP expression in INS832/13 -cells, which is likely to elevate the formation of glycerolipid intermediates, caused enhanced glucotoxicity (Fig 2E), whereas overexpression of hG3PP led to decreased glucotoxicity (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucolipotoxicity, which was enhanced by G3PP knockdown, was curtailed by hG3PP overexpression that also reversed the toxic effect of G3PP knockdown under glucolipotoxic condition (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, changes in G3PP activity in the -cell modulate insulin secretion and the response to metabolic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Distribution_and_Nutritional_Regulation_of_G3PP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression of G3PP at the mRNA (Fig S2 A, C, and E) and protein (Fig S2 B, D, and F) levels is apparently ubiquitous, as it was detected in all tissues examined; it was found to be particularly high in testis, followed by heart, skeletal muscle, and islet tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver, kidney, intestine, and visceral white adipose tissue showed low expression, probably because these tissues are engaged in gluconeogenesis and/or lipogenesis, both of which require Gro3P supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high expression of G3PP in heart and skeletal muscle possibly ensures no toxic accumulation of lipids in these fat-burning tissues (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of this enzyme in testis is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G3PP expression is regulated by nutritional status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, G3PP mRNA and protein is inversely changed in white adipose vs. brown adipose tissue (BAT) under fed and fasted states (Fig S2 A and B) and under high-fat diet (HFD) vs. normal diet conditions (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes may reflect the adaptation for regulation of nutrient metabolism in adipose tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elevated G3PP in white adipose tissue in fasted state ensures supply of glycerol into circulation rather than glycerol reincorporation into glycerolipids (25) for the purposes of gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney, whereas the decreased G3PP expression in BAT ensures trapping of incoming FFA and glucose into glycerolipids for future use, as well as for fuel use for thermogenesis during fasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the decreased expression of G3PP in white adipose tissue in HFD condition should help in the storage of fat, whereas, in BAT, such storage is not needed and the elevated G3PP levels ensure effective burning of fatty acids in BAT mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, nutritional control of G3PP exemplifies the importance of this enzyme in fuel and energy metabolism as its expression is differentially regulated in different tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3PP_Expression_Level_Influences_Glucose__Lipid__and_Energy_Metabolism_in_-Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Gro3P is a central metabolic intermediate that lies at the crossroads of glucose and lipid metabolism, we examined whether G3PP also plays a critical role in metabolic regulation (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, RNAi knockdown of G3PP in INS832/13 cells increased the synthesis of 1,2(2,3)-DAG, 1,3-DAG, TG, total phospholipids, lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidate, and lysophosphatidylcholine (Fig 3A and Fig S3A), whereas overexpression led to their decreased synthesis (Fig 3B and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that many of these lipids have signaling roles in different cells (3), G3PP is likely to regulate these signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In INS832/13 cells, altered activity of G3PP had no effect on fatty acid oxidation at low or high glucose concentration (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FFA release from these cells, which is mostly dependent on lipolysis, was elevated when G3PP was overexpressed, indicating that a reduction in Gro3P levels following G3PP overexpression lowers the reesterification of FFA, leading to their elevated release from the cells (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rat islets, glucose-stimulated glycerol release was lowered by G3PP knockdown and increased by G3PP overexpression (Fig 3E), similar to that noticed with INS832/13 cells (Fig 1 J and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Gro3P directly transfers electrons to mitochondria via the action of mitochondrial Gro3P dehydrogenase, changes in Gro3P levels during glucose oxidation are expected to influence respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in rat islet cells, reducing G3PP expression led to elevated O2 consumption and ATP production (Fig 3F), whereas hG3PP overexpression caused opposite changes (Fig 3G), without affecting H+ leak in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by using INS832/13 cells (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered G3PP protein levels were confirmed in rat islet cells after shRNA knockdown and hG3PP overexpression (Fig 3 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased ATP levels in -cells by G3PP knockdown relate to the increased GSIS seen under these conditions (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, altered expression of G3PP in -cells has a significant impact on glucose, lipid, and mitochondrial metabolism, and consequently on the response of these cells for metabolic signal transduction and GSIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3PP_Controls_Glycolysis__Gluconeogenesis__and_Lipid_Metabolism_in_Hepatocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liver is the major site of gluconeogenesis starting from amino acids or adipose lipolysis-derived glycerol, and both pathways involve the formation of Gro3P (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in primary rat hepatocytes, shRNA knockdown of G3PP (Fig S4A) led to a great increase in gluconeogenesis from glycerol and from pyruvate plus lactate (Fig 4A), whereas overexpression of hG3PP in these cells (Fig S4B) completely curtailed gluconeogenesis (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fatty acid oxidation in liver is dependent on the availability of fatty acyl-CoA substrate, which is controlled by the extent of esterification by glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fatty acid oxidation was directly related to G3PP expression levels in rat hepatocytes, and, at high glucose levels, which suppress -oxidation, elevated G3PP expression led to enhanced fatty acid oxidation (Fig 4 B and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is different from the results with INS832/13 cells and probably reflects the highly lipogenic nature of liver tissue compared with -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FFA entering cells must be esterified before being oxidized following lipolysis of endogenous lipid stores (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hepatocytes as well, glycerol release at high glucose levels was reduced by G3PP knockdown and elevated by its overexpression (Fig 4 C and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knockdown of G3PP in hepatocytes enhanced lactate production and release, an index of glycolytic flux, as expected, because of decreased diversion of glucose carbons in the form of glycerol via G3PP (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, overexpression of hG3PP had the reverse effects, reducing glycolytic flux (Fig 4 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall increase in glycolytic flux compared with noninfected cells is a result of viral infection, which is known to accelerate glycolysis (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the changes in INS832/13 cells, lipogenesis was affected by altered G3PP expression in rat hepatocytes (Fig 4 K and L and Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of cholesterol esters was markedly decreased by the overexpression of G3PP in liver cells (Fig S4D), and this may be a result of reduced availability of fatty acyl groups because of their enhanced flux through mitochondrial -oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Regulation_of_Cellular_Redox_and_Energy_Production_by_G3PP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolite measurements using LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy) in rat hepatocytes revealed a significant decrease in Gro3P and DHAP following hG3PP overexpression, whereas G3PP knockdown led to a marked increase in Gro3P at 25 mM glucose (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the intracellular metabolite concentrations assuming average intracellular water volume to be 2.54 L/mg protein (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular Gro3P concentrations in control hepatocytes were 2 mM and 4.5 mM at 5 mM and 25 mM glucose, respectively, and the corresponding DHAP concentrations were 0.03 mM and 0.095 mM, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the intracellular Gro3P concentration is sufficient for the G3PP to use this substrate effectively, as it is in the range of its Km value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of Gro3P/DHAP increased greatly only when G3PP was knocked down at 25 mM glucose (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lactate levels decreased and pyruvate levels increased after G3PP overexpression, and the opposite changes were noted after G3PP knockdown (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with the enzymatic measurements of lactate (Fig 4 D, E, I, and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the ratio of lactate to pyruvate, which reflects the cytosolic redox, was decreased by G3PP overexpression and increased by G3PP knockdown (Fig 5F), indicating that G3PP regulates cellular redox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, G3PP levels were reciprocally related to cellular total NADH levels (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noticed a significant decline in total NAD+ levels by G3PP overexpression (Fig 5H), which may be related to lowered production of ATP (Fig 5K), which is needed for the synthesis of NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such reduced formation of ATP during respiration was also observed in rat islet cells (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in cellular redox ratio (i.e., NADH/NAD+) were more evident upon G3PP knockdown than after G3PP overexpression (Fig 5I), probably because of reduced total NAD+ levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that G3PP, by promoting Gro3P to glycerol conversion, actually regulates NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cell and thus ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, overexpression of G3PP causes a shift in glucose carbon flux toward glycerol formation, leading to a decrease in DHAP and also in NADH (used for DHAP-to-Gro3P conversion; see Fig 2H), which results in reduced ATP formation and also reduced lactate production, an index of glycolysis, in hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse is true when G3PP is knocked down, leading to elevated ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, G3PP appears to directly regulate cellular redox and energy production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gro3P_but_Not_2-Phosphoglycolate_Is_the_Physiologically_Relevant_Substrate_for_G3PP_PGP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significantly, 2-PG levels were found to be very low (less_than0.04 nmol/mg protein or less_than0.02 mM), approximately 250-fold lower than Gro3P levels and also 75-fold lower than the Km for PGP/G3PP, in hepatocytes, and the cellular content of G3PP/PGP had no major effect on 2-PG levels (Fig 5J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Gro3P cellular concentration calculated from our results on hepatocytes ranges from 2 mM to 4.5 mM at low and high glucose concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in INS832/13 cells, Gro3P concentration was calculated to be 1.5 mM at 10 mM glucose concentration (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cellular concentrations of Gro3P are quite favorable for G3PP/PGP to use this substrate effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results indicated that 2-PG is not a physiologically relevant substrate for this enzyme, at least in hepatocytes, even though this enzyme can efficiently hydrolyze 2-PG when available at very high concentrations in a cell extract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to keep in mind that 2-PG is formed in cells during repair of DNA strands when they are broken, for example, in the presence of chemical agents like bleomycin or radiation (32), and its levels in normal tissues and cells are quite low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported earlier that 2-PG levels in liver tissue are approximately 1920 M (33) and that, in many other tissues and blood, this metabolite is present in micromolar concentrations only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the normal physiological function of this enzyme is very likely to be in the control of Gro3P levels via its hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Overexpression_of_G3PP_Reduces_Hepatic_Glucose_Production_and_Plasma_TGs_in_Rats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further understand the metabolic regulatory role of G3PP, we injected adenoviral vector coding for hG3PP (Adv-hG3PP) or GFP (Adv-GFP; control) to rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One week after injection, expression of G3PP in liver was greatly elevated (Fig 6 A and B), whereas it was not altered in other tissues (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day after injection, Adv-hG3PPinjected rats showed 10% reduction in body weight (BW), which was maintained for the next 6 d compared with Adv-GFPinjected rats (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adv-G3PP rats also showed a modest reduction in cumulative food intake (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After one week, plasma glycerol levels were markedly elevated (Fig 6F), indicating that the overexpressed G3PP in liver is able to generate glycerol in vivo, which is released into blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the observation in isolated hepatocytes and INS832/13 cells, in vivo liver overexpression of G3PP led to reduced plasma TG levels (Fig 6G), which is likely a result of reduced hepatic TG synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circulating LDL and HDL were modestly affected, with HDL showing a significant increase (Fig S4 E and F) and LDL showing a decreasing trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic glucose production from glycerol during a glycerol load test was reduced in Adv-G3PPinjected rats (Fig 6H), showing that liver gluconeogenesis from glycerol was affected, as was the case with isolated rat hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The possibility of Gro3P hydrolysis in mammalian cells (34) and fish (11, 35) was previously considered, but no clear evidence could be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent work, it has been suggested that, in liver, there is a NADH/NAD+ ratio-dependent direct formation of glycerol from Gro3P, generated by high carbohydrate intake, particularly under conditions of mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform-2 (i.e., citrin) deficiency; however, no enzyme for this conversion was suggested (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, it has been proposed that the action of the antidiabetic agent metformin entails, at least in part, mitochondrial Gro3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH) inhibition, resulting in increased hepatic cytosolic redox that lowers hepatic gluconeogenesis (37) (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present work, the net anticipated result of enhanced G3PP activity and reduced Gro3P levels is also decreased flux through mitochondrial G3PDH because there is less substrate for this enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, G3PP activation will result in decreased cytosolic NADH rather than increased, as metformin does.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, because of the irreversible nature of G3PP reaction, its overactivity pulls glycolytic carbon flux toward glycerol formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, cytosolic NADH, which is formed during glycolysis, is consumed to reduce dihydroxyacetone-phosphate to Gro3P by cytosolic Gro3P dehydrogenase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, metformin and elevated G3PP activity inhibit gluconeogenesis, but via different mechanisms: metformin by increasing the cytosolic redox and G3PP by removing Gro3P and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, the substrates of gluconeogenesis (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, we have identified a metabolic enzyme in mammalian cells that can directly transform Gro3P to glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of a previously unrecognized G3PP in mammalian cells is an important addition to our understanding of metabolic regulation and signaling at large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that G3PP expression level controls several metabolic pathways and biological processes (Fig 2H) in a tumoral -cell line and in normal rat islet cells as well as in hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include, depending on the cell type, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, phospholipid synthesis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial energy metabolism, cellular redox, and ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, G3PP regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion and the response to metabolic stress in the -cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, G3PP is an attractive target for metabolic syndrome-related disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is anticipated that enhanced activity of G3PP to be beneficial under conditions of type 2 diabetes and obesity, as it protects -cells from fuel surfeit toxicity and from exhaustion caused by overstimulation by high glucose concentrations and reduces hepatic glucose production and the lipogenic burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Gluconeogenesis_and_Glycolysis_in_Hepatocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For gluconeogenesis determination, after infection with adeno- or lentiviral constructs, hepatocytes were starved in DMEM without glucose for 2 h, followed by incubation in glucose-free DMEM (pH 7.4) without phenol red, supplemented with 10 mM glycerol or 20 mM sodium lactate plus 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 15 mM Hepes for 2 h. After incubation, the medium was processed for glucose measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycolysis was assessed by lactate content and lactate release measurement, as lactate is considered a reliable index of steady-state glycolysis in isolated hepatocytes in culture (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Rats injected with Adv-G3PP or Adv-GFP were fed a chow diet for 1 wk and, on the seventh day, food was withdrawn for 12 h. Then, 87% (wt/vol) glycerol (5 mg/g BW) was administered orally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was collected from the tail vein before and at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 50 min, and 60 min after glycerol load, and blood glucose was measured by using a glucometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PGP_G3PP_Protein_Expression_and_Activity_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified recombinant murine PGP/G3PP (18) was assayed by using EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mix in a volume of 100 L, containing 50 mM triethanolamineHCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5), and indicated concentrations of Gro3P, was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction at 37 °C was started by the addition of 1 µg purified PGP/G3PP, and phosphatase activity was then monitored by measuring absorbance at 360 nm in a microplate reader (Spectramax Plus 384; Molecular Devices) and corrected for background absorbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human PGP/G3PP in extracts of overexpressing 293T cells (10 µg cell extract protein) or control INS832/13 cells (30 µg cell extract protein) was assayed by using a Phosphate Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mix (final volume, 200 µL) containing 50 mM triethanolamineHCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5), indicated concentrations of Gro3P, 2-PG, and glucose-6-phosphate was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, and the reaction was started by the addition of G3PP overexpressed or control extracts and continued for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphatase activity was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm on a microplate reader (Greiner Bio-one).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To derive KM and Kcat values, the data were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using GraphPad Prism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The pCMV-based plasmids (Origene) expressing human G3PP (PGP; SC311252) and GFP (PS100010) were introduced into INS832/13 cells by using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h in 96-well, 12-well, or 6-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencer select predesigned siRNA against G3PP (rat PGP) and two scrambled siRNA were obtained from Ambion (G3PP, s220489; scrambled siRNA-1, 4390844; scrambled si-RNAi-2, 4390847).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences for G3PP used were 5-AGGCGGACAUCAUCGGGAAtt-3 and 5-UUCCCGAUGAUGUCCGCCUgg-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA constructs were introduced into INS832/13 cells by reverse transfection using RNAiMAX and used 48 h after transfection (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were used for Western blotting and measurements of insulin secretion, caspase activity, glycerol and FFA release, oxygen consumption, and fatty acid oxidation and esterification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue and cell lysates were prepared and extracted proteins were processed for immunoblotting (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were incubated with antibodies for G3PP/PGP (sc-241605, dilution 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse monoclonal -actin (dilution 1:10,000) and rabbit polyclonal -tubulin (dilution 1:20,000) antibodies were from Sigma and Abcam, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RT-qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from INS832/13 cells, islet cells, and rodent tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA in 50 L (final volume) of a buffer containing the Pd(N)6 random primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-qPCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Robotics), and the PCR products were quantified using the FastStart DNA Master PLUS SYBR Green kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels were normalized for the 18S or cyclophilin mRNA transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primer sequences were as follows: 18S mRNA forward (5-CTGAGAAACGGCTACCACATC-3), reverse (5-GGCCTCGAAAGAGTCCTGTAT-3); cyclophilin forward (5- CTTGCTGCAGACATGGTCAAC-3), reverse (5- GCCATTATGGCGTGTGAAGTC-3); mouse G3Pase forward (5-CTGGACACAGACATCCTCCTG-3), reverse (5-TCACTTTCCTGATTGCTCTTCA-3); and rat G3Pase forward (5-GACAACCTCCACTCACTCTGC-3), reverse (5- AAGTTTAGCTGGGCTGCTGTT -3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FFAs_and_Glycerol_Release  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For FFA determinations, isolated rat islet cells were preincubated for 1 h in KRBH containing 2 mM glutamine and at 4 mM glucose, 50 M carnitine, and then incubated for 2 h at 4 mM, 10 mM, 16 mM, and 25 mM glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low and high glucose concentrations were 2 mM and 10 mM, respectively, when INS832/13 cells were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubations were done without and with the panlipase inhibitor orlistat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells and islets were harvested after incubations for protein extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FFA released into the medium were extracted by a modified DoleMeinertz extraction procedure (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the media (0.5 mL), in Pyrex glass tubes, were mixed with the internal standard [2H31]palmitic acid and extracted with 2.5 mL of a solvent mixture containing isopropanol-n-heptane-2M phosphoric acid (40:10:1, vol/vol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After thorough mixing by vortex, the tubes were kept in a bath sonicator (Branson Ultrasonic) and sonicated for 2 min with 30-s intervals, avoiding sample heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After rigorous mixing by vortex, the tubes were let stand at room temperature for 10 min, and then heptane (1 mL) and water (1.5 mL) were added and the tubes were thoroughly mixed by vortex followed by sonication for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aliquot of 1.5 mL (88% of the total organic layer) from the top layer was transferred to 2.0 mL Reacti-Vials (Supelco) and dried under nitrogen (N-Evap; Organomation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dried fatty acids were derivatized with phenacylbromide and quantified by reverse-phase HPLC (44) using a Zorbax Eclipse plus XDB analytical C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; 5 m; Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FFAs were eluted using methanol/water (92.5:7.5, vol/vol) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and absorbance of eluting FFA-phenacyl derivatives was measured at 242 nm and 254 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peaks were identified by their retention times, and the concentrations of individual fatty acids were computed by the internal standard method from peak area using the standard curves of individual FFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycerol release was determined by a radiometric glycerol assay (45) using [-32P]ATP and glycerokinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

INS832/13 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing hG3PP or GFP (control) or siRNA targeting G3PP or control siRNA as described earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fatty acid esterification and oxidation in the transfected INS832/13 cells were measured after incubating the cells as for insulin secretion experiments as described earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, for fatty acid oxidation, the cells were incubated in KRBH containing 0.1 mM unlabeled palmitate, 2 µCi/mL [9,10-3H]palmitate (51 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), plus 0.5% defatted BSA, 1 mM carnitine, and 2 mM or 10 mM glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Esterification of FA was followed under similar incubation conditions, with 0.2 mM unlabeled palmitate, 0.1 µCi/mL [1-14C]palmitate (57.5 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), plus 0.5% defatted BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary hepatocytes (0.2 million cells per well in 12-well plate for FA oxidation and 0.5 million cells per well in six-well plate for FA esterification) were first preincubated for 45 min in 1 mL of DMEM containing 5 mM glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then incubated for 2 h in 0.5 mL (FA oxidation) or 1 mL (FA esterification) of DMEM with 0.25% defatted BSA, 0.1 mM palmitate (for oxidation, with 2 µCi/mL [9,10-3H]palmitate) or 0.2 mM palmitate (for esterification, with 0.1 µCi/mL [1-14C]palmitate), at 5 mM or 25 mM glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FA esterification determination, at the end of the incubations, INS832/13 cells or primary hepatocytes were collected and washed in cold PBS solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total lipids were extracted using Folch reagent (47) and separated by TLC by using a solvent system (petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid; 70/30/1) to measure the incorporation of labeled palmitate into various lipids species (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FA oxidation was determined by collecting and measuring the released 3H2O into incubation medium (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glucotoxicity_and_Glucolipotoxicity_in_INS832_13_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of either overexpression or knockdown of G3PP in INS832/13 cells on glucotoxicity and glucolipotoxicity was assessed by culturing the transfected cells in a 96-well plate for 48 h, followed by replacing the medium with 50 L of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 0.5% BSA, and 5 mM or 20 mM glucose with or without 0.3 mM palmitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubations were continued for an additional 24 or 72 h, after which caspase-3 activity, which reflects apoptosis, was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubations with 5 mM glucose in the absence of palmitate served as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total caspase-3 activity in each well was determined by using the Caspase 3/7 Luminescent Assay kit (Caspase-Glo; Promega) and normalized to the DNA content in each well, measured with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
