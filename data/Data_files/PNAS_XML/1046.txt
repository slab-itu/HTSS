The eardrums move when the eyes move: A multisensory effect on the mechanics of hearing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The peripheral hearing system contains several motor mechanisms that allow the brain to modify the auditory transduction process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movements or tensioning of either the middle ear muscles or the outer hair cells modifies eardrum motion, producing sounds that can be detected by a microphone placed in the ear canal (e.g., as otoacoustic emissions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a form of eardrum motion produced by the brain via these systems: oscillations synchronized with and covarying with the direction and amplitude of saccades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that a vision-related process modulates the first stage of hearing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, these eye movement-related eardrum oscillations may help the brain connect sights and sounds despite changes in the spatial relationship between the eyes and the ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interactions between sensory pathways such as the visual and auditory systems are known to occur in the brain, but where they first occur is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show a multimodal interaction evident at the eardrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (n = 19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (n = 5 ears in three subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These eardrum movements, which we dub eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude and phase of the EMREOs depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Motile cochlear OHCs expand and contract in a way that depends both on the incoming sound and on the descending input received from the superior olivary complex in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OHC motion moves the basilar membrane, and subsequently the eardrum, via fluid/mechanical coupling of these membranes through the ossicular chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MEMs also pull on the ossicles, directly moving the eardrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These muscles are innervated by motor neurons near the facial and trigeminal nerve nuclei, which receive input from the superior olive bilaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, eardrum motion can be measured with a microphone in the ear canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Eardrums_Move_with_Saccades  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sixteen humans executed saccades to visual targets varying in horizontal position (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the trials were silent, whereas the other half incorporated a series of task-irrelevant clicks presented before, during, and at two time points after the saccades (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to compare the effects of eye movement-related neural signals on the auditory periphery in silence as well as in the presence of sounds often used to elicit OAEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the eardrum moved when the eyes moved, even in the absence of any externally delivered sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 D and E shows the average eye position as a function of time for each target location for the human subjects on trials with no sound stimulus, aligned with respect to (w.r.t.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  saccade onset (Fig 2D) and offset (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding average microphone voltages are similarly aligned and color-coded for saccade direction and amplitude (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microphone readings oscillated, time-locked to both saccade onset and offset with a phase that depended on saccade direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the eyes moved toward a visual target contralateral to the ear being recorded, the microphone voltage deflected positively, indicating a change in ear canal pressure, beginning about 10 ms before eye movement onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by a more substantial negative deflection at about 5 ms after the onset of the eye movement, after which additional oscillatory cycles occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period of the oscillation is typically about 30 ms (33 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For saccades in the opposite (ipsilateral) direction, the microphone signal followed a similar pattern but in the opposite direction: The initial deflection of the oscillation was negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of the oscillations appears to vary with the amplitude of the saccades, with larger saccades associated with larger peaks than those occurring for smaller saccades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the traces aligned on saccade onset vs. saccade offset reveals that the oscillations continue into at least the initial portion of the period of steady fixation that followed saccade offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eye movement-related eardrum oscillation (EMREO) observed following saccade offset was similar in form to that observed during the saccade itself when the microphone traces were aligned on saccade onset, maintaining their phase and magnitude dependence on saccade direction and length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that this postsaccadic continuation of the EMREO is not seen when the traces are aligned on saccade onset suggests a systematic relationship between the offset of the movement and the phase of the EMREO, such that variation in saccade duration obscures the ongoing nature of the EMREO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a portrait of the statistical significance of the relationship between the direction and amplitude of the eye movements and the observed microphone measurements of ear canal pressure across time, we calculated a regression of microphone voltage vs. saccade target location for each 0.04-ms sample from 25 ms before to 100 ms after saccade onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression was conducted separately for each individual subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this involved many repeated statistical tests, we compared the real results with a Monte Carlo simulation in which we ran the same analysis but scrambled the relationship between each trial and its true saccade target location (details are provided in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, the slope of the regression involving the real data (red trace, averaged across subjects) frequently deviates from zero, indicating a relationship between saccade amplitude and direction and microphone voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of the slope oscillates during the saccade period, beginning 9 ms before and continuing until about 60 ms after saccade onset, matching the oscillations evident in the data in Fig 2F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the scrambled data trace (Fig 3A, gray) is flat during this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the effect size (R2 values) of the real data deviates from the scrambled baseline in a similar but slightly longer time frame, dropping back to the scrambled data baseline at 75100 ms after saccade onset (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3E shows the percentage of subjects showing a statistically significant (P less_than 0.05) effect of saccade target location at each time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This curve reaches 80100% during the peaks of the oscillations observed at the population level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar, although weaker, dependence of the EMREO on target location was observed when the recordings were synchronized to saccade offset (Fig 3 B, D, and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeated this test in an additional dataset (human dataset II; Methods) involving finer grained sampling within a hemifield (i.e., analyzing target locations within the contralateral or ipsilateral hemifield).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis confirmed the relationship between the microphone voltage and saccade amplitude, as well as saccade direction (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMREO_Phase_Is_Related_to_Relative__Not_Absolute__Saccade_Direction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the EMREOs in subjects who had both ears recorded confirmed that the direction of the eye movement relative to the recorded ear determines the phase pattern of the EMREO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 shows the results for one such subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the left ear was recorded, leftward eye movements were associated with a positive voltage peak at saccade onset (Fig 4A, blue traces), whereas when the right ear was recorded, that same pattern occurred for rightward eye movements (Fig 4B, blue traces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translating this into eardrum motion, the implication is that for a given moment during a given saccade, the eardrums bulge inward in one ear while bulging outward in the other ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which ear does what when is determined by the direction of the eye movement relative to the recorded ear (contralaterality/ipsilaterality), not whether it is directed to the left vs. right in space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other subjects tested with both ears showed similar patterns, and those tested with one ear were also generally consistent (although there were some individual idiosyncrasies in timing and amplitude; the remaining individual subject data are shown in Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relating_the_EMREO_Signal_to_Eardrum_Displacement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the low frequencies characteristic of EMREO oscillations (30 Hz), mean eardrum displacement is directly proportional to the pressure produced in the small volume enclosed between the microphone and the eardrum (1 cc for humans).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We converted the EMREO voltage signal to pressure using the microphone calibration curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At frequencies below about 200 Hz, the nominal microphone sensitivity quoted by the manufacturer does not apply, and so we used the complex frequency response measured by Christensen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29) (details are provided in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the group average EMREO had peak-to-peak pressure changes near 42 mPa for 18° contralateral saccades, as well as an initial phase opposite to the microphone voltage (Fig 5C, maximum excursion of dark red traces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ear canal dimensions typical of the adult ear (30), this pressure, the equivalent of about 57-dB peak-equivalent sound pressure level (SPL), corresponds to a mean peak-to-peak eardrum displacement of 4 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the inferred initial deflection of the eardrum was always opposite to the direction of the saccade: When the eyes moved left, the eardrums moved right, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMREOs_in_Monkeys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As noted earlier, eye movements are known to affect neural processing in several areas of the auditory pathway (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this previous work was conducted using nonhuman primate subjects, we sought to determine whether EMREOs also occur in monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the ears of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; n = 5 ears in three monkeys) performing a paradigm involving a trial type that was a hybrid of those used for the humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hybrid trial type was silent until after the eye movement, after which a single click was delivered with a 200- to 270-ms variable delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMREOs were observed with timing and waveforms roughly similar to those observed in the human subjects, both at the population level (Fig 6 BD) and at the individual subject level (Fig 6E, individual traces are shown in Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-wise regression analysis suggests that the monkey EMREO begins at about the time of the saccade and reaches a robust level about 8 ms later (Fig 4 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Controls_for_Electrical_Artifact  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Control experiments ruled out electrical artifacts as possible sources of these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we were concerned that the microphones circuitry could have acted as an antenna and could have been influenced by eye movement-related electrical signals in either the eye movement measurement system in monkeys (scleral eye coils) and/or some other component of the experimental environment: electrooculographic signals resulting from the electrical dipole of the eye or myogenic artifacts, such as electromyographic signals, originating from the extraocular, facial, or auricular muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such artifacts contributed to our measurements, they should have continued to do so when the microphone was acoustically plugged without additional electrical shielding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we selected four subjects with prominent effects of eye movements on the microphone signal (Fig 7A) and repeated the test while the acoustic port of the microphone was plugged (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eye movement-related effects were no longer evident when the microphone was acoustically occluded (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that eye movement-related changes in the microphone signal stem from its capacity to measure acoustic signals rather than electrical artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, EMREOs were not observed when the microphone was placed in a 1-mL syringe (the approximate volume of the ear canal) and positioned directly behind the pinna of one human subject (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this configuration, any electrical contamination should be similar to that in the regular experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw none, supporting the interpretation that the regular ear canal microphone measurements are detecting eardrum motion and not electrical artifact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMREOs_and_Click_Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EMREOs occurred not only in silence but also when sounds were presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During half of our trials for human subjects, acoustic clicks (65-dB peak-equivalent SPL) were delivered during the initial fixation, during the saccade to the target, and at both 100 ms and 200 ms after obtaining target fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clicks presented during the saccade superimposed on the ongoing EMREO (Fig 8B1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subtraction of the clicks measured during the fixation period (Fig 8A1) indicated that the EMREO was not appreciably changed by the presence of the click (Fig 8B2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike saccade onset or offset, the click did not appear to reset the phase of the EMREO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clicks delivered after the eye movement was complete (Fig 8 C1, C2, D1, and D2) revealed no new sound-triggered effects attributable to the different static eye fixation positions achieved by the subjects by that point of the trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results in monkeys, for which only one postsaccadic click was delivered (at 75-dB peak-equivalent SPL), were similar (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we tested the peak-to-peak amplitude of the microphone signal corresponding to the click itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any changes in the recorded amplitude of a click despite the same voltage having been applied to the earbud speaker would indicate changes to the acoustic impedance of the ear as a function of saccade direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the peak-to-peak amplitude of the click as a function of saccade target location, but found no clear evidence of any saccade target location-related differences during any of the temporal epochs (Fig 8 A3E3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the mechanisms causing the eardrum to move produce concomitant changes in the dynamic stiffness of the eardrum, they are too small to be detected with this technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we demonstrated a regular and predictable pattern of oscillatory movements of the eardrum associated with movements of the eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the eyes move left, both eardrums initially move right and then oscillate for three to four cycles, with another one to two cycles occurring after the eye movement is complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eye movements in the opposite direction produce an oscillatory pattern in the opposite direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This EMREO is present in both human and nonhuman primates and appears similar across both ears within individual subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impact of the eye movement-related process revealed here on subsequent auditory processing remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of OAEs, the emissions themselves are easily overlooked, near-threshold sounds in the ear canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the cochlear mechanisms that give rise to them have a profound impact on the sensitivity and dynamic range of hearing (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OAEs thus serve as a biomarker for the health of this important mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMREOs may constitute a similar biomarker indicating that information about the direction, amplitude, and time of occurrence of saccadic eye movements has reached the periphery and that such information is affecting underlying mechanical processes that may not themselves be readily observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMREO assessment may therefore have value in understanding auditory and visual-auditory deficits that contribute to disorders ranging from language impairments to autism and schizophrenia, as well as multisensory deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One important unresolved question is whether the oscillatory nature of the effect observed here reflects the most important aspects of the phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that the oscillations reflect changes to internal structures within the ear that persist statically until the eye moves again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, then the impact on auditory processing would not be limited to the period of time when the eardrum is actually oscillating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, processing could be affected at all times, updating to a new state with each eye movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the oscillations themselves are the most critical element of the phenomenon, and auditory processing is only affected during these oscillations, then it becomes important to determine for what proportion of the time they occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our paradigm, we were able to demonstrate oscillations occurring over a total period of 110 ms, based on the aggregate results from aligning on saccade onset and offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They may continue longer than that, but with a phase that changes in relation to some unmeasured or uncontrolled variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As time passes after the eye movement, the phase on individual trials might drift such that the oscillation disappears from the across-trial average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the eyes moving about three times per second under normal conditions, an EMREO duration of about 110 ms for each saccade corresponds to about one-third of the time in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regardless, evidence arguing for a possible influence on auditory processing can be seen in the size of EMREOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A head-to-head comparison of EMREOs with OAEs is difficult since auditory detection thresholds are higher in the frequency range of EMREOs than in the range of OAEs, but EMREOs appear to be at least comparable and possibly larger than OAEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 18° horizontal saccades, EMREOs produce a maximum peak-equivalent pressure of about 57-dB SPL, whereas click-evoked OAEs range from 0- to 20-dB SPL in healthy ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar or greater scale of EMREOs supports the interpretation that they too likely reflect underlying mechanisms of sufficient strength to make a meaningful contribution to auditory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In whatever fashion EMREOs, or their underlying mechanism, contribute to auditory processing, we surmise that the effect concerns the localization of sounds with respect to the visual scene or using eye movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining whether a sight and a sound arise from a common spatial position requires knowing the relationship between the visual eye-centered and auditory head-centered reference frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eye position acts as a conversion factor from eye- to head-centered coordinates (1), and eye movement-related signals have been identified in multiple auditory-responsive brain regions (217).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction/phase and amplitude of EMREOs contain information about the direction and amplitude of the accompanying eye movements, which situates them well for playing a causal role in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that we view the EMREO as most likely contributing to normal and accurate sound localization behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sounds can be accurately localized using eye movements regardless of initial eye position (33), and this is true even for brief sounds presented when the eyes are in flight (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some studies have found subtle influences of eye position on sound perception tasks (3542), such effects are only consistent when prolonged fixation is involved (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holding the eyes steady for a seconds to minutes represents a substantial departure from the time frame in which eye movements normally occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that deficiencies in the EMREO system under such circumstances contribute to these inaccuracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The source of the signals that cause EMREOs is not presently known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the EMREOs precede, or occur simultaneously, with actual movement onset, it appears likely that they derive from a copy of the motor command to generate the eye movement rather than a proprioceptive signal from the orbits, which would necessarily lag the actual eye movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This centrally generated signal must then affect the activity of either MEMs or OHCs, or a combination of both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on similarities between our recordings and known physiological activity of the MEMs, we presume that the mechanism behind this phenomenon is most likely the MEMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the frequency (around 2040 Hz) is similar to oscillations observed in previous recordings of both the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles (4651).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it seems unlikely, given the measured fall-off in reverse middle ear transmission at low frequencies (52), that OHC activity could produce ear canal sounds of the magnitude observed (42-mPa peak-to-peak or 57-dB peak-equivalent SPL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MEMs are often associated with bilaterally attenuating loud environmental and self-generated sounds (which their activity may precede), they are also known to be active in the absence of explicit auditory stimuli, particularly during rapid eye movement sleep (5356) and nonacoustic startle reflexes (51, 5761), and have been found to exhibit activity associated with movements of the head and neck in awake cats (57, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (This latter observation is worthy of further investigation; perhaps there is also a head movement-related eardrum oscillation to facilitate conversion of auditory information into a body-centered reference frame).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More generally, we have demonstrated that multisensory interactions occur at the most peripheral possible point in the auditory system and that this interaction is both systematic and substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation builds on studies showing that attention, either auditory-guided or visually guided, can also modulate the auditory periphery (2127).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also raise the intriguing possibility that efferent pathways in other sensory systems [e.g., those leading to the retina (6373)] also carry multisensory information to help refine peripheral processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study contributes to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that the brain is best viewed as a dynamic system in which top-down signals modulate feed-forward signals; that is, the brain integrates top down information early in sensory processing to make the best-informed decision about the world with which it has to interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human_Subjects_and_Experimental_Paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monkey_Subjects_and_Experimental_Paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All procedures conformed to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  86-23, revised 1985) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monkey subjects (n = 3, all female) underwent aseptic surgical procedures under general anesthesia to implant a head post holder to restrain the head and a scleral search coil (Riverbend Eye Tracking System) to track eye movements (80, 81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After recovery with suitable analgesics and veterinary care, monkeys were trained in the saccade task described above for the human subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two monkeys were tested with both ears in separate sessions, whereas the third monkey was tested with one ear, for a total of n = 5 ears tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trial structure was similar to that used in human dataset I but with the following differences (Fig 2B, red traces): (i) Eye tracking was done with a scleral eye coil; (ii) task-irrelevant sounds were presented on all trials, but only one click was presented at 200270 ms after the saccade to the visual target (the exact time jittered in this range, and was therefore at the same time or slightly later than the timing of the fourth click for human subjects); (iii) the ±24° targets were presented in an equal proportion to the other target locations but were similarly excluded from analysis as above, and there were additional targets at ±9° that were also discarded as they were not used with the human subjects; (iv) initial fixation was 110160 ms (jittered time range), while target fixation duration was 310430 ms; (v) monkeys received a fluid reward for correct trial performance; (vi) disposable plastic ear buds containing the earphone/microphone assembly as above were placed in the ear canal for each session; (vii) auditory recording levels were set at the beginning of each data collection session (the ear bud was not removed during a session, and therefore no recalibration occurred within a session); (viii) sessions were not divided into blocks (the monkeys typically performed consistently throughout an entire session and dividing it into blocks was unnecessary); and (ix) the number of trials per session was different for monkeys vs. humans (which were always presented exactly 1,200 trials over the course of the entire study), and the actual number of trials performed varied based on monkeys performance tolerance and capabilities for the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monkeys MNN012 and MYY002 were both run for four sessions per ear (no more than one session per day) over the course of 2 wk; MNN012 correctly performed an average of 889 of 957 trials at included target locations per session for both ears, while MYY002 correctly performed 582 of 918 trials per session on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monkey MHH003 was only recorded for 1 d and yielded 132 correct out of 463 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this much lower performance, visual inspection of the data suggested they were consistent with other subject data and were therefore included for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth highlighting that the effect reported in this study can be seen, in this case, with comparatively few trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_Sessions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify that the apparent effects of eye movements on ear-generated sounds were genuinely acoustic in nature and did not reflect electrical contamination from sources such as myogenic potentials of the extraocular muscles or the changing orientation of the electrical dipole of the eyeball, we ran a series of additional control studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some subjects (n = 4 for plugged microphone control, n = 1 for syringe control) were invited back as participants in these control studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first control experiment, the microphone was placed in the ear canal and subjects performed the task but the microphones input port was physically plugged, preventing it from detecting acoustic signals (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accomplished by placing the microphone in a custom ear mold in which the canal-side opening for the microphone was blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the microphone was in the same physical position during these sessions, and should therefore have continued to be affected by any electrical artifacts that might be present, but its acoustic input was greatly attenuated by the plug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four subject ears were retested in this paradigm in a separate pair of data collection sessions from their initial normal sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control sessions were handled exactly as the normal sessions except that the plugged ear mold was used to replace the regular open ear mold after the microphone was calibrated in the open ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibration was executed exactly as in the normal sessions before plugging the ear mold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second control, trials were run exactly as a normal session except that the microphone was set into a 1-mL syringe [approximately the average volume of the human ear canal (82)] using a plastic ear bud and the syringe was placed on top of the subjects ear behind the pinna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic recordings were taken from within the syringe while a human subject executed the behavioral paradigm exactly as normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sound levels were calibrated to the syringe at the start of each block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
