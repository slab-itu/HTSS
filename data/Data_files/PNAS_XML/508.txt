Experimental and theoretical evidence for bilayer-by-bilayer surface melting of crystalline ice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over 150 years ago, Faraday discovered the presence of a water layer on ice below the bulk melting temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This layer is important for surface chemistry and glacier sliding close to subfreezing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature and thickness of this quasi-liquid layer has remained controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining experimental and simulated surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy, the thickness of this quasi-liquid layer is shown to change in a noncontinuous, stepwise fashion around 257 K. Below this temperature, the first bilayer is already molten; the second bilayer melts at this transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue shift in the vibrational response of the outermost water molecules accompanying the transition reveals a weakening of the hydrogen bond network upon an increase of the water layer thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the surface of water ice, a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) has been extensively reported at temperatures below its bulk melting point at 273 K. Approaching the bulk melting temperature from below, the thickness of the QLL is known to increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate the precise temperature variation of the QLL, and its nature, we investigate the surface melting of hexagonal ice by combining noncontact, surface-specific vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and spectra calculated from molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using SFG, we probe the outermost water layers of distinct single crystalline ice faces at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the basal face, a stepwise, sudden weakening of the hydrogen-bonded structure of the outermost water layers occurs at 257 K. The spectral calculations from the molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental findings; this allows us to interpret our experimental findings in terms of a stepwise change from one to two molten bilayers at the transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 displays the SFG spectra under ssp polarization (s, SFG; s, visible; p, IR) of the basal ice face at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and Methods and Fig S4 for details of the SFG experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intense peak slightly below 3,200 cm1 is observed, which agrees with the previous SFG measurements (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the temperature increases from 235 K to 264 K, the intensity decreases by a factor of 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends are observed for the secondary prism face of ice (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wei et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) reported a similar, albeit much weaker, intensity decrease by a factor of 3 with increasing temperature from 173 K to 272 K. In contrast, a strong temperature dependence has been reported by the Shultz group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They observed an intensity decrease by approximately a factor of 6 in the temperature range from 113 K to 178 K (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the ice SFG intensity with increasing temperature has previously been interpreted as a decrease in the (bulk-allowed) quadrupole contribution (22, 33) and a loss in the tetrahedral hydrogen bond structure leading to a decrease in the intermolecular coupling (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides the intensity variation [I()], Fig 2A also shows an apparent shift of the hydrogen-bonded OH stretch band to higher-frequency () with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the frequency shift as a function of temperature, the numerically determined first moment of the spectral distribution, I()d/I()d, of the hydrogen-bonded OH peak has been plotted in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the first moment of the spectral distribution exhibits not a gradual shift with increasing temperature but rather a steep increase from 3,185 cm1 to 3,210 cm1 around 257 K. A sigmoidal fit gives the transition temperature at 256.9 ± 0.3 K (i.e., 16 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the secondary prism face (c axis oriented perpendicular to plane of incidence), we also observe a decrease in intensity and a shift to higher frequency with increasing temperature (Fig 2B), whereas the observed shift is smaller than that for the basal face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sigmoidal fit results in a transition temperature at 258.6 ± 0.1 K (i.e., 14 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a higher frequency of the OH stretch mode of water indicates a weakening of the hydrogen bonds strengths (26, 27), the sigmoidal shape may be interpreted as an abrupt weakening of the hydrogen bonds in the top layers of the ice sample for both the basal and, although smaller, the secondary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, the spectra between 235 K and 269 K can be very well described by a linear combination of the spectra at 235 and 269 K, where the higher temperature spectrum is blue shifted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative amplitudes of the 235 and 269 K spectra to the spectra at intermediate temperatures inferred from the fits (red curves in Fig 2A) are plotted in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the amplitude of the 235 and 269 K spectral contribution are free parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of the 235 K spectrum decreases linearly with increasing temperature, whereas the contribution of the 269 K spectrum has a stepwise increase from zero to a finite value around 254 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides the hydrogen-bonded OH stretch region, the vibrational response of OH bonds sticking out of the surface, i.e., dangling OHs, also contains potentially important information about the nature of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibrational frequency of this mode is rather high, around 3,700 cm1, as the OH group does not form a hydrogen bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the SFG spectra in the frequency range from 3,630 cm1 to 3,760 cm1 for various temperatures that reveal a moderate, continuous reduction of the free OH intensity with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak amplitude can be obtained by calculating the peak area between 3,630 cm1 and 3,760 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As apparent from the data in Fig 3B, the amplitude of the 3,700 cm1 mode shows only a weak, continuous temperature dependence, indicating that the outermost surface structure does not change dramatically, in agreement with previous results by Shen and coworkers (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary prism face shows the same trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To connect the experimental results to a molecular-level picture, MD simulations were performed using the TIP4P/Ice model, showing the melting point at 272.2 K (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the simulation are given in Materials and Methods and Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 and Fig S6 show the density profiles for different temperatures for the basal and secondary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double peaks for basal face and a single peak for prism face manifest the bilayer structure for the basal face and the single-layer structure for the secondary prism face, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed density profiles resemble those reported in previous works (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 230 K, the density profile for the slab cleaved along the basal plane displays a double peak structure for all bilayers, except the outermost bilayer, indicating that the outermost layer is already disordered at this temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend is also supported by the radial distribution function (RDF), which, for the outer layer, is similar to the water reference, whereas it retains the structure of ice from the second layer inward (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double peak fine structure in the second layer suddenly disappears between 260 K and 270 K. At the same temperature, the RDF for the second layer loses crystalline features and turns liquid-like.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the exchange of water molecules between the layers increases around this temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orange lines in Fig 4 and Fig S7 mark the molten layers based on the absence of the double peak structure in the density profile and the liquid features of the RDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two parameters indicate that the basal plane melts in a bilayer-by-bilayer fashion, in agreement with the findings of Kroes (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density profiles of the slab exposing the secondary prism face show that melting occurs gradually, as the difference between density peaks and valleys in the surface layers decreases progressively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsequently, SFG spectra are calculated to connect the molecular-level changes to the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeling details can be found in Materials and Methods and in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5A shows the calculated ssp polarized SFG intensity spectra of the basal face of ice as a function of temperature in the hydrogen-bonded and the dangling OH regions of the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the simulations, only the first two outer bilayers were taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner bilayers were assumed not to contribute to the SFG signal, because they have inversion symmetry, which can be seen from the orientation of the OH group plotted in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low temperature (Fig 6A), the distribution is symmetric (up and down) for the third bilayer, whereas the first two layers show asymmetry resulting in an SFG signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 230 K, the hydrogen-bonding stretching band has a relatively intense peak in the SFG spectrum near 3,200 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the experiments, with increasing temperature, the peak intensity decreases and the peak maximum appears to shift toward higher frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evident from Fig 5B, a sigmoidal fit through the peak maximum of hydrogen-bonded OH stretch mode as a function of temperature results in an inflection point at 252 ± 1 K (i.e., 21 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temperature is slightly lower than the temperature observed in the density profiles reported in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these simulations were performed using a different force field (see Supporting Information for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in agreement with the experiments, the dangling OH band at about 3,700 cm1 shows a moderate reduction with increasing temperature (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A more detailed look into the orientation of the water molecules provides more details on the molecular origin of the temperature-dependent change in the calculated SFG signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6C shows the two maxima for the probability distributions of up- and down-oriented OH groups of the water molecules of the second bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the probability maximum decreases with increasing temperature as the water becomes more disordered, making the distribution wider and the maximum consequently lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this change is not continuous: between 250 K and 260 K, the slope of the curves in Fig 6C alters, reflecting a larger change of the disorder of the orientation of the water molecules for a given temperature step, apparently caused by melting of the second bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both experimentally measured and calculated spectra show an abrupt blue shift of the spectral response, indicating a weaker hydrogen bond environment, consistent with a transition to a state with more liquid-like character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical results explain the experimentally observed sudden change in the SFG spectra, and thus the interfacial water organization, around 257 K in terms of a transition from one to two molten bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the discreteness of the ice lattice, it is reasonable that the variation of the QLL with increasing temperature occurs in a discrete manner, i.e., in a bilayer-by-bilayer fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patches of molten bilayers in large crystalline samples would be thermodynamically unfavorable, as there would be a penalty from the liquidsolid interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we attribute the observed change to the transition of the QLL thickness from one to two bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such a transition seems to have been observed as well by photoelectron spectroscopy experiments; the inferred thickness seems to suddenly change between 248 K and 258 K but was not investigated in more detail (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Layer by layer melting has been found for other systems (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for crystals with directional bonds, tendencies for layering are pronounced (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for most of these systems, blocked surface melting, i.e., a finite thickness of the QLL up to the bulk melting point, has been observed (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for ice with its tetrahedral H-bonded structure, at low temperature, we observe a sharp transition from one to two layers, i.e., an indication for stepwise melting, whereas, for temperatures close the melting point, a divergent increase of the layer thickness has been reported (10, 1214, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, water seems to be one of the few cases showing stepwise melting at low temperature and diverging melting at higher temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From our experimental SFG data alone, we cannot strictly exclude that the observed transition represents the onset of surface melting, i.e., solid ice below 257 K and a QLL layer with constant or increasing thickness above 257 K, instead of the formation of one QLL layer to two QLL layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, using gracing incidence X-ray diffraction, Dosch and coworkers (13, 16) found onset temperatures of 259.5 K (13.5 °C) for the basal and 260.5 K (12.5 °C) for nonbasal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the transition temperatures are slightly lower in our experiments, we find the same trend, i.e., a lower transition temperature for the basal compared with the prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this alternative interpretation is not only at odds with the simulations presented above, it is also in seeming contradiction of the experimental observation that the response from the dangling OH groups varies modestly and continuously over our temperature window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that the dangling OH groups of solid ice and those of water in the QLL have the same exact vibrational frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, one would expect not only a frequency shift but also an intensity change, as the fast reorientational motion that is possible for the free dangling OH groups (40) in the QLL is expected to significantly affect the vibrational response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous SFG results have witnessed a change in the order parameter of the dangling OH at 200 K, which is a measure of the disorder of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below 200 K, the order parameter is constant, whereas, above 200 K, the order parameter decreases with increasing temperature (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The picture that thus emerges is that the first bilayer melts at temperatures as low as 200 K, and that surface melting proceeds from 257 K onward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our results indicate that a single additional bilayer melts at this temperature, we cannot exclude a continuously increasing thickness of the QLL above this temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spectral changes associated with the transition provide information about the change in the local environment of the water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the spectral response at 235 K and that at 269 K, the former has a strong contribution from ice and likely a (small) contribution from the very thin QLL present already at 235 K. The high temperature spectrum has a larger contribution of the QLL, as this spectrum originates from a state with at least two molten bilayers, and contains a smaller contribution from the ice, as the ice signal decreases in amplitude with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the temperature-dependent spectra reveals that the contribution of the 235 K spectrum goes down with increasing temperature as the tetrahedral hydrogen bond structure in ice gets more disordered with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the number of water layers abruptly increases at 257 K, so does the central frequency of the spectral response (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift to higher frequency of the 269 K spectrum compared with the 235 K spectrum indicates a weakening of the hydrogen bonds for the QLL layer compared with ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the free OH groups, the small gradual decrease observed in both the experimental and the calculated SFG spectra could indicate a small decrease in ordered free OH groups with increasing temperature and/or an increased rotational mobility of these groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stepwise change in the SFG spectrum observed for the basal face is also observed for the secondary prism face, albeit with a smaller, less pronounced frequency change in the experimental spectra (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the transition in the contribution of the 269 K spectrum after fitting the data with a linear combination of the spectra at low and high temperatures is less pronounced (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for the smaller step may be that, for the secondary prism face, single layers of ice melt, as the layerlayer interaction does not give rise to bilayer behavior for this crystal cut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it is clear that as the temperature increases the SFG response shifts to higher frequency, a key question is about the nature of the QLL: Is it spectroscopically discernible from liquid water?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we compare, in Fig 7, the normalized SFG spectra from supercooled water and ice, both recorded at 269 K. The supercooled water spectrum looks similar to water spectra above zero degrees, indicating little difference between the surfaces of supercooled water and water at ambient temperatures, in contrast to bulk measurements for more strongly supercooled water (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the ice surface at 269 K, we expect to probe both the iceQLL and QLLwater interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response differs substantially from that of the supercooled waterair interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two spectra look very similar around 3,200 cm1 (the small difference at low frequency can at least in part be attributed to a higher relative contribution of NR signal at 269 K than at 243 K), but, between 3,300 cm1 and 3,500 cm1, the relative intensity in the ice spectrum is much lower than that of the supercooled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice spectrum at 269 K resembles more the ice spectrum at 243 K than the supercooled water spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison could suggest that, at 269 K, the iceQLL interface still significantly contributes to the observed SFG spectrum and/or that the QLL has a different nature than supercooled water in the sense that it has stronger hydrogen bonds, possibly due to templating from the underlying crystalline ice order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Fig S8 shows only a slight increased ordering, i.e., tetrahedrality, for the outmost layer of ice compared with liquid water (280 K in Fig S8) in the MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both in SFG experiments and in MD simulations, a stepwise apparent blueshift in the spectra of the iceair interface around 257 K has been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature that indicates weakening of the hydrogen bonds marks the transition to a state in which the surface layers entail a more liquid character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively small temperature variation of the dangling OH in the temperature range from 235 K to 273 K suggests that the outermost layer is not changing its nature over this temperature range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that, already at 235 K, a QLL is present on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This quasi-liquid water layer suddenly increases its thickness around 257 K in a discrete bilayer-by-bilayer manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the SFG response of ice at 270 K with that of supercooled water at the same temperature indicates that the QLL is more similar to ice than to supercooled liquid water: The QLL seems to have stronger hydrogen bonds than liquid water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information is crucial for understanding both the surface chemistry on ice under near-freezing conditions (4244) and the melting mechanism of the ice surface, which has important geophysical implications on the macroscopic scale of our planet, such as for glacier sliding (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in more detail in Supporting Information, single crystalline ice Ih was grown by seed extraction from a melt (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single crystalline seed is used as the starting point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallinity of the sample was checked with a Rigsby stage (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, a sample with the desired surface face (i.e., basal or secondary prism) was cut with a band saw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the sample was confirmed using Formvar etching (47) (2% m/v) and X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before SFG measurements, oriented samples were mounted in a homemade stainless steel sample holder and flattened with a modified microtome (using disposable diamond-coated blades; C.L Sturkey, Inc.) and a clean oxidized silicon wafer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the ice sample was annealed for at least 24 h in the closed sample holder at 253 K. All of the components that were in contact with ice (i.e., band saw blade and sample cell) were cleaned with acetone and ethanol and rinsed with deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, silicon wafers were heated at 500 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The secondary prism ice samples were oriented with the c axis perpendicular to the plane formed by the incident laser light and the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SFG_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace; Spectra-Physics) generates laser pulses (5 mJ at 1 kHz) centered at 800 nm with a pulse duration of 40 fs; 1 mJ of the laser output is used to pump a commercial optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C; Spectra-Physics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal and idler output were difference-frequency mixed in a silver gallium disulfide (AgGaS2) crystal to generate IR pulses around 3,000 cm1 and 3,600 cm1 (FMWH 250 cm1) with pulse energies at the sample of 3 J and 1.5 J, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visible probe pulse (20 J, FWHM 20 cm1) was obtained by frequency narrowing 1 mJ of the laser output in an etalon (SLS Optics Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident angles of the IR and visible beams were 40° and 51°, respectively, with respect to the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ice spectra were collected under ssp polarization and normalized to a nonresonant signal from a gold-coated (100 nm) silicon wafer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 380-m-thick gold-coated silicon wafer (0.25 cm2) was placed on top of the ice surface outside the ice area probed with SFG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SFG experiments, the infrared laser pulse is resonant with the molecular vibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid surface melting during experiments in the hydrogen-bonded region, the repetition rate of the infrared was reduced to 250 Hz and the sample was moved with a pivot crank mechanism at a speed of 2.8 cm/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, every laser shot was at a new position; after 3 s, the laser returned back to the same position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical acquisition times are around 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supercooled water and ice spectra at 269 K in Fig 7 are acquired for 60 min and 140 min, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the cleanliness of the ice alters the premelting QLL thickness (48), we carefully checked that the ice surface is free from organic impurities by measuring the CH stretch SFG signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No detectable CH contamination was present, as shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reproducibility of the spectra between different samples manifests that the surface was also free from nonorganic contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MD simulations were performed to compute the density profiles, RDFs, and tetrahedral order parameter of ice surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether different MD setups affect the density profiles of ice, we performed two MD simulations with different cell size and different number of water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TIP4P/Ice model (36) was used for water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the MD simulations are given in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained 40-ns MD trajectories were used to compute density profiles, radial distributions function, and tetrahedral order parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsequently, we computed SFG spectra of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the OH stretch vibrational mode cannot be described by the fixed-body water model and the dipole moment of water cannot be described accurately with a nonpolarizable model, the fixed-body and nonpolarizable TIP4P/Ice water model is not applicable to the SFG spectra calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we used the polarizable and flexible-body charge response kernel (CRK) water model (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation details can be found in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained total 1-ns MD trajectory with the CRK water model were used to compute the SFG spectra of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_SFG_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ssp polarized SFG intensity, ISFG(), is given by the square of the xxz component of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility xxz(2)(), where the xy plane is parallel to the surface and the z axis forms the normal to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (2)() is composed of a vibrationally resonant part (2),R() and a nonresonant part (2),NR(2)()=(2),R()+(2),NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The xxz(2),R() can be accessed by calculating the time correlation function of the z component of the dipole moment (Mz) and the xx component of the polarizability (Axx) as (50)xxzR(IR)=iIRkBT0cdtexp(iIRt)Axx(t)Mz(0),[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where IR is the IR frequency, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature; c was set to 1.2 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polarizability and dipole moment were calculated with the local field correction using the CRK model (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To suppress the noise of the time correlation function, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, due to the limited length of the MD trajectories, we used the damping treatment on the distant intermolecular correlation (51), with a cutoff distance of 5.6 Å OO distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be consistent with experimental data, (2),NR = 0.15 was used for constructing the ISFG() spectra in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growth_of_Single_Crystalline_Ice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The single crystal ice boule growth method is based on withdrawing a single crystalline seed from a liquid water melt (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single crystal seed is frozen onto a copper pin, kept at 248 K, which is attached to a Peltier element with liquid back-cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As soon as the seed and the copper pin are well connected, the surface of the seed is melted with a heat gun, and formed water drops are blown away with N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the surface of the seed still being liquid, the copper pin with the seed is quickly lowered to make contact between the seed and a constantly stirred melt, kept at 272.85 K, and allowed to grow in the melt for half an hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After confirming that the seed is growing in the melt, the seed is slowly raised at 5 mm/h to allow the boule to grow in diameter and in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produces a 30-mm-long cylindrical single crystalline boule with 60- to 90-mm diameter in 6 h to 7 h (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial seed was obtained from a modified Bridgman method (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it could, for example, be obtained from a free-growing ice dendrite (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single crystallinity of the boule was confirmed on a Rigsby stage between two crossed polarizers (46) (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices of these single crystalline boules were used as seeds for the subsequent production of single crystalline ice boules, or as samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those slices were cut from the boule with a band saw, at specific roll and azimuth angles, to orient the c-axis perpendicular to the cross-section of the slice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutting angles were obtained from the geometrical analysis of the pits generated from Formvar etching, where the shape of the etch pit represents the orientation of the c axis in the slide (47, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 shows images after formvar etching of the basal, primary, and secondary prism plane, which has been confirmed with X-ray diffraction (see X-Ray Characterization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ice_Sample_Cell  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the SFG measurements, a copper plate was cooled down to 223 K with a Peltier element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat generated by the Peltier was transferred into a water/polyglycol mixture cycling through an open bath chiller set at 255 K. After reaching the desired temperature, the sample was kept for at least 30 min before starting a measurement to achieve thermal equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice was mounted in a stainless steel cell, which was closed with a CaF2 window (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice samples were frozen in the cell before microtoming; then the samples were further flattened with a silicon wafer; thirdly, the gold reference was placed on top of the ice; and, finally, the cell was closed with a CaF2 window and annealed for one night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small piece (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.03 cm) of gold-coated silicon wafer was used as reference in the SFG experiments to determine the frequency dependence of the IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell was constantly moved in a circular motion on the copper plate by a motorized pivot crank mechanism at a speed of 30 mm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

X-Ray_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure and orientation of single crystal ice samples were studied by X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-rays from a Cu K (wavelength 1.54 Å) rotating anode source (Rigaku MicroMax 007 X-ray generator) with curved multilayer optics (Osmic Confocal Max-Flux) are collimated by a set of two four-jaw apertures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were conducted on a self-constructed six-circle diffractometer using the standard angle convention (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice crystals were mounted inside a sealed sample cell on a copper disk, cooled to 253 K. Full access to the sample surface by the incident and scattered X-ray beam is provided by a transparent Kapton dome (foil thickness 25 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-rays are detected at a sample-detector distance of 57 cm by a microstrip solid-state detector (Dectris Mythen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the surface orientation of ice samples, previously oriented by the Formvar etch technique (Fig S2), the positions of multiple Bragg reflections were recorded (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widths of the measured rocking curves are limited by the instrumental resolution (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miscuts and crystal orientations determined by X-ray diffraction with respect to the alignment using the Formvar etch technique are summarized in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Additional_SFG_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ice melts due to the absorption of the infrared probe light when probed in the hydrogen-bonded region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dramatic decrease of the signal intensity is observed when the sample is not moving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid melting, the sample was moved and, for the bonded OH region, the repetition rate of the infrared pulse was reduced to 250 Hz so that every laser shot appears on a fresh spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the absorption is less at higher frequency, a repetition rate of 1 kHz could be used for the SFG measurement in the free OH stretch frequency range (3,700 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S4 shows that, following this procedure, the SFG spectrum at 235 K in the hydrogen-bonded range is stable over at least 6 h: The spectrum after 6 h of continuous irradiation is identical to the initial spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a repetition rate of 250 Hz and 164 Hz gave identical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of the signal shown in Fig S4 proves that the sample is not damaged by the laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the spectra in Fig S4 show no CH stretch vibration; the CH stretch modes of hydrocarbon contamination are normally observed in the frequency range of 2,800 cm1 less_than  less_than 3,000 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a signal in this frequency range indicates that the sample has no contamination or contamination that is less than the detection limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S5A depicts SFG spectra of the secondary prism face as a function of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity decreases as the temperature increases, as was observed for the basal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral first moment presents a more gradual shift to higher frequencies at 257 K in comparison with the basal plane (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, after fitting the data with a linear combination of the spectrum at 235 K and the one at 269 K, the contribution of the 235 K spectrum linearly decreases by increasing temperature, whereas the contribution from the 269 K spectrum may increase around 257 K (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MD_Simulation_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effects of the different MD approaches on the ice density profile, we performed two independent MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methodology of the MD simulation for the ice surface was essentially the same as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MD simulation 1, a slab of proton-disordered ice Ih consisting of 1,120 H2O molecules was prepared with the Monte Carlo method (55) in a rectangular simulation box of 31.44 Å × 31.11 Å × 40 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice forms a slab of 34 Å thickness, with two basal face surfaces normal to the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For equilibrating the systems generated by the Monte Carlo simulation, first simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) were carried out using the TIP4P/Ice model (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The periodic boundary condition was used for the x, y, and z directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Ewald summation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the NPT equilibration process, semiisotropic pressure coupling to control the pressure in the xy and z directions separately at P = 1 atm was employed using the ParrinelloRahman barostat (56), and the temperature was controlled with the NosèHoover thermostat (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target temperatures were set to 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, and 280 K. After the NPT equilibration for 1 ns, we elongated the z length of the cell to 150 Å and carried out further equilibration in the canonical ensemble (NVT) for 10 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These equilibrations were conducted with GROMACS package (version 4.6.1) (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of simulation 1, the equation of motion has been integrated with a time step of t = 2 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulation_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second set of MD simulations, a slab of proton-disordered ice Ih consisting of 1,536 TIP4P/Ice H2O molecules was prepared following the same procedure outlined in MD Simulation 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial sizes of the periodic simulation box were 36 Å × 23.38 Å × 58.56 Å for the basal plane and 54 Å × 31.1769 Å × 29.28 Å for the secondary prism plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To take into account thermal expansion, we performed simulations of bulk ice in the NPT ensemble at each target temperature, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, and 272 K, at a pressure of 1 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then generated a slab for each sample equilibrated in the NPT ensemble by introducing a vacuum layer of 2 nm, and we ran 10-ns equilibration in the NVT ensemble, in which the temperature was controlled by stochastic velocity rescaling (60) with a coupling constant of 2 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence we performed 40-ns-long production runs, also in the NVT ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In these MD simulations, the equations of motion were integrated with a time step t = 1 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using smooth particle mesh Ewald summation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation has been conducted with DL_POLY software (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained nearly identical results as for the density profiles and the tetrahedrality parameters of ice for MD simulations 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulation_for_SFG_Spectra_Calculation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequentially, we computed the SFG spectra of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For computing SFG spectra we used the polarizable and flexible-body CRK water model (49) instead of the TIP4P/ice model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is a fixed-body and nonpolarizable water model, and not suitable for the SFG calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CRK model has been frequently used for computing the OH stretch SFG spectra, which show good agreement with the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from 16 different molecular configurations of ice generated with the TIP4P/Ice model (MD simulation 1), we ran 1-ps NVT MD simulation with the CRK water model for each configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equation of motion was integrated with a time step of t = 0.61 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control the system temperature, we used the Berendsen thermostat (62) with coupling constant of 0.4 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequentially, 60 ps NVE runs were performed for each of the 16 configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure generated a total 960 ps MD trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average temperatures over the total 960 ps NVE MD trajectory were 230.25, 240.17, 250.19, 260.61, and 270.49 K. This 960 ps MD trajectory was used for computing the time correlation functions of the dipole moment and polarizability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CRK_vs_Quantum_Mechanics_Molecular_Mechanics_Approach_for_Computing_SFG_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present simulation of SFG spectra was carried out with the classical CRK model of water, whereas our previous work on ice surface used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculation of dipole and polarizability (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we discuss here the differences between the calculation methods and the performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical model was used to lower the computational cost, but, arguably, the present simulation is adequate enough to prove the relation between the surface premelting and the peak shift of the SFG signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The principal advantage of using the QM/MM calculation is to reproduce the remarkably strong SFG signal of ice surface in the hydrogen-bonding region (3,200 cm1) in comparison with the dangling OH (3,700 cm1); this is because the hydrogen-bonded OH vibrations are strongly influenced by the charge transfer, which is not fully described by the classical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the previous works with the QM/MM calculation also used classical polarizable simulation to generate MD trajectories, and thus the structure of the ice surface was essentially equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference only lies in the evaluation method of dipole and polarizability in the nonlinear susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface premelting of ice is captured by the present simulation as well, as discussed in Tetrahedrality Parameter q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such apparent structural change is reflected in the calculated SFG spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tetrahedrality_Parameter_q  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The surface premelting is further demonstrated by introducing the average tetrahedrality q, an index of lattice disorder, where q=1 stands for complete tetrahedral order, and q=0 indicates a random structure (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8 shows the order parameter q calculated with the CRK model with varying depth (bilayer number) and temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure shows that the interior of ice (e.g., B5 layer) at 230 K has an ordered structure with q0.96, whereas the q value decreases near the surface, indicating the surface disorder of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing temperature, the q value quickly decreases at about 270 K to 280 K, implying the surface melting of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural transition is signified in the peak shift of the calculated SFG spectra in Fig 5B, as the SFG is sensitive to a few bilayers of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally we would like to note that these data were generated based on the layer-by-layer definition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can be also plotted based on the recently proposed coarse-graining instantaneous liquid interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Density_Profiles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Density profiles (Fig S6) were computed by averaging over a 40 ns trajectory of systems containing 1,536 molecules (MD Simulation 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiles are taken by moving perpendicularly to the slab surfaces, namely along the [0001] direction for the basal plane and the [1¯21¯0] direction for the secondary prism plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point of the profile is obtained by convoluting the instantaneous atomic positions with a normalized triangular weighting function with width 0.105 nm, for snapshots taken every 10 ps from the trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars represent the SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The double peak in the density profiles of the basal plane slab (Fig S6A) is a fingerprint of crystalline ice bilayers: Disappearance of the double peak indicates that a bilayer is disordered and possibly molten.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that, in the simulations below 270 K, the outermost bilayers do not exhibit the double peak, whereas, at 270 K and above, the first and the second outermost bilayers lose this feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the minimum separating the first and second bilayer rises, indicating an increased exchange of molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transition occurs sharply between 260 K and 270 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second prism slab is made of equidistant single layers (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monolayer structure is also visible in the density profiles in Fig S6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice melting transition is less sharp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The envelope of the density profiles evolves smoothly from a rectangular shape to an ellipsoidal one, with a gradual decrease of the distance between peaks and valleys from the outer layers inward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RDFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the RDF of each bilayer slab to those of the reference systems bulk ice and bulk water provides compelling evidence of the sharp melting transition occurring between 260 K and 270 K in the MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute the RDF of the reference systems, we performed MD simulations in the NPT ensemble at the target temperatures of 230 K to 272 K for a liquid water model consisting of 480 molecules and an ice Ih model consisting of 1,536 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations, we follow the same protocol described in MD Simulation 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S7 shows three RDFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S7A, the temperature dependence of the RDFs for the reference systems is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the characteristic differences between the RDFs for the ice Ih and for the liquid are shown, to be compared with the RDFs shown in Fig S7 B and C. The RDFs are shown resolved by bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the RDFs are obtained in three steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first step based on the density profiles in Fig S6A, parameters for distinguishing the first and the second bilayers are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are then used to create different RDFs resolved in bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a last step, the RDFs for the bilayers slices are scaled to the bulk according to(r)=lsz{112rz,rz12rz,r greater than z,where z is the width of the bilayer slice, ls is the full length of the simulation box in the [0001] direction, and the RDFs are scaled by division through (r) (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RDFs of the first bilayer (Fig S7B) of the basal plane show liquid-like behavior (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, the RDFs of the second bilayer exhibit a rather sharp transition between 260 K and 270 K from an ice-like to a liquid-like RDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
