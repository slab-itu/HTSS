Ancient drug curcumin impedes 26S proteasome activity by direct inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Curcumin is an ancient drug derived from turmeric and has been found to exhibit potent anticancer properties albeit through controversial mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a biochemical model, mouse cancer model, and cellular models, we show that curcumin is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), a positive regulator of the 26S proteasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin perturbs 26S proteasome activity via DYRK2 inhibition in various cancer cells and in the mouse cancer model leading to impairment of cell proliferation and reduction of cancer burden in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel mechanism of action of curcumin opens up new avenues for potential preventative or therapeutic strategies in proteasome-addicted cancers like triple-negative breast cancer and multiple myeloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Curcumin, the active ingredient in Curcuma longa, has been in medicinal use since ancient times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the therapeutic targets and signaling cascades modulated by curcumin have been enigmatic despite extensive research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), a positive regulator of the 26S proteasome, as a direct target of curcumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin occupies the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 in the cocrystal structure, and it potently and specifically inhibits DYRK2 over 139 other kinases tested in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, curcumin diminishes DYRK2-mediated 26S proteasome phosphorylation in cells, leading to reduced proteasome activity and impaired cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, curcumin synergizes with the therapeutic proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib to induce apoptosis in a variety of proteasome-addicted cancer cells, while this drug combination exhibits modest to no cytotoxicity to noncancerous cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a breast cancer xenograft model, curcumin treatment significantly reduces tumor burden in immunocompromised mice, showing a similar antitumor effect as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DYRK2 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal an unexpected role of curcumin in DYRK2-proteasome inhibition and provide a proof-of-concept that pharmacological manipulation of proteasome regulators may offer new opportunities for anticancer treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Curcumin_Is_a_Potent_and_Selective_Inhibitor_of_DYRK2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of curcumin is shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin inhibits DYRK2 with an IC50 of 5 nM (Fig 1B) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether curcumin could suppress cellular DYRK2 activity, we treated HEK293T cells with stable DYRK2-FLAG overexpressing with increasing concentrations of curcumin and assessed curcumin-mediated changes of RPT3 phosphorylation at Thr25, the major site of DYRK2 phosphorylation on the proteasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that curcumin treatment suppressed pT25 RPT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed at inhibitor concentrations of 310 M (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the specificity of curcumin, we also examined the activity of 140 protein kinases, including CMGC kinase family members that are closely related to DYRKs (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin targeted DYRK2 specifically; curcumin treatment was found to also inhibit DYRK1A, DYRK3, PIM, MLK, and PHK kinases albeit to a lesser extent compared with DYRK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin had off-target effects on DYRK1A with an IC50 of 190 nM (Fig 1E) and on DYRK3 with an IC50 of 20 nM (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to previous literature, curcumin did not exhibit potent inhibition of purified IKK (IC50  10 M) (Fig 1G) or purified GSK3 (IC50  3 M) (Fig 1H) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal that curcumin is a highly potent inhibitor of DYRK2 with off-target effects on related DYRK isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_of_DYRK2_in_Complex_with_Curcumin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate how curcumin specifically inhibits DYRK2, we crystallized DYRK2 in the presence of curcumin and determined the structure at 2.5 Å (SI Appendix, Table S2) [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code: 5ZTN].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong electron densities are present for curcumin, allowing confident interpretation of its position (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin occupies the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl groups of curcumin forms hydrogen bonds with the Lys251 (the ion pair Lys), Glu266 (the ion pair Glu), and Asp368 (the DFG Asp) of DYRK2 that anchors curcumin deep within the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ile228, Ala249, Ile285, Phe301, Leu303, Leu355, and Ile367 are involved in making hydrophobic interactions with curcumin (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cocrystal structure of DYRK2-curcumin clearly reveals that curcumin imparts its inhibitory effect on DYRK2 by directly binding to the DYRK2 ATP-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Curcumin_Inhibits_26S_Proteasome_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reasoned that curcumin, by inhibiting DYRK2, may reduce proteasome activity in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, curcumin treatment of MDA-MB-231 and HaCaT cells caused a 2540% decrease of proteasome activity toward the fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC without altering proteasome abundance as indicated by Western blotting (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the same degree of proteasome inhibition was observed with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DYRK2 knockout (37), and yet the DYRK2-null MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3A) or HaCaT (Fig 3B) cells showed no further decrease of proteasome activity with curcumin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly support that curcumin down-regulates proteasome activity via DYRK2 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in 293T cells, curcumin treatment reduced all three types of proteasome peptidase activities (Fig 3C) and also stabilized UBL-YFP-PEST (37), a short-lived reporter protein that undergoes rapid ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkable accumulation and stabilization of two other well-established proteasome substrates, p21Cip1 and IB, was also evident in curcumin-treated cells compared with control (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of curcumin on proteasome activity was observed across a panel of TNBC and multiple myeloma cell lines (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, cotreatment of the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line with curcumin and carfilzomib resulted in a much stronger proteasome inhibition than either compound alone (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that the antiproteasome activity of curcumin, due to DYRK2 inhibition, is similar in different cancer cell types and exhibits synergistic inhibition with carfilzomib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Curcumin_Impedes_Cell_Proliferation_and_Invasion_and_Induces_Apoptosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we wanted to determine if curcumincarfilzomib-mediated synergistic impairment of proteasome activity could have an effect on cancer cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a marked synergistic cytotoxicity was observed across four different multiple myeloma cell lines with a combination index (CI) of less_than1 (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, noncancerous myeloid cell AHH1 exhibited modest cytotoxicity toward the combination (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar data were observed in four different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines with a curcumin-carfilzomib CI less_than1 for cytotoxicity in all cancer cells with modest to no effect in noncancerous mammary cell line MCF10A (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used bortezomib-resistant cell lines that were generated by adaptation to continuous proteasome inhibition (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPMI8226.BR and MM.1S.BR cells were treated with 10 M curcumin in parallel with their bortezomib-sensitive WT counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPMI8226.BR and MM.1S.BR cells exhibited comparable cytotoxicity to 10 M of curcumin although these cells were 20- to 100-fold more resistant to bortezomib than their respective bortezomib-sensitive cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with curcumin induced apoptotic cell death with a significant increase in caspase3/7 activity in multiple myeloma cell lysates (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DYRK2-mediated pT25-RPT3 phosphorylation is essential for proteasomal degradation of cell-cycle regulators and timely progression of S-phase (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin treatment clearly perturbs cell proliferation that is consistent with DYRK2 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-MB-231 and 5TGM1-GFP cells treated with curcumin exhibited a markedly slower rate of cell proliferation compared with DMSO-treated controls (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, curcumin treatment of MDA-MB-231 DYRK2 KO cells did not exhibit a further decrease in cell proliferation (Fig 4E), suggesting that the curcumin-mediated impediment of cell proliferation is directly linked to DYRK2 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, curcumin treatment largely blocked the ability of TNBC cells to migrate in transwell chemotaxis and 3D matrigel invasion assays (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support that curcumin-mediated DYRK2-proteasome activity impairment has a direct effect on cytotoxicity, proliferation, and invasion of proteasome-dependent TNBC and multiple myeloma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously shown that curcumin shows synergism with proteasome inhibitors resulting in cytotoxicity in cancer cells (38); however, our data clearly indicate that curcumin-mediated cytotoxicity is predominantly rendered by curcumin-mediated inhibition of DYRK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Curcumin_Reduces_Tumor_Burden_at_a_Rate_Consistent_with_DYRK2_Inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-MB-231 is a basal-like TNBC cell line shown to be resistant to proteasome inhibition-mediated cytotoxicity (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results on cell viability and biochemistry made us wonder whether curcumin could inhibit the tumorigenic growth of these cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was documented previously that curcumin reduces tumor burden in various cancer models at 200 mg/kg1 gm/kg body weight (1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported that tumors derived from DYRK2 KO cells grow at a significantly lower rate than those formed by the parental cells (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the effect of curcumin on tumor growth to DYRK2-depleted tumor growth, parental and DYRK2 KO MDA-MB-231 cells were injected s.c. into NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunocompromised mice to induce tumor formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental MDA-MB-231 bearing mice with palpable tumors were randomized into two groups of n = 5 each, and vehicle control or 300 mg/kg curcumin was injected intraperitoneally every alternate day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, curcumin treatment significantly reduced tumor burden after 2 wk of treatment (Fig 5A), and curcumin-treated tumor weights (Fig 5B) were comparable with tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 DYRK2 KO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological examination of the xenograft tumors also showed greatly attenuated Ki-67 staining (a cellular marker for proliferation) in both curcumin-treated and DYRK2 KO tumors (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the total proteasome activity in curcumin-treated tumor lysates were significantly reduced compared with vehicle-treated tumor lysates (Fig 5D), thus suggesting the direct contribution of DYRK2 inhibition in tumor regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly support the role of curcumin-mediated inhibition of the DYRK2proteasome axis in regulating cell proliferation in vivo and suggest that targeting proteasome regulators (such as DYRK2) in combination with proteasome inhibitors may be a promising approach of anticancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This current study is a comprehensive report of a major mechanism of action of curcumin in alleviating proteasome-addicted tumor burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that curcumin potently binds and inhibits DYRK2 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2), resulting in reduced 26S proteasome activity, (Fig 3) which leads to impaired cell proliferation with induction of apoptotic cell death, and (Fig 4) culminating in reduced tumor growth (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also report a comprehensive kinase specificity profile of curcumin (Fig 1D and SI Appendix, Table S1), which clearly shows that curcumin is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of DYRK2 with a 10-fold higher potency for DYRK2 compared with other DYRK isoforms (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher concentrations of ATP had a modest effect on the IC50 of curcumin for DYRK2 (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that binding of curcumin to DYRK2 is potentially irreversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past three decades many groups have reported that curcumin exhibits therapeutic efficacy in mouse models for various cancers (1215) and have shown curcumin to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity via either IKK inhibition and down-regulation of NFB (8, 9) or inhibition of GSK3 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our research, curcumin exhibited an in vitro IC50 of 10 M for IKK (Fig 1G) and 3 M for GSK3, which consequently requires 30-M concentrations of curcumin in cells to see activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the down-regulation of NFB observed by the various groups is brought about by the accumulation of IB in cells due to impairment of the proteasome activity by curcumin (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DYRK isoforms have been known to play a general role in priming phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates (39), which is possibly why other researchers have observed changes in GSK3 substrate phosphorylation upon curcumin treatment (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various other kinases have been reported as potential targets of curcumin; however, in the absence of proper biochemical kinetics, kinase specificity, or target engagement analyses, the credibility of the reports is dramatically reduced (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1D shows that 1 M of curcumin has modest to no effect on JNK isoforms, HER isoforms, and VEGFR kinases, which were previously reported to be potential targets (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, curcumin does not inhibit 139 other kinases tested in vitro to the same extent as DYRK2 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, curcumin inhibits DYRK2 in cells at 110 M (Fig 1C), which is much lower than 30100 M as reported previously for other targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been convincingly shown that using curcumin at 20 M leads to aggregation and rapid degradation of curcumin in standard cell culture and biochemical assay conditions (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clear all doubts regarding the mechanism of target engagement, we solved the cocrystal structure of DYRK2 with curcumin bound at 2.5 Å (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Table S2) (PDB ID code: 5ZTN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cocrystal structure of curcumin with a kinase target reveals that curcumin binds the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain the selectivity of curcumin for DYRK2, we identified that the essential curcumin-interacting residues in DYRK2, Ile285 and Ile367, are replaced by valines in DYRK1A and DYRK1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that this Ile-Val replacement would result in a slightly larger pocket in the DYRK1s and reduce the shape complementarity to curcumin, explaining the selectivity of curcumin for DYRK2 (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignment with representative members of distant and closely related CMGC protein kinases (SI Appendix, Fig S3) echoes this conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitutions of polar residues, which alter the hydrophobicity of the pocket (e.g., see SI Appendix, Fig S3B, F301:Q), or less bulky hydrophobic residues, which result in a more open pocket (e.g., see SI Appendix, Fig S3A, F301:L), are indicative of the resistance of a given kinase to curcumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitutions of the residues interacting via hydrogen bonding (Lys251, Glu266, and D368) was not observed in these alignments, but their conservation in even highly resistant kinases (e.g., GSK3) suggests that they are not major contributors to curcumin specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to generate a curcumin-resistant mutant of DYRK2 have failed, as the binding of curcumin to DYRK2 was quite strong and most single mutations either did not confer drug resistance or dramatically inhibited the kinase activity of DYRK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that the majority of curcumins specificity toward DYRK2 is garnered by tight hydrophobic interactions made uniquely possible at the DYRK2 ATP-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recently reported that DYRK2 directly phosphorylates the 26S proteasome on the Thr25 of the RPT3 subunit that impedes the 26S proteasome activity (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Thr25 site on RPT3 is thought to enhance substrate translocation into the 20S proteasome core, leading to protein degradation (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various groups have previously reported curcumin-mediated impairment of proteasome in cells (1621); however, the exact mechanism of curcumin activity has not been not reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curcumin treatment inhibits all three peptidase activities of the proteasome by 1030% (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect, however, is not observed in DYRK2-depleted cells (Fig 3B), clearly suggesting that curcumin targets the proteasome via inhibition of DYRK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, curcumin at 10 M had no significant effect in vitro on the activity of affinity-purified proteasome to degrade BODIPY-casein substrate (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of DYRK2 delays the cell cycle by possible accumulation of proteasome substrates in the cell cycle (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with DYRK2 depletion phenotypes, curcumin treatment impedes cell proliferation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4E and 5C) and invasion (Fig 4F) at concentrations less_than10 M and reduces tumor burden on a TNBC mouse xenograft model at 300 mg/kg body weight dose (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accumulation of proteins with short half-lives (UBL-YFP-PEST, IB, p27Kip1, p21Cip1) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3C and 5D) indicates that curcumin treatment leads to a global reduction of proteasome activity and that this activity is synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synergism between curcumin and carfilzomib was observed not only at a biochemical level, but also in apoptotic cell death in TNBC and multiple myeloma cells lines (Fig 4 A, B, and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Allegra et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38) reported a synergism between carfilzomib and curcumin toward induction of cytotoxicity on U266 myeloma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their work, we report that eight different proteasome-adapted cell lines exhibit strong synergistic cytotoxicity upon treatment with carfilzomib and curcumin combination (Fig 4 A and B and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, noncancerous cells did not exhibit the similar levels of cytotoxicity (Fig 4 A and B), thus conveying the fact that cancer cells with acquired proteasome resistance could be selectively targeted by the curcumincarfilzomib combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important point to note is that higher concentrations of curcumin are equally fatal for all cells cancerous or noncancerous (HaCaT and MCF10A) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells did not exhibit any significant resistance to curcumin (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was expected since curcumin inhibits the upstream proteasome regulator DYRK2 and does not dock into the 20S proteasome peptidase active site that is often mutated in these cell lines (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our cell-based data, we saw a major reduction in the cell proliferation marker Ki67 in the sections of the curcumin-treated tumors (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor reduction upon curcumin treatment was observed comparable to the volume and weight of DYRK2-depleted tumors (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, proteasome activity in the curcumin-treated mouse tumors was reduced by 30% along with accumulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, suggesting that curcumin-mediated DYRK2 inhibition successfully perturbed proteasome activity in the mouse xenograft model (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic similarity between curcumin treatment and DYRK2 depletion reinforces our hypothesis that curcumin-mediated effects on cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and tumor development are all a direct consequence of DYRK2 inhibition and impairment of the proteasome activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Curcumin has been one of the most controversial yet extensively studied natural products over the past three decades, having been implicated in a wide range of diseases, often with contradictory results reported by various groups worldwide (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the poor pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of curcumin, there is an unresolved debate on curcumin treatment as a viable therapeutic option (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current work establishes curcumin not only as an excellent research tool for DYRK2 inhibition, but also as a potential therapeutic possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derivatives of curcumin with improved PK/PD could be viable treatment options especially for proteasome-dependent highly refractory TNBC or multiple myeloma in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the vast body of literature on potential targets of curcumin, we do not claim inhibition of the DYRK2proteasome axis as the only possible mechanism of action of curcumin; nevertheless, we have conclusively established that impairment of proteasome activity by DYRK2 inhibition is a major mechanism of action for curcumin in the context of the alleviation of proteasome-dependent neoplastic malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
