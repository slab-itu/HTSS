Cyclic deformation leads to defect healing and strengthening of small-volume metal crystals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Producing strong and defect-free materials is an important objective in developing many new materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal treatments aimed at defect elimination often lead to undesirable levels of strength and other properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although monotonic loading can reduce or even eliminate dislocations in submicroscale single crystals, such mechanical healing causes severe plastic deformation and significant shape changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by observing an easier pullout of a partly buried object after shaking it first, we demonstrate that cyclic healing of the small-volume single crystals can indeed be achieved through repeated low-amplitude straining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cyclic healing method points to versatile avenues for tailoring the defect structure and strengthening of nanoscale metal crystals without the need for thermal annealing or severe plastic deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When microscopic and macroscopic specimens of metals are subjected to cyclic loading, the creation, interaction, and accumulation of defects lead to damage, cracking, and failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that when aluminum single crystals of submicrometer dimensions are subjected to low-amplitude cyclic deformation at room temperature, the density of preexisting dislocation lines and loops can be dramatically reduced with virtually no change of the overall sample geometry and essentially no permanent plastic strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cyclic healing of the metal crystal leads to significant strengthening through dramatic reductions in dislocation density, in distinct contrast to conventional cyclic strain hardening mechanisms arising from increases in dislocation density and interactions among defects in microcrystalline and macrocrystalline metals and alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our real-time, in situ transmission electron microscopy observations of tensile tests reveal that pinned dislocation lines undergo shakedown during cyclic straining, with the extent of dislocation unpinning dependent on the amplitude, sequence, and number of strain cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those unpinned mobile dislocations moving close enough to the free surface of the thin specimens as a result of such repeated straining are then further attracted to the surface by image forces that facilitate their egress from the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results point to a versatile pathway for controlled mechanical annealing and defect engineering in submicrometer-sized metal crystals, thereby obviating the need for thermal annealing or significant plastic deformation that could cause change in shape and/or dimensions of the specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starting Al single crystal (99.999% purity) had a thickness of 200 m and diameter of 3 mm with a less_than110 normal direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was polished mechanically on both sides to a thickness of 50 m. One side was then subjected to twin-jet polishing in a chemical solution of methanol with 5% (vol/vol) perchloric acid to obtain a thin region with a thickness of several micrometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, this sample was glued to a specially designed copper support with its thin region facing out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the thin region, thin plates with dimensions of 500 nm (thickness) × 3 m (width) × 5 m (length) were fabricated by using a FIB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long edge of this thin plate was carefully aligned to be parallel to the loading axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this step, the beam current was gradually decreased from 21 nA to 93 pA while the accelerating voltage of the ion beam was kept at 30 KeV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then T-shaped samples were FIBed into the thin plate through a flexible-designed bitmap pattern and the beam current used for this step was 28 pA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The middle region was thinned to electron transparent with a beam current of 1.5 pA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Tensile_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in situ tensile experiments were carried out inside a JEM 2100 field emission gun TEM (JEOL), using a PicoIndenter (PI95) (Hysitron) under displacement control mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding microstructure evolution was recorded using a Gatan 833 CCD camera (SC200).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Table S1 summarizes the visibility of dislocations with various Burgers vectors when they are observed under dark-field imaging mode with different reflection vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the depletion of the dislocations in the gauge section, we purposely tilted the Al sample shown in Fig 1 to [334] zone axis (ZA) and imaged it under [22¯0] and [313¯] reflection vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S1 A and B, few dislocations can be detected in the gauge part, which confirms that dislocation density was reduced dramatically in the gauge section of the specimen after mechanical healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Origin_of_the_Compressive_Stress_upon_Unloading  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The compressive (or negative) stress observed in our tests (e.g., Fig 3 B and C in the main text) upon unloading can be attributed to a number of factors, as illustrated schematically in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grip was programmed to travel within the region marked by the two red short lines, as shown in Fig S2 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the very beginning, the minimum stress was zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once the sample deformed plastically because of the escaped dislocations and/or the plastic fitting at the contact interface between the sample and the diamond grip, its length increased by L. Because all of the tests were carried out under displacement-control mode, the grip was set to keep its programmed travel range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the zero stress position was shifted by L. Because of the adhesion force between the grip and the sample, a compressive stress would now be generated within the region framed by the right red line position and the new zero stress position (vertical dashed line), as shown in Fig S2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig S3A shows the stressstrain curves from quasistatic athermal loading (QAL) simulations for a perfect Al pillar with an atomically smooth surface and for an Al pillar with a slip step of 1b height on a cylindrical surface by the escape of one dislocation along the {111} plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3A, Inset shows the orientation of the crystal for the loading simulation for these two cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that even a one-Burgers-vector height step can significantly reduce the athermal flow strength, by as much as 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further calculations using the free-end nudged elastic band (FENEB) method evaluated the activation energy of dislocation nucleation as a function of applied stress level, as shown in Fig S3B, which reveals that at the same applied stress, the activation energy for surface dislocation nucleation is decreased significantly (by an order of magnitude) for a pillar with stepped surfaces compared with that with an atomically smooth, perfect surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in Fig S3B imply further significant flow strength reduction, in addition to that shown in Fig S3A, due to thermal energy activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the atomistic computations, the large-scale molecular dynamics package, LAMMPS (24) was used to simulate the response of an Al single-crystal pillar of dimensions 23 × 11 × 11 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axial orientation of the crystal was along [110] and the side surfaces were (001) and (1¯10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The empirical potentials (25) used here, describing the interaction between Al atoms, were developed using a large database of experimental and ab initio data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic physical properties (e.g., lattice constants, elastic constants, energy for vacancy formation and migration, stacking fault energy, equation of state to a large pressure range, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  generated by this potential were found to be in good agreement with experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For QAL, the sample was first stretched by uniformly scaling the axial coordinate of each atom to a small strain and then kept at the current strain, and energy minimization was performed via the conjugate gradient method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loading mode was repeated until the athermal stress level for surface dislocation nucleation was reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FENEB method is a useful reaction pathway sampling technique for stress-driven dislocation nucleation problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) method, first a trial reaction pathway was generated by linearly interpolating the hyperspace coordinate (13) ({xi} is the lattice vector of atom i) of the system between an initial configuration and a final configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Usually, a finite number of intermediate images/replicas of the system were chosen from the trial reaction pathway, forming the so-called band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intermediate images/replicas generally are not exactly on the minimum energy pathway (MEP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a constrained energy minimization procedure was performed to converge the band to the MEP while maintaining equal spacing between neighboring replicas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constraint was applied by first adding an elastic force along the band such that each intermediate replica experienced a pulling/pushing force along the band, depending on their relative distances between the neighboring replicas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial state usually is not subjected to the elastic force (hence the term, elastic band).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to this elastic force constraint, atoms in each replica were subjected only to the potential energy force component perpendicular to the band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This forms the so-called nudged elastic band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall effect is that the potential energy force component perpendicular to the band relaxes the replicas to the MEP while the elastic force along the band maintains an equal spacing between neighboring replicas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the FENEB, a special treatment is applied to the final state; i.e., only elastic force along the band is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the potential energy of the final state will remain constant and it is free to move on an isosurface of the potential energy landscape where the same potential energy is found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is quite useful if the final state is not in a stable/metastable state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason is that it allows us to choose only a segment around the saddle point instead of using the whole band to perform the calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For dislocation nucleation problems, usually the length of band beyond the saddle point is much longer than that before the saddle point, so by the FENEB, we can reduce the overall number of replicas used while maintaining a relatively higher density of replicas around the saddle point, thus significantly increasing the efficiency and accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we use eight replicas for each individual calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energies of the final configurations are at least 0.1 eV lower than those of the initial configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen with a one-Burgers-vector height step was relaxed at 300 K for 100 ps and then cooled down to low temperature for FENEB calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Quickmin algorithm (26), which is a damped dynamics method for minimizing a systems energy, was used to update atomic positions during FENEB calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FENEB calculations were considered to be converged when the force on each replica is below 0.001 eV/Å or the calculation step exceeds a significant large number (100,000 steps) such that the activation energy rarely changes with even more calculation steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
