Synthetic quorum sensing in model microcapsule colonies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many organisms, from bacteria to humans, can sense their local population density and modify their behavior in crowded environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This density-dependent behavior, known as quorum sensing, is a highly desirable attribute for synthetic systems because it permits novel self-recognition and self-regulating functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using theory and simulation, we design chemical-producing microcapsules that display quorum sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the chemical production is regulated by a biomimetic feedback loop, the capsules exhibit tunable transitions between steady (off) and oscillatory (on) states as a function of the number and number density of microcapsules in a colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a system can behave as a mechanoresponsive material, modulating chemical activity when applied stresses alter the spatial configuration of the capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biological quorum sensing refers to the ability of cells to gauge their population density and collectively initiate a new behavior once a critical density is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Designing synthetic materials systems that exhibit quorum sensing-like behavior could enable the fabrication of devices with both self-recognition and self-regulating functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we develop models for a colony of synthetic microcapsules that communicate by producing and releasing signaling molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of the chemicals is regulated by a biomimetic negative feedback loop, the repressilator network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through theory and simulation, we show that the chemical behavior of such capsules is sensitive to both the density and number of capsules in the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, decreasing the spacing between a fixed number of capsules can trigger a transition in chemical activity from the steady, repressed state to large-amplitude oscillations in chemical production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, for a fixed density, an increase in the number of capsules in the colony can also promote a transition into the oscillatory state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration-dependent behavior of the capsule colony exemplifies quorum-sensing behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our theoretical model, we predict the transitions from the steady state to oscillatory behavior as a function of the colony size and capsule density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Discrete_Capsule_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We model the colony of microcapsules as a set of regions in space where the production of chemicals is regulated by the repressilator feedback network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of capsules in the colony is Ncap, and the position of the capsule with index k is Xk, k=1,2,3,...,Ncap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although arbitrary arrangements of the capsules can be studied with this model, we focus on random, uniformly distributed capsules in a circular disk-shaped region of radius Rcol confined between parallel walls with separation h, as illustrated in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each capsule is a 3D sphere of radius Rcap containing enzymes that produce the signaling chemicals (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capsules shell is selectively permeable; it prevents the enzymes from leaving the capsule but allows the reactants and products of the enzymatic reaction to freely diffuse into and out of the shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the reactants are always in excess, the rates of reaction can be taken to be independent of reactant concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we do not explicitly model nor further discuss the reactants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the products that are of interest, because they act as signaling species in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the repressilator (1214) modulating the production of signaling species in the capsule, species j, with concentration denoted by cj, acts as an inhibitor for the production of the next chemical j+1 in the cycle, and, conversely, the production of species j is inhibited by the presence of chemical j1 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The indices referring to chemical species are interpreted modulo 3.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating the enzyme as a uniformly distributed continuum within the capsules, the rates of production per unit volume pjcap depend on the local concentrations cj aspjcap=f(cj1),j=1,2,3,[1]where f is a function describing the effect of the inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in previous theoretical studies of repressilator systems (1214), we model inhibition using the Hill function (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressed in dimensionless form (SI Text for details of nondimensionalization), the Hill function reads f(c)=pmax/(1+cn), where pmax is the maximum production rate per unit volume; for brevity, we also refer to pmax as the production capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, this quantity would depend on the concentration of enzymes in the capsules and the maximum turnover rate for the enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter n, known as the Hill coefficient or cooperativity, characterizes the sharpness of the transition from the unrepressed state (no inhibitor present) to the repressed state (high inhibitor concentration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model assumes identical kinetic parameters pmax and n for the production of all three species within the capsule; the model can, however, be extended to accommodate different production capacities or inhibitor cooperativities for each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to production, each signaling species undergoes first-order degradation and diffuses throughout a laterally (x,y) unbounded domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nondimensionalized reactiondiffusion equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions for the concentration fields are given bytcj(x,t)=2cj(x,t)cj(x,t)+pj(x,t),j=1,2,3,[2]cjz|z=h/2=cjz|z=h/2=0,cj(x,t=0)=cj0(x),[3]where the production terms are pj(x,t)=k=1Ncapf[cj1(x,t)]cap(xXk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capsule indicator function,cap(x)={1,ifx2+y2+z2Rcap,0,otherwise,[4]restricts the production terms to act only within the capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that there is no physical boundary around the colony, so the chemicals produced by the capsules are free to diffuse out of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been argued that bacterial QS is, in fact, based on sensing the rate of diffusion or leakage of the signal away from cells (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confining the colony in an enclosed space would alter the behavior of the system and negate potential influences of colony size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We numerically solve the reactiondiffusion equations using a finite difference method (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are five model parameters: Hill coefficient n, production capacity pmax, capsule number Ncap, capsule size Rcap, and colony size Rcol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical interpretation of dimensionless lengths is discussed in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixing the Hill coefficient to n=3 and the capsule size to Rcap=0.05, we observe qualitatively different behavior, depending on the values of the other parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a large number of capsules (Ncap=400) of production capacity pmax=125 in a large colony of radius Rcol=2, sustained temporal oscillations emerge in the chemical productions and concentrations (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitudes of these oscillations are all comparable, and the three species oscillate out of phase with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conversely, when the colony size is decreased while keeping the same number density of capsules (Ncap=100, Rcol=1), the system exhibits transient oscillations, but the concentration fields and production rates rapidly approach a steady state (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in capsule activity between sustained oscillatory chemical production in large colonies and steady, or quiescent, production in small colonies exemplifies the QS characteristic of our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the production capacity affects the behavior of the system, we increase the maximum production rate per unit volume of the capsules from pmax=125 to pmax=5,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small colony (Ncap=100, Rcol=1) now exhibits sustained oscillations (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with our theoretical understanding of the corresponding well-mixed repressilator system, which is known to exhibit oscillations when pmax exceeds a critical value (dependent on other parameters) (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the number density of capsules should similarly favor oscillations, because chemicals can be produced at a higher rate per unit volume of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, this is not always the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, when we maintain the same number of capsules and production capacity as in the oscillatory case of Fig 2C, but increase the number density by reducing the radius of the colony from Rcol=1 to Rcol=0.75, the capsules no longer sustain oscillations in chemical production and return to the quiescent state (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the capsule density is higher, oscillations cannot be sustained, due to the smaller span of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the colony behavior depends on the combination of colony size and capsule density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For insight into the internal dynamics of the colony, we map the concentration fields and spatial distributions of chemical production at various times over a period of oscillation (Fig 3; also see Movie S1) for the simulation presented in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All capsules oscillate in phase with each other and have similar production rates at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although chemical production only occurs in the discrete capsules, the concentrations vary smoothly throughout the colony, and the discrete nature of the sources is difficult to discern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration field is approximately radially symmetric and is highest at the center of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As indicated by the in-phase oscillations of capsules in the colony, our system behaves as a collection of oscillators that undergo synchronization (1719, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our colony, however, a single capsule in isolation does not exhibit oscillations; oscillations require coupling among many capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, similar phenomena have been reported for synchronized glycolytic oscillations in yeast (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above numerical approach is feasible in a limited range of parameter space, because it is computationally demanding to simulate large, 3D domains with each capsule spatially resolved over time scales that are sufficient to evaluate the long-term behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve a broad, qualitative understanding of the system, we develop a simpler, coarse-grained model of the colony that allows rapid characterization over a large region of parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Continuum_Colony_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reduce the complexity of our colony model, we replace the collection of discrete capsules with a spatially continuous distribution throughout the volume occupied by the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this continuum model, we do not resolve inhomogeneities on the length scale of the capsule radius but rather consider average effects over macroscopic scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplification is valid assuming the capsules are both small and lie close together relative to the diffusion length of the chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (If the capsules were far apart from each other, then they would effectively behave independently because the signaling chemicals would decay before diffusing to neighbors.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The continuum model is described by the same reaction diffusion equations, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, boundary conditions and initial concentrations, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, as the discrete capsule model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuum approximation replaces the sum of discrete production terms with a single term,pj(x,t)=f[cj1(x,t)]col(x),col(x)={Vcapcap,ifx2+y2Rcol0,otherwise,[5]where cap is the number density of capsules and Vcap=4Rcap3/3 is the volume of a capsule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the colony indicator function col describes the local volume fraction of capsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider colonies with uniform distributions of capsules so that cap does not vary with position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further simplify the model by assuming that the production rates per unit volume are spatially uniform throughout the colony at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is motivated by observations of in-phase synchronized oscillations of all capsules in our discrete simulations (Fig 3) and is justified if the inhibitor concentrations are approximately homogeneous throughout the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose to evaluate the homogeneous production rates based on the chemical concentrations at the center of the colony, denoted by Cj(t)=cj(x=0,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production term is pj(x,t)=f[Cj1(t)]col(x), and the (homogenized) maximum production rate per unit volume inside the colony is pcolmax=Vcapcappmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model parameters in this coarse-grained description of the capsule colony are Rcol, pcolmax, and n. The parameters describing single, discrete capsules, Rcap and pmax, can be thought of as fixed while the number of capsules and spacing between capsules are varied to change Rcol and pcolmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first consider the case n=3 and vary Rcol and pcolmax over several orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the method of Greens functions (24) to obtain an expression for the solution in a form amenable to stability analysis (SI Text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unique pair of steady-state concentration and production rate (identical for all three species j=1,2,3 by symmetry) is found for each set of parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase map in Fig 4A shows the respective regions of parameter space with linearly stable and unstable steady states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed numerical solution of the reactiondiffusion equations, relaxing the assumption of uniform chemical production (SI Text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations were consistent with the uniform colony stability analysis; oscillatory behavior emerges when the steady state is linearly unstable, and steady behavior emerges in the linearly stable regime (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison validates our simplification of considering spatially uniform production rates within the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noting that the maximum production rate per unit volume pcolmax is proportional to the number density of capsules in the colony, the phase maps shown in Fig 4 demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the colony is sensitive to colony radius and capsule density, hallmarks of QS in biological organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, small and sparse colonies tend to produce chemicals at low, steady rates, whereas large, dense colonies exhibit high-amplitude oscillatory production of chemicals (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition between these two modes of behavior can be described by approximating the regime boundary with two straight line segments, indicated by dashed lines in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal line denotes a critical value of the production capacity pcolmax=pcritmax, equivalent to a critical capsule density cap=crit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For colonies of sufficiently large radius, the precise value of the radius is not important in determining the behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oscillations emerge when the capsule density exceeds a threshold, capcrit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vertical portion of the transition curve corresponds to a critical colony radius Rcol=Rcrit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit of dense colonies (high pcolmax or cap), the transition from steady to oscillatory behavior occurs when the colony radius exceeds a threshold, RcolRcrit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If either the colony radius or the production capacity is below the threshold, or if both quantities are close to their respective thresholds, then the colony will relax to a steady-state behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QS characteristics we observe for this colony of synthetic capsules (with Hill coefficient n=3) resemble the responses exhibited in biological QS; namely, a certain behavior is activated when the population size and density become sufficiently high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our repressilator colony system, however, can produce different responses to varying capsule number and density, depending on the choice of the Hill coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5, we overlay the phase map boundaries separating stable and oscillatory regimes for different Hill coefficients n=2,3,4,5 (nota bene, the Hill coefficient can take fractional values in both experimental and theoretical systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cases n=4,5 show, qualitatively, the same QS transition as the n=3 case described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical production capacity and the critical colony radius decrease as n increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, oscillations are more likely in systems with large Hill coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case n=2, a qualitatively different phase map boundary is obtained between the oscillatory and steady regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the colony radius increases, oscillations require increasingly high capsule densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There may be an upper limit to the colony radius beyond which oscillations cannot be sustained at any value of the production capacity, although this asymptotic behavior is not clear from the range of parameter values tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the oscillatory regime in Fig 5 indicates that the n=2 repressilator system can function as a bandpass filter, allowing oscillations to emerge only within a specific range of Rcol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this functionality may not be common in biological QS, it is useful in engineered systems in providing additional degrees of self-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The characteristic that oscillations cease as the colony radius increases (for n=2) is consistent with previous theoretical studies of well-mixed (homogeneous) repressilator systems (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a system of ordinary differential equations to model the repressilator kinetics without diffusion, it was shown that the n=2 case does not exhibit oscillations unless the model is formulated with an additional three chemical species representing mRNA molecules that are involved in the production of proteins by living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our capsule colony becomes larger, the interior becomes less affected by the finite size of the colony and behaves like an infinite, homogeneous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this homogeneous limit, it was shown (14) that the steady state is always stable for n2 but that a Hopf bifurcation leads to oscillations whenever n2 and (in our notation) pcolmaxpcritmax=r0n+1+r0, where r0=2/(n2)n. Table S1 compares this formula for the critical production capacity in well-mixed systems with thresholds obtained numerically in the large colony limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results for large colony sizes agree well with the homogeneous description, but we also demonstrate that diffusion is an important process for small colonies and can lead to chemical oscillations that are otherwise not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [In Supporting Information, we also compare the periods and amplitudes of oscillation for the well-mixed and heterogeneous systems (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the above discussion, we focused on analysis of a 2D colony of capsules because this is potentially the simplest arrangement to realize experimentally; unless the fluid and microcapsule mass densities are carefully matched, the microcapsules would naturally settle into a 2D layer in a microfluidic chamber, as in experiments with porous catalytic particles (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, 3D arrangements of capsules are experimentally possible, as are 1D arrangements in a capillary tube or other channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is straightforward to adapt both the discrete and the continuum colony models to determine the behavior in such systems, although numerical solution becomes much slower as the dimensionality increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Text, we present a QS phase map for spherical colonies in unbounded, 3D space (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar to the 2D case shown in Fig 5; oscillations are favored by large colony sizes, high production capacities, and large values of the Hill coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a theoretical model for the chemical activity of a colony of microcapsules that produce and release chemical species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach extends standard mathematical models for reaction kinetics in well-mixed systems to a spatially heterogeneous description by considering capsules to be diffusively coupled, localized sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations showed that the colonies regulated by the repressilator feedback network exhibited QS behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, small colonies gave steady, low production of chemicals (off state), whereas large, dense colonies generated large-amplitude oscillations in chemical production rates and concentrations (on state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a simplified model, we characterized the dependence of the emergent behavior on model parameters, enabling systems with particular transitions to be designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, colonies are generally switched on when the colony radius is sufficiently large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the Hill coefficient n=2, however, it is possible to design colonies that switch off when the radius is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such behavior is not possible with the QS networks in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The models and simulation techniques we have implemented can be extended and applied to arbitrary regulatory networks to investigate the coordinated behavior in other systems of synthetic or biological cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these findings show that QS can emerge from regulatory networks that are not used for QS in biological systems and hence reveal that a variety of feedback loops could enable sensitivity to the number and density of elements in a colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings have important implications for designing novel mechanoresponsive materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the capsules can be embedded within and chemically linked to a polymer gel, or the enzymes can be directly immobilized in hydrogels (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical deformation (extension or compression) can be harnessed to tailor the separation between the capsules and thus create materials that controllably emit oscillatory signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In systems of free (unbound) capsules, chemical concentration gradients can cause the capsules to move due to diffusiophoresis, for example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signaling molecules, or other secreted chemicals, would control the motion of the capsules in addition to regulating reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such systems could display complex self-organizing behavior, as there is bidirectional feedback between the spatial arrangement of capsules and the chemical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous simulations demonstrated that a group of three capsules, each producing a different component of the repressilator network, could dynamically regulate chemical concentration gradients to induce rapid aggregation of the capsules (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying a similar mechanism for gradient-driven motion of QS capsules could enable large populations to aggregate when the population density locally reaches a critical threshold, mimicking the coordinated aggregation of slime mold cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible to envision engineering other collective phenomena, such as oscillating contraction and expansion of colonies, by modifying the diffusiophoretic response of capsules to each chemical species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, based on recent experimental studies (2630), we propose potential routes for physically realizing our QS microcapsules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key component for QS in our system is a regulated production of chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, this is achieved through the repressilator network, which enables self-sustained oscillations under specific conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original realization of the repressilator was based on regulation of a synthetic gene network in living cells (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repressilator motif can, however, be implemented in cell-free alternatives, which use biochemical mixtures to execute the regulation scheme (26, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in vitro transcriptional circuits can be systematically assembled to form arbitrary networks in an experimentally simple manner (31); oscillators, including the repressilator, have been successfully constructed using this technique (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three chemical species in the repressilator network are inhibitor species of RNA (26, 27, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics following this mechanism of inhibition were experimentally shown to be approximated by the Hill function, as was assumed in our model (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of the effective Hill coefficient n varied between 3 and 6, depending on controllable experimental conditions (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our predictions on variations in the system behavior with changes in n could be tested experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the regulated production of chemicals, to experimentally realize our system, we need to enclose the regulating network within microcontainers, while still allowing chemical communication among these containers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encapsulation of cell-free biochemical networks has been achieved using phospholipid vesicles (30) and water-in-oil microemulsion droplets (27, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain small molecules used in bacterial QS, such as N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, could pass through vesicle membranes (30) and the oil phase surrounding emulsion droplets (29), thus facilitating intercellular communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Channel proteins could be used to allow transport of other signaling species across vesicle membranes (32), and stomatocytes with large openings would also freely exchange a wide range of materials with the external fluid (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the necessary components for experimentally realizing our system are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative route, the necessary enzymes can be confined in membraneless compartments by complex coacervation (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under specific conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, polyelectrolytes can undergo phase separation and form coacervate droplets that are enriched in protein molecules (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lacking membranes, signaling species could freely diffuse into and out of the droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the condition dependence of coacervation provides a mechanism for dynamically aggregating and dispersing the enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our model indicates that oscillations occur when there is a large, concentrated aggregate of chemical-producing material, we could design systems that oscillate when a certain temperature is reached, for example, and phase separation occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a finite difference approach to numerically solve an approximation to the model described by Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forward-time centered-space scheme is implemented for the temporal and spatial derivatives (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computational domain is the 3D box defined by L/2xL/2, L/2yL/2, h/2zh/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periodic boundary conditions are used for the x and y boundaries, and impermeable boundary conditions are used for the z boundaries,cj(x=L/2,y,z,t)=cj(x=L/2,y,z,t),cj(x,y=L/2,z,t)=cj(x,y=L/2,z,t),cjz|z=h/2=cjz|z=h/2=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Restricting our studies to 2D arrangements of capsules, we consider a thin domain h=2Rcap as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the influence of the lateral (x,y) periodic boundaries, we place them far away from the colony by setting the domain length L=2(Rcol+) with =3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nondimensionalized units, the characteristic time required for a chemical to diffuse by a distance  is t=2=9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this time, first-order degradation removes (1et)=99.99% of the chemical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, chemical concentrations at the lateral boundaries are negligible, and the periodicity of the computational domain should have little effect on the behavior of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The domain is discretized using a regular square grid with spacing x=0.02.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical grid size is 400 × 400 × 5, for example, for the simulations presented in Fig 2 B and C. The time step size used with the finite difference scheme is t=4×105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The centers of all capsules are confined to the plane z=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (x,y) coordinates are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position is rejected and redrawn from the uniform distribution if the capsule would be placed outside the colony (Rcap+x2+y2Rcol) or if the capsule would overlap a previously accepted capsule placement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each simulation time step, the chemical production term defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 is applied to all grid cells within a distance Rcap of a capsule center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Nondimensionalization_of_Governing_Equations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before nondimensionalization, the reactiondiffusion equations governing the concentrations of the chemical species in our repressilator system aretcj(x,t)=D2cj(x,t)cj(x,t)+pj(x,t),j=1,2,3,[S1]where D is the diffusion coefficient and  is the decay constant for first-order degradation of the chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that all chemical species have the same decay constant and diffusion coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production terms pj are defined as described in Results and Discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repression is modeled using the Hill function, which has the dimensional formf(c)=pmax1+(c/cthresh)n,[S2]where pmax is the maximum production rate per unit volume, cthresh is the repressor concentration that reduces production to half of the maximum rate, and n is the dimensionless Hill coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2 are transformed into the dimensionless forms in Results and Discussion by introducing the dimensionless variables x=x/D/, t=t, and cj=cj/cthresh and defining the dimensionless maximum production rate per unit volume pmax=pmax/(cthresh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_Interpretation_of_Dimensionless_Lengths_in_the_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The time scale for nondimensionalization in our model is the inverse decay constant for first-order degradation of the chemicals, =1, and the length scale is the distance that the chemicals diffuse over this time scale, l=D/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dimensionless units, lengths express the relative significance of decay to diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies with Rcol1 are large in the sense that chemicals produced in the center decay before reaching the periphery and, similarly, chemicals produced at the periphery of the colony do not affect the center; this explains why the threshold production capacity for oscillations is insensitive to Rcol at large values (Rcol5) for n2 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given a spatial arrangement of capsules, the dimensionless colony radius can be altered by changing the diffusion coefficient D or the first-order decay constant  of the chemical species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion coefficient depends on the viscosity of the fluid medium, for example, and the decay constant can be controlled by adjusting the concentrations of enzymes in the ambient fluid that degrade the chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the viscosity or the degradation rate would lead to a shorter length scale, i.e., a larger dimensionless colony radius, which would generally promote chemical oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that increasing the chemical degradation rate also affects the time scale of the system and results in a lower dimensionless production capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stability_Analysis_of_Uniform__Continuous__2D_Colony_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed in Results and Discussion, we assume that the production rates per unit volume inside the colony are spatially homogeneous for each chemical species at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current analysis, we assume a 2D (circular) colony in an unbounded domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from applying the same procedure to 3D (spherical) colonies are briefly presented in Stability Analysis of Uniform, Continuous, 3D Colony Model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first obtain a steady-state solution for our model and then use a linear expansion to determine the stability of the steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the steady state is stable, then we expect the colony to relax to constant, nonoscillatory dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the steady state is unstable, then sustained oscillations in the chemical production rates and concentrations will emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For convenience, we repeat the reactiondiffusion equations from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2,tcj(x,t)=2cj(x,t)cj(x,t)+pj(x,t),j=1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The production terms are given bypj(x,t)={Pj(t)=pcolmax1+Cj1n(t),ifx2+y2Rcol,0,otherwise,[S4]where Cj(t)=cj(x=0,t) so that the production of species j is governed by the concentration of its repressor, chemical (j1), at the center of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout our analysis, the species index is to be interpreted modulo 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the chemical concentrations are spatially varying in this model, the behavior of the system is completely determined by the concentrations at the center of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once we obtain consistent solutions for Cj(t) and Pj(t) for all times t, we can use the method of Greens functions to write the concentration fields ascj(x,t)=0G^(x,s)Pj(ts)ds,[S5]where G^(x,s)=||x0||RcolG(xx0,s)dx0, and the Greens function for the reactiondiffusion Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 without the production term isG(x,s)=14sexp(x24ss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suppose that a steady state exists with equilibrium concentrations C¯j and equilibrium production rates P¯j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 to the steady state,C¯j=P¯jH0,H0=0G^(x=0,s)ds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]Here, H0 is a constant for a fixed value of Rcol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noting that the Hill function in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 relating P¯j to C¯j1 decreases monotonically, we deduce that Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 can only hold for all j simultaneously if all three species have identical equilibrium values, P¯1=P¯2=P¯3=P¯, C¯1=C¯2=C¯3=C¯.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady state is the unique solution ofC¯(1+C¯n)=pcolmaxH0,P¯=pcolmax1+C¯n,[S8]which can be solved numerically for given values of n, Rcol, and pcolmax (note that H0 depends on Rcol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now linearize about the steady state, Cj(t)=C¯+Cj(t), Pj(t)=P¯+Pj(t), and assume perturbations in the production rates of the formPj(t)=dCj1(t)=Pj(0)exp(t),[S9]whered=PjCj1|Cj1=C¯[S10]is the gradient of the Hill function at the steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding perturbations in the concentrations are given byCj(t)=Pj(t)H()=dCj1(t)H()=[dH()]3Cj(t),[S11]whereH()=0G^(0,s)exp(s)ds=0exp[(1+)s]{1exp[Rcol2/(4s)]}ds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11, we conclude that the eigenvalue  in our assumed perturbations must be complex solutions of the equation [dH()]3=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We solve this equation using numerical root-finding algorithms for a given set of parameters n, Rcol, and pcolmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If any of the eigenvalues have a positive real part, then the perturbations grow exponentially with time, indicating an unstable steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, then the perturbations decay exponentially with time, and the steady state is stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stability_Analysis_of_Uniform__Continuous__3D_Colony_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A procedure analogous to that in Stability Analysis of Uniform, Continuous, 2D Colony Model can be performed to determine the stability of steady states for a spherical colony in a 3D domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Greens function Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 is replaced by the 3D form,G(x,s)=1(4s)3/2exp(x24ss),[S13]and the chemical production terms are defined bypj(x,t)={Pj(t)=pcolmax1+Cj1n(t),ifx2+y2+z2Rcol,0,otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S14]The phase map for the spherical colony is presented in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing with the 2D colony configuration (Fig 5), the transitions between steady and oscillatory colony behavior are qualitatively the same for Hill coefficients n=2and3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cases n=4and5, the 3D colonies differ in behavior at small values of Rcol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolating the asymptotes beyond the finite parameter range explored numerically, the phase map for 3D colonies suggests that arbitrarily small colonies are still able to sustain oscillations if the production capacity is sufficiently high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 2D colonies exhibit a minimum colony radius below which oscillations are not sustained irrespective of the production capacity pcolmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Oscillation_Amplitudes_and_Periods_in_Finite_Capsule_Colonies_and_Well-Mixed_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that colonies of large enough radius adopt the qualitative behavior expected for well-mixed repressilator systems modeled by the set of ordinary differential equations,dCjdt=PjCj,Pj=pcolmax1+Cj1n,j=1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S15]We now compare the details of the oscillatory behavior, namely, the amplitudes and periods of oscillations, between the well-mixed system and systems of finite colony size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixing the parameters n=3 and pcolmax=41.7, the time series of production rates in the well-mixed system are shown in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have taken the initial concentrations to be C10=3, C20=6, and C30=9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These model parameters and initial conditions correspond to those used in the simulation of discrete capsules in a finite colony of radius Rcol=2 presented in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the time series of average production rates in the discrete colony are reproduced in Fig S1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period of oscillations in the discrete colony is Tosc=2.33, much smaller than the value Tosc=8.20 in the well-mixed case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of oscillations in production rate P (defined as half of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the time series after transience) is also smaller in the discrete colony (P/pcolmax=0.194) than in the well-mixed system (P/pcolmax=0.469).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain whether the differences in oscillation period and amplitude are due to the finite colony size or some other effect, such as the spatial heterogeneity within the colony, it would be ideal to systematically vary the colony radius from the small to the large limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colony radius is, however, limited by constraints on computational resources for detailed discrete capsule simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we use our coarse-grained model assuming uniform, continuous chemical production throughout the colony, as used to efficiently construct the phase maps in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the equivalent conditions as with the discrete capsule case above, the coarse-grained colony (Fig S1C) has a larger period Tosc=4.72 and amplitude P/pcolmax=0.419 than the discrete capsule colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the colony radius from Rcol=2 to Rcol=16 (Fig S1D), oscillations of the coarse-grained colony become indistinguishable from the well-mixed case (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We plot the dependences of Tosc and P on the colony radius in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both quantities increase rapidly once the threshold colony radius for oscillations is surpassed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period and amplitude are most sensitive to the colony radius around Rcol=2, potentially contributing to the discrepancy between the discrete model (Fig S1B) and the coarse-grained model (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above Rcol=8, the finite colony model behaves essentially like the well-mixed system in terms of oscillation period and amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that our assumption of uniform production in the coarse-grained model precludes the development of wave solutions that can appear in large reactiondiffusion systems when synchronized oscillations become unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Continuum_Model_with_Radially_Varying_Chemical_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the continuum colony model, the chemical source terms are homogeneous throughout the disk-shaped colony, as described by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prescribe uniform initial concentration fields for each chemical species and, hence, expect the chemical concentration fields to remain independent of z and azimuthally symmetric about the center of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enforcing these symmetry considerations, the reactiondiffusion system (Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3) can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates astcj(r,t)=r1r[rrcj(r,t)]cj(r,t)+pj(r,t),rcj|r=0=0,cj(r,t=0)=cj0,[S16]with the chemical production term given bypj(r,t)=f[cj1(r,t)]col(r),col(r)={Vcapcap,ifrRcol,0,otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S17]As in our simulations of discrete capsules, we consider a finite spatial domain for computational purposes; this is achieved by introducing a no-flux boundary at r=(Rcol+) with =20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A finite difference method is used to solve this system of equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the initial concentrations to c10=3, c20=5, and c30=7 and advance the solution in time until either stable temporal oscillations in concentrations emerge or all concentration fields converge to a steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a subset of model parameter combinations, we verify the convergence of the numerical solutions by testing a range of spatial and temporal discretizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
