Evolutionarily conserved TRH neuropeptide pathway regulates growth in Caenorhabditis elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hypothalamic neuropeptide TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) is one of the major endocrine factors that regulate vertebrate physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For decades the general assumption has been that TRH neuropeptides are not present in protostomes, at least not in ecdysozoans, despite the presence of TRH receptor orthologs in these phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a TRH-related neuropeptidereceptor pathway in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRH-like neuropeptides activate the C. elegans TRH receptor ortholog in cell-culture cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 reverse genetics, we discovered that TRH-related signaling in the pharyngeal system promotes C. elegans growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides evidence of a functional TRH neuropeptidereceptor pathway in invertebrates, suggesting that TRH signaling had evolved in a bilaterian ancestor more than 700 million years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vertebrates thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that exerts the hormonal control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as well as neuromodulatory functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a functional equivalent in protostomian animals remains unknown, although TRH receptors are conserved in proto- and deuterostomians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a TRH-like neuropeptide precursor in Caenorhabditis elegans that belongs to a bilaterian family of TRH precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi reverse genetics, we show that TRH-like neuropeptides, through the activation of their receptor TRHR-1, promote growth in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRH-like peptides from pharyngeal motor neurons are required for normal body size, and knockdown of their receptor in pharyngeal muscle cells reduces growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants deficient for TRH signaling have no defects in pharyngeal pumping or isthmus peristalsis rates, but their growth defect depends on the bacterial diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the decrease in growth, trh-1 mutants have a reduced number of offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that TRH is an evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide, having its origin before the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, and may ancestrally have been involved in the control of postembryonic growth and reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Identification_of_a_TRH_Precursor_Ortholog_in_C_elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. elegans has a single receptor ortholog of vertebrate TRHRs encoded by the gene C30F12.6 (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein is an orphan receptor of the rhodopsin GPCR family and was originally named NMUR-4 based on its sequence similarity to mammalian neuromedin U receptors (NMURs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analyses show that NMUR-4 is orthologous to vertebrate TRHRs (Fig 1A and refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 and 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we refer to NMUR-4 from here onwards as TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the cognate ligand(s) of this receptor, we expressed TRHR-1 with the promiscuous Gq-like G16 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and monitored its activation by a bioluminescent calcium indicator (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We challenged receptor-expressing cells with a synthetic library of more than 250 known and predicted C. elegans peptides, but none was able to activate TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lack of TRHR-1 activation by known C. elegans peptides and the presence of orphan TRHR orthologs in Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa led us to hypothesize that an as yet unknown family of TRH-like precursors might be present in these phyla and might encode the cognate ligand of TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore performed an in silico search for TRH-like neuropeptide precursors in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based strategy (19, 20), we first generated a list of peptide precursor candidates in the C. elegans genome that showed conservation across protostomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this screening strategy the ELFamide precursor, encoded by the C. elegans gene C30H6.10, stood out as the most promising candidate, because (i) it was conserved across all the main protostomian phyla, and (ii) it yielded peptides with features similar to TRHs in terms of their small size (five or six amino acids) and biochemical characteristics (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newly predicted ELFamide precursor has 96 amino acid residues including an N-terminal signal sequence (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains two TRH-like progenitor sequences that are preceded by a triple basic site (KRR or RRR) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a C-terminal glycine residue in these peptide sequences is indicative of posttranslational modification to an amide (-NH2) group in the mature peptides (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on its relationship to deuterostomian trh precursor genes, we propose designating C30H6.10 as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone 1 (trh-1) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TRH-1_Neuropeptides_Activate_C_elegans_TRHR-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the predicted TRH-like peptides are ligands of TRHR-1, we tested synthetic peptide replicates of GRELF-NH2 and ANELF-NH2 in our calcium bioluminescence assay (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both peptides are preceded by a tribasic site in the TRH-1 precursor, we also tested the activity of RGRELF-NH2 and RANELF-NH2 peptides that are generated if cleavage occurs after the second arginine residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All TRH-1 peptides activated TRHR-1 dose dependently and with nanomolar EC50 values, whereas cells transfected with a control vector showed no calcium responses (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRHR-1 was not activated by scrambled TRH-1 peptides (Fig 2 A and B) or by any other neuropeptide-like protein (NLP) or FMRFamide-like peptide (FLP) of C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRH-1 peptides therefore specifically activate TRHR-1 in cellulo, suggesting that they are the cognate ligands of this receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further studied TRHR-1 signaling in cells lacking expression of the G16 subunit, which couples the receptor to the Gq pathway regardless of its endogenous G-protein coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When expression of G16 was omitted, TRH-1 peptides elicited strong calcium responses (Fig S1A), indicating that TRHR-1 can couple to endogenous Gq proteins in CHO cells and can signal through the calcium pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuropeptide ligands have been identified for vertebrate and Platynereis TRHRs (22, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether TRH-like peptides of these species could activate C. elegans TRHR-1 in cell-culture cells (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both vertebrate TRH (pQHP-NH2) and Platynereis EFLGamide (FSEFLG-NH2) activated TRHR-1 at 10 M (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted echinoderm TRH of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (pQYPG-NH2 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6) elicited no calcium response (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. elegans TRH-1 peptides also activated the human and Platynereis TRHRs at concentrations down to 1 µM (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ligandreceptor couples coevolve, cross-activation of TRHRs by TRH-like peptides from different species is expected to require high ligand concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results support the evolutionary conservation of a TRH-related signaling system in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. elegans TRH-1 peptides have five to six amino acid residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine residues that are crucial for activation of TRHR-1, we tested a series of analogs in which amino acids of TRH-1 were replaced by alanine residues (Fig S1 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitution of the N-terminal glycine, arginine, or asparagine residues had nearly no effect on peptide activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the activity of TRH-1 peptides was strongly reduced when residues of the C-terminal ELFamide sequence were replaced by alanine (Fig S1 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the ELF-NH2 tripeptide motif, which is conserved in all TRH-1 peptides, is important for activating TRHR-1, although it is not sufficient to elicit full receptor activation (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_TRH-Like_Neuropeptides_in_Protostomia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to C. elegans TRH-1, our in silico search for TRH precursor orthologs identified TRH-like sequences in the genomes of several protostomes, including annelids, mollusks, arthropods, and other nematode species (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like deuterostome TRHs, all protostomian TRH-like peptides have short sequences and a C-terminal amide group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All listed TRH-like peptides contain five to eight amino acids in protostomes, four residues in echinoderms, and three amino acids in vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal E-[L/F]-[L/F/V]-[G/Ø]-NH2 motif is common to all protostomian TRH-like sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, all deuterostomian TRHs share a pyroglutamate residue (pQ) that can be generated from an N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In protostomes, the glutamic acid residue is not situated at the N terminus, suggesting that the pyroglutamate modification most likely arose later in evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, all TRH precursors yield multiple related peptides, ranging from two copies in C. elegans to more than 20 variants in annelids and Branchiostoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C_elegans_TRH-1_and_TRHR-1_Are_Expressed_at_the_Neuromuscular_Pharynx  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain hints on putative functions of TRH-1 signaling, we determined the expression patterns of trh-1 and trhr-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic C. elegans expressing translational fosmid-recombineered GFP transgenes or a polycistronic Ptrhr-1::trhr-1::SL2::gfp reporter transgene showed trhr-1 expression only at the pharynx (Fig 4A and Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pharynx is a neuromuscular feeding organ that consists of three functional parts: the corpus, subdivided into an anterior procorpus and a posterior metacorpus, the isthmus, and the terminal bulb (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, TRHR-1 localized to pharyngeal muscle cells of the metacorpus (pm4) and the isthmus (pm5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reporter transgenes for trh-1, including the trh-1 promoter region and the gene's genomic or cDNA sequence, showed similar expression patterns in the pharyngeal nervous system that is separated from the CNS by a basal lamina but is thought to secrete signals to the pseudocoelomic fluid (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified trh-1expressing cells as the pharyngeal motor neurons M4 and M5 based on their position and morphology (Fig 4B and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M4 directly innervates the pharyngeal muscle pm5 and controls isthmus peristalsis; the function of the motor neuron M5 is unclear (27, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CRISPR_Cas9-Induced_Knockout_Mutants_of_trh-1_Have_Normal_Pharyngeal_Pumping_and_Peristalsis_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pharyngeal motor neuron M4, which expresses trh-1, is essential for feeding because it controls peristalsis of the posterior isthmus muscles of the pharynx (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that TRH-1 neuropeptides might regulate isthmus peristalsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no null mutants of trh-1 were available, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in the trh-1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated a loss-of-function trh-1 allele, lst1118, with an 8-bp indel (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation caused a frameshift and premature stop codon immediately downstream of the signal peptide sequence, which should target the aberrant trh-1 transcripts for nonsense-mediated decay and fully eliminate trh-1 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the isthmus peristalsis rate of trh-1 mutants by feeding worms red fluorescent Escherichia coli OP50 bacteria, allowing direct visualization of the peristaltic contractions of the pharyngeal isthmus (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the isthmus peristalsis rates of wild-type and trh-1mutant worms fed OP50 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates of pharyngeal pumping while feeding on E. coli OP50 were similar as well (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that TRH-1 neuropeptides have no obvious effects on isthmus peristalsis or on pharyngeal pumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_TRH-1_TRHR-1_Pathway_Promotes_Growth_in_C_elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the role of TRH-like peptides in protostomes has remained unknown, TRH signaling in vertebrates regulates several aspects of physiology, such as development, growth, reproduction, and locomotor activity (9, 3439).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated if TRH-1 neuropeptides mediate C. elegans locomotion by measuring the forward speed of worms on a bacterial lawn and off food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, trh-1 mutants crawled at a speed similar to that of wild-type worms (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vertebrates, TRH promotes growth as a stimulatory factor of GH secretion (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether trh-1 regulates growth in C. elegans, we quantified worm sizes by measuring the length and width of formaldehyde-fixed or anesthetized worms and approximated their volume as a cylinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synchronized a population of worms by embryonic starvation, leading to developmental arrest at the first larval stage (L1), and quantified the body volume every 24 h after feeding until the fifth day of adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body size of trh-1 mutants was smaller than that of wild-type worms 24 h after L1 arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This size defect increased and persisted in subsequent larval and adult stages (Fig 5A and Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trh-1 mutants showed a reduced growth rate from early larval stages to adulthood (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest difference was seen around 48 h after the L1 arrest, corresponding to the fourth larval (L4) stage and its transition to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body size defect was most pronounced at the adult stage (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore 1-day-old adult worms were used in further experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trh-1 mutants had a significantly smaller body length and width, resulting in a reduced body volume (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoring trh-1 expression under the control of its promoter rescued the size defect (Fig 5D); hence TRH-1 neuropeptides are required for normal body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of the neuropeptide significantly increased the body volume of wild-type worms, suggesting that trh-1 is sufficient to induce growth (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the role of TRHR-1 in growth regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a strain carrying a trhr-1 mutant allele is available (RB1284), we found that a genomic sequence of the reported deletion is still present in the strain's background and that it is unlikely to be a trhr-1null mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore applied RNAi using trhr-1 promoter-driven sense and antisense (sas) transgenes (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of trhr-1 significantly decreased body volume (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that TRH-1 and its receptor function together in vivo, we combined knockdown of trhr-1 with overexpression or knockout of trh-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body size of trh-1(lst1118);trhr-1(RNAi) worms was similar to that of trh-1(lst1118) mutants or trhr-1(RNAi) worms (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trh-1 overexpression increased the body size of wild-type worms, and knockdown of trhr-1 suppressed this effect (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that TRH-1 regulates growth through the activation of its receptor TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A reduction in body volume may result from slower development caused by impaired TRH-1 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, trh-1 overexpression increased the body size of wild-type worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size defect of trh-1 mutants also persisted at least 5 days into adulthood (from 72 h onwards; Fig 5A), suggesting that growth, and not development, is affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corroborating this finding, trh-1 mutants displayed little to no delay in reproductive maturation (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with wild-type worms, egg-laying of trh-1 mutants started within 72 h after synchronized L1 larvae were fed and reached its maximum at the second day of adulthood (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although reproductive maturation was normal, the number of viable offspring was significantly reduced by 17% in trh-1 mutants compared with wild-type worms (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This defect may indicate a role of trh-1 in regulating C. elegans reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reintroducing a wild-type copy of trh-1 cDNA that restored the growth defect failed to rescue the reduced brood size of the mutant strain (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharyngeal_TRH-1_Signaling_Controls_Body_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both TRH-1 neuropeptides and their receptor are expressed at the neuromuscular pharynx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the cellular basis of TRH-1mediated growth, we transgenically restored trh-1 gene expression in specific neurons in worms otherwise lacking trh-1 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no cell-specific promoter is known to drive expression in the M5 neuron, we used the ceh-28 promoter to restore trh-1 expression only in the pharyngeal motor neuron M4 (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M4-specific expression of trh-1 partially rescued the reduced body size of trh-1 mutants (Fig 5F), indicating that trh-1 is required in M4 to promote growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partial rescue effect suggests that growth regulation likely depends on trh-1 functions in M4 and M5 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth defect of trh-1 mutants was fully rescued when we restored trh-1 expression under the control of trh-1 or glr-8 promoters (Fig 5 D and G), which drive expression in both M4 and M5 neurons (in addition to other neurons driven by the glr-8 promoter) (Table S1) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the cellular focus of trhr-1, we performed a tissue-specific knockdown of the receptor in pharyngeal muscle cells by expressing sense and antisense transgenes under control of the myo-2 promoter (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of trhr-1 in the pharyngeal muscles resulted in a significantly decreased body volume, comparable to the reduced size of the trh-1 mutant (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TRH-1_Signaling_Regulates_Growth_Independently_of_TGF-_Signaling_and_Depending_on_Bacterial_Diet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DBL-1, a ligand of the TGF- superfamily, is a major growth regulator in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among other cells, it is synthesized in the trh-1expressing neuron M4 (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to trh-1 mutants, worms deficient in dbl-1 signaling hatch as L1 larvae indistinguishable in length from wild-type L1s and display a continuously reduced body size throughout development (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether trh-1 and dbl-1 act in the same growth-regulatory pathway, we measured the body volume of trh-1;dbl-1 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-mutant worms were significantly smaller than trh-1 and dbl-1 single mutants (Fig 6A), suggesting that trh-1 regulates body size independently of DBL-1/TGF- signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. elegans body size also depends on the type of bacteria and quality of the food (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because growth is regulated by TRH-1/TRHR-1 signaling in the pharyngeal system, we hypothesized that its regulation of body size might be food-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore compared the body volume of wild-type and trh-1mutant worms grown on the standard laboratory food source E. coli OP50 with those fed E. coli HB101, a high-quality food source which better supports growth (4750).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although trh-1 mutants grown on OP50 have a growth defect, their body volume is similar to that of wild-type worms when they are fed E. coli HB101 bacteria (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both bacterial strains, trh-1 mutants showed normal pharyngeal pumping and isthmus peristalsis rates (Fig 4 C and D and Fig S5), indicating no obvious defects in food intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we identified a functional TRH-like neuropeptide system in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings expand our understanding of the evolutionary history of the TRH neuropeptide family, for which we identified similar peptides in all major protostomian phyla of the Ecdysozoa (nematodes and arthropods) and Lophotrochozoa (annelids and mollusks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic analyses of TRHRs show a clear conservation of this receptor family in Protostomia and Deuterostomia (19, 20), including the C. elegans TRHR ortholog NMUR-4, which we named TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico studies and peptidomics previously identified 31 FLP and 52 NLP precursors in C. elegans (51, 52), but none of the corresponding peptides show sequence similarity to deuterostomian TRHs or were able to activate TRHR-1 in cell-culture cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the presence of orphan protostomian TRHR orthologs (1921), we hypothesized that an as yet unknown family of neuropeptide precursors in these phyla might encode the cognate ligand of TRHR-1, and we performed an in-depth in silico search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our search identified the trh-1 precursor (C30H10.6) as the most promising candidate, because this precursor shows a phylogenetic distribution similar to protostomian TRHRs and encodes two peptides with TRH-like sequence features in terms of length and biochemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that TRH-1 neuropeptides (R)GRELF-NH2 and (R)ANELF-NH2 are cognate ligands of TRHR-1 in vivo and activate C. elegans, Platynereis, and human TRHRs in cellulo, supporting the homology of TRH-1 to deuterostomian TRH precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the lack of evidence for TRHR ligands in protostomes, except in Platynereis (22), it was proposed that TRH neuropeptides have been lost in this lineage, or at least in Ecdysozoa (2123, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in silico search revealed the presence of TRH-like peptides in nematodes, arthropods, annelids, and mollusks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various lines of evidence suggest that they belong to the TRH neuropeptide family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The conservation of their precursor proteins across Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa matches the evolutionary conservation of TRHR orthologs in these phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Similar to vertebrate preproTRH, all the identified protostomian precursors contain multiple copies of TRH-like peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The encoded peptides are short amidated sequences (five to eight amino acids), like TRHs, that show the highest degree of similarity for the C-terminal tripeptide motif E-[L/F]-[L/F/V].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) This core signature shares the acidic residue of deuterostomian TRHs (pyroglutamate in all deuterostomes and glutamic acid in all protostomes), whereas the hydrophobic residue at position two is also found in deuterostomian echinoderm TRHs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (v) Neuropeptides encoded by the C. elegans TRH-1 precursor activated the C. elegans, Platynereis, and human TRHRs in our cellular assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ELFamide motif of TRH-1 peptides, which resembles the protostomian core signature, is crucial for receptor activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Platynereis the EFLGamide peptides were recently shown to activate the TRHR ortholog in this species (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in line with this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified the annelid EFLGamides and the related fulicin peptides in mollusks as homologs of the C. elegans TRH-1 peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these lines of evidence we suggest that the annelid EFLGamides and molluscan fulicins, together with the related peptides that we identified in nematodes and arthropods, are all part of the TRH neuropeptide family (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our search in public databases for TRH-like peptides and receptors indicates that this signaling system is present in major protostomian groups including annelids, mollusks, arthropods, and nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could retrieve only a low number of TRHR sequences in insects that were restricted to the Hemiptera (Nilaparvata, Cimex, and Diaphorina) and Diptera (Rhagoletis) groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found a TRH-like precursor in only one insect species, the Firebrat (Thermobia domestica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the TRH system has been lost in many insect groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRHRs share strong sequence similarity with ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) receptors, which are well conserved in insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, phylogenetic studies indicate that they are not orthologous to TRHRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ETH receptor orthologs are present in nonarthropod species, including in some deuterostomes, and coexist with TRH-like peptides and TRHRs in some arthropods (e.g., Ixodes and Daphnia) (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the TRH and ETH systems were both established in an early bilaterian and potentially evolved from a common ancestral receptor-encoding gene (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential loss of the TRH or ETH system may explain the conservation of only one of the two systems in some arthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of TRH-like neuropeptides in protostomes is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A function was previously described for fulicin peptides in the African giant snail, Achatina fulica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fulicin and fulyal, a fulicin gene-related peptide, modulate female and male copulatory behavior (5557).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both peptides, which are TRH-like, show an excitatory effect on contractions of the vagina and the oviduct and potentiate contraction of the penis retractory muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRH-1 peptides also may have a role in regulating hermaphrodite reproduction in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that trh-1 mutants produce fewer offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reintroducing wild-type copies of trh-1 cDNA failed to rescue the brood-size defect in the mutant strain, although it rescued other phenotypic defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation might be that the reproductive phenotype is highly sensitive to trh-1 expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, brood size may be regulated by trh-1 at the germline, where the expression of transgene arrays with repetitive gene or cDNA copies is silenced (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and RNAi, we found that TRH-1/TRHR-1 signaling regulates body size in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRH-1 neuropeptides are required for promoting growth and regulating body size through activation of their receptor TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trh-1 mutants are smaller than wild-type worms throughout the larval and adult stages, but they have no delay in reproductive maturation, indicating that TRH-like signaling promotes growth rather than development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced growth rate of trh-1 mutants was most pronounced around the period of larval-to-adult transition, although a reduction is already seen at earlier larval stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temporal pattern for growth rate and body size defects resembles that of DBL-1/TGF- and feeding-defective mutants (46, 59, 60), but we found no indications that trh-1 is involved in feeding or in interacting with DBL-1/TGF- signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We showed that TRH-1 peptides are synthesized and required for growth in pharyngeal motor neurons, including M4 and most likely M5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These motor neurons innervate or are in close apposition to the pharyngeal muscles that express the peptides receptor TRHR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of trhr-1 localizes to a subset of muscles that constitute the metacorpus (pm4) and isthmus (pm5) and are involved in sequestering and regulating the flow of food in the pharynx (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue-specific knockdown confirmed that TRHR-1 signaling in pharyngeal muscle cells regulates growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although reported previously (61), we did not observe intestinal expression of trhr-1 using a translational reporter transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy could be explained by the absence of cis-acting regulatory sequences in the transcriptional reporters used previously (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How might TRH-like signaling regulate growth in C. elegans?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRHR-1 acts in the pharyngeal muscles, which regulate body size through their function in feeding and development of the pharynx (60, 6264).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of trh-1 caused no obvious defects in pharynx morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of the two main motions that constitute feedingpharyngeal pumping and isthmus peristalsiswas also unaffected, although we cannot rule out the possibility that TRH signaling might have subtle modulatory effects on food intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TRH-1 neuropeptides and their receptor are expressed together with signaling components of the DBL-1/TGF- pathway, which plays a major role in the regulation of body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that trh-1 regulates body size independently of dbl-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because TRH-1 mediates growth by signaling to the pharyngeal muscles, we hypothesized that its regulation of body size might be food-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worms are usually cultured on the laboratory food source E. coli OP50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HB101 bacteria are considered a high-quality E. coli food source, which better supports growth (4750).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although trh-1 mutants fed OP50 are growth-defective, they have a normal body volume when growing on HB101.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli HB101 bacteria are larger and have a different nutrient composition, containing higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates than OP50 (47, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the body size defect of trh-1 mutants might result from a reduction in the efficiency with which nutrients in the OP50 strain are absorbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vertebrate TRH is a releasing factor of growth-stimulating hormones, including GH and THs (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for the existence of these hormones and their receptors in nematodes is lacking (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, THs or TH receptors have been described for some mollusks, flatworms, echinoderms, and nonvertebrate chordates and may be conserved regulators of postembryonic development (5, 65, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the evolutionary origin of the TH system likely dates back to a common ancestor of bilaterians, although its function may have been lost or taken over by other endocrine factors in Ecdysozoa (23, 24, 67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many invertebrates, C. elegans has a homolog of vertebrate glycoprotein receptors, which include TSH receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ortholog FSHR-1 is involved in innate immunity, stress responses, and germline fertility (6971).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C. elegans genome also encodes two genes, flr-2 and T23B12.8, for  and  glycoprotein subunits (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to see whether TRH-like signaling regulates the release of invertebrate glycoproteins, similar to its function in vertebrates, or whether its role in these species points to a different ancestral function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our results lend further support to the ancestral origin of TRH neuropeptides predating the split of protostomian and deuterostomian animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our genetic analysis of the C. elegans TRH-like system suggests that this pathway may be a conserved regulator of growth and reproductive behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protostomian TRH-like peptides that we identified in this study provide a molecular basis for further investigations of whether these functions are shared by TRH in other invertebrates and whether TRH signaling may have ancestrally regulated animal growth and reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In_Silico_Search_for_TRH_Precursors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first performed an in silico search for neuropeptide precursors in C. elegans using a screening strategy described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this list we extracted potential peptide precursors that had not been associated with a receptor and did not belong to known nematode-specific families of peptide precursors, such as most RFamide precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used BLAST and degenerate motif search to search the GenBank, Joint Genome Institute (JGI), and nematode databases [www.pristionchus.org (74)] for precursor sequences from protostomian lineages that contained peptides resembling each of the C. elegans candidate peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We retained C. elegans candidates with a phylogenetic distribution spanning the arthropod, annelid, and molluscan lineages as expected from phylogenetic TRHR analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From that screening strategy the ELFamide precursor, encoded by the C. elegans gene C30F12.6, stood out as the most promising candidate, because it was clearly conserved across all the main protostomian phyla and yielded peptides which had features similar to TRH peptides in terms of length (3  N  8) and biochemical characteristics (N-terminal pyroglutamate in deuterostomians and conserved glutamic acid close to the C terminus in protostomians).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aequorin_Bioluminescence_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CHO cells expressing the luminescent calcium indicator aequorin and (unless otherwise stated) the human G16 subunit were transfected with pcDNA3.1/receptor plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days posttransfection, cells were loaded with coelenterazine H (Invitrogen) for 4 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luminescence after the addition of peptides dissolved in BSA medium was measured for 30 s at 469 nm with a Mithras LB940 (Berthold Technologies) reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C_elegans_Strains_and_Maintenance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The wild-type (N2) and NU3 dbl-1(nk3) strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center at the University of Minnesota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LSC1118 trh-1(lst1118) strain was created by CRISPR/Cas9 and contains an 8-bp indel, causing a frameshift and premature stop codon immediately after the signal peptide sequence (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of mutant and transgenic strains can be found in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The guide RNA (gRNA) sequences used to target trh-1 and the corresponding 3 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences are listed in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains were cultivated at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with E. coli OP50 bacteria, unless otherwise indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Body_Size_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Worm volumes were measured in two different ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) For growth curves, images of synchronized worms fixed in 4% (wt/vol) formaldehyde were captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For every sample, the average length and width of at least 1,500 particles were calculated by a RapidVUE Particle Shape and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter) (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent experiments were performed, and each sample was run three or four times (technical replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) For rescue, overexpression, and RNAi experiments, worm length and width (just behind the pharynx) were measured from images of anesthetized day 1 adult worms with ImageJ on at least two independent days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both methods, worm volume was approximated using the cylinder formula V = L(D/2)2, where L is the length of the worm, and D represents its diameter (width).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worm growth rates were modeled by regressing the length and width data obtained by the RapidVUE Particle Shape and Size Analyzer using a sigmoid (logistic) function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression was further used to compute the increase in length and width over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed descriptions of all methods and reagents and extended experimental procedures are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic_Analysis_of_TRHRs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The collection of known bilaterian sequences orthologous to TRHRs (19, 20) was expanded by BLASTing C. elegans TRHR-1 (C30F12.6) against all arthropod, annelid, and mollusk cDNA sequences contained in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repository (both nr/nt and est databases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new phylogenetic tree was built from these sequences using SATE, which simultaneously infers an alignment and a phylogenetic tree from a set of sequences (76, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It makes use of a suite of alignment and tree reconstruction tools, including MAFFT 6.717 (78) to align sequences, MUSCLE 3.7 (79) for merging alignments, and FastTree 2.1.4 (80) for maximum likelihood-based tree reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Default parameters were used for all programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the substitution model a General Time Reversible Model with a Gamma distribution approximated by 20 rate-across-sites categories (GTR+20 model) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Biology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmids for receptor expression in mammalian cells were constructed as described (81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cDNA sequence of the trhr-1 (nmur-4) gene was amplified by PCR using cDNA from mixed-stage wild-type C. elegans as template and the following gene-specific primers: forward, 5-CACCAGATGACGTCAGCCTC-3 and reverse, 5-ATGTATCACGGAGTTCCAGC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR product was directionally cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO TA (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pcDNA3.1 plasmid for the human TRHR was obtained from the Missouri University of Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pcDNA3.1 plasmid of the Platynereis EFLGa receptor was kindly provided by G. Jékely of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tuebingen, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GFP reporter and rescue constructs were generated in a modified pSM vector carrying a GFP reporter sequence preceded by an SL2 transsplicing site (kindly provided by C. Bargmann, Rockefeller University, New York).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter constructs for trhr-1 were made by cloning the trhr-1 promoter and gene locus (pEVS01) or cDNA (pEVS02) between the MscI and KpnI restriction sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pEVS02, the trhr-1 promoter (3.5 kb) was inserted between NotI and XmaI restriction sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For trh-1 reporter and rescue constructs, the genomic trh-1 fragment (pEVS03) or its cDNA (pEVS04) were first cloned at the NheI/KpnI sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trh-1 promoter (1.8 kb) then was cloned between NotI and KpnI sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A translational fosmid-based GFP reporter construct for trhr-1 was obtained from the C. elegans TransgeneOme project (82) and confirmed the expression pattern obtained with the pSM-derived reporter constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-specific trh-1 rescue strains were generated using Gateway constructs or linear PCR fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glr-8 promoter [2.9 kb (42)] was fused by overlap extension PCR to the trh-1 cDNA::SL2::gfp::unc-54 3 UTR sequence amplified from pEVS04.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Pceh-28::trh-1::SL2::gfp::let-858 3UTR rescue construct (pEVS05) was made using the MultiSite Gateway Three-Fragment Vector Construction Kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This construct was generated using the ceh-28 promoter [3.7 kb (41)] and trh-1 cDNA amplified from pEVS04.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 summarizes the promoter sequences used and their expression patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Short guide RNA (sgRNA) constructs for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing were constructed as described (83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the targeting oligonucleotides (Table S3) were inserted into the EcoRI site between the rpr-1 promoter and the gRNA scaffold (Addgene plasmid no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48961) by Gibson assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. elegans codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and 3×FLAG tag (Addgene plasmid no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48960) was used as the Cas9 expression plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sas transgenes for trhr-1 knockdown were constructed as described (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trhr-1 promoter (3.5 kb) and myo-2 promoter [1 kb (43)] were fused to a trhr-1 genomic fragment spanning exons 48 (1.5 kb) in sense and antisense orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Peptides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A library of more than 250 synthetic C. elegans peptides was compiled from in silico predictions and peptidomics data (84) and was custom-synthesized by Thermo Scientific and GL Biochem Ltd. C. elegans TRH-1 peptides, alanine-substituted and scrambled TRH-1 peptides, and nonnematode TRHs were synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. and were HPLC purified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aequorin_Bioluminescence_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CHO K1 cells stably overexpressing the mitochondrially targeted apo-aequorin and human G16 subunit were transiently transfected with trhr-1/pcDNA3.1, human TRHR/pcDNA3.1, Platynereis EFLGa receptor/pcDNA3.1, or empty pcDNA3.1 (control) plasmid using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) at 6080% confluency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfection, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C and then were transferred to 28 °C and incubated for another 24 h. CHO cells were detached and loaded with coelenterazine H (Invitrogen) for 4 h at room temperature, allowing the formation of the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incubated cells were added to synthetic peptides in DMEM/BSA, and luminescence was measured for 30 s at 469 nm using a Mithras LB940 reader (Berthold Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added for 8 s to measure the total calcium response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the mode of downstream signaling, CHO-K1 cells lacking G16 expression were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrationresponse measurements were performed in triplicate on at least two different days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sigmoidal concentrationresponse curves were created and EC50 values were calculated with GraphPad Prism software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Transgenic_Worms_and_Expression_Pattern_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GFP reporter constructs for expression analysis were injected into the syncytial gonad of young adult wild-type worms at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 ng/µL (Table S2) with 50 ng/µL of the coinjection marker Pelt-2::mCherry (pCIM01) or Punc-122::dsRED (pCIM02) and 17 ng/µL of a 1-kb DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific) as carrier DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression patterns were confirmed in at least two independent transgenic strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains for which data are shown in figures are indicated in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hermaphrodites were mounted on 2% agarose pads with 25 mM sodium azide in S-basal solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression patterns were visualized using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 (IX81) confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal Z-stack projections were analyzed with Imaris 7.2 (Olympus) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CRISPR_Cas9-Mediated_Knockout_of_trh-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To target trh-1, we searched for potential gRNA sequences of the form G(N)1921NGG with the help of the online CRISPR design tool (crispr.mit.edu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the generated list of possible guides, we selected three gRNAs complementary to the coding sequence of trh-1 because of their faithfulness of on-target activity (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA mixes containing a gRNA construct (30 ng/µL), Cas9-expressing vector [30 ng/µL (83)], Punc-122::mCherry coinjection marker (50 ng/µL), and a 1-kb DNA ladder (17 ng/µL), were injected into C. elegans hermaphrodites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injection, F1 transgenic worms were transferred to individual NGM plates and allowed to produce F2 progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F1 worms then were lysed with a proteinase K treatment and screened by PCR for the presence of mutations near the gRNA-targeted region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA fragments (100 bp) surrounding the targeted PAM site were amplified and subsequently analyzed on a 15% Tris/borate/EDTA polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the presence of indel mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Isthmus_Peristalsis_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the isthmus peristalsis rate on OP50 bacteria, worms were grown and observed on NGM culture plates supplemented with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 50 µg/mL ampicillin and seeded with dsRED-expressing OP50 bacteria (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the isthmus peristalsis rate on HB101 bacteria, worms were first cultured on NGM plates seeded with OP50 and on the day of the measurement were transferred individually to a new NGM plate seeded with mCherry-expressing HB101 bacteria (33); worms were allowed to recover for 20 min after transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isthmus peristalsis was observed by looking under a stereomicroscope with a rhodamine fluorescence filter for red signal passing through the posterior isthmus of synchronized, well-fed day 1 adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worms were recorded using a digital microscope camera (AmScope MU035) and ToupView (ToupTek) software with focus on the pharynx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of isthmus peristalsis movements was counted for 30 s on two independent days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Pharyngeal_Pumping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pharyngeal pumping rate of worms fed E. coli HB101 or OP50 was determined by transferring synchronized, well-fed day 1 adults from their culture plate to individual new plates seeded with HB101 or OP50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfer, worms were allowed to recover for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worms then were recorded using a GigEPRO camera (NET GmbH) and StreamPix software (Norpix) for 2 min with focus on the pharynx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharyngeal pumping was counted for 30 s; for every worm the average of four counts was plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Locomotion_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For on-food locomotion assays, well-fed day 1 adults were transferred from their culture plate to a freshly seeded NGM plate and allowed to recover for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worms then were recorded for 1 min using a digital microscope camera (AmScope MU035) and ToupView (ToupTek) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For off-food tracking, synchronized, well-fed day 1 adults were first transferred from their culture plate to an unseeded NGM plate for 5 min to remove residual bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worms then were placed at the center of a second unseeded NGM plate and were allowed to acclimate for another 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the on-food locomotion assays, the worms were recorded for 1 min on two different days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The video data were analyzed using automated tracking software (OptoTracker; Gotschalk laboratory, www.biochem.uni-frankfurt.de/index.php?id=236), and speed was computed by the WormAnalyzer package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All assays were performed in a temperature-controlled room at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Egg-Laying_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Egg-laying behavior was quantified as described (85) unless stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Egg-laying was assayed in synchronized worms placed on individual NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria 48 h after L1 arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worms were transferred to freshly seeded NGM plates three times each day, once after a 12-h period and twice after a 6-h period, until day 5 of adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viable offspring was counted when in the L4/adult stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incomplete offspring data resulting from the escape or death of parental worms were omitted from the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data shown for wild-type and trh-1 mutants are combined from two independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
