Tearing of Indian mantle lithosphere from high-resolution seismic images and its implications for lithosphere coupling in southern Tibet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show high-resolution P and S images of the subducted Indian mantle lithosphere, which has been torn into four main pieces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tearing provides a unified mechanism for (i) Late Miocene and Quaternary rifting, (ii) mantle earthquakes in southern and central Tibet, and (iii) patterns of current crustal deformation (seismicity and GPS strain rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests (iv) that the deformations of the crust and the mantle lithosphere in southern Tibet are strongly coupled and thus we need to take a deeper view to understand the HimalayanTibetan continental deformation and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of the Indian mantle lithosphere and the above issues are of fundamental importance and have been debated for decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed model has implications across geoscience disciplines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What happened to the Indian mantle lithosphere (IML) during the IndianEurasian collision and what role it has played on the plateau growth are fundamental questions that remain unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show clear images of the IML from high-resolution P and S tomography, which suggest that the subducted IML is torn into at least four pieces with different angles and northern limits, shallower and extending further in the west and east sides while steeper in the middle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermediate-depth earthquakes in the lower crust and mantle are located almost exclusively in the high-velocity (and presumably strong) part of the Indian lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tearing of the IML provides a unified mechanism for Late Miocene and Quaternary rifting, current crustal deformation, and intermediate-depth earthquakes in the southern and central Tibetan Plateau and suggests that the deformations of the crust and the mantle lithosphere are strongly coupled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods_and_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our P and S images came from Pn tomography (SI Appendix, Data and Methods for Pn Tomography) and a recent surface-wave tomographic model (10), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pn wave is a P wave traveling along the topmost mantle as the result of the sudden velocity increase at the Moho discontinuity and can be observed from 200 to over 1,000 km in distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of the Pn wave turns a normally 3D tomography problem into a 2D problem for the topmost mantle, improving its lateral coverage and resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a large collection of Pn travel time data in Tibet from various sources (SI Appendix, Data and Methods for Pn Tomography).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we included a dataset that consists of a large number of handpicked Pn arrivals from temporary deployments (SI Appendix, Fig S1), which improved significantly the coverage of the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tomographic inversion shows that the Pn velocity is low in the north and high in the south in general (Fig 2), consistent with previous studies (4, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret the boundary between the north and the south from the improved image as the northern frontier of the IML (IML-F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved image also shows considerable complexities in the southern and central TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-velocity regions are dissected by three narrow low-velocity bands that have a similar spacing and are nearly perpendicular to the collisional front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest low-velocity anomaly along the YadongGulu rift (YGR) was observed in a previous Pn tomography (4) and was interpreted as a tear of the IML (4, 911).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latest Pn image suggests that the IML has been torn into four main pieces with three dissecting tears or weak zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolution and error analyses suggest that the high/low-velocity contrasts are resolvable and statistically robust (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also performed an anisotropic Pn tomography by including anisotropy in the Pn velocity (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of Pn velocity is quite similar to the inversion without including the Pn anisotropy, suggesting the Pn velocity pattern is not significantly affected by the anisotropy (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our recent high-resolution S-wave model from surface-wave (Rayleigh-wave) tomography (10) (Fig 3) agrees with the Pn results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D S-wave images show clearly high velocities separated by low-velocity bands in the top part of the mantle in the map view (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S6A), in the depth view (Fig 3B), and in the 3D view (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow Pn and the slow S anomalies are at similar but are not exactly at the same locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of T1 is nearly the same, but the location of T2 or T3 can differ by 12°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy may be caused for the following reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Pn and surface waves have different sensitivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface wave is sensitive to the average velocity profile with depth, while the Pn wave is sensitive to the very top of the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the vertical averaging of surface wave data, it is not meaningful to examine the S-velocity map right below the Moho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the slow-velocity structures may not be vertical, thus appearing at slightly different locations at different depths (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the P and S tomographic resolutions are different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pn and surface-wave datasets are independent, giving rise to different resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the resolutions are still limited because of the limited station coverage, particularly in the western TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining the Pn image and the 3D S model (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6), we infer the geometry of the IML as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IML has been fragmented into four segments, which have different advancements and subduction angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segment in the east (S1) shows nearly flat subduction and advanced the most to about the Jinsha suture; the segment in the west (S4) is also flat, advancing to the Tarim Basin; and the segments in the middle (S2 and S3) have steeper subduction and advanced to about the BangongNujiang suture with S2 perhaps even steeper than S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D S model above is not deep enough to constrain the bottom of the IML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary is imaged along a few dense north-south seismic profiles in S4, S3, S2 (and T1) (7, 26), and the IML geometry is consistent with our results with an increasing angle of subduction from S4 to S2 (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent P tomography (27) shows clear fastslow along-strike variations extending to depths of at least 260 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast velocities extend further north in the western (S4) and eastern (S1) parts of the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1 and T2 can be seen in an enlarged view of 100-km depth at longitudes of 90 and 85°, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T3 does not seem to show up in their model, whose resolution may be limited by sparse station distribution in the western TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternating fastslow anomalies can also be observed from teleseismic P and S tomography under the eastern part of the TP from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A band of low velocities are observed in T1 down to depth of 250 km in both their P and S models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from recent adjoint waveform tomography (29, 30) also show similar fastslow along-strike pattern in the uppermost mantle of the TP when we zoom in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) observed low-velocity anomalies at depths shallower than 150 km, suggesting possible partial melting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they did not observe large-scale low-velocity anomalies at greater depths, although the low resolution in their studies with sparse station distribution in central-western TP may underestimate the level of the lateral heterogeneities and may not resolve the relatively fine-scale low-velocity bands at these depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of the IML and its influence on the mantle flow in the asthenosphere are likely to affect the shear-wave (SKS) splitting pattern, which have been reported previously along a few linear profiles (7, 11, 26, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared a large collection of SKS splitting measurements (32) with the S model in the mantle (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see changes of the splitting pattern across the IML-F line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern TP in the Qiangtang block, the delay times are generally larger than 1.5 s or even 2.0 s and the fast directions are mostly in the eastwest direction, which correlates with the large area of low velocities in the mantle and suggests a strong eastward mantle flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  South of the IML-F, however, the delay times are mostly smaller than 1.0 s and the null stations (with no measurable splitting) are located almost exclusively in high-velocity regions, which may be due to the presence of the thick IML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the delay times and the fast directions are much more variable with many parallel to the slab-tear directions or oblique to the fast directions in the north, which may be attributed to the influence of the complex geometry of the IML with segmentation and different angles of underthrusting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The locations of the unusually intermediate-depth intracontinental earthquakes in the southern TP show a striking correlation with the fragmented IML (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earthquakes are located in the high P velocities within the mantle lid (Pn velocities) with very few exceptions (Fig 2), including events from routine bulletins and relocated events (depth, 70 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The focal depths in bulletins have significant errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, statistical analyses on the depth distribution (SI Appendix, Fig S8) of the moderate-size earthquakes (magnitude, 4.5) relative to the fast velocities of the IML (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S5) suggest that the probability that all of the intermediate-depth earthquakes are in the crust is extremely small, that is, some of them must be in the IML as indicated by relocated events (below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermediate-depth events (depth, 70 km) from the Engdahlvan der HilstBuland (EHB) bulletins (33), which have been relocated using depth phases, are all in the IML (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S5; with only one exception in the northern TP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some selected events, which we refer as high-quality events, have been carefully relocated using waveforms that are listed in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 and 34, including three that must be from the mantle according to waveform characteristics (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermediate-depth high-quality events (depth, 70 km) are located exclusively in the fast regions in southeast Tibet (Himalaya and the southern TP) and northwest Tibet (the western Kunlun) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus conclude that at least some of intermediate-depth events in Himalaya, south Tibet, and western Kunlun are in the mantle and that these mantle earthquakes are associated with the cold (fast) parts of the subducted IML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low occurrence of intermediate-depth earthquakes along the three tears, particularly the seismicity gap under the YGR (T1), is consistent with the IML having been weakened by a lithospheric tear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-quality intermediate-depth events in southeast and northwest Tibet have focal mechanisms consistent with eastwest extension, similar to active extension and faulting at the shallow crust throughout the southern and central Tibet (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation has been used to argue against the Indian subduction as the cause of the intermediate-depth earthquakes (21); however, the tearing of the IML would be consistent with the significant normal faulting component of the intermediate-depth events under the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crustal seismicity and surface deformation also show a regular pattern that correlates well with the inferred fragmented IML (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3), which seems to suggest strong coupling between the mantle lithosphere and crustal and surface deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The focal mechanisms in the southern and central TP are dominated by normal and strike-slipping faulting and so are the intermediate-depth earthquakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of earthquakes in the upper crust or in the lower crust shows patches of most active seismicity (SI Appendix, Fig S9) that coincide with fast mantle velocity blocks (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most seismicity (at the upper crust, lower crust, or the mantle) is separated by three noticeable gaps that coincide with the P and S low-velocity bands in mantle lid (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most striking example is in the vicinity of the YGR, which shows low seismicity at all depths and low velocities in the mantle and midcrust (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A most recent strain rate calculation with good GPS station coverage in southern Tibet (36) displayed a very clear pattern of four strong localized compression segments along the collisional front when little smoothing was used (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four contours of strongest compression (with the largest dilatational strains less than 50 nanostrain/y) fall in the four segments outlined by the high mantle lithosphere velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates strong coupling of the IML and the shallow crust, producing the stronger localized compression at the collisional front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in the bands where there are tears and perhaps local upwelling in the tears, the subduction would exert considerably weaker mechanical coupling, resulting in a weaker compression at the collisional front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Conceptual_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The several different types of geophysical observations above (mantle P and S velocities, SKS splitting, mantle and crustal seismicity, focal mechanisms, and surface strain rate) seem to point to a consistent picture (Fig 4) that the IML has been torn into four main segments (S1 to S4) with three main tears (T1 to T3) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6) and that the geometry of the subducted IML is likely to exert strong influence on the mantle flow of the TP as well as the deformation of the entire crust of the southern and central TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevated topography in the TP alone may not have sufficient gravitational potential energy to produce eastwest extension under the influence of compressive stresses at the convergence boundary (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid rise of the TP from the convective removal of the thickened mantle lithosphere may produce sufficient eastwest extension to replace the northsouth compression as the dominant feature of the TP (38), which may explain the rifting and normal faulting in the northern and central TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, much of the IML in the southern and part of the central TP has remained (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the IML tearing may be the main cause of the crustal extension, rifting, and melting in the south-central TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frontier of the IML may have met different resistance along the strike, advancing shorter distance and at a steeper angle in the middle due to stronger Lhasa block (39, 40) and further at a shallow dip in the east and in the west.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterogeneous resistance and advancement caused the IML to tear, which caused extension in the coupled crust and lithosphere (41) and multiple rifts in brittle upper crust but might not involve asthenosphere upwelling at greater depths (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lithosphere tearing or weakening is not uniform, with T1 much more prominent than T2 and T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lithospheric tears (weak zones) do not have one-to-one correspondence with surface rifts as the heterogeneous upper crust responds to stress field from the mantle lithosphere, convergent boundary, and surface loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lithosphere tearing may be facilitated by preexisting weak zones of the Indian plate that are deep-seated to at least lower crust (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, gravity data traced three Indian basement ridges (MungerSaharsa ridge, Faizabad ridge, and DelhiHardwar ridge from east to west) to the vicinities of T1T3, respectively, underneath the Himalayas and the southern Tibet (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large earthquakes of the past millennium (43) were found within segments of the Himalayan collision zone, which did not propagate across the segment boundaries of the inherited structure of the Indian plate (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the deep-seated weak zones and the segmentations of the present-day strain at surface (Fig 3) and the lithosphere structure at depth (this study), we concur with the recent proposal (44) that the lateral extent of potential megathrust earthquakes may be limited by the segment boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model of IML tearing is consistent with other geological and geochemical observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical arguments on the large rift spacing in the TP suggest that that eastwest extension must have involved mantle lithosphere (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model can explain asynchronous volcanism that preceded the initiation of rifts in southern Tibet (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also consistent with a mantle source of the observed ultrapotassic adakites in southern Tibet (46) and a large area of the negative aeromagnetic anomaly (47) in the central segments, presumably a result of demagnetization from mantle heat flow (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
