Leucokinin mimetic elicits aversive behavior in mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) and inhibits the sugar taste neuron  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kinin receptors are known in insects to contribute to osmotic regulation and are expressed in the excretory system, in the Malpighian tubules (renal organs), and in hindgut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are important vectors of human disease, a kinin receptor is also expressed within taste hairs (sensilla) on the legs and mouthparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A kinin analog engineered to be peptidase resistant activates this kinin receptor with high potency, inhibiting sucrose taste detection directly at the level of the taste organs and eliciting a fast and highly aversive response in females during feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that mosquito G protein-coupled receptors could be new targets for discovering compounds to deter mosquitoes and preventing them from feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insect kinins (leucokinins) are multifunctional peptides acting as neurohormones and neurotransmitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In females of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti (L.), aedeskinins are known to stimulate fluid secretion from the renal organs (Malpighian tubules) and hindgut contractions by activating a G protein-coupled kinin receptor designated Aedae-KR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used protease-resistant kinin analogs 1728, 1729, and 1460 to evaluate their effects on sucrose perception and feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In no-choice feeding bioassays (capillary feeder and plate assays), the analog 1728, which contains -amino isobutyric acid, inhibited females from feeding on sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It further induced quick fly-away or walk-away behavior following contact with the tarsi and the mouthparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrophysiological recordings from single long labellar sensilla of the proboscis demonstrated that mixing the analog 1728 at 1 mM with sucrose almost completely inhibited the detection of sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aedae-KR was immunolocalized in contact chemosensory neurons in prothoracic tarsi and in sensory neurons and accessory cells of long labellar sensilla in the distal labellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing Aedae-KR by RNAi significantly reduced gene expression and eliminated the feeding-aversion behavior resulting from contact with the analog 1728, thus directly implicating the Aedae-KR in the aversion response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first report that kinin analogs modulate sucrose perception in any insect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aversion to feeding elicited by analog 1728 suggests that synthetic molecules targeting the mosquito Aedae-KR in the labellum and tarsi should be investigated for the potential to discover novel feeding deterrents of mosquito vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparative structures of the three biostable insect kinin analogs: K-Aib-1 (1728) (A), K-Aib-3 (1729) (B) (12), and K-A-1 (1460) (C) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boxes highlight the unnatural portions of the peptide structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A and B, the boxes highlight the side chains of the bulky Aib residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C the box highlights the -amino acid 3Pro that replaces the Pro that normally resides at that position in many natural insect kinins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both B and C also feature an acetyl group (Ac) that caps the N terminus, located at the very left of the structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This acetyl group adds further biostability against hydrolysis by aminopeptidases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

No-Choice_Feeding_Bioassays_of_Kinin_Analogs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effects of kinin analogs (Fig S1) on mosquitoes, we exposed females to drops of a sucrose solution mixed with different concentrations of kinin analogs 1728 and 1729.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most often, females touched the diet with their proboscis and prothoracic legs simultaneously (Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With analog 1728 at a concentration of 1 mM, females that contacted the diet moved away within a few seconds by exhibiting jump-, fly-, or walk-away behavior (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an aversive response was rarely observed when females contacted the control sucrose-only solution (Fig 1 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify these behaviors, we compared the time females spent in contact with diets containing a kinin analog and with the sucrose-only solution (300 mM) during the first hour of exposure (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analog 1728 at 1 mM significantly reduced the median time spent in contact with the diet (6 s) compared with the other analog concentrations and the sucrose-only control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximal time spent in contact with analog 1728 at a concentration of 1 mM was about 2 min and was several fold longer for all other treatments (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median time spent in contact with analogs 1728 at 600 µM and 1729 at 1 mM and 600 M also was reduced compared with the time spent in contact with the control solution (94.5 s) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time females spent in contact with analog 1728 at 600 µM (41 s) did not differ from the time spent in contact with analog 1729 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the observed shorter time spent in contact with the two analogs also differentially affected ingestion, capillary feeder (CAFE) assays were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females ingested significantly less of either analog at the 1-mM concentration (Fig 2 and Fig S2) and also ingested less analog 1728 at the 600 µM concentration (Fig 2), as compared with sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because kinin analogs may stimulate diuresis during feeding, plate assays were run to determine the number of urine drops (colored blue by the addition of Evans blue to the diets) deposited in the plates and the quantity of Evans blue remaining in females 5 h after diet ingestion when provided sucrose plus one analog at a time (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females exposed to analog 1728 at 1 mM and 600 µM contained less Evans blue than females exposed to analog 1729 at similar concentrations or to the control sucrose solution (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences in Evans blue content were observed between treatments with analogs 1728 and 1729 (Fig S3 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, fewer urine drops were observed when females were exposed to analog 1728 at 1 mM and 600 µM than when females were offered control solution (S) or solution treated with analog 1729 at the same concentrations (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of urine drops excreted from females exposed to analog 1728 also was lower at 1 mM than at 600 µM (Fig S4 B and Inset I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences were found between females offered control sucrose-only solution and those treated with analog 1729 (Fig S4 B and Inset II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the median time spent in contact with diets during the first hour of exposure (Fig 1) and CAFE assays (Fig 2) indicated that females exposed to analog 1728 at 1 mM or 600 M consumed less diet than those exposed to analog 1728 at lower concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closer examination of females behavior allowed us to determine that the rejection of diets containing analog 1728 at 1 mM and 600 µM occurred most often after the female contacted the diet with the legs and proboscis simultaneously (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiological_Recordings_on_Long_Labellar_Hair_Sensilla  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if kinin analogs interfered directly with the detection of sucrose, we performed electrophysiological recordings from long labellar sensilla on the proboscis (Fig 3A and Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this preparation, extracellularly recorded spikes show an amplitude between 0.5 and 2 mV, depending on the insect and on the firing rate of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The responses to 300 mM sucrose mixed with the kinin analogs (10 µM to 1 mM of 1728, 1729, or 1460) generally showed only one class of action potentials (Fig 3B), suggesting that these analogs do not activate another taste modality (i.e., salty or bitter), at least in the sensilla tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the analogs were applied at 1 mM, a significant (*P less_than 0.05) decrease in the firing rate60, 45, and 30% for analogs 1728, 1729, and 1460, respectivelywas observed (Fig 3A) as compared with sucrose only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogs were not inhibitory when applied at 10 M, but the level of inhibition was intermediate for 1728 and 1729 applied at 100 M. Analog 1460 inhibited the sucrose response significantly only when applied at 1 mM and was less inhibitory than the other two at this concentration, with analog 1729 being intermediate in potency (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative traces obtained in response to sucrose in the absence or presence of the three analogs clearly show analog 1728 is the most potent, followed by 1729 and 1460 in that order (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinin analogs depress both the phasic and the tonic portions of the responses to sugar, and this inhibition is concentration dependent (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinin analogs thus exert their inhibition immediately after the female contacts the stimulus solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three analogs do not differ in their temporal kinetics, keeping the same rank order of potency, suggesting that they act on the same target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that the initial response to sucrose is higher than the initial number of spikes per second for analog 1728 at 100 µM (and 1 mM); this difference is not so obvious for analog 1460.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response is very rapid for analog 1728 at 1 mM and is less rapid for the other two analogs (Fig 3C, black traces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These electrophysiological results are in accordance with observations of feeding behavior (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3, and Movie S1), which indicated that analog 1728 was the most potent molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if analog 1728 had other aversive effects in addition to the inhibition of sucrose perception, we performed no-choice assays in the presence and absence of sucrose (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time spent in contact with Evans blue only (E) was shorter the time spent in contact with sucrose solution containing Evans blue (SE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we showed that Evans blue does not alter the number of spikes per second of the sucrose neuron (Fig S5C), suggesting that females perceive solution (E) to be similar to water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was no difference in the median time females spent in contact with the (E) solution or analog 1728 with Evans blue in the absence of sucrose (1728E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median time spent in contact did not differ between 1728E and 1728SE, indicating that sucrose is not perceived differentially by these two female groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the median time females spent with 1728SE was shorter than that spent with solution (E) (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that analog 1728 at 1 mM interacts strongly with the sucrose perception circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aedae-KR_Full-Length_cDNA_Cloning_from_Female_and_Male_Legs_and_Female_Labellum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aversive response to analog 1728 appeared to be specific and mediated mainly by labellar and tarsal contact (Fig 1 and Movie S1) Therefore, to investigate Aedae-KR expression in these appendages, full-length cDNAs were cloned from the labellum and legs of females and from the legs of males (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aedae-KR predicted amino acid sequences obtained were similar to the receptor cloned from the Malpighian tubule (AAT95982) (9), and the region selected for antibody production (residues 328345; NEKFKREFHKRYPFRGRN) (Fig S7) also was identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, transcript expression of Aedae-KR was confirmed in appendages, validating the use of the previously reported antibody to localize the receptor (5, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunolocalization_of_Aedae-KR_and_Identification_of_Aedae-KR_Sensilla  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify Aedae-KR protein expression, immunohistochemistry was performed in frozen sections of labellum (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9) and tarsi (Fig 5 and Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labellum is shown in Fig 4A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8A and S9U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor signal (red) was observed in dendrites of sensory neurons extending to the tip of the long labellar hairs (Fig 4) and in accessory cells present at the base of long labellar sensilla (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9), but the signal was detected only in accessory cells of short papillae (Fig 4 and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Receptor signal was not observed at the base of hairs in the labellar proximal segment (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No signal was observed in tissues incubated with antigen-preabsorbed antibodies (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9) or preimmune serum (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Aedae-KR was immunolocalized in prothoracic tarsal sensory neurons in the second and third tarsomeres (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both tarsomeres exhibited a number of immunoreactive neurons along their proximaldistal axis; these neurons have somas that are strongly labeled by the antiAedae-KR antibody (anti-KR) and are close to the cuticle (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aedae-KR sensory neurons in tarsi appear to extend their dendrites (Fig 5 B, III-2) into sensilla trichodea (Fig 5 B, III-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative control tarsal tissues, incubated with either antigen preabsorbed antibodies (Fig S10 AC) or preimmune serum (Fig S10 DF) did not show any receptor signal, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_Aedae-KR_Gene_Silencing_on_Feeding_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene silencing was performed to confirm that the mosquitoes aversive behavior to the 1728 analog was mediated by the kinin receptor function in peripheral organs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days postinjection of dsRNA, Aedae-KR expression was significantly reduced by 52% compared with control dsGFP-injected mosquitoes (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In no-choice feeding assays with kinin analogs, control dsGFP females demonstrated aversive behavior to kinin analog 1728 at 1 mM (Fig 6B), similar to that observed in naive 1728-challenged females (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, KR-silenced females no longer displayed the aversive behavior while probing and touching diets containing analog 1728 at a concentration of 1 mM (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the median time those silenced females spent in contact with the diet containing 1-mM analog 1728 (71 s) was similar to the time silenced females spent in contact with the sucrose solution (80 s) (Fig 6C), suggesting that the KR is directly responsible for the aversion phenotype of the 1728 analog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, KR-silenced females exposed to analog 1729 at 1 mM did not display significant differences from those exposed to sucrose solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no significant differences were found for the dsGFP females, a trend toward shorter time in contact with analog 1729 was observed for the dsGFP-silenced females (1729: 101.5 s vs. S: 129 s) (Fig S11), as we had observed previously (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we clearly show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the gustatory detection of sugars is modulated by a neuropeptide directly at the level of peripheral sensory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that kinin analogs interact with G protein-coupled receptors expressed within gustatory sensilla similar to the way that peripheral olfactory neurons are modulated by tachykinin (16, 17) and neuropeptide F (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peptides bind to GPCRs in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) or in circuits that modulate chemosensory signal-dependent feeding behaviors and food search (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence that neuropeptide GPCRs are expressed in taste peripheral neurons and that activating these GPCRs with kinin analogs changes the sensitivity of these neurons to sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most mechanistic studies on insect kinins have been conducted with dipterans, Drosophila melanogaster and mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila kinin is named drosokinin or leucokinin (lk) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three pairs of lk subesophageal neurons (SELKs) receive projections from gustatory receptor neurons in the head (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral drosokinin expression was found in sensory cells associated with tarsal sensilla (bristle sensilla) and in labellum by monitoring GFP expression driven by an lk-specific GAL4 line (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic flies in which drosokinin release was blocked from the brain lateral horn (LHLK) and SELKs had altered olfactory and gustatory responses, respectively (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports have questioned the significance of the lk system in taste perception in legs and labellum (25), based on the lack of GFP in mouthparts and legs in driver lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP-expressing cells shown by de Haro et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23) did not have the appearance of sensory neurons, and mutant flies did not display defects in the gustatory detection of sucrose (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the significance of the kinin signaling system in peripheral taste sensory function in Drosophila is still controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no information about the peripheral functions of kinin neurotransmission in mosquitoes or about behavioral responses to altered kinin signaling in putative leucokinin or leucokinin-responsive sensory cells in labellum and legs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we exposed mosquitoes to sucrose solutions containing potent and biostable insect kinin analogs that are lethal to aphids and that are active on the recombinant Aedae-KR (12, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Floral nectar, which is fed upon by diurnal mosquitoes such as A. aegypti, contains 55% sucrose, and both sexes prefer disaccharides, sucrose and trehalose, over monosaccharides (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most individuals accept a sucrose-only diet, we used a sucrose solution as a driver for providing the kinin analogs (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We discovered a previously unidentified function of the kinin-signaling system in mosquitoes in the rapid aversive response to the tasting/feeding of sucrose containing a kinin agonist, 1728, in 300 mM sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinin analog 1728 contains pentapeptide kinin core residues (Phe-X1-X2-Trp-Gly-NH2) identical to those of drosokinin (22), further supporting the role of insect kinins in chemosensory responses for taste perception of sugars, similar to that reported for trehalose in adult Drosophila (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before feeding, females normally touched diets with their labellum and tarsi but quickly avoided the agonist 1728 at 1 mM by flying, jumping, or walking away (Fig 1 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from CAFE assays corroborated the observations that females significantly rejected this diet and also ate less diet with analog 1728 at 600 µM (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This aversion also was reflected in plate assays showing that at these concentrations females retained less Evans blue (Fig S3 A and B) and deposited fewer urine drops (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for analog 1729 at 1 mM in CAFE assays, but in plate assays the differences among analog concentrations in remaining Evans blue (Fig S3 A and Inset II) and in the number of urine drops deposited (Fig S4 B and Inset II) were not detected after 5 h. We then investigated if the aversive response to 1728 was correlated to the expression of the Aedae-KR in chemosensory appendages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aedae-KR immunostaining observed in the distal labellum (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9) coincides with dendrites of sensory neurons in the long labellar sensilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These A. aegypti labellar hairs, from which recordings were also obtained (Fig 3A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5A, S8A, and S9A), are identical to the long labellar sensilla described in A. aegypti (28, 29) and are similar to the long labellar sensilla (trichoid) of Anopheles gambiae (30) and Culiseta inornata (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessory cells surrounding sensory neurons immunostained for the Aedae-KR could be the trichogen or tormogen (30, 33), because these cells are believed to secrete the dendrite bathing fluid (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aedae-KR staining at the sensilla base is reminiscent of accessory cells associated with sensory neurons in the proboscis of Anopheles stephensi, a mosquito vector of malaria (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that the Aedae-KR is expressed in sensory neurons associated with sensilla (Fig 3 B, III-3) in the tarsi, where it was associated with tarsal sensilla trichodea (Fig 3 B, III-2 and III-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the receptor is present in neurons housed by other types of sensilla (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aedae-KR transcript expression and receptor localization in tarsi and in the distal segment of the labellum strongly linked the observation of the shorter time females spent in contact with diet containing analog 1728 in feeding assays to the specific action of the kinin analog on the Aedae-KR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed single-sensilla recordings of long labellar sensilla in which the receptor was immunolocalized (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because A. aegypti prefer sucrose solutions of 100 mM or higher, a 300-mM sucrose solution was chosen for assays (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrophysiological recordings on the long labellar sensillum of female A. gambiae showed that responses of the sucrose receptor cell reached a plateau at sucrose concentrations of 25292 mM (10% sucrose) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that kinin analogs of diverse chemical structure inhibited the firing of neurons in response to sucrose in the female labellum (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of spikes per second decreased significantly in response to all three analogs at 1-mM concentrations, although 1728 appears to be the most potent (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the observation of reduced feeding of sucrose plus analog 1728 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, using RNAi-mediated gene knockdown, we verified the fundamental role of Aedae-KR in mediating the aversive behavior resulting from contact with the 1728 analog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females with silenced Aedae-KR no longer display aversive behavior in response to the 1728 analog at 1 mM (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result strongly supports our conclusion that Aedae-KR expressed in sensory peripheral organs plays an important role in the control of feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinin analogs tested have been characterized extensively in vitro and in vivo for their activity on insect kinin receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of kinin analog structures were tested, the first containing -amino isobutyric acid (Aib) (analogs 1728 and 1729) and the second containing 3Pro (analog 1460) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All activate recombinant mosquito and tick kinin receptors in CHO-K1 cells, with 1728 being the most potent on the Aedae-KR (EC50, 76 nM), followed by 1460 (EC50, 367 nM) and 1729 (EC50, 625 nM) (12, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogs 1728 and 1460 (12, 26) also have potent diuretic activity in the Malpighian tubules of A. aegypti in vitro (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both the Aib-containing analogs 1728 and 1729 elicit hindgut contractions in Rhodnius; 1728 is more potent (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural modifications of insect kinins, such as the incorporation of Aib and -amino acids with an additional methylene group (-CH2-), render these peptides biostable, because they are protease resistant (8, 1012, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hypothesis is that the potent analog 1728 enters the labellar and tarsal sensilla (30) and diffuses through the aqueous sensillum lymph to activate the Aedae-KR expressed in sucrose taste neurons, thereby decreasing sucrose taste perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not certain why analog 1728 elicits fast walk-, fly-, or jump-away behaviors (Movie S1) that are not observed for either analog 1729 or 1460, which also inhibit the sucrose response, although with less potency (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that analog 1728 may stabilize the Aedae-KR in a specific conformation by homologous functional selectivity (biased agonism) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that aedeskinins hyperpolarize the basolateral membrane voltage by increasing the chloride conductance of Malpighian tubule cells in A. aegypti (8, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple speculative explanation is that, acting via the Aedae-KR, analog 1728 changes the chloride concentration in the sensillum lymph, thus affecting the chloride channels involved in the repolarization of gustatory neurons and making the sucrose receptor cells insensitive (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a lack of knowledge regarding chemosensory reception in mosquito leg sensilla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of the Aedae-KR in sensilla trichodea is supported by earlier studies showing that tarsal sensilla trichodea are involved in mosquito gustatory behaviors associated with sugar (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila the mapping of taste sensilla in tarsomeres revealed specific sensilla in tarsomeres 52 that detect sugars (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a detailed map does not exist for any mosquito species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work contributes to the understanding of taste in mosquitoes by providing a receptor marker for a subpopulation of sensory cells in tarsi that can be pharmacologically manipulated and now can be explored further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results pertaining to Aedae-KR peripheral function may extend the current knowledge about the modulation of ORNs by GPCRs in olfactory systems (discussed above) to those of chemosensory neural networks in taste organs such as labellum and legs, for which less information is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our pharmacological manipulation of the Aedae-KR by an externally applied synthetic molecule provides proof of principle for the search of environmental deterrents (or repellents) modulating GPCRs in peripheral sensory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, it demonstrates that these analogs are valuable tools for investigating how peripheral chemosensory systems define insect behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mosquitoes the leucokinin system in peripheral organs appears to be involved in a behavioral avoidance mechanism in the context of sucrose feeding, in addition to its known role in the hormonal control of water and ion homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This avoidance mechanism could be present in other pests and might be exploited for their control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Larvae of A. aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), Rockefeller strain, were reared at 26.5 °C under a 16-h light:8-h dark photoperiod in plastic trays (30 × 20 × 9 cm) with 2 L water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain mosquitoes of consistent size, each pan contained 200 larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larvae were fed with Purina One Natural Blends (Nestle Purina PetCare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pupae were kept in water in cups, which were placed in cages for adult emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults were fed using cotton wicks soaked in a 10% sugar solution (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Females used for electrophysiology were a kind gift from Louis Lambrechts (Institut Pasteur, Paris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electrophysiological experiments, 3- to 5-d-old females were anesthetized by being placed on ice for 12 min and then were immobilized sideways on putty (UHU patafix) using fine strips of tape placed over the body and the mouthparts to expose the 30- to 35-m-long sensilla present at the tip of the proboscis, as in A. gambiae (Fig S5A) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were obtained from dorsal and ventral long labellar hairs nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39, as mapped by Hill and Smith (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insect was grounded using a drop of electrocardiogram gel placed on the abdomen and was connected to a grounded silver wire (0.15 mm in diameter) (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To stimulate individual taste sensilla, each sensillum was covered in turn by a capillary electrode (tip diameter 10 µm) (Fig S5A) filled with the chemical to be tested and 30 mM tricholine citrate (TCC) (Sigma-Aldrich) in distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCC acts as an electrolyte and inhibits the activity of the water cells (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed no significant response to this control solution (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because pilot experiments showed that Evans blue was inactive (Fig S5C), we tested kinin analogs alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulus electrode was brought into contact with the sensillum for 2 s under visual control (Leica MZ12) with a micromanipulator (NMN-25; Narishige).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capillary touching the tip of a taste sensillum established an electrical contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal was recorded through a nonblocking taste preamplifier (Tasteprobe DTP-02; Syntech) (48) connected to an amplifier (CyberAmp 320; Axon Instruments), where the signal was amplified further (1001,000×) and filtered (eighth order Bessel filter, 102,800 Hz), digitized (16 bits, 10 kHz: A/D card DT9803; Data Translation), and stored on a disk for further analysis using a custom program (dbWave) (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of action potentials in each recording was detected using a variable threshold adjusted over the digitally filtered recording (using a running median computed over 30 points on each side) and was exported to Excel for further analysis either as the number of spikes per second or by 100-ms bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mRNA_Isolation_and_Cloning_of_Aedae-KR_from_Labellum_and_Legs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Labella were dissected from 3- to 5-d-old NBF females (n = 210).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen, total RNA was isolated following the protocol of the NucleoSpin RNA manufacturer (MachereyNagel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA (0.1 µg) was used to synthesize 3 RACE cDNA with the SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the full-length ORF cDNA of Aedae-KR from labellum, a PCR amplification was performed using the RACE cDNA with the primers Aedaekinin5UTR0 and Aedaekinin3UTR1 (see Table S1 for the primers used in this section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR program was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 59 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three pairs of legs from 3- to 5-d-old female (n = 50) and male (n = 50) mosquitoes were dissected, and mRNA was isolated following the protocol given in the Dynabeads mRNA Direct Kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the addition of lysate buffer (250 µL) the legs were ground in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After mRNA elution, single-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (200 U/µL) (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloning strategy to obtain the full-length cDNA from legs involved obtaining three PCR products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All PCR products were cloned in a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and were sequenced at the Gene Technologies Laboratory of Texas A&M University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the ORF of Aedae-KR after the seventh transmembrane region (TM#7) was amplified from these cDNA templates with AedaekininF2 and AedaekininR2 primers designed within the predicted ORF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplifications were performed with 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 59 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A product of the expected size (393 bp) was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, RACE cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from female legs using the SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the 3 UTR and 5 UTR sequences of Aedae-KR, a first amplification was performed using the RACE cDNAs with universal primer mix (adaptor primer) and AedaekininF2 and AedaekininR2 primers for the 3 and 5 UTRs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplified PCR products were diluted (1:25) and used for a nested amplification with universal nest primer mix and AedaekininF3 for the 3 UTR (the product obtained was 917 bp) and AedaekininR3 for the 5 UTR (the product obtained was 1,861 bp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions for both amplifications were 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 61 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the ORF cDNA of Aedae-KR from legs in a single PCR product, either RACE cDNA from female legs or regular cDNA from male legs was amplified with the primers Aedaekinin5UTR and Aedaekinin3UTR0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 59 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diluted PCR products (1:25) were used for a nested amplification with primers Aedaekinin5UTR0 and Aedaekinin3UTR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 54 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORF was 1,789 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Frozen-Section_Immunohistochemistry_of_Aedae-KR_in_Labellum_and_Prothoracic_Tarsi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation of the antiAedae-KR antibody (anti-KR-Ct328-345, NEKFKREFHKRYPF RGRN) (5) and immunostaining procedures were performed as described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50 and 51, with modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labellum and prothoracic tarsi were removed from 3- to 5-d-old NBF females (n = 230) and were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being washed in PBS at room temperature, the tissues were infiltrated with 12% sucrose in PBST for 8 h and for an additional 8 h with 25% sucrose in PBST (both steps at 4 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then were embedded in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compound (Ted Pella) at room temperature for 10 min and were placed immediately inside the cryostat at 20 °C for at least 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sections (14 µm) were cut at 20 °C with a Leica Cryostat (Leica Microsystems) and were collected with a small brush on ColorFrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections on slides were dried at 37 °C for 24 h and were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBST for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing for 3 × 5 min in PBST, the sections were incubated with blocking solution (PBST, 5% normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were incubated with either antiKR-Ct328345 (1:10 in blocking solution, 115 µg IgG/mL) or antiKR-Ct328345 preabsorbed antibody or preimmune serum (1:2,000) at 4 °C, overnight (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preabsorbed antibody was prepared in blocking solution with 500 µg kinin C-terminal peptide (amino acid residues 328345 in the receptor sequence; see above) per 40 µg antibody (1,000 molar excess).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-AffiniPure goat anti-HRP antibody (3 µg IgG/mL; 1:500 in blocking solution) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 4 °C, overnight (in coincubation with primary antibody) (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing for 4 × 20 min in PBST, the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (8.5 µg/mL; 1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were washed 4 × 20 min in PBST, incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 and streptavidin (10 µg IgG/mL; 1:200) (Invitrogen) in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h, and then washed 6 × 30 min in PBST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector), and images were obtained with either a Carl Zeiss Axio Imager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) or an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc.) at the Microscopy and Imaging Center at Texas A&M University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Feeding bioassays were performed in three independent replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time spent in contact with kinin analogs 1728 or 1729 at 1 mM and at 600 µM or sucrose solution was analyzed by a nonparametric one-way ANOVA (Fig 1) with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment effect on the volume of Evans blue remaining per female was analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (SPSS, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially all data were analyzed by the univariate general linear model (GLM) considering analogs (1728 and 1729) and concentrations of analogs (11,000 µM) as independent variables (factors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently we analyzed these data by one-way ANOVAs, followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, for treatment effects, the two analogs 1728 and 1729 and sucrose solution treatments were compared when analogs were given at the same concentration (independent ANOVAs from Fig S3 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, data for different concentrations of the same treatment (within-treatment concentration comparisons for analogs 1728 and 1729 and to sucrose) were compared by running two independent ANOVAs (Fig S3, Insets I and II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment effect on the number of deposited urine drops after 5 h (Fig S4) was analyzed by a nonparametric one-way ANOVA followed by the KruskalWallis ranks test (GraphPad Prism 5.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analyses of electrophysiological recordings from long labellar sensilla (Fig 3A), repeated-measures analysis of data (the number of spikes during the first second of 2-s recordings) was performed using the PROC GLMM TukeyKramer test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed by SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
