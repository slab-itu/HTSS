How learning shapes the empathic brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deficits in empathy for out-group members are pervasive, with negative societal impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore important to ascertain whether empathy toward out-groups can be learned and how learning experiences change empathy-related brain responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a learning intervention during which participants experienced help from a member of their own social group or of a generally depreciated out-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the intervention successfully increased empathy-related brain responses toward the out-group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in out-group empathy were triggered by the learning signal (prediction error) elicited during the first two positive out-group experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results show that classical learning signals update empathic brain responses and that surprisingly few positive experiences with an out-group member are sufficient to increase out-group empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deficits in empathy enhance conflicts and human suffering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is crucial to understand how empathy can be learned and how learning experiences shape empathy-related processes in the human brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a model of empathy deficits, we used the well-established suppression of empathy-related brain responses for the suffering of out-groups and tested whether and how out-group empathy is boosted by a learning intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this intervention, participants received costly help equally often from an out-group member (experimental group) or an in-group member (control group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that receiving help from an out-group member elicits a classical learning signal (prediction error) in the anterior insular cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal in turn predicts a subsequent increase of empathy for a different out-group member (generalization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement of empathy-related insula responses by the neural prediction error signal was mediated by an establishment of positive emotions toward the out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that surprisingly few positive learning experiences are sufficient to increase empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results specify the neural and psychological mechanisms through which learning interacts with empathy, and thus provide a neurobiological account for the plasticity of empathic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rationale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study consisted of three parts, a preintervention part, a learning intervention, and a postintervention part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the interaction between learning and empathy, we exploited an ecologically valid intergroup conflict in our country (Switzerland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During all three parts of the study, the Swiss participants were paired with individuals of Swiss descent (in-group members) and individuals of Balkan descent (out-group members).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter form a large minority in Switzerland whose presence is often portrayed as problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The learning intervention was based on the principles of negative reinforcement, i.e., learning that arises from the absence of an expected negative outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The participant expected to receive painful shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, he knew that one of the other individuals in the scanner room could give up money to save him from pain (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The name of the potential helper was revealed just before the intervention started, and was a typical Balkan name in the experimental, and a typical Swiss name in the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from these differences in names, the intervention was identical in both treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure empathy, we assessed participants brain responses while they were observing pain in the in-group and in the out-group member, which is a well-established procedure for assessing neural activation related to empathy for pain (9, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pain stimulation on the back of the in-group or out-group members hand was indicated by visual cues (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, before and after the intervention, the in-group and the out-group members were represented by different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This setup allowed us to test whether and how the learning intervention affects the neural response to in-group and out-group pain and whether its potential impact generalizes to other individuals who were not present during the intervention but were members of the same respective groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that expectations concerning out-group members are typically more negative than those concerning in-group members (22), receiving help from an out-group member is an unexpected positive outcome that should elicit a strong positive prediction error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, then the participants of the experimental group should arguably use the prediction errors to establish positive associations with their out-group helper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in out-group positivity should in turn increase empathy for the suffering of out-group members (12), reflected by an increase of activation in empathy-related brain regions such as the AI (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the participants of the control group are likely to expect help from the in-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even though the control group is saved from pain exactly as often as the experimental group, we predicted less learning and no significant change in empathy in the control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the analyses of behavioral data, we focused on in-group vs. out-group differences in impression ratings and emotion ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impression ratings (9) (Supporting Information) served as a manipulation check for the group manipulation and were collected before scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants had significantly more positive impressions of the in-group members, compared with the out-group members [F(1,36) = 12.5, P = 0.001; experimental group, t(1,19) = 2.6, P = 0.018; control group, t(1,17) = 2.5, P = 0.02].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emotion ratings served to determine whether the learning intervention had established positive out-group associations and were collected at the end of each intervention trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a linear regression model to compare learning-related changes in emotion ratings in the experimental vs. the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for potential differences between early and late learning stages (25, 26), we also compared the effects in the first (trials 110) and the second half (trials 1120) of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emotions toward the out-group member (experimental group) became more positive than those toward the in-group member (control group), in particular in the first half of the intervention [Treatment (experimental/control group) × Trial (trials 120) × Half (first/second half), T = 2.1, P = 0.03; Treatment × Trial interaction, first half, T = 1.95, P = 0.05 (Fig S1), second half, T = 1.29, P = 0.2 (Table S1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that in the experimental group, the learning intervention established positive associations toward the out-group member, with particularly strong effects in the first half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we tested whether the establishment of positive out-group associations in the experimental group had an impact on empathy-related brain responses after the intervention compared with before the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous studies (79), we assumed that potential learning effects on out-group empathy should modulate the neural response in the AI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this assumption, we analyzed our data in bilateral anatomical masks of the insular cortex (27), using small-volume familywise error (SV FWE) correction (see Tables S2S7 for whole-brain results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the intervention, participants brain responses in the left AI were stronger when they saw the in-group member compared with the out-group member in pain (experimental group, T = 6.16, Z = 4.14, SV FWE-corrected; control group, T = 5.71, Z = 3.9, SV FWE-corrected) (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming previous results (79), these findings show an out-group deficit in the AI when comparing observed in-group to out-group pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether the learning intervention counteracted this out-group deficit, we calculated Group (in-group/out-group) × Time (preintervention/postintervention) interactions for each participant and compared the average interaction contrasts between the experimental and the control group, using a two-sample t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this approach is testing a three-way interaction between Group (in-group/out-group), Time (preintervention/postintervention), and Treatment (experimental group/control group), while providing information about the direction of the effect at the same time (experimental group greater than control group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main result was a significant intervention effect in bilateral AI, which was more substantial in the left hemisphere (T = 4.72, Z = 4.13, SV FWE-corrected) (Fig 2A and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In follow-up analyses, we tested for a Group (in-group/out-group) × Time (preintervention/postintervention) interaction, for the experimental and the control group separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experimental group, we again found activation in the left AI (T = 4.41, Z = 4.15, SV FWE-corrected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the control group, the interaction revealed no significant activations, even at a relaxed threshold of P less_than 0.05, uncorrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the intervention effect in AI cortex is based on pre-to-post increases in AI activation in the experimental, but not in the control group (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, AI activation increased primarily for out-group members in pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was evidenced by a significant difference in the out-group post vs. pre contrast between the experimental group and control group in left AI (T = 4.25, Z = 3.8, SV FWE-corrected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference between the groups with regard to the in-group conditions (in-group post vs. pre), even at P less_than 0.05 uncorrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate a significant intervention effect in left AI, which reflects an increase in the experimental group participants neural response to the out-group members pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, the neural response in the left AI region, which changed in response to the intervention, correlated with self-reported empathy, that is, the individual ratings on the Empathic Concern Scale (28), which we collected after scanning [r (38) = 0.39, P = 0.015] (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding confirms that the observed neural effects in this region are related to empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After establishing the success of our intervention, we investigated the mechanisms underlying it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted that positive experiences, i.e., receiving help would elicit positive prediction errors, in particular in the case of an out-group helper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed the individual prediction errors based on a modified version of a reinforcement learning model (19), which allowed us to model learning as a function of individual prior expectations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impression ratings reported above indicate that participants entered the learning intervention with more positive expectations toward the in-group compared with the out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture the individual variability in expectations, our model included each participants impression ratings for the out-group members (experimental group) and the in-group members (control group) as starting predictions for subsequent prediction error estimation (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach extends classical prediction error models in which learning starts from a starting prediction of zero (the assumption being that participants have neutral prior expectations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we identified brain regions that track individual prediction errors by regressing neural activity elicited by the decisions of the potential helper (out-group member in the experimental group and in-group member in the control group) against trial-by-trial estimates of prediction errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed activation in the AI (Fig 3A, red), which was more substantial in the right AI (T = 4.56, Z = 4.01, SV FWE-corrected) (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we tested whether the individual prediction error signal in right AI predicted the pre-to-post changes in empathy, that is, the neural intervention effect shown in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each individual, we extracted the prediction error-related beta values from right AI and regressed them against the individual magnitude of the intervention effect, as reflected by the Group (in-group/out-group) × Time (preintervention/postintervention) interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed significant activation in left AI (T = 5.28, Z = 4.52, SV FWE-corrected) (Fig 3B, red, and Table S5), which overlapped with the observed intervention effect (Fig 3B, orange; Fig 2A for comparison).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that the change in empathy after compared with before the intervention is linked to the magnitude of the learning signal during the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, we assumed that the prediction error signal affects empathy-related brain responses via the establishment of positive associations with the out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the direct impact of the prediction error signal on the intervention effects should be mediated by the learning-related increase in positivity toward the helper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified brain signals that were related to a learning-related increase in positivity by correlating the trial-by-trial emotion ratings with the neural response when the helpers decision was revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed significant activation in right AI (T = 4.7, Z = 4.1, SV FWE-corrected) (Fig 3A, yellow, and Table S6), which overlapped with the prediction error signal (Fig 3A, orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bootstrapped mediation analyses (29) were then conducted to examine whether the neural change in positivity mediated the effect of the neural prediction error signal on the empathy intervention effect (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed a significant indirect path from the prediction error signal, via the neural increase in positivity, to the neural intervention effect (B = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = [0.157.9]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, after controlling for the indirect path, the significant correlation between the prediction error signal and the intervention effect (c) became nonsignificant (Fig 3C, comparison between c and c), reflecting full mediation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results corroborate the hypothesis that positive prediction errors drive pre-to-post changes in empathy as mediated by the establishment of positive emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In real life, the number of positive interactions with an out-group member is likely to be small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore of practical importance to investigate the minimal number of positive out-group experiences that is necessary to predict increases in out-group empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, we have shown that a successful intervention effect is obtained after 15 positive out-group experiences, but it would be useful to know whether a smaller number of positive learning experiences with the out-group is sufficient to increase out-group empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore which phase of the learning intervention is most effective, we divided the entire period in quarters of equal length (trials 15, 610, 1115, 1620) and extracted the respective prediction error-related activity from right AI (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 for a similar approach).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested the predictive relation between each of these four intervention phases on the individual intervention effect in left AI activation (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the initial five intervention trials alone accounted for 62.5% of the variance in the intervention effect, which yielded a significant model [F(1,19) = 11.5, P = 0.003].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prediction error-related activity during the initial five learning trials remained the best predictor even when all of the other predictors were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, none of the other three predictors contributed significantly to explaining individual variance in the intervention effect (Table 1) (model 2, R2 change = 0; model 3, R2 change = 0.017; model 4, R2 change = 0.023).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial five intervention trials contained an average of four positive learning experiences (mean = 3.8, SD = 0.91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further specify the number of positive experiences required to predict the individual intervention effects, we extracted the right AI prediction error signal related to the first, second, third, and fourth positive learning experience and assessed their relationship with the individual intervention effect in separate regression analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each regression, the number of negative experiences (i.e., when the participant did not receive help) that preceded the individual number of positive experiences was included as a control variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the individual magnitude of the intervention effect is predicted after only one to two positive learning experiences with the out-group member [first positive experience, B = 3.04, T = 2.43, P[false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected] = 0.053; second positive experience, B = 4.4, T = 2.9, P(FDR-corrected) = 0.038].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the prediction error signals elicited by three and four positive experiences no longer predicted the intervention effect [three positive experiences, B = 2.6, T = 1.06, P(FDR-corrected) = 0.4; four positive experiences, B = 0.36, T = 0.12, P(FDR-corrected) = 0.9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings show that empathy with an out-group member can be learned and generalizes to other out-group individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This learning is driven by classical prediction errors, whose impact on empathy signals is mediated by an increase in positivity toward the out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study provides a mechanistic account of how positive contacts with the out-group can counteract empathy deficits (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reductions in out-group deficits were predictable after surprisingly few (two) positive experiences with an out-group individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact number of experiences should be taken with a grain of salt, it is unlikely that these findings reflect noise, for example induced by a specific constellation of helping and nonhelping trials in the beginning of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, an analysis that was based on the full dataset (and therefore less prone to noise) independently identified the strongest learning effects in the first five trials (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a detailed trial-by-trial analysis revealed that the average ratio of helping to nonhelping trials within the first two trials was not different from that ratio in later phases of the learning intervention, indicating that volatility does not change in early compared with late phases of the experiment (SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, prediction error signals during the first two intervention trials were similar, irrespective of whether participants had experienced no or some nonhelping trials (SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, in the analysis that revealed a predictive relation between the AI activity between the first two helping trials and subsequent empathy change, we controlled for the number of nonhelping trials experienced by each subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
So far, efficient learning based on a very few events has mainly been shown in the domain of punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in animals, aversive reactions can be learned based on a single aversive event (31, 32), and humans require only two to three negative experiences (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Going beyond this work, our findings show that people can learn very efficiently from positive social experiences that prevent them from harm, and that this type of learning has a strong impact on complex internal states, such as empathy for a person in pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we provide insights into the efficiency of negative reinforcement learning in humans and its potential to serve as an intervention to counteract deficits in out-group empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, we found that the learning experience, which was initiated by one representative of the out-group, resulted in an increase in empathy for another representative of the out-group who was in pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generalization of the learning effect is important, because it shows the robustness of the learning intervention and its potential relevance for society (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex experimental setup (including cover story and confederates) did not allow for repeating the empathy measure for a second time to test for long-term effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has been shown that negative reinforcement can induce robust and long-lasting learning effects, for example in therapeutic settings (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the light of such results, it is conceivable that learning interventions like ours might elicit lasting intervention effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results reveal how learning underpins the dynamics of empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpected positive outcomes resulting from help of another person elicit prediction error signals, that is, signals that resemble the ones known to drive reinforcement learning in the monkey brain (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that basic learning mechanisms are also used during complex social learning, which is in line with previous studies (13, 3538).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Going further, our findings show how classical learning mechanisms shape other-regarding motivational states such as empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that learning about another person and experiencing empathy for a person in pain recruit a common neural structure, namely, the AI cortex (see Supporting Information for a discussion of lateralization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different fields of research have independently accumulated evidence for the important role of the AI in the processing of empathy (23) and the encoding of prediction errors during learning (15) (see Table S7 and SI Discussion for less significant striatal effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results integrate these two domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, during learning, the AI is involved in updating predictions about future outcomes as well as in implementing the resulting emotional states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the updated information is used to modulate the empathic reaction to another person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, an empathy-learning model would propose that empathy-related processes in AI are altered by a persons individual learning history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the empathy-learning model, empathic responses are altered by any information that elicits prediction errors and thereby results in an update of predictions about others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it makes the clear prediction that empathy learning should be the stronger, the more positive and unexpected the information revealed about another person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These predictions of the empathy-learning model provide a plausible mechanism for the effect of positive intergroup contact (10, 11) and can inspire interventions to foster empathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a conceptual level, our results uncover the neural interplay between empathy and learning, and thus provide a neurobiological mechanism for the profound plasticity of empathic reactions, which has been widely documented (39, 40), but so far not explained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing_the_Ratio_of_Nonhelping_to_Helping_Trials_Between_Treatments_Groups_and_Early_and_Late_Intervention_Phases__and_Its_Impact_on_Prediction_Error-Related_Activation_in_Right_AI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study, we used a fixed compound learning rate across participants, which is an approach that is common practice in neuroimaging research (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a fixed learning rate is particularly appropriate in low-volatility situations, where the experienced reinforcement rate (i.e., the ratio of reinforcement and nonreinforcement) is stable over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is not the case and the reinforcement rate changes at some point in time (or, relevant for our case, within a given group of individuals), prediction error models with a fixed learning rate could drift away from the actual prediction error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address this concern, we tested whether the ratio between nonhelping trials (i.e., nonreinforcement) and helping trials (i.e., reinforcement) was comparable in early and late phases of the learning intervention, and between our treatment groups (experimental and control group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first analysis, we compared the nonhelping/helping trial ratio between the first (trials 110) and the second (trials 1120) half of the intervention, and tested for differences between the experimental and the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis was particularly important for the interpretation of the emotion rating results, which showed a Trial × Half × Treatment interaction, reflecting a stronger increase in emotion ratings in the experimental group during the first half of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the nonhelping-to-helping trial ratio (nonhelping/helping) instead of the helping-to-nonhelping ratio to avoid division by zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we tested for differences in the ratio of nonhelping/helping trials in early- and late-intervention phases of the experimental group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we compared the nonhelping/helping ratio between trials 15 (bin 1), trials 610 (bin 2), trials 1115 (bin 3), and trials 1620 (bin 4), and between trials 1, 2, trials 3, 4, and trials 5, 6, of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two-trial analyses are more fine-grained and particularly relevant for the interpretation of the early learning effects in the experimental group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results showed that the reinforcement rate, i.e., the ratio between nonhelping trials and helping trials in the first and the second half of the intervention did not differ and was comparable in the experimental and the control group [Half, F(1,36) = 2.2, P = 0.15; Half × Treatment, F(1,36) = 1.1, P = 0.3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there was no difference in the ratio of nonhelping to helping trials between the early and the later phases of the intervention [nonhelping/helping trials, bin 1 vs. bin 2, t(19) = 1.6, P = 0.12; bin 1 vs. bin 3, t(19) = 0.5, P = 0.61; bin 1 vs. bin 4, t(19) = 0.9, P = 0.35.; trials 12 vs. trials 34, t(19) = 1.19, P = 0.25; trials 12 vs. trials 56, t(19) = 1, P = 0.33].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that the actually experienced learning history was stable in our study, both over time and between treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, there was no reason for the actual learning rate to drift away from the modeled fixed learning rate, and for the modeled prediction error signal to account for more variance in early than in late learning phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we assessed differences in prediction error-related activity between participants who had experienced one to two negative experiences before two positive experiences and those who had no negative experiences before two positive experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference in the prediction error-related activation in right AI between participants who had experienced no (n = 13) or one to two nonhelping trials (n = 7) before the first two positive experiences (n = 7) [t(18) = 0.25, P = 0.8], suggesting that our findings are not due to context differences but reflect genuine learning effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_Individual_Prediction_Errors_Based_on_Emotion_Ratings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study, it was important to assess whether few learning experiences can change emotions toward the out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the learning intervention was short (20 trials only), and we assessed emotion ratings instead of a typical behavioral learning measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design served the purpose of our study but was not optimized for estimating individual learning rates from behavior with a classical approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We nevertheless validated the assumed learning rate using the observed emotion ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we used help and nonhelp as rewarding and punishing outcomes and modeled how they affected changes in emotion rating values via the following standard delta-learning rule (19) that included learning rate () as a free parameter:Vt+1=Vt+ttwitht=RtVt,[S1]where, on a given trial t, V is the value of the expected rating,  is the learning rate,  is the reward prediction error defined as the difference between the observed reinforcement outcome (R) and predicted rating value (V) (13, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used nonlinear least squares (lsqcurvefit implemented in Matlab) to estimate the learning parameter  by fitting the predicted ratings (V), which varied due to helping and the learning rate, to the scaled observed ratings (scaled to outcomes, i.e., to fall between the values 1 and 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, to test the robustness of the estimations, we iterated through starting parameters between 0.1 and 0.9 and found that results did not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the model estimate of the learning rate for our sample was  = 0.301 (95% confidence interval [0.272, 0.331]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result, in combination with our manipulation check showing largely overlapping neural results across a range of assumed learning rates (0.20.4), indicates that our literature-based (44) assumption of a learning rate of 0.3 is close to optimal for our sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, we compared the learning rates of participants with particularly negative out-group attitude against participants with less negative out-group attitude (determined via kmeans cluster analysis over the out-group impression ratings).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Learning rates of strongly biased participants did not differ from less biased participants both within the whole sample [t(36) = 1.50, P = 0.143] and within the experimental group only [t(18) = 0.663, P = 0.516].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Involvement_of_the_Ventral_Striatum_in_Learning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exploratory analyses with a liberal threshold (P uncorrected less_than 0.005) also revealed a learning-related change of activation in left ventral striatum (Table S7), in line with the notion that positive feelings of reciprocation during collaboration are reflected in striatal prediction error signals (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our study, the involvement of the striatum was considerably weaker than the strong learning effect in the AI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although there were no significant laterality differences, the learning effects were somewhat stronger in the right AI, whereas the empathy-related changes were somewhat stronger in the left AI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are in line with models of functional lateralization, which propose that the right AI is mainly related to the subjective processing of emotional experiences (which, according to our data, drives learning), whereas the left AI is mainly involved in other-regarding (or affiliative) feelings (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that both the learning and the empathy effects were observed in bilateral AI at less stringent thresholds (Tables S3 and S4), such a conclusion should be drawn with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Forty healthy men (mean age, 22.7; SE, 0.41) participated in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were randomly assigned to the experimental and the control group with no age difference between the groups [t(38) = 0.34, P = 0.73].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a male instead of a gender-mixed participant group because it allowed us to also choose male confederates and avoided the potential complications of gender-mixed pairing of participants and confederates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, testing the modulation of empathy in males is more conservative than in females, because males are less likely to simulate others emotional state on the neural level (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two datasets of the control group had to be excluded because of technical problems during fMRI data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prescanning_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a well-established priming procedure (42) to induce the in-group/out-group manipulation and to activate the relevant stereotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details about the prescanning procedure and the cover story are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scanning_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the preintervention empathy session, the participant in the scanner observed the in-group or the out-group confederate receive painful stimulation (18 trials each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each trial started with an arrow cue (500 ms), whose color indicated the recipient of the pain (in-group/out-group member).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a fixation period (1,500 ms), a lightning bolt was presented whose color matched the color of the arrow cue (1,000 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the color of the bolt changed to yellow, which indicated the delivery of the painful stimulation to the respective person (1,000 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a fixation period (1,0003,000 ms), the next trial was presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colors indicating the in-group and out-group condition were counterbalanced across participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trials were presented in pseudorandomized order (no more than two consecutive trials of the same condition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervention session consisted of 20 trials, 15 trials in which the participant received help from the other person, and 5 in which he did not receive help and was thus subjected to pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helping and nonhelping trials were presented in random order (for details, see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postintervention session was identical to the preintervention session, except that the participant observed the painful stimulation of a new in-group and a new out-group member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The participants (and confederates) were informed that they would not meet after the study and had separate visual displays to keep emotion ratings anonymous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prediction_Error_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prediction errors were computed according to t =  (t  Vt), where Vt corresponds to the value V predicted by all stimuli presented in trial t, t corresponds to the value of the outcome in trial t, and  corresponds to the learning rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The learning rate determines how much weight is given to recent experience as captured by the prediction error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed a learning rate of 0.3, which is most commonly reported in reinforcement learning paradigms (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the prediction error-related effects were very similar for other learning rates (0.2 and 0.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional prediction error estimates based on the emotion ratings confirmed the applied learning rate (SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture individual variability in prior expectations, V1 was equal to each participants average out-group score (experimental group) or in-group score (control group) on the impression scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our approach, traditional learning theory assumes no prior expectations (V1 = 0), which is unlikely in our social setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boundary outcome values were set according to the maximum (54 points) and minimum (6 points) score of the impression scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, t = 54 in helping trials and t = 6 in nonhelping trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted standard preprocessing, first- and second-level analyses (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second-level results were corrected for multiple comparisons by using FWE correction within bilateral anatomical masks of the entire insular cortex, as defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data extraction, we used the entire cluster of the respective activations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted beta values reflect the average activation of all voxels within the cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details about the multiple-regression analyses and the mediation analysis are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prescanning_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A well-established priming procedure (42) was used to induce the in-group/out-group manipulation and to activate the relevant stereotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this procedure, the participant and the two Swiss individuals interacting with the participant were asked to collect attributes that are typical for a Balkan male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The participant then wrote down these attributes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other confederates playing Balkan individuals were asked to collect and write down attributes that are typical for a Swiss male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collected material was ostensibly part of a future study investigating stereotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure is commonly used to activate stereotypes (43), in our case to activate the stereotype of a Balkan male in our Swiss participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all five men were asked to wear name tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each confederate had two names (one stereotypical Swiss name for when they were part of the in-group and one stereotypical Balkan name for when they were part of the out-group), which they used throughout the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of the priming procedure was confirmed by subsequent ratings on an impression scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After group membership priming, individual pain thresholds were determined for the participant and the four confederates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attached a pain electrode to the dorsum of the left hand of the four persons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a standard procedure (9, 21), we determined individual thresholds for painful sensation, using electrical stimulation (bipolar, monophasic; maximum duration: 1,000 ms; input range, 5 V; output range, 50 mA) from a single-current stimulator (DS5; Digitimer, Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, the respective person was asked to rate the intensity of electrical stimulation he received on the back of his hand on a scale from 1 (not painful) to 10 (extremely painful).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity that corresponded to a subjective value of 8 was used during the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cues that would indicate the pain stimulation for each person were introduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the two confederates who were assigned to the postintervention phase were sent away, ostensibly to take part in a different experiment in another room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Left alone with the participant and two confederates, the experimenter explained that the participant would lie inside the scanner so that his brain responses could be measured, while the other two people would sit on chairs next to the scanner, ostensibly so that other physiological measurements could be taken (skin conductance and heart rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first experimental run, all of them would receive painful stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, during the second experimental run, one participant would be randomly assigned to receive pain (pain receiver), while a second participant would be randomly assigned to make decisions (decision maker), and a third participant would be randomly assigned to be the bystander.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pain receiver would receive a number of painful shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decision maker would be able to prevent the upcoming pain stimulation of the pain receiver by giving up money he would otherwise earn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third participant would stand by without being able to affect the pain stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenter also explained that the third experimental run would be the same as the first experimental run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, before the beginning of the third run, the two people who would be sitting beside the scanner would be taken out because they would also complete the other study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They would be replaced by the two people the pain receiver had met in the beginning who would have completed the other study by this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, the role of the pain receiver during the second experimental run was assigned by a game of drawing straws that ostensibly offered a 1/3 chance for each participant to be assigned this role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, however, the experimenter controlled who drew the shortest straw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, holding up three partially concealed straws, the experimenter made sure that the two confederates always drew first and that the participant drew the shortest straw, which assigned him the role of pain receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same game of drawing straws, one of the two remaining people would be assigned the role of the decision maker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decision makers name was not revealed until the beginning of the second experimental run to avoid biasing measurements during the first experimental run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To avoid possible reputation effects that might influence the behavior of our participants, all ratings were kept anonymous and we ensured that the participants did not meet the confederates after the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular care was taken to ensure that this was clear to participants by pointing out the following: Inside the scanning room, each of the three people had a separate visual display, such that the participant viewed stimuli via backprojection from a mirror onto a screen, while the confederates outside the scanner viewed stimuli via video goggles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, all ratings and decisions were personal and could not be observed by the other participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Everyone was also clearly informed that they would not meet after the experiment because the scanned participant needed to stay longer for an anatomical scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Acquisition_and_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment was conducted on a 3-T Philips whole-body MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems), equipped with an eight-channel Philips SENSitivity Encoded (SENSE) head coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural image acquisition consisted of 180 T1-weighted transversal images (voxel size of 1 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For functional imaging, we used T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (35 slices, slice thickness of 3 mm, interslice gap of 0.5 mm, ascending acquisition; repetition time, 2,100 ms; echo time, 30 ms; flip angle, 80°; field of view, 240 mm; matrix, 80 × 80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the preintervention and the postintervention sessions, a total of 495 images was acquired; in the intervention session, a total of 110 images was acquired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple-Regression_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the minimum number of positive experiences that can change empathy-related brain responses, we extracted the prediction error signals from right AI that were elicited in trials 15, 610, 1115, and 1620, and entered them as predictors in a hierarchical multiple regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the intervention-induced change in empathy-related brain responses to the in-group vs. out-group as the dependent variable [(in-group vs. out-group pre)  (in-group vs. out-group post)/abs(in-group vs. out-group pre)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By dividing by the absolute value of the reference point abs(in-group vs. out-group pre), this formula yields positive values for postdifferences smaller than predifferences (which indicate the success of the intervention) and negative values for postdifferences larger than predifferences (which indicate the failure of the intervention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To specify the number of positive experiences, we extracted the individual prediction error signals that were elicited after one, two, three, or four positive experiences, tested their correlation with the individual intervention effect in separate regressions, and used FDR correction to correct for multiple comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mediation_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The individual beta values related to the prediction error in right AI were entered as the independent variable, the beta values related to emotion positivity from right AI were entered as the mediator, and the beta values of the Group (in-group/out-group) × Time (preintervention/postintervention) interaction from left AI was entered as the dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distribution of the indirect (mediated) effect, calculated as the product of paths from the independent variable to the mediator and from the mediator to the dependent variable was derived over 5,000 iterations of data sampled with replacement (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this distribution, confidence intervals for the indirect effect were constructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
