Flow-assisted assembly of nanostructured protein microfibers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein nanofibrils formed by self-assembly have emerged as a promising foundation for the design of bio-based materials with enhanced mechanical properties or new functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make use of the extraordinary properties of these structures in materials design, improved understanding of the assembly of the nanofibrils into macroscale materials is crucial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that micrometer-sized protein fibers can be created from protein nanofibrils using a simple microfluidics setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembly mechanism of these fibers is elucidated using high-resolution small-angle X-ray studies in combination with rheology measurements of the corresponding hydrogels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal essential parameters associated with the fiber formation and provide insights about the assembly processes of hierarchical protein materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the most remarkable materials in nature are made from proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The properties of these materials are closely connected to the hierarchical assembly of the protein building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this perspective, amyloid-like protein nanofibrils (PNFs) have emerged as a promising foundation for the synthesis of novel bio-based materials for a variety of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas recent advances have revealed the molecular structure of PNFs, the mechanisms associated with fibrilfibril interactions and their assembly into macroscale structures remain largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that whey PNFs can be assembled into microfibers using a flow-focusing approach and without the addition of plasticizers or cross-linkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microfocus small-angle X-ray scattering allows us to monitor the fibril orientation in the microchannel and compare the assembly processes of PNFs of distinct morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the strongest fiber is obtained with a sufficient balance between ordered nanostructure and fibril entanglement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results provide insights in the behavior of protein nanostructures under laminar flow conditions and their assembly mechanism into hierarchical macroscopic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Preparation_and_Characterization_of_Whey_PNFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The whey protein -lactoglobulin forms amyloid-like fibrils under several different conditions, including high concentrations of urea (20), in the presence of alcohols (21), and at low pH and elevated temperature (5, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low pH and high temperature, the fibrillation proceeds through hydrolysis of the protein into smaller peptide fragments and some of these peptides spontaneously assemble into PNFs (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we used whey protein isolate (WPI) as starting material because it gives us access to large amounts of PNFs and is a potential raw material for industrial-scale production of protein-based materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNFs formed from WPI when incubated at pH 2, 90 °C, and low ionic strength for 13 d (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although WPI is a mixture of different proteins, previous studies have shown that PNFs formed under the applied conditions are built from -lactoglobulinderived peptides (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, vandenAkker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrated that pure -lactoglobulin can assemble into fibrils with different morphology depending on the initial protein concentration (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their study, low protein concentration (3%) resulted in long and straight fibrils whereas short, worm-like structures were formed at higher concentrations (7.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a similar morphological switch exists for PNFs formed from WPI solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower WPI concentrations (less_than4%), we obtain straight and long (up to several micrometers) PNFs (Fig 1A), whereas at higher concentrations (6%) the fibrils are short, more aggregated, and have a higher degree of curvature (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A brief quantification of the morphological differences in terms of persistence lengths showed that the average value of the straight fibrils is 1,960 nm, which is almost 50× higher than for the curved fibrils (41 nm) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the straight fibrils have an apparent height of 4.1 ± 1.1 nm whereas the curved fibrils are thinner (2.5 ± 0.5 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the straight fibrils are built from 23 protofilaments, as described by others (10, 25), and that these filaments have the same cross-sectional area as the curved fibrils, we can get an estimate of the relative elastic moduli of the two classes of PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The straight fibrils then appear to have an elastic modulus that is 1525× higher than the curved fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values for PNFs similar to the straight fibrils have previously been reported to be 5 GPa (26), which means that the curved PNFs would have an elastic modulus between 0.2 and 0.4 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PNF solutions were extensively dialyzed to remove nonfibrillated proteins and peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dialyzed dispersions of straight, as well as curved, PNFs undergo a phase transition to a gel (arrested state) when the pH is increased to 5.2 (Fig 1 D and E), which is close to the isoelectric point of -lactoglobulin (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the corresponding changes in pH for nondialyzed samples resulted in macroscopic phase separation with opaque aggregates rather than a gel, signifying that nonfibrillated proteins could impede the gel network formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow-Induced_Formation_of_PNF_Microfibers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pH-induced gel transition of the PNF dispersions was explored in combination with flow-induced alignment to assemble fibrils into microfibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a double-focusing millimeter-scaled device (Fig 2 and Fig S1) with a core flow of PNF dispersion and two focusing steps of the sheath flows (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laminar flow conditions along the channel enable precise control of pH, which is required for the transition into a gel state for the PNF dispersions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the first focusing step, deionized water was used to enable the alignment of fibrils in the presence of an elongational flow field, whereas the flow at the second step contained acetate buffer at pH 5.2, which in turn locked the aligned structure of PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined the assembly of straight fibrils, where the concentration of PNF in the core flow varied from 0.45% to 1.8% (the concentrations are lower than the above-mentioned initial concentrations as they refer to the pure PNF content of the dialyzed dispersions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, no conditions were found where fibrils could be assembled into fibers that were strong enough to be picked out from the bath solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weak hydrogel fibers were obtained that were unable to withstand the surface tension at the liquidair interface when pulled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curved fibrils, on the other hand, were able to produce hydrogel fibers that were strong enough to overcome the surface tension (Fig 3 A and B and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the fiber formation with curved fibrils was possible at a concentration of 1.8%, where straight fibrils were not able to produce strong enough hydrogel fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, nonfibrillar solutions of WPI could not produce fiber-like structures at any concentration, highlighting the importance of ordered nanostructures in the starting material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extracted hydrogel fibers were dried in air (Fig S3) and investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images reveal a smooth surface with constant cross-section along the diameter (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the close-up view of the fiber surface (Fig 3F), it can be seen that the PNFs are assembled into closely packed graupel-like units of the dimensions of a few hundred nanometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this surface morphology is similar to previous observations of the assembly of recombinant spider silk proteins, where colloidal aggregates clustered together to form higher-order structures (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, however, different from mechanically more rigid particles like cellulose nanofibrils, where rod-like linearly arranged units were observed on the fiber surface (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of amyloid-like structure in the fibers was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig 3 C and D), where a homogeneous binding of the amyloidophilic dye thioflavin T over the fiber surface was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the fibers can be functionalized with fluorophores as shown in other PNF materials (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also characterized the mechanical properties of the fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stressstrain curves reveal a rather brittle material with modulus up to 288 MPa and strain at break of 1.5%, as shown in Fig 3G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the stiffness of fibers is in the same range as expected for individual PNFs (2), whereas the ultimate tensile strength is significantly lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the measured elastic modulus is in good agreement with the estimated values for curved fibrils (vide supra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Investigations_of_PNF_Alignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the behavior of straight and curved PNFs in the flow-focusing channel, we carried out synchrotron microfocus small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A channel with slightly modified geometry was used for these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this channel the second focusing step was replaced by a contraction (Fig 4A), because the gel transition was not required for this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both channel geometries function by the same principle of elongational flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of PNFs was studied in terms of alignment defined by the order parameter calculated from the obtained SAXS images (Methods for detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An order parameter of 1 represents fully aligned fibrils in the streamwise direction, whereas 0 represents an isotropic distribution (random orientation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation of the order parameters along the channel indicated increased alignment of fibrils immediately after the focusing and the contraction steps (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the order parameters decreased again, indicating relaxation of the aligned fibrils toward isotropy, which is primarily due to Brownian motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial differences between the behaviors of straight and curved PNFs were observed: The curved fibrils were poorly oriented in the flow direction, as indicated by the lower values of order parameter (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum order parameter reached by the straight fibrils was 0.41, which is almost twice the highest value for the curved fibrils (0.21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAXS results are in agreement with observations by polarized optical microscopy (Fig 4D) in which the straight fibrils displayed birefringence at the location where we observed increased order parameter in the SAXS measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no birefringence was observed for the curved fibrils, which confirms a lower degree of alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micro-_and_Molecular_Structure_of_PNFs_in_the_Gel_State  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the interfibrillar interactions for the two morphological classes of PNFs, we investigated the fracture behavior of the gel networks under macroscopic strains using rheometry (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At similar concentrations of straight and curved fibrils, a large difference in the value of initial storage modulus (G) was observed (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher modulus for the straight fibrils might be associated with an initial alignment of fibrils in a nematic phase (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results also reveal a difference in response to the increasing oscillatory strains before gel fracture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels from the straight fibrils undergo a gradual fracture as indicated by the slow decrease of storage modulus, whereas for the curved fibrils, a sudden drop of the modulus close to the fracture point is detected (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow deformation for gels formed by straight fibrils is presumably associated with rotation and sliding of the fibrils, which plastically deforms their network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the gel of curved fibrils fractured without plastic deformation, indicating that fibrils might be interlocked to a higher degree due to the entanglements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the network fractures distinctively when these entanglements break.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in responses to the oscillatory strain in the gel state gives us a clue about the reason for different behaviors of straight and curved PNFs in the fiber spinning process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the straight fibrils are aligned in the flow, the possibilities of further optimizing the interaction network decrease, resulting in suboptimal cross-linking of PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when the entangled network of curved fibrils is extended and thus redistributed by the flow focusing, their interlocking might be enhanced, and a stronger network is achieved (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A highly entangled network of fibrils is in agreement with the SEM image in Fig 3F, where dense packing of PNFs can be seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the molecular structure of the PNFs stays intact during fiber formation, we acquired FTIR spectra in amide I and amide II band regions that report on the protein secondary structures (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amide I and II bands are centered at 1,625 cm1 and 1,517 cm1, respectively (Fig S5), which is in agreement with a high content of -sheet structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of the acetate-induced hydrogel is essentially the same as that of the PNF dispersion at pH 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the solid fiber made from curved PNFs in the flow-focusing geometry, the amide II band becomes broader, and the peak center is shifted to 1,550 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change most likely originates from a higher content of acetate in the fiber sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased spectral intensity at 1,400 cm1 (Fig S5), where acetate has another absorption peak, supports this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -sheet core of the PNFs is, however, intact as the peak position of amide I band is unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_the_Design_of_Hierarchical_PNF-Based_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many other systems, the alignment of nanofibrils (of any origin) provides an opportunity to improve mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, alignment of cellulose nanofibrils using a similar device as in this study resulted in filaments with superior mechanical properties (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here show the opposite effect for PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the size and shape of PNFs and cellulose nanofibrils might appear similar, the structural and chemical properties of these nanostructures are indeed different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origins of the materials further elucidate the differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellulose nanofibrils from wood are extracted through chemical pretreatment followed by mechanical decomposition of cellulose, which refers to their intrinsic crystallinity and ability to form higher-order structures, e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNFs, on the other hand, are self-assembled from protein monomers that might not correspond to any higher-order structures that already exist in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, despite the similarities in size and aspect ratio, PNFs and cellulose nanofibrils are distinct classes of nanomaterials with essentially different behavior during assembly into macroscopic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, our results suggest some similarities between the formation of PNF microfibers and the assembly mechanism of recombinant spider silk proteins (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the PNFs, spider silk has a high degree of -sheet secondary structure and the fibers are formed in a spinning process based on elongational flow and pH alterations (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the structural characteristics are different as the silk fibers contain significant parts that are disordered and the orientation of the -sheets relative to the fiber axis is perpendicular to that expected for aligned PNFs (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this perspective, it is interesting that the lower degree of fibril alignment associated with the curved PNFs resulted in a stronger microfiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the assembly process of spider silk also differs from our system because the molecular- and supramolecular structures are formed simultaneously during the spinning process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for formation of entangled structures with optimized intermolecular interactions at the same time as highly ordered -sheet regions are created.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study shows that sufficient balance between ordered regions and interchain entanglements to create a coherent fiber can be achieved also with preformed -sheet elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that not even artificially assembled silk fibers reach the same mechanical performance as natural silk, it is indeed fascinating that we can produce pure protein fibers from a rather crude raw material and with a fairly simple experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further exploration of processing conditions and/or protein building blocks will elucidate the parameter space (mechanical entanglements, fibril orientation, spatial distribution of fibrils and chemical bonds) of PNF assembly in detail and provide the basis for design of novel materials with tailored properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_of_PNFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WPI (Lacprodan Di-9224) was kindly provided by Arla Food Ingredients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNFs formed in the solution during incubation at 90 °C for 3 d. Concentrations of 40 g/L or 7580 g/L were used to obtain straight and curved PNFs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PNF solutions were dialyzed using a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff for 7 d. The concentration of the straight fibrils was increased by centrifugal membrane filtration (100-kDa cutoff).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Atomic_Force_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PNF morphology was investigated using a Dimension FastScan atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker) operating in tapping mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were diluted between 1:500 and 1:10,000 in 0.01 M HCl and applied on a freshly cleaved mica surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  End-to-end lengths and the contour lengths of the fibrils were measured from AFM images using Image J software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 300 fibrils were measured for each fibril morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations of persistence lengths and estimation of elastic moduli is described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow-Focusing_Setup_and_Fiber_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The flow setup (13, 27) is described in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rates were 4.1 mL/h for the core flow, and 4.7 mL/h and 24.9 mL/h for the first and second sheath flows, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second sheath flow and bath solution, sodium acetate buffer at a pH of 5.2 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After spinning, hydrogel fibers were extracted from the bath and dried at room temperature for 2 h (Fig S3) to obtain solid fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fiber_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sample for SEM was prepared by sputtering a 10-nm goldpalladium layer on the dried fiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM images were acquired with a Hitachi S-4800 Field-Emission SEM operating at an acceleration voltage of 1.0 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For fluorescence microscopy, the obtained fiber was dipped in 120 M thioflavin T solution and then dried at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fiber was investigated using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope with excitation at 455490 nm and emission at 500540 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tensile tests were carried out using a Deben Micro tester with a 2.0-N load cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length and cross-section of each fiber were measured by an optical microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTIR spectroscopy was recorded in the frequency range of 6004,000 cm1 using a Bruker Tensor instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_SAXS_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SAXS measurements were performed at the P03 beamline, at the PETRAIII storage ring at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slightly modified flow setup was used, where the second focusing step is mimicked by the contraction step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rates were the same as the ones used for core flow and first sheath flow for the fiber formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the alignment of PNFs, order parameters were calculated from SAXS scattering patterns using a similar method as previously reported (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rheology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rheology measurements of the PNF dispersions were carried out at room temperature using a DHR-2 rheometer (TA Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After placing 300 L of dispersion between the plates, 1 mL of pH 5.2 acetate buffer was added along the circumference to attain gelation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_of_PNFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WPI (Lacprodan Di-9224) was kindly provided by Arla Food Ingredients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WPI corresponding to a concentration of 100 g/L was dissolved in 0.1 M (pH 1) hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Fisher Scientific) and the solution was dialyzed against 0.01 M HCl (pH 2) for 24 h at room temperature using a membrane (Spectrum Laboratories) with 68-kDa molecular weight cutoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution was then diluted to desired concentrations: 40 g/L to obtain straight PNFs (Fig 1A) or 7580 g/L to obtain curved fibrils (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNFs formed in the solution during incubation at 90 °C for a period of 3 d. To remove nonfibrillated proteins, the PNF solution was dialyzed using a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane (Spectrum Laboratories) for 7 d. For straight fibrils, the concentration was increased by centrifugal membrane filtration (100-kDa cutoff membrane, GE Healthcare), until the desired concentration was achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final concentrations were measured by UV absorbance (at 280 nm; relative concentrations of the samples) and dry weight measurements of lyophilized materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the methods showed similar values of protein concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Atomic_Force_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PNF morphology was investigated using a Dimension FastScan AFM (Bruker) operating in tapping mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were diluted between 1:500 and 1:10,000 in 0.01 M HCl and 25 L was applied on a freshly cleaved mica surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then dried in air and investigated immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FastScan A cantilevers (Bruker) were used for the experiments and the images were investigated in Nanoscope 1.5 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments were also performed in liquid using ScanAsyst Liquid+ cantilevers (Bruker) operating in Peak Force mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments showed the same difference between the morphologies of straight and curved PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the difference of fibril morphology, the end-to-end lengths and the contour lengths of the fibrils were measured from AFM images using Image J software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistence length was calculated based on the assumption that the fibrils interact weakly with the mica surface and are able to relax to 2D equilibrium (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data points of Fig 1C were fitted to the following expression:E22D=4PC(12PC(1e(C/2P))),where E is end-to-end length and C is contour length measured from AFM images, and P is persistence length calculated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this calculation, at least 300 fibrils were measured for each fibril morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculated persistence lengths and measured fibril heights were used to derive a rough estimate of the relative elastic moduli of the PNFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic modulus is proportional to the persistence length (P), and inversely proportional to the area moment of inertia (I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a circular cross-section with an area moment of inertia I0 of the curved fibrils and that the straight fibrils are build from n twisted filaments, each with the same cross-section as the curved fibrils, we can approximate the area moment of inertia of the straight fibrils as I  nI0 because bending mainly occurs according to the lowest energy mode (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bulk_Gel_Transition_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PNF dispersions were gelled in a cuvette by adding sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) buffer with pH values between 4.0 and 5.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At an optimized pH value, the cuvette was inverted after gelation and gelling ability was accessed as the ability of the gels to remain at the top of the cuvette (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow-Focusing_Setup_and_Fiber_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The flow setup consists of three syringe pumps (WPI, Al-4000), a flow-focusing channel (27), and a bath for the outlet of protein hydrogel fibers (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syringe pumps were used to control the flow rates of the core and sheath flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rates used in this study were 4.1 mL/h for the core flow, and 4.7 mL/h and 24.9 mL/h for the first and second sheath flows, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow channel was milled in a 1-mm-thick stainless steel plate and sandwiched between two Plexiglas plates (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the Plexiglas plates, two aluminum plates were placed on either side and screwed together to prevent leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the channels in the flow-focusing geometry were 1 mm in width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second sheath flow and bath solution, sodium acetate buffer at a pH of 5.2 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outlet of the channel was submerged into the bath solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After spinning, hydrogel fibers from the bath were extracted with the help of tweezers and then dried at room temperature for a period of 2 h (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid fibers were obtained after drying the hydrogel fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fiber_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sample for SEM was prepared by sputtering a 10-nm goldpalladium layer (Gressington Instruments Ltd.) on the dried fiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM images were acquired with a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission SEM (Hitachi, Japan) operating at an acceleration voltage of 1.0 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For fluorescence microscopy, the amyloidophilic dye thioflavin T (Sigma-Aldrich) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained fiber was dipped in 120 M thioflavin T solution and then dried at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence microscopy investigations of the fiber were carried out using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope with excitation at 455490 nm and emission at 500540 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tensile tests were carried out using a Deben Micro tester with a 2.0-N load cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length and cross-section of each fiber were measured by an optical microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The span length of fibers tested was 810 mm and measurements were performed at a pulling rate of 0.6 mm min1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTIR spectroscopy was recorded in the frequency range of 6004,000 cm1 using a Bruker Tensor instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_SAXS_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SAXS measurements were performed at the P03 beamline at the PETRAIII storage ring at DESY in Hamburg, Germany (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were performed in a transmission geometry with an X-ray wavelength  = 0.95 Å and sample-to-detector distance of 6950 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering patterns were recorded by a single-photon counting detector (Pilatus 1M, Dectris) with the pixel size of 172 × 172 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam size was 20 × 10 m2 (horizontal × vertical).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the in situ SAXS study, a slightly modified flow setup was used where the second focusing step is mimicked by the contraction step, which works on the same principle of elongational flow field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rates were the same as the ones used for core flow and first sheath flow for the fiber formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow-focusing channel was sandwiched between two Kapton sheets instead of Plexiglas plates that were used for the fiber formation experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the alignment of PNFs, order parameters were calculated from SAXS scattering patterns using a similar method as reported by Håkansson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the scattering patterns were first transformed into the diffractogram with scattering vector q [defined as q = 4sin()/, where 2 is scattering angle] and azimuthal angle  as coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background intensity of a flow with pure water was subtracted from the intensity of protein samples, with the normalization of the maximum intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate order parameter, the intensity of isotropic contribution was removed under the assumption that the highest aligned case shows the intensity of the isotropic distribution of PNFs in the nonaligned direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the intensity distribution was averaged for 0.1 less_than q less_than 0.5 nm1 for each azimuthal angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment of PNFs was quantified by order parameter (S) (35), defined ass=32cos212.Expanding the average givess=0I()(32cos212)sind,which is normalized according to0I()sind=1,where I() is the intensity distribution averaged along the examined q range for each azimuthal angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rheology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rheology measurements to investigate the viscoelastic properties of the PNF dispersions and hydrogels were carried out at room temperature using a DHR-2 rheometer (TA Instruments) equipped with a Peltier plate for temperature control and a 25-mm-diameter parallel plate setup with a truncation gap of 500 m. After placing 300 L of dispersion between the plates, 1 mL of pH 5.2 acetate buffer was added along the circumference to attain gelation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, 0.25% strain was applied and measurements of storage and loss modulus were carried out for a period of 50 min (until the time a constant measurement value was reached).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, fractured stress was measured with increasing strain from 0.01% to 60% at a constant frequency of 1 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
