Impact of local symmetry breaking on the physical properties of tetrahedral liquids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water and silica are quite important for human beings because they are the most abundant materials with tremendous biological, geological, and technological significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They show similar density anomalies and crystalline structures but also have differences: Water crystallizes easily on cooling, but not silica, which has a significant impact on our planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These similarities and differences have been known for a long time, but a clear microscopic explanation is still missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we successfully reveal the microscopic physical origin of the similarities and differences between water and silica, from the local symmetric arrangement of atoms in these liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding indicates the importance of detailed characterization of low-energy local structures for understanding the properties of liquids interacting with directional bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water and silica are the most important materials with local tetrahedral symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have similar crystalline polymorphs and exhibit anomalous density maximum in the liquid state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, water and silica also show very different characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the density of water varies much more sharply than that of liquid silica near the maximum as temperature changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More notably, silica is a very good glass-former, but water is an extremely poor one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical origins of these similarities and differences still remain elusive, due to the lack of a microscopic understanding of the structural ordering in these two important liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by accessing microscopic structural information by computer simulations, we reveal that local translational symmetry breaking is responsible for the density anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the difference in the degree of local orientational symmetry breaking between water and silica, which originates from the difference in their bonding nature, causes not only the difference in the sharpness of density anomalies, but also their distinct glass-forming abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work not only shows the crucial roles of local translational and orientational symmetry breaking in the physical properties of the two extremely important materials, water and silica, but also provides a unified scenario applicable for other tetrahedral liquids such as Si, Ge, C, BeF2, and GeO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is now widely recognized that the key to characterize the microscopic structures of water is the second shell structure (12, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Popular structural parameters, such as local structure index (LSI) (17) and d5 (5, 18), were developed to extract the structural feature associated with the second shell (see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods for the definitions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters have been widely used to study the local structures of water (1824).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the characterization of the shell structure by these previous structural parameters and experiments are based solely on the information on the distance between the oxygen of a central molecule and its neighboring ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The important point is that the locally favored structure of water is stabilized by the energy gain from hydrogen-bond (H-bond) formation, i.e., directional intermolecular OHO bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this consideration, we recently introduced the  parameter, which is a measure of the local translational order of the second shell of water (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter  is defined for each water molecule i as the difference between the distance dji of the nearest neighbor molecule j not H-bonded to molecule i, and the distance dji of the furthest neighbor molecule j H-bonded to molecule i: (i)=djidji.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this definition, the detection of H-bonds plays an important role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We regard two water molecules as H-bonded only if the OO distance is less_than0.35 nm and the HOO angle is less_than30° (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this H-bond definition may fail at a certain condition, e.g., at very high pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have confirmed that our definition of  and conclusions derived from it are robust against various H-bond definitions (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2), at least in the temperature and pressure range we studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that our  parameter, which characterizes not only oxygen order but also proton order, indeed identified locally favored structures better than LSI and d5 over a wider temperature range (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, here we propose a structural parameter z to measure the translational order in silicons second shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike in water, we cannot define bonds in silica unambiguously due to their ionic nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we can introduce the information on the oxygen order, albeit indirectly, in addition to the information on SiSi distance as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define z for each silicon atom i as the difference between the distance ji of the fifth nearest silicon neighbor j, and the distance ji of the fourth nearest oxygen neighbor j: z(i)=jiji.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring the relative distance between the first and second shells of silicon, z describes the translational order of silicons second shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This z parameter is robust against thermal fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be regarded as an improvement of the structural parameter d5 that simply measures the distance of the fifth nearest silicon from a reference silicon (5) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the two-order-parameter model (13), water can be approximately treated as a dynamic mixture of two types of local structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-state scenario has been studied by many groups (23, 2734) and become popular nowadays (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, its microscopic justification by a proper structural descriptor (see above) has only recently been made (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct evidence comes from the bimodal distribution of the structural parameter , as shown in Fig 1A, with the  and S states assigned to the left and right peaks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1B, we plot the distributions of the parameter z for silica at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, z also displays a clear bimodal feature similarly to water, suggesting a two-state feature in silica, too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 C and D show the numbers of oxygen and silicon neighbors as a function of the parameters  and z in the first shell of oxygen in water and silicon in silica, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the parameters,  and z, are correlated to the first-shell coordination number in both systems: The S state has fewer neighbors and thus lower local density than the  state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a correlation between the structural parameters and the tetrahedral order parameter q [1 for perfect tetrahedron and 0 for random arrangement (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2)] (11) was also found in both water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1 E and F, the S state exhibited higher tetrahedral order than the  state for both systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  q increased with decreasing temperature and reached 0.9 at the lowest temperature, indicative of high tetrahedrality of the S state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 G and H plot the OO and SiSi radial distribution functions (RDF) for water and silica, respectively, as well as the contribution from the S state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can clearly see that the S state exhibits a clear separation between the first and second shells, which are signaled by a steep minimum between the first and second peaks, suggesting local translational symmetry breaking in S state for both systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The substantial differences in the translational order of the second shell, the local density, and the tetrahedrality between the S and  states (Fig 1) naturally suggest the relevance of a two-state description of water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the two-state scenario (13), the controlling parameter is the fraction s of the S state, which determines the physical properties of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the two-state modeling of water (23, 2732, 34), the key parameter s was usually obtained from fitting without a microscopic basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by using the proper structure parameters,  and z, we managed to distinguish the S state from the background disorder  state and thus accurately obtained the fraction s by two-Gaussian fitting to the bimodal distribution of P() and P(z) for water and silica, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction s is displayed as a function of temperature and pressure for water and silica, respectively, in Fig 2 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order parameter s increases upon cooling and depressurizing for both systems, in agreement with the high-order and low-density nature of the S state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences between the two states can be simply characterized by their free energy difference: G=GSG=ET+PV, where E, , and V are the energy, entropy, and volume differences between the two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of a second critical point has been suggested for water (3638) and silica (5, 39), which has been subjected to hot debate until today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the presence of the second critical point is natural in our two-order-parameter model (13), we argue that it can play only a minor role far from the critical region, even if it exists in real water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our study focused on the anomalous thermodynamic behavior far from the postulated critical points, we neglected cooperativity (criticality) in our two-state model, and thus the fraction s can be approximately described by (Materials and Methods)s=11+exp(ET+PVkBT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 A and B plot the fitting results (the colored surfaces) of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 to the values of s. We can see that the fraction s determined microscopically from P() and P(z) can be nicely described by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, strongly supporting our two-state model neglecting cooperativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 are listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these parameters, density  can be simply calculated by=nMV+sV=nMV+V1+exp(kB)exp(E+PVkBT),[2]where M is the molar mass; n is the average number of molecules involved in each state, which bridges the two-state model described on the state basis and the simulation/experimental data described on the molecular basis; and V is the specific volume of  state that follows normal-liquid behavior (V decreases upon cooling and pressurising).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2 CF, we plot the densities (symbols) of water (Fig 2 C and E) and silica (Fig 2 D and F) in a wide range of temperature and pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that the two-state model (solid lines) perfectly describes the simulation results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we emphasize that the anomalous parts (s) are independently determined from the structural analysis (Fig 2 A and B) and thus not involved in the fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density maximum can be clearly seen from Fig 2 C and D for both systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the BKS model overestimates Tmax [1,823 K in experiment (40)], probably due to the limited accuracy of the classical force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the different temperature and pressure scales, water and silica displayed very similar density profiles (Fig 2 CF), reflecting the same two-state feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-state model provides a common structural description of the density anomaly in water and silica, i.e., the negative correlation between local translational symmetry breaking and density in the S state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pointed out by Angell and Kanno (1), silica has much sharper density variation near the maximum than water in a reduced temperature scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference can be simply explained in the framework of our two-state model by the smaller || for silica than for water (Table 1), which controls the sharpness of density variation with temperature through the factor exp(kB) in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical reason of the difference in || will be discussed later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common two-state feature can also explain the isothermal compressibility maximum, which appears upon cooling, in simulated water and silica (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the confirmation of the compressibility maximum is still waiting for future experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the disordered nature of the  state, the smaller || of silica indicates a higher entropy of S state in silica than in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To seek the origin of this difference, we turned our attention to the bond-orientational order (see Materials and Methods for details) up to the second shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 A and B show the distribution of Q12 in liquid water and silica, respectively, compared with their low-density crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Q12 was able to distinguish all types of crystalline orientational symmetries from liquid for any tetrahedral liquids (43), including both water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon cooling, water exhibited significant development of Q12 toward crystals (Fig 3A), whereas silica almost showed no change of Q12 below Tm (solid orange line in Fig 3B is above Tm), despite the fact that silica reached deeper supercooling than water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 C and D compare the W4Q4 map of water and silica, which was used to distinguish different phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrows in Fig 3 C and D denote the direction and degree of growing bond-orientational order upon cooling for both systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the Q12 results, water showed much more significant growth of orientational order than silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the degree of bond-orientational ordering was very different, both systems developed toward the high-Q4 and low-W4 direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means a considerable growth of cubic ice and/or ice 0 (43) symmetries in water and a slight development of -quartz and/or -cristobalite symmetries in silica upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the development of bond-orientational order (13) explains the significantly different glass-forming abilities of water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water has much poorer glass-forming ability than silica, which we ascribe to the higher bond-orientational ordering for water than for silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding agrees with the larger || for water than for silica, which should also originate from the substantially higher bond-orientational ordering of locally favored tetrahedral structures in water than in silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difference in the degree of the bond-orientational order can also been seen in the ring structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A ring is defined as a shortest loop of H-bonded oxygens in water and that of silicons linked by the SiOSi bond in silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A shows the distribution of ring size in water and silica at deep supercooling conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both systems, the majority of rings are pentagon, hexagon, and heptagon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, silica has a much wider distribution of the ring size than water does.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B compares the fraction of hexagonal rings, f6, in water and silica as a function of degree of supercooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both systems, f6 increased with supercooling, but the speed was much faster in water than in silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In deep supercooling, the growth of hexagonal rings started to saturate in silica, but continued in water, which is consistent with the much greater development of the bond-orientational order with an increase in the degree of supercooling for water than for silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a hexagonal ring is preferred in the low-density crystals of both water and silica, the higher hexagonal ring-forming ability of water again supports the lower glass-forming ability of water than silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Until now, we have shown that water and silica have similar local translational and tetrahedral order in the S state, whose coupling to local density explains the density anomaly, but at the same time they show significantly different orientational order that is responsible for their very different glass-forming abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now the remaining fundamental question is what the microscopic origin of the difference in the degree of local orientational order between water and silica is, despite the fact that they both show similar local translational order and tetrahedrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, in Fig 4 C and D, we plot the spatial distribution function of oxygen and silicon atoms in the S state of water and silica, respectively, at the similar levels of supercooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first shell (green clouds) of water and silica both showed high tetrahedrality (although the first shell of silica is invisible since it is covered by the second shell in Fig 4D), in agreement with Fig 1 E and F. However, in the second shell, water exhibited high orientational order, whereas silica showed very broad spatial distribution, indicating very poor orientational order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 E and F show the same function for hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the S state of water and silica, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, both water and silica displayed high tetrahedrality in the first shell, but in the second shell, oxygens in silica showed much broader distributions than hydrogens of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference originates from the intrinsic difference in the bonding nature between water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a hydrogen atom has only one electron, it can only form one covalent bond with an oxygen atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, one oxygen is covalently bonded to two hydrogens, forming one water molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, H-bonds can be formed between water molecules with much weaker strength than covalent bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the bond strength between intramolecular covalent bonds and intermolecular H-bonds not only affects the macroscopic properties of water, such as the low melting point and volatility, but also provides the microscopic rigidity of water molecules, which greatly reduces the freedom of hydrogen-atom location, even in the second shell, as seen from the red clouds in Fig 4E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silica, on the other hand, there is no formation of a stable molecule, and instead oxygen atoms normally form two equivalent bonds with neighboring silicon atoms, with half covalent and half ionic nature (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique nature of SiO bonds results in not only the high melting point of silica, but also the large freedom of oxygen atom location in the second shell, as seen from the blue clouds in Fig 4F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon supercooling, tetrahedral and translational order gradually build up in the first and second shell, respectively, driven by the energy gain from the growth of the S state in both systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the rigidity of water molecules leads to the simultaneous development of bond-orientational order in the second shell of water, whereas the large flexibility of bridging atoms (oxygens) hinders the growth of orientational order outside the first shell of silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding agrees with simulations of patchy colloids showing that large flexibility of bridging bond can stabilize the tetrahedral liquid, resulting in high glass-forming ability (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In any liquids, short-range translational and bond-orientational order both grow upon cooling, since the relative importance of energy to entropy increases upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ordinary liquids interacting with spherically symmetric potentials, however, there is only minor growth of translational order and little ordering in the second shell, whereas bond-orientational order can grow rather rapidly in a supercooled state (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stress that the growth of translational order in the second shell, or the presence of open space inside the first shell and its protection from invasion of other particles, is specific to the low-coordination tetrahedral liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the two extremely important liquids, water and silica, as examples, we show that (i) local breakdown of translational and rotational symmetry has different impacts in the liquid-state properties and crystallization; and (ii) their relative importance in a certain liquid depends upon the detailed nature of interparticle bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the properties of a liquid may be predicted by revealing how translational and bond-orientational order emerge from the interaction potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have shown the important role of local structural ordering in the second shell in determining the unique properties of water and silicain particular, different roles of two types of local symmetry breaking, translational and bond-orientational orderings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using two microscopic structural parameters,  and z, we have found a common two-state featurei.e., the formation of locally favored tetrahedral structures in the disordered normal-liquid backgroundwhich well explains not only the similar density anomaly, but also the different sharpnesses of density variance near the maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, owing to the different nature of bonding, the locally favored structure shows very different degrees of bond-orientational ordering in the second shell between water and silica, which explains their distinct glass-forming abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides not only a microscopic physical picture of structural ordering, but also a unified scenario for the similarities and differences between water and silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the formation of locally favored tetrahedral structures should be common to water-type liquids such as Si, Ge, C, BeF2 and GeO2 (13, 46), we believe that our physical scenario should also be relevant to a wide class of tetrahedral liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental importance of local symmetry breaking and its relation to the bonding may not be restricted to these tetrahedral liquids, but can be generalized to a wide range of materials with hydrogen or covalent bondings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding suggests that the liquid properties and glass-forming abilities of such materials may be better understood by studying how local translational and orientational orders emerge from the interaction potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulation_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on cubic systems containing 1,000 TIP5P (15) water by using the GROMACS (47) and 3,456 BKS (5, 14) silica (3,456 silicon and 6,912 oxygen atoms) by the LAMMPS (48) package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermolecular interactions were truncated at 9 and 5.5 Å for water and silica, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble, with temperature and pressure kept constant by using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat for water and NoséHoover ones for silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-time simulations were performed to ensure a good equilibration of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time step of 1 fs was used for all of the simulations of water and those of silica below 6,000 K. Above 6,000 K, the time step was adjusted to 0.5 fs for silica to avoid overlap of atoms within one step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total simulation times for water and silica are listed in SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-State_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In two-state scenario, a system consists of two states: locally favored structures (S state) and normal-liquid structures ( state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy of a nonideal mixture of two states is given by (25, 2729):G=G+sG+kBT[slns+(1s)ln(1s)]+Js(1s),[3]where G=GSG, G and GS is the free energy of pure  and S state, respectively; s is the fraction of the S state; J is the strength of coorperativity; and kB is the Boltzmann constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy difference, GGSG, can be described byG=ET+PV,[4]where E, , and V are the energy, entropy, and volume differences between the S and  states, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compatible with the existence of a second critical point, our two-state model predicts a critical point at Tc=J2kB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the system is far from the critical point, the effect of cooperativity or criticality is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such a case, at equilibrium condition Gs=0, we can write analyticallys=11+expGkBT,[5]which, along with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, describes the temperature and pressure dependences of the fraction of the S state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bond-Orientational_Order  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water and silica both have many crystalline forms with difference symmetries, which can be distinguished by the bond-orientational order (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial coarse-grained bond-orientational order parameter Ql is defined as follows (50):qlm(i)=1Nb(i)j=1Nb(i)Ylm(r^ij),[6]Qlm(i)=1Nb(i)k=0Nb(i)qlm(k),[7]Ql(i)=4(2l+1)m=ll|Qlm(i)|2,[8]where Ylm is the spherical harmonic function of degree l, and m is an integer running from m=l to m=l.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rij^ is a unit vector pointing from particle i to another particle j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum runs over the nearest Nb(i)=16 neighbors of particle i, so that it includes the structure information up to the second shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The definition of Wl(i) is given byWl(i)=m1+m2+m3=0l(lllm1m2m3)×(Qlm1(i)Qlm2(i)Qlm3(i))/(m=ll|Qlm(i)|2)32,[9]where the coefficients (lllm1m2m3) are Wigner 3j symbols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
