Uneven balance of power between hypothalamic peptidergic neurons in the control of feeding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interplay between the anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons in the arcuate nucleus that contributes to the control of feeding remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using optogenetic stimulation, we show that activation of POMC neurons rapidly inhibits feeding behavior in fasted animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, simultaneous stimulation of both POMC neurons and a subset of the orexigenic neurons that express AgRP is sufficient to reverse that inhibition and trigger intense feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 3D imaging and functional studies to illuminate the anatomical underpinning of both the inhibitory and excitatory events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work suggests that translational applications that aim to control appetite need to target the activation rather than the inhibition mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two classes of peptide-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus are known to exert opposing actions on feeding: the anorexigenic neurons that express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and the orexigenic neurons that express agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These neurons are thought to arise from a common embryonic progenitor, but our anatomical and functional understanding of the interplay of these two peptidergic systems that contribute to the control of feeding remains incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study uses a combination of optogenetic stimulation with viral and transgenic approaches, coupled with neural activity mapping and brain transparency visualization to demonstrate the following: (i) selective activation of Arc POMC neurons inhibits food consumption rapidly in unsated animals; (ii) activation of Arc neurons arising from POMC-expressing progenitors, including POMC and a subset of AgRP neurons, triggers robust feeding behavior, even in the face of satiety signals from POMC neurons; (iii) the opposing effects on food intake are associated with distinct neuronal projection and activation patterns of adult hypothalamic POMC neurons versus Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing lineages; and (iv) the increased food intake following the activation of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors engages an extensive neural network that involves the endogenous opioid system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings shed further light on the dynamic balance between two peptidergic systems in the moment-to-moment regulation of feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterization_of_Viral_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To control hypothalamic POMC neurons selectively, we used a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the gene encoding the blue light-activated cation channel ChR2 fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Cre-inducible double-floxed inverted ORF (DIO) AAV viral vector AAV5-EF1-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (Fig 1A) was microinjected into the Arc of adult POMC-Cre transgenic mice (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon transduction, Cre-expressing POMC neurons invert the ChR2-eYFP ORF in irreversible means and ChR2-eYFP proteins are expressed under control of the elongation factor 1 promoter (referred to as viral POMC-ChR2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed us to selectively stimulate Arc POMC neurons with blue light (473 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated the cell-type selectivity of this viral approach in coronal Arc sections of viral POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChR2-eYFP specifically colocalized with endogenous POMC neurons (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, 80% of POMC-positive neurons were positive for ChR2-eYFP in the virus injection sites (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the ChR2-eYFP expressing cells, 93% were colocalized by POMC immunostaining (Fig 1C), demonstrating high specificity of ChR2 expression in the POMC neurons of the Arc of the viral POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the functional impact of ChR2 activation in the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, the Arc was illuminated with blue light while the animal explored an open field chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the neuronal activity marker, immediate early gene cFos, was evaluated in the Arc of the viral POMC-ChR2 mice with or without optic stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity in the region of virus injection was increased by approximately sevenfold following blue light stimulation [cFos-positive neurons per section: laser off (n = 3 mice), 6.14 ± 1.27; laser on (n = 5 mice), 40.80 ± 3.74; unpaired two-tailed t test, t(6) = 6.83, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of cFos-positive cells, 77% were colabeled by ChR2-eYFP staining (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 6% of cFos-positive cells were colocalized in ChR2-eYFP staining in the no-stimulation group (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate selective and effective local activation of POMC neurons in the viral POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Transgenic_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To target ChR2 expression selectively in POMC progenitors, the POMC-Cre mouse line was crossed to a conditional mouse line containing Rosa26-CAG-stopflox-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring of the double transgenic mouse line are hereafter referred to as transgenic POMC-ChR2 (Tg POMC-ChR2) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult Tg POMC-ChR2 mice exhibited robust expression of ChR2-eYFP in the Arc (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that both POMC-positive (Fig 2C) and AgRP-positive (Fig 2D) neurons were detected in ChR2-eYFP expressing cells, indicating that the POMC-expressing lineage gives rise to two opposing neuronal populations in the Arc during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the view that embryonic POMC-expressing progenitors differentiate into AgRP/NPY expressing cells (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our immunostaining study revealed that this group of AgRP-positive neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors represents a subset of AgRP neurons in the Arc (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ex vivo, whole-cell current-clamp recording revealed that ChR2-eYFP-positive cells fired action potentials in response to repeated light-stimulation patterns used in the hot-plate and food intake tests of the current study (Fig 2 E and F), indicating that ChR2-expressing cells were capable of responding to light pulses during the entire behavioral testing sessions and they were well tolerant to light stimulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blue light stimulation of the Arc of Tg POMC-ChR2 mice induced a significant increase in cFos expression in the region below the implanted optic fiber [cFos-positive neurons per section: laser off (n = 3 mice), 4.06 ± 0.82; laser on (n = 3 mice), 49.17 ± 1.12; unpaired two-tailed t test, t(4) = 32.5, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty-one percent of ChR2-eYFP expressing neurons were activated in the light-stimulation group compared with 5% in the group without stimulation (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using triple-label immunostaining, we found that both POMC-positive and AgRP-positive neurons (Fig 2 H and I) were activated by light stimulation as assessed by induction of the cFos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that, in adult Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, ChR2 proteins are expressed in POMC or AgRP neurons and these two opposing neuronal populations are simultaneously activated by light stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rapid_Inhibition_of_Feeding_Behavior_in_Fasted_Viral_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined whether activating POMC neurons by optogenetic stimulation was sufficient to reduce food intake in viral POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food consumption was measured for 30 min each day for three consecutive days (day 1, blue laser off; day 2, blue laser on; day 3, blue laser off).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were food-deprived for 4 h each day before the food intake test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser stimulation parameters used on day 2 were 15-ms light pulses at 10 Hz for 30 s every minute for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of Arc POMC neurons in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice resulted in a significant reduction in food intake (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we studied the impact on pain regulation since this is one of the most classical and well-established effects of -endorphin (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latency for the mice to lick their paws was measured in the hot-plate test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral POMC-ChR2 mice showed an increased nociceptive threshold following light stimulation (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analgesic effect induced by light stimulation could be blocked by pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone (Fig 3C), suggesting that -endorphin was released by activation of Arc POMC neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that functional neuropeptides in POMC neurons can be released by light stimulation, and activation of Arc POMC neurons leads to acute inhibition of food intake in fasted animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rapid_and_Robust_Increase_in_Food_Intake_in_Tg_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, ChR2 protein was expressed in neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc including POMC- and AgRP-positive neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrated that both POMC and AgRP neurons are simultaneously activated by light stimulation in the Arc of Tg POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hot-plate and food intake tests were performed in this double transgenic mouse line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice by light stimulation induced an acute analgesic effect in the hot-plate test (Fig 4A), which could be blocked by pretreatment with naloxone (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that POMC neurons in the Tg POMC-ChR2 mice are functionally activated by optogenetic stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latency for single transgenic littermate control mice without ChR2-eYFP expression to lick their paws was unchanged following optogenetic stimulation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, Tg POMC-ChR2 mice displayed a vigorous increase in food intake in response to light stimulation in the Arc (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no change in food consumption in control mice following photostimulation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice leads to a dramatic increase in food intake, counteracting the effect of activation of POMC neurons in the same area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the orexigenic neurons that drive food consumption clearly override the anorexigenic neurons that inhibit feeding in this animal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distinct_Neuronal_Projections_Between_Viral_and_Tg_POMC-ChR2_Mice_Visualized_via_3D_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of recently developed brain transparency techniques permit the 3D visualization of fluorescent-labeled molecules in genetically modified animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CLARITY (1921) and iDISCO (22) methods are two such approaches capable of illuminating neuronal networks that may offer insight into brain connectivity in large millimeter-thick tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the potential association between behavior phenotypes and related brain circuitries, we implemented the CLARITY and iDISCO methods for the viral and Tg POMC-ChR2 animal brain samples, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, anti-GFP antibody-labeled fibers originating from the Arc were observed throughout the extent of analyzed samples (Fig 5 A and B and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that the Arc POMC neurons send efferent projections to various regions, including: (i) ventral to the median eminence; (ii) rostral to the medial preoptic nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the lateral and medial septum, and lateral habenular nucleus; (iii) dorsal to the thalamic periventricular nucleus; (iv) lateral to the amygdala; (v) caudal to the brainstem regions, including the periaqueductal gray; and (vi) ventrocaudal to the mammillary nucleus (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arc POMC neurons project extensively to paraventricular, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamic nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, anterior and periventricular hypothalamic areas and zona incerta also receive direct and dense inputs from the Arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band also receive direct projections from the Arc POMC neurons (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, in neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc of the Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, the majority of their projections remain within hypothalamic areas (Fig 6 A and B and Movies S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, anti-GFP antibody-labeled fibers were observed terminating in the paraventricular, periventricular, anterior, and the dorsomedial hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is remarkable that the most qualitatively robust innervation was seen within the lateral hypothalamic nucleus (Fig 6 A and B and Movies S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed the anti-GFP antibody-labeled signals in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Fig 6A) in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising, given that expression of POMC follows a dynamic pattern during development and POMC expression in some regions of an embryo is transient (23), including the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate distinct neuronal projection patterns in these two animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distinct_Neuronal_Activation_Patterns_Between_Viral_and_Tg_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the opposite effects on food intake between viral POMC-ChR2 and Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, we evaluated the neuronal activation as determined by cFos mRNA expression following light stimulation in the Arc in these two animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of POMC neurons of the Arc in viral POMC-ChR2 mice led to an increase in cFos in limited brain regions (Fig 5C), including cerebral cortex, lateral septum, PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamus, Arc, and the medial posterior part of the Arc (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice resulted in an intensive cFos response in broader areas of the brain (Fig 6C), including cerebral cortex, prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate-putamen (CPu), NAcc, septum, lateral thalamus, PVN, LH, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and Arc (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that this acute increase in food intake following activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice engages an extensive neuronal system in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Endogenous_Opioids_in_Increased_Feeding_in_Tg_POMC-ChR2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further investigated the role of endogenous opioids in increased food intake observed in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased feeding could be largely blocked by pretreatment with naloxone in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7A), indicating the driving force to consume food can be partially abolished by blocking opioid receptor signaling in this animal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following naloxone pretreatment, increased cFos mRNA expression in LH, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and the Arc was observed in response to light stimulation in the Arc of the Tg POMC-ChR2 mice (Fig 7B and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the induction of neuronal activity in the Arc and LH was reduced by 63% and 52%, respectively, following naloxone pretreatment (Arc: optical density of cFos induction 0.74 versus 0.27 relative to respective control; LH: optical density of cFos induction 0.21 versus 0.10 relative to respective control) (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally important, the cFos response in most brain regions was completely abolished by pretreatment with naloxone (Fig 7B and SI Appendix, Table S4), including cerebral cortex, PFC, CPu, NAcc, septum, PVN, and lateral thalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the acute increase in food intake following activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice is likely mediated by activation of the opioid receptor-signaling system with direct and indirect impact throughout the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we examined the relationship between cell-typespecific neuron activation and feeding behavior by optogenetic stimulation of both mature POMC neurons and neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc of the hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This body of work revealed the following main findings: (i) selective activation of POMC neurons rapidly inhibits feeding in food restricted animals; (ii) simultaneous activation of both POMC and orexigenic neurons derived from a common progenitor, including a subset of AgRP neurons, leads to a robust increase in feeding; (iii) 3D imaging delineates the projection pattern of adult hypothalamic POMC neurons versus the projection pattern of neurons derived from embryonic POMC-expressing cells that differentiate into POMC and a subset of the AgRP population; (iv) brain regions induced by activation of POMC alone and associated with reduced feeding include the cerebral cortex, lateral septum, PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and the Arc; (v) coupling of neuronal activation and pharmacological treatment shows that activation of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors engages an extensive neural network that involves the endogenous opioid system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the increased food intake was blunted by pretreatment with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by the normalization of neural activity in most of the activated brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, PFC, CPu, NAcc, septum, PVN, and lateral thalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Arc, posttranslational processing of the POMC prohormone results in two primary peptide products, -MSH and -endorphin (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Endorphin is involved in pain regulation (12) and -MSH mediates the anorexigenic effect on feeding (7, 2529).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, both viral POMC-ChR2 and Tg POMC-ChR2 mice showed an analgesic effect induced by light stimulation, demonstrating functional activation of POMC neurons in these two animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective stimulation of POMC neurons in viral POMC-ChR2 mice led to decreased food intake, consistent with the observation that the hypothalamic melanocortin pathway is involved in feeding behavior (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This acute inhibition of feeding in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice is also consistent with pharmacological studies (2529).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an -MSH agonist has a potent inhibitory effect on deprivation-induced food intake within 1 or 2 h (28, 29) when administrated in the PVN, a site that receives projections from Arc POMC neurons and where MC4-R expression is very high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our finding is in partial contrast with previous studies using optogenetic (30) or chemogenetic (31, 32) activation of POMC neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies demonstrate reduced food consumption, they report that the effect is not evident until 24 h of stimulation in ad libitum-fed mice (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility for this discrepancy is that we used a different light-stimulation pattern in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another difference is that our mice were fasted for 4 h, which may contribute to the more immediate effects of stimulation on feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that Arc POMC neurons exert faster regulation of satiety in food-motivated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is supported by a recent report that at least some Arc POMC neurons may act on faster time scales to reduce the drive to seek food (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of these pharmacological and opto- or chemogenetic studies would lead to a more complex view of the role of POMC in food regulation, whereby it would exert a long-term modulatory role based on metabolic status in the freely feeding animals, but is also active on shorter time scales during times when the animal is motivated to eat and the monitoring of food intake by these appetitive circuits is more critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not preclude other mechanisms that recruit POMC to induce eating cessation (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, activation of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors evoked voracious feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that in these animals, ChR2 is expressed in both POMC- and AgRP-positive neurons, and these two groups of neurons are simultaneously activated as determined by cFos protein induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The POMC neurons in the Arc were also functionally activated as evidenced by the pain regulation experiment in this animal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice demonstrates that activation of this subset group of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors overrides the anorexigenic effect contributed by POMC neuron activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons in the Arc exert opposing actions on feeding to maintain energy homeostasis in the body (8, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic and pharmacological evidence suggests that AgRP/NPY neurons promote feeding and increase body weight (810).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opto- or chemogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons promotes intense food consumption (30, 3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposing effects on food consumption following optogenetic activation in the transgenic and the viral models and their differences in potency stand in sharp contrast to the effects on analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, optogenetic stimulation in both the viral and the transgenic models produced comparable analgesic potency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because, in both cases, the analgesia is elicited from the activation of POMC neurons only, whereas the food regulation is the result of the relative power of POMC versus AgRP/NPY neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our finding of increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice suggests that mechanisms that increase satiety may not be as effective under conditions that enhance the inhibition of food consumption and oppose AgRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice can be largely blocked by pretreatment with the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, suggesting involvement of the opioid receptor-signaling system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other neural systems may also contribute to this increased food intake because naloxone did not completely block the increased food intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opioids are a family of peptides that differentially interact with three receptor classes (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anatomical studies have demonstrated that opioid receptors and peptides are widely distributed throughout the brain (38), including in a number of hypothalamic nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the wide distribution of opioid receptors and the presence of other neuropeptides in the vicinity of opioidergic pathways, opioids are in position to affect many aspects of feeding and energy homeostasis (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological studies have indicated that opioids stimulate food intake, whereas opioid antagonists are inhibitory (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that this increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice may not be solely due to the release of endogenous -endorphin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective activation of POMC neurons in unsated viral POMC-ChR2 mice induced a reduction of food intake despite the possibility that endogenous -endorphin was likely released as evidenced by an analgesic effect during the hot-plate test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the possible neural mechanisms whereby activation of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors led to increased food intake while selective activation of POMC neurons resulted in decreased food intake using cFos mRNA as a marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective activation of POMC neurons in viral POMC-ChR2 mice led to neural activation in limited brain regions that are typically thought of as regulating food intake (41), including cerebral cortex, lateral septum, PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and Arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classic lesion studies in PVN, dorsomedial, or ventromedial hypothalamus induced hyperphagia and obesity, while electrical stimulation increased food intake (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found increased neural activity in cerebral cortex and lateral septum following stimulation of Arc POMC neurons, indicating their possible involvement in regulating food intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice resulted in an intensive cFos response in broader areas of the brain thought to modulate feeding behavior (8, 4244), including cerebral cortex, PFC, NAcc, septum, PVN, LH, and dorsomedial hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the neuronal activity in cerebral cortex, PFC, CPu, NAcc, septum, and PVN was normalized by pretreatment with naloxone, while the neuronal activity of the LH was reduced by 52% with the same pretreatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these responsive regions, such as the PFC, the NAcc, and the LH, have connections with reward systems and motivated behavior that modulate feeding (4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, activation of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the PFC increases food intake (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NAcc functions as a major projection area for food reward and motivation in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LH is known to be a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motivated feeding behavior in corticostriatalhypothalamic circuitry (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the activation of the subset of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice may influence the rewarding characteristics of food and/or the motivational component of feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also investigated the architecture of neural circuits specifically originating from Arc peptidergic neurons on a brain-wide scale in these two animal models via 3D visualization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, CLARITY processing showed that Arc POMC neurons project to a number of brain regions (SI Appendix, Table S1), consistent with previous anatomical studies (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our detailed mapping of Arc POMC neuronal connectivity points to functional studies on the roles and circuit mechanisms underlying the regulation of feeding in these areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent diffuse projections of Arc POMC terminals observed suggest that POMC participates in the regulation of food consumption not only through hypothalamic structures, but also extrahypothalamic nuclei, including the amygdala, zona incerta, and lateral septum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the amygdala is of interest as it is an area implicated in emotional aspects of feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have also shown that activation of zona incerta GABAergic neurons results in rapid binge-like eating behavior (48), while inactivation of lateral septum neurons blunts ventral hippocampus-induced suppression of feeding (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still not fully understood how the inputs from Arc POMC neurons affect the neuronal physiology in these brain regions or their potential regulation of feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, a seemingly greater intensity of hypothalamic eYFP signal in the Tg POMC-ChR2 mice necessitated diminishing the comparatively less intense extrahypothalamic projections through the image threshold function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the 3D visualization of neuronal projections in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice highlights the extensive neuronal communication between the Arc and lateral hypothalamic nucleus which is at the center of feeding control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, the POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc differentiate into two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations to influence feeding behavior in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the differences in food intake are associated with distinct projection and activation patterns of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing lineages compared with adult hypothalamic POMC neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translational applications that aim to control appetite likely need to target the activation rather than the inhibition mechanisms and to modulate either the AgRP system itself or its downstream mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice can be blunted by the opioid antagonist naloxone coupled with the normalization of neuronal activity in brain regions involved in reward and motivation highlights the potential value of targeting opioid receptor signaling to control feeding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Behavioral_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All behavioral tests were conducted at least 3-wk postsurgery during the same circadian period (09001600).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were handled and attached to the optical fiber without photostimulation for 4 d before behavioral tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the hot-plate test, the latency (in seconds) for the mice to lick their paws was measured (cutoff time, 60 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 3 consecutive testing days, mice were connected to the optical fiber and placed in an empty mouse cage for 5 min (day 1, blue laser off; day 2, blue laser on; day 3, blue laser off).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately following this 5-min period, mice were then tested on the hot plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue laser stimulation (15-ms pulses, 10 Hz, 4.3 mW on the tip of fiber) on day 2 continued until the completion of the test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For naloxone pretreatment studies, mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline or naloxone HCl (10 mg/kg) 15 min before laser stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the regular food intake test, mice had ad libitum access to standard laboratory pellet food in the home cage before and after tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was tested at the same time each day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food consumption was measured for 30 min for 3 consecutive days (day 1, laser off; day 2, blue laser on; day 3, blue laser off).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser stimulation parameters used on day 2 were 15-ms light pulses at 10 Hz for 30 s every minute for 30 min with 4.3 mW light power on the tip of fiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For naloxone pretreatment in the Tg POMC-ChR2 mouse line, animals were injected intraperitoneally with saline or naloxone (2 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg) 15 min before laser stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the food intake test in viral POMC-ChR2 mice, animals were food deprived for 4 h with water freely available before the regular food intake test each day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser stimulation on day 2 was the same as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed information is provided in SI Appendix, SI Material and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Three-Dimensional_Visualization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For 3D imaging of immunofluorescence in viral POMC-ChR2 mice, the CLARITY procedure (1921) was followed (SI Appendix, SI Material and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 3D imaging of immunofluorescence in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, the iDISCO method (22) was followed (SI Appendix, SI Material and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLARITY optimized light sheet microscope (COLM) was used to acquire the images (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tiles of acquired image stacks were stitched together using TeraStitcher and subsequently visualized in 2D through orthoslice mode and in 3D through maximum intensity projection volume rendering mode using Amira 3D software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

cFos_mRNA_Expression_Following_Optogenetic_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all cFos mRNA response experiments, mice received 6 min of either blue laser stimulation (10 Hz, 15-ms pulses, 4.3 mW on the tip of fiber) or no laser stimulation in the open field chamber, and then were returned to their home cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed by rapid decapitation 30 min after the onset of laser stimulation and their brains were dissected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For naloxone pretreatment in the Tg POMC-ChR2 mouse line, animals were injected intraperitoneally with naloxone (10 mg/kg) 15 min before laser stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ hybridization (ISH) methodology was performed as previously described (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details see SI Appendix, SI Material and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) software or R software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental animals demonstrating inaccurate viral injection or cannula sites were excluded from the present study since these subjects lacked expression of the reporter gene or neuronal activity marker cFos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These validation parameters were established before data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the naloxone pretreatment study on feeding behavior in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, a multilevel regression model (also known as a hierarchical linear model or a mixed-effects model) was used to assess the effects of light, naloxone treatment, and naloxone dosage on food intake, while accounting for within-subjects design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses were performed in R (R v.3.3.0: https://cran.r-project.org; RStudio v.0.99.896: www.rstudio.com/) using the lme() function in the nlme package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) with a default correlation structure (no within-group correlation) and method (restricted maximum likelihood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model included the fixed effects of the factors light (reference level = off), naloxone treatment (reference level = no naloxone), and dosage (reference level = 2 mg/kg), as well as a conditional effect of dosage on naloxone treatment (naloxone × dosage), with repeated measures accounted for by including individual subjects as a random effects variable (random intercept).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
