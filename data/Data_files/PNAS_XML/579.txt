Structural insights into the activation mechanism of dynamin-like EHD ATPases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eps15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15)-homology domain containing proteins (EHDs) are molecular machines that use the energy of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis to remodel shallow membranes into highly curved membrane tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity is required in many cellular membrane trafficking pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we have determined a high-resolution structure of an EHD machine in the active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure indicates how EHDs assemble at the membrane surface into ring-like scaffolds that deform the underlying membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing this active state with a previously determined autoinhibited conformation, we can deduce the mechanistic details how recruitment of EHDs to membranes is regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison with other membrane-associated molecular machines reveals commonalities and differences in the activation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eps15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15)-homology domain containing proteins (EHDs) comprise a family of dynamin-related mechano-chemical ATPases involved in cellular membrane trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have revealed the structure of the EHD2 dimer, but the molecular mechanisms of membrane recruitment and assembly have remained obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we determined the crystal structure of an amino-terminally truncated EHD4 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the EHD2 structure, the helical domains are 50° rotated relative to the GTPase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using electron paramagnetic spin resonance (EPR), we show that this rotation aligns the two membrane-binding regions in the helical domain toward the lipid bilayer, allowing membrane interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A loop rearrangement in GTPase domain creates a new interface for oligomer formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the EHD4 structure represents the active EHD conformation, whereas the EHD2 structure is autoinhibited, and reveal a complex series of domain rearrangements accompanying activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison with other peripheral membrane proteins elucidates common and specific features of this activation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystal_Structure_of_the_EHD4_Dimer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain mechanistic insights into the activation mechanism of EHD proteins, we expressed and purified an N-terminally truncated EHD4 variant (amino acids 22541, EHD4N; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that this variant may mimic the situation when EHDs are activated by membrane recruitment and release their N terminus from the GTPase domain (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An EHD4 full-length construct was insoluble when expressed in Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to EHD2, EHD4N bound to the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5-(-thio)-triphosphate (ATPS) with a micromolar affinity in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, EHD4N cosedimented with liposomes derived from bovine brain (Folch) lipids (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane binding resulted in liposome tubulation, and regular EHD4N oligomers were formed at the surface of the lipid tubules (Fig 1B and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the slow ATPase activity of EHD4N was 200-fold stimulated by the addition of Folch liposomes (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulated ATPase rate of EHD4N is sevenfold higher compared with EHD2 under identical conditions (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When C-terminally GFP-tagged EHD4 was overexpressed in HeLa cells, it localized to endosomal structures that partially overlapped with early endosomal antigen1 (EEA1) (Fig 1D, Left and Fig S2, see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminally truncated EHD4 variant showed increased membrane association (Fig 1D, Right, quantified in Fig S1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many membranous structures appeared tubulated in these cells, pointing to an increased membrane remodelling activity of EHD4N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that EHD2 and EHD4 use related mechanisms of membrane recruitment and oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the N-terminal residues appear to negatively control membrane recruitment in both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For EHD4N, crystals of the same space group were obtained in the presence of ATPS and ADP and diffracted to a maximal resolution of 2.8 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined to Rwork/Rfree of 22.7%/24.3% and 20.8%/25.0%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides minor changes in the nucleotide binding site, both structures were essentially identical, with a rms deviation (rmsd) of 0.30 Å for all built C atoms (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If not otherwise mentioned, we refer in the following to the higher resolution ATPS-bound structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall architecture of EHD4N is similar to that of AMPPNP-bound EHD2 (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the GTPase domains of EHD4 and EHD2 show a highly related fold (rmsd of 0.92 Å for 194 aligned C atoms; Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They form a dimer via an interface involving helix 6, including Arg234, Tyr236, and Trp241 (Fig 1E and Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interface is highly conserved in EHD proteins (Fig S4) (14), but not in other dynamin-related proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electron density for ATPS and ADP was clearly discernible in the nucleotide-binding pocket (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Switch I in the ATPS-bound EHD4N structure adopts a different conformation compared with EHD2 (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the completely invariant Thr97 (Thr94 in EHD2), which coordinates the Mg2+ ion in EHD2 (14) and, in analogy to dynamin (21), may position a catalytic water molecule for nucleotide hydrolysis, points away from the nucleotide in the EHD4N structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reorientation of switch I may be caused by a newly formed contact of Arg138 from the rearranged KPF loop (see below) with the main chain of Thr96 in switch I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ADP-bound structure, switch I is disordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest an ATP-dependent conformational cross-talk between the KPF loop and the nucleotide-binding site in EHD proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EH domains were not resolved in the electron densities, despite being present in the crystallized construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDS/PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals showed no hints for proteolytic degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that the EH domains are disordered in the crystals and do not bind to their autoinhibitory site on top of the GTPase domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Large-Scale_Rotation_of_the_Helical_Domain_Promotes_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The helical domain of EHD4N has an almost identical architecture as its counterpart in EHD2 (rmsd of 0.67 Å for 142 C atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared with EHD2, it is rotated by 50° relative to the GTPase domain around a hinge featuring the invariant Pro289 (Fig 2A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rotation pushes the N-terminal residues of the linker to the EH domain 12 Å away (Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the EHD2 structure, the linker makes prominent contacts to the GTPase domain and binds via a GPF motif to the EH domain of the opposing monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotation may thus displace the linker, therefore releasing the EH domain from its autoinhibitory site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also reorients the membrane binding site in 9 including Thr320, Val321, Phe322, and Lys328, which, in EHD2, were shown to directly interact with the membrane (16) (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the consequences for membrane binding, we used the previously established EPR assay for EHD2 as a model for the EHD family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, a single paramagnetic spin probe is attached to a single cysteine introduced at a specific site in an otherwise cysteine-free EHD2 variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accessibility of the spin label toward paramagnetic spin colliders, such as oxygen and nickel ethylenediamine diacetic acid (NiEDDA), can provide information on the membrane immersion of the spin label (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this assay, we now demonstrate that not only the N-terminal part of 9 at the tip of the stalk, but also Gln330, Leu331, and Leu333 at the C-terminal end of 9, contribute to membrane binding (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that Cys356 in the adjacent helix 11 directly interacts with the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Val337 and A340 in 10, which is bent away from 9 and 11, did not penetrate into the membrane (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the membrane interaction site in EHD proteins extends along the parallel helices 9 and 11, which, together with the entire helical domain, move en bloc during activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the autoinhibited EHD2 structure, the membrane binding sites from two opposing monomers point away from each other (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the EHD4N structure, the lipid binding regions reorient in a parallel fashion toward the membrane surface for binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the EHD4N structure represents a membrane-binding competent, active conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Switch_in_the_GTPase_Domains_Allows_Oligomerization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the EHD2 structure, the helical domains form several salt bridges to the GTPase domain of the same monomer (Fig 3A, black box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding salt bridges are broken in the EHD4N structure (Fig 3B, black box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that the N-terminal 8 aa in the autoinhibited EHD2 dimer fold back into a hydrophobic pocket of the GTPase domain (Fig 3A) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EHD4N, the hydrophobic pocket in the GTPase domain is occupied by the adjacent KPF loop, which undergoes a large-scale reorientation (Fig 3B, blue box, Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conserved residues in this loop, such as Phe125, Leu128 and Phe131, anchor the helix into this pocket, whereas in the auto-inhibited EHD2 structure, the highly conserved Trp4 and Met5 of the N terminus (Fig S4) occupy the equivalent space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that during the activation process, the KPF loop switches into the hydrophobic binding pocket of the GTPase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When analyzing the crystal packing, we noticed that EHD4N dimers assembled in a linear fashion in the crystals (Fig 4A and Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these oligomers, the membrane binding sites of the helical domain were oriented in the same direction, suggesting a physiologically plausible assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligomer had the same width (90 Å) as single EHD4 filaments sometimes observed on tubulated liposomes (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the GTPase domains of adjacent EHD4N dimers directly opposed each other via the highly conserved G interface, although they were separated by a small gap (Fig 4A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously proposed a similar oligomerization model for EHD2, but without the rotation of the helical domains (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When analyzing the oligomerization determinants in these linear EHD4N assemblies, we found that the rearranged KPF loop interacted via a highly conserved interface with the helical domain of the adjacent dimer (Fig 4B and Fig S7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the involvement of this new interface for oligomerization, we aimed to disrupt it by introducing the F125A and K302A/R305A mutations in EHD4N (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mutants still bound to liposomes (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the F125A completely lost its ability to remodel membranes, the K302A/R305A mutant showed reduced remodeling of membranes, as indicated by the formation of less and irregular membrane tubules (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mutants showed slightly increased basal ATPase rates, which, however, were not or only to a minor extent stimulated by the addition of liposomes (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these N-terminal deletion variants were overexpressed in HeLa cells, they showed a severe loss of membrane recruitment (Fig 4E and Fig S1 D and E), and similar results were previously obtained for the F122A mutant of EHD2 (corresponding to F125A in EHD4; Fig S4) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also attempted to stabilize the oligomerization interface in full-length EHD4 by introducing the A116L and N133D mutations to enhance hydrophobic interactions and create an additional salt bridge to Lys302, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When expressed in HeLa cells, the single mutants showed similar membrane recruitment compared with EHD4 (Fig S1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the double mutant showed greatly enhanced membrane recruitment, consistent with an increased oligomerization activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that upon membrane recruitment and release of the N terminus, the KPF loop switches into the hydrophobic pocket of the GTPase domains and promotes oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A contact of the rearranged KPF loop with the open helical domain of the adjacent EHD dimer contributes to the regular assembly of EHDs on membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Membrane-associated assembly processes of peripheral membrane proteins are challenging to study at the structural level, and only in very few cases, high-resolution structures of such proteins in the autoinhibited and the activated, oligomerized form have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By removing the autoinhibitory N-terminal sequence, we obtained a membrane-binding and oligomerization-competent conformation of EHD4, which we consider as the active conformation [see also related manuscript by Hoernke et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the membrane binding sites in the previous EHD2 structure were oriented away from the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore refer to the EHD2 structure as an autoinhibited conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison between the active and autoinhibited form reveals a complex domain rearrangement in EHD proteins accompanying activation, resulting in an activation model for EHDs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the autoinhibited cytosolic form, the N terminus is locked in the GTPase domain and the EH domains block the assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon membrane recruitment, a series of conformational changes is triggered: (i) The N terminus of EHDs is released from the GTPase domain and may switch into the membrane (Fig S7B for further discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch appears to activate EHDs because the EHD4N construct is in the active conformation even in the absence of membranes and in both the ATP- and ADP-bound states (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The helical domains rotate around the conserved Pro289.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar rotation mechanism was observed for dynamin and suggested to act as a power stroke (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the domain rotation of the helical domains in EHDs appears to regulate membrane binding by adjusting the position of the membrane-binding site in 9 and 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Concomitant with the rotation of the helical domain, the linker to the EH domain is dislodged from the GTPase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the EH domains are displaced from their autoinhibitory site on the GTPase domain, as observed in the EHD4N structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells, this release may be further promoted by interactions of the EH domain with NPF motif-containing binding partners, such as syndapins/PACSINs (9, 12) and MICAL-L1 (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Our structural analysis indicates that the KPF loop moves into the hydrophobic pocket of the GTPase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loop creates a new assembly interface with the helical domain of the adjacent EHD dimer, therefore stabilizing the active conformation and promoting oligomerization of EHDs at the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (v) In addition, the nucleotide-loading state of EHDs may affect the activation by nucleotide-dependent stabilization of the N-terminal loop or the KPF loop in the GTPase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this hypothesis, the KPF loop and switch I interact in an ATP-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the removal of the EH domain tail from the active site may allow the ATP-dependent oligomerization of EHDs in ring-like structures via the conserved G-interface, which could explain the strict ATP dependency of assembly (Movie S2) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such assembly would facilitate (vi) a direct coupling of EHD oligomerization with the creation of membrane curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas the overall architecture of EHDs is related to dynamin, the oligomerization modes of these proteins differ fundamentally: Oligomerization of dynamin/MxA/DNM1L in helical filaments is mediated by three assembly interfaces in the helical stalk (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GTPase domains contribute to assembly by mediating GTPase-dependent contacts between adjacent filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis can induce the rearrangement of adjacent filaments assembled via the stalk, leading to constriction of the underlying membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, EHDs use a unique interface in the GTPase domain for dimerization and use the ATP-dependent G interface for further oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contacts between the GTPase domain and the helical domain of the next dimer contribute to oligomer formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The architecture of the EHD oligomers excludes a nucleotide-driven sliding mechanism because nucleotide-dependent contacts are formed within and not between adjacent filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the assembly mode is well suited for the stabilization of membrane curvature by oligomerizing into ring-like tubular oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the involvement of different domains, there are striking parallels in the activation mechanisms of EHDs and dynamin (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the autoinhibited dynamin tetramer, an intramolecular contact of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with the oligomerization surface of the stalk prevents the assembly in the cytosol (25), whereas an autoinhibitory contact of the C-terminal EH domain with the GTPase domains takes over this function in EHDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such intramolecular inhibitory contacts are also observed in other peripheral or integral membrane proteins, such as BAR-domain containing proteins (26, 27), SNAREs (28), ESCRT-III (29), or the WASP protein (30) (Fig S8 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of specific elements to membranes or interaction partners shifts the equilibrium toward the active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of new interactions in the membrane-bound oligomer is accompanied by the loss of intramolecular interactions in the autoinhibited dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such mechanism may allow reversibility of membrane recruitment and oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our study elucidates a complex activation mechanism of EHD family proteins, revealing common and specific features how peripheral membrane proteins scaffold cellular membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For membrane tubulation assays, 10 µM EHD4N in 25 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 1 mg/mL liposomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were spotted on carbon-coated copper grids (Plano) and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron grids were imaged with a transmission electron microscope at 80 kV (EM 910; Zeiss) and acquisition was done with a CCD camera (Quemesa; Olympus Viewing System).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EPR_Power_Saturation_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These experiments were carried out as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 at a concentration of 2 g/L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessibilities to O2 (from air, Ox) and 10 mM NiEDDA (NiEDDA) were obtained from power saturation experiments by using a Bruker EMX X-Band ESR spectrometer fitted with ER4123D dielectric resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth parameter  was calculated from  = ln[Ox/NiEDDA] (16) and the membrane insertion depth was obtained as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

HeLa cells (ATCC-CRM-CCL-2) were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For confocal imaging, 80,000 cells were seeded on 1.5 high tolerance glass coverslips 25 mm (Warner Instruments) 24 h before transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD4-mCherry constructs were transiently transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions 1624 h before the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microscope stage and objective lenses were maintained at 37 °C within an environmental chamber supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired with a Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disk Confocal controlled by ZEN interface with an Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope, equipped with a CSU-X1A 5000 Spinning Disk Unit and a EMCCD camera iXon Ultra from ANDOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were imaged in DMEM lacking Phenol Red (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For epifluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in 3% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, then washed and blocked in 5% (vol/vol) goat serum with 0.05% saponin in PBS before staining with mouse anti-EEA1 (clone 14, 610456, BD Biosciences) in 1% goat serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS using standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired by using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 system with Zen software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative microscopic images were cropped by using ImageJ (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Analysis_and_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SDs of the image histogram from maximum intensity projections of confocal stacks were used to measure the textures of the different mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A ROI of fixed size was applied within an area with representative texture and the SDs of the gray values were measured by using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis was performed byusing Prism5 (GraphPad Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
