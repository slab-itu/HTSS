Molecular hydrogen and catalytic combustion in the production of hyperpolarized 83Kr and 129Xe MRI contrast agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high signal intensity associated with magnetic resonance of hyperpolarized 129Xe has enabled countless applications ranging from materials science to biomedical MRI of the lung and brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New modalities are constantly emerging; for example, hyperpolarized 129Xe biosensors are of potential interest for molecular imaging of biomarker distribution in organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperpolarized 83Kr shows promise as novel surface-sensitive contrast agent for pulmonary MRI but previous work was limited to excised lungs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work reports a previously unexplored approach in the generation of hyperpolarized contrast agents that makes highly concentrated hyperpolarized 83Kr available for the first time, to our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results also provide the basis for on-demand flow production of highly concentrated hyperpolarized 129Xe for in situ process monitoring and in vivo molecular imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hyperpolarized (hp) 83Kr is a promising MRI contrast agent for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases affecting the surface of the respiratory zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the distinct physical properties of 83Kr that enable unique MRI contrast also complicate the production of hp 83Kr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work presents a previously unexplored approach in the generation of hp 83Kr that can likewise be used for the production of hp 129Xe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular nitrogen, typically used as buffer gas in spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP), was replaced by molecular hydrogen without penalty for the achievable hyperpolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this particular study, the highest obtained nuclear spin polarizations were P = 29% for 83Kr and P = 63% for 129Xe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were reproduced over many SEOP cycles despite the laser-induced on-resonance formation of rubidium hydride (RbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following SEOP, the H2 was reactively removed via catalytic combustion without measurable losses in hyperpolarized spin state of either 83Kr or 129Xe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly spin-polarized 83Kr can now be purified for the first time, to our knowledge, to provide high signal intensity for the advancement of in vivo hp 83Kr MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, a chemical reaction appears as a viable alternative to the cryogenic separation process, the primary purification method of hp 129Xe for the past 2 1/2 decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inherent simplicity of the combustion process will facilitate hp 129Xe production and should allow for on-demand continuous flow of purified and highly spin-polarized 129Xe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows the 129Xe nuclear spin polarization, P, as a function of gas pressure after 6 min of SEOP of a mixture of 5% Xe and 95% Kr at an external cell temperature of 378 K. The spin polarization is similar to data produced previously with a 5% Xe95% N2 mixture under almost identical conditions described and analyzed in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39, also shown in Fig 1A for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using H2 buffer gas, hp 129Xe with up to P = 63% was generated within 6 min of SEOP at 70 kPa total gas pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using 5% krypton in 95% buffer gas, the highest 83Kr polarization of P = 29%, obtained with H2 after 11 min of SEOP at 440 K, is comparable to that obtained previously with N2 under similar conditions (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On-Resonance_Rubidium_Hydride_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high spin-polarization values for 83Kr with the H2 in Fig 1A were achieved repeatedly for more than 30 h of SEOP over a time span of about 1 wk and for 129Xe over a duration of at least 6 h of continuous SEOP despite the formation of rubidium hydrides (RbH) during on-resonance D1 laser irradiation (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  a white RbH deposition was observed on all SEOP cell surfaces but to a lesser extent at the laser entry window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, SEOP cell recycling, causing substantial removal of the RbH, was possible by increasing the temperature to 480 K for about 30 min with ongoing laser irradiation while the cell was connected, via a Rb trap, to a vacuum pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although excessive RbH buildup on the cell entry window will reduce laser irradiation, deposition on other cell surfaces may not necessarily adversely affect the achievable noble gas spin polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work demonstrated that the 131Xe T1 relaxation time increases for this spin I = 3/2 isotope because of RbH buildup (4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RbH surface coating may therefore also reduce the 83Kr T1 relaxation rates and improve SEOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed study by Cates and coworkers explored the effect of RbH surface deposition on the T1 relaxation of 129Xe as a function of field strength (0.08 T) and temperature (340 K) in a spherical 25-mm-diameter cell (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the results one may interpolate 129Xe T1 times in excess of 400 s at the conditions used in the current work, causing little interference during rapid SEOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H2_as_Radiation_Quenching_Agent  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high polarization values obtained with H2 in Fig 1A, i.e., in the absence of any N2, are remarkable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on SEOP temperature, the gas mixtures usually contain at least a partial pressure of 5 kPa of molecular nitrogen for radiation quenching to prevent radiation trapping of arbitrarily polarized fluorescence photons that severely reduce Rb polarization (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work investigating the efficacy of H2 to quench Rb radiation found that the effective cross-sections for quenching of the D1 and D2 transitions are about 1 order of magnitude smaller for H2 than for N2 (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An empirical model of radiation quenching with H2 is reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52 but is limited to buffer gas pressures below 7 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, H2 has found little consideration as quenching agent at high gas density and temperature conditions typically used for SEOP production of hp 129Xe or hp 83Kr for MRI applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The measurement of D1 fluorescence at 795 nm, obscured by high-power laser radiation, is experimentally very demanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the Rb D2 fluorescence during SEOP was straightforwardly monitored in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixing cross-sections between the electronic states Rb*52P1/2 and Rb*52P3/2 are comparable for H2 and N2 (42) and the D2 fluorescence should therefore provide at least qualitative insights into D1 radiation quenching efficiency of the molecular hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B demonstrates that H2 serves as a remarkably efficient radiation quenching agent at partial pressures above 4060 kPa, where little fluorescence was detected during SEOP even at the very high temperature of 433 K. Therefore, H2 can be used as radiation quenching agent during SEOP but the required partial pressure is about 10 times higher than that for N2, in agreement with previous measurements of quenching cross-section in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below this critical partial pressure, radiation quenching is largely incomplete and a substantial difference in the D2 fluorescence is observed between SEOP of 129Xe and 83Kr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B depicts a higher fluorescence count at the elevated temperature used for 83Kr SEOP (in the 433440-K range) where the Rb density is almost 20-fold increased compared with that for 129Xe SEOP at 378 K. At low buffer gas pressure, where radiation quenching is incomplete, the high Rb density for 83Kr SEOP produces significantly more radiation trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of the increased radiation trapping can be observed in Fig 1A where, at buffer gas pressures below 50 KPa, the noble gas polarization obtained through SEOP with H2 falls short compared with that with N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Rb density on radiation trapping was previously studied at extremely low H2 partial pressure (less_than0.1Pa) for the purpose of SEOP of dissociated atomic hydrogen (4346).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, radiation quenching is effectively nonexistent and radiation trapping can be limited only by keeping the Rb densities very low through SEOP temperatures around or below 318 K. In the current work, no adverse effect of H2 as buffer gas at SEOP pressures above 4050 kPa (with the exception of reversible RbH formation, discussed above) was found compared with SEOP with N2 under otherwise identical conditions, regardless of the temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the high IR quenching cross-section of H2 is a rare exception among small molecules without chemical double or triple bonds and Fig 1 includes data obtained with CH4 as buffer gas for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inefficient small quenching cross-section of CH4 (53) causes a high IR count (Fig 1B) and a correspondingly low 129Xe spin polarization below that of hp 83Kr (Fig 1A), a problem that was previously solved using a ternary mixture of 5% Xe, 85% CH4, and 10% N2 (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Buffer_Gas_Removal_Through_Catalytic_Combustion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient SEOP of noble gases in H2 mixtures opens a path for oxidative buffer gas elimination that produces H2O as the only reaction product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the generated water vapor can straightforwardly be removed through condensation at ambient temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting gas phase is composed of the purified hp noble gas in addition to a small remaining quantity of the water vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work demonstrated qualitatively the feasibility of hp 129Xe MRI (54) of a methane combustion zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the effect of catalytic hydrogen combustion on the noble gas spin polarization, an experimental setup was devised as sketched in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shuttling of hp noble gasH2 mixture into the reactor chamber that contained a small quantity of Pt and monitoring the signal decay over time through NMR spectroscopy at 9.4 T provided the baseline data, shown as open circles in Fig 3B, for hp 129Xe and in Fig 4B for hp 83Kr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For oxidative H2 removal, O2 was added, which led to hydrogen combustion within less_than100 ms due to the presence of the Pt catalyst, as depicted in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactor pressure during this process was monitored (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 4A) but potential short pressure increases during the reaction were not detected at the time resolution of the pressure gauge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon adding O2, slightly above the stoichiometric ratio, the pressure decreased within 15 s as the sole reaction product, H2O, had condensed rapidly upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature increase measured outside the reactor was limited to 5 K and the final reactor pressure of 4.7 ± 0.5 kPa was close to that expected from the combined water vapor pressure at ambient temperature (3.2 kPa at 298 K) and the noble gas partial pressure (1.21.3 kPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monitoring the hp 129Xe signal intensity (Fig 3B), an initial signal increase was observed upon O2 delivery, caused by hp 129Xe influx from the connecting tubing [i.e., perfluoroalkoxy polymer (PFA) tubing with 1.6-mm inner diameter] that was pushed into the reaction chamber by the oxygen gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 20 s, gas convection and diffusion returned the signal intensity approximately to the baseline value, indicating that the nuclear spin state had experienced no significant depolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after the reaction, the 129Xe relaxation was accelerated due to a small excess of paramagnetic O2 (approximately 0.7 kPa partial pressure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the O2 excess to 7.5 ± 0.5 kPa led to further accelerated 129Xe signal decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hp 83Kr data in Fig 4B demonstrate that combustion caused no signal loss and, in contrast to 129Xe, the 83Kr gas-phase relaxation slowed down after the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease of the 83Kr T1 relaxation was likely a consequence of competitive coadsorption of water molecules on the reactor surface that have been found previously to reduce krypton surface interactions (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very low gyromagnetic ratio makes 83Kr insensitive to paramagnetic relaxation even at higher (7.5 ± 0.5 kPa) oxygen partial pressure (Fig 4B) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial short-term signal increase upon O2 gas delivery, present in the 129Xe data, was not observed because hp 83Kr located in the connecting PFA tubing depolarized due to fast quadrupolar T1 relaxation in the presence of the fluorocarbon surface (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The capability to almost instantaneously remove a buffer gas that serves as an efficient radiation quenching agent during SEOP allows, for the first time to our knowledge, for the generation of purified, highly spin-polarized 83Kr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the method may be of interest for a fully automated hp 129Xe production at reduced costs without the need for cryogenic operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the low total gas pressure after catalytic buffer gas removal, the hp gases will require recompression to ambient pressure for biomedical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recompression has previously been demonstrated with little polarization loss for hp 129Xe (10, 40) and acceptable 1/4 polarization loss for hp 83Kr (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the result in this work, this would suggest that purified hp 83Kr with 21% spin polarization is now feasible, a sevenfold improvement over recent hp 83Kr work with 3% apparent polarization that already allowed for MRI with 0.795 × 0.635-mm2 resolution in ex vivo lungs (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the experimental setting was for the sole purpose of proof of concept demonstration and can be substituted by combustion under continuous flow within a catalytic converter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, direct contact between H2 and O2 may be avoidable through the use of recyclable metal oxides similar to those used in chemical looping combustion (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactive H2 removal may take place in a small flow-through catalytic converter placed downstream from the SEOP cell that would facilitate gas transport through the generated pressure gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kimura, Imai, Fujiwara, and coworkers used a peristaltic pump for continuous hp 129Xe recompression after continuous flow SEOP at low pressures (6, 10, 33), a concept that could be further extended by flow-through catalytic buffer gas removal before recompression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enabling on-demand production of an uninterrupted, continuous flow of hp 129Xe at high spin polarization and purity, this concept should be of high value for a variety of applications ranging from material science to biomedical MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If required, hp 129Xe could also be stored before recompression (and even before H2 removal), using the extraordinary slow T1 relaxation of 129Xe described in the past for gas phase xenon under certain conditions (5860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a final note, the presented concept does not involve any toxic reagents or reaction products and the complete absence of nitrogen and carbon prevents any accidental generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) during combustion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any H2 passing through the buffer gas removal step, however unlikely, can straightforwardly be detected through reliable hydrogen microsensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEOP was conducted at 0.04-T field strength in a 75-cm3 cylindrical borosilicate cell (120 mm long, 28-mm inner diameter) using a Comet module (Spectra Physics) laser with a 0.25-nm linewidth producing 23-W incident power at the SEOP cell entrance window under very similar conditions as described in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of 5% Xe (or 5% Kr) in H2 was used for all experiment in this work with natural abundance noble gas isotope distribution (i.e., 26.4% 129Xe and 11.5% 83Kr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spin polarization was determined as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39 (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6) and a general expression for polarization of I  1/2 spin systems is discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor the Rb D2 fluorescence during SEOP at 780 nm, an HR2000+ Ocean Optics spectrometer was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All catalytic combustion experiments took place in a 1.5-mm glass wall vessel that contained 25 mg Pt/Al2O3 catalyst powder (i.e., 5 wt % dry loading Pt on alumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard safety precautions were followed and the H2hp noble gas mixture was delivered to the reactor at pressures below 30 kPa to limit temperature and pressure bursts that could compromise reactor integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactor pressure was metered using a gas composition independent diaphragm gauge (OmegaDYNE Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
