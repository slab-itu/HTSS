Highly specific SNP detection using 2D graphene electronics and DNA strand displacement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe the first, to our knowledge, integrated dynamic DNA nanotechnology and 2D material electronics to overcome current limitations for the detection of DNA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical detection of DNA has been advancing rapidly to achieve high specificity, sensitivity, and portability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the actual implementation of DNA detection is still in infancy because of low specificity, especially for analytically optimal and practically useful length of target DNA strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the research to date has focused on the enhancement of the sensitivity of DNA biosensors, whereas the specificity problem has remained unsolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low specificity is primarily attributed to the nonspecific binding during hybridization of the probe and the target DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have addressed these limitations by designing a functional prototype of electrical biosensors for SNP detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene sequence are markers for a variety of human diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of SNPs with high specificity and sensitivity is essential for effective practical implementation of personalized medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current DNA sequencing, including SNP detection, primarily uses enzyme-based methods or fluorophore-labeled assays that are time-consuming, need laboratory-scale settings, and are expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously reported electrical charge-based SNP detectors have insufficient specificity and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the use of a DNA strand displacement-based probe on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) for high-specificity, single-nucleotide mismatch detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single mismatch was detected by measuring strand displacement-induced resistance (and hence current) change and Dirac point shift in a graphene FET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNP detection in large double-helix DNA strands (e.g., 47 nt) minimize false-positive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our electrical sensor-based SNP detection technology, without labeling and without apparent cross-hybridization artifacts, would allow fast, sensitive, and portable SNP detection with single-nucleotide resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technology will have a wide range of applications in digital and implantable biosensors and high-throughput DNA genotyping, with transformative implications for personalized medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Description_of_SNP_Detection_Using_Fluorescence-Based_Observations_of_Strand_Displacement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The schematics of strand displacement and single-mismatch detection are shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DS probe is prepared by hybridization of two complementary strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red strand in Fig 1 has a prolonged toehold section of 7 nt, and its total length is 47 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black strand is 40 nt and contains four inosine (I) substitutions, where guanines were originally located, to weaken the affinity between the two strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 47-nt side is called the normal side (N); and the 40-nt side is called the weak side (W) because it contains I bases to weaken the double-helix affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the DS probe with specific sequences is shown in SI Appendix, Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, when 47 nt of target strand (T), which is fully complementary with the normal strand (N), is introduced to DS probe, it displaces the weak strand (W) and hybridize with the normal strand (N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inosine (I) bases allow the shortening of the toehold part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If W does not contain inosines, hybridization affinity between W and N becomes too strong to efficiently displace W with T with the 7 nt of toehold; without inosines substitutions, longer toehold is required to efficiently displace W strand by T. Thus, the strand displacement reaction can be summarized as the following (39):[N:W]+T[N:T]+W.When T has a single mismatch to N, the affinity between N and T is significantly decreased and the reaction rate is greatly reduced; DNA strands in the DS probe are not displaced, and it remains in its initial conformation (Fig 1C) (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strand displacement was monitored over time with the fluorescence labeling (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Texas red fluorophore was labeled at the end of W and a fluorescence quencher was labeled at the end of N. The quencher absorbed the emission wave from the fluorescence when it was adjacent to fluorescence label, thus upon hybridization of N and W, the fluorescence was quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the perfect-match T was added on the sample, strand displacement happened, the fluorophore and quencher were separated and the fluorescence signal became brighter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the single-mismatch T strand was added, strand displacement happened at much slower rate and much lower fluorescence signals were measured compared with a perfect-match T experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the toehold affected the reaction rate and hence different lengths of toeholds were tested (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The test with 10-nt toehold showed vague discrimination of a single mismatch because affinity between N and T was too strong with 10 nt toehold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two strands hybridized efficiently even with the single-mismatch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain that the single-mismatch T strand did not hybridize partially from toehold part until the mismatched point, the discrimination was verified by DNA gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For DNA gel electrophoresis, the structure of DS probe was modified to accumulate T onto the DS probe, not just for switching their positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity of the DS probe is not affected when W and N are bound by the hinge part when the hinge part is introduced to conform the DS probe partial-triple strand after strand displacement (SI Appendix, Fig S3) (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the modification of DS probe are reported in the supplemental information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel image shows that the sample with the single-mismatch T stained weaker than the sample with perfect-match T (i.e., the single-mismatch T did not displace W effectively compared with the perfect-match T; SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental protocols described above using fluorescence-based detection of DNA strand displacement represent the standard experimental approach for the DS probe design optimization and fine-tuning of toehold lengths and inosine base substitutions for SNP detection using graphene FET biosensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_of_Strand_Displacement_on_Graphene_FET  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A graphene FET with two electrodes and a liquid gate chamber was fabricated to examine electrical sensing of DNA using DNA strand displacement-based probes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toehold part of N, which is adjacent to the graphene surface (Fig 1B, black dotted circle), became double-stranded after strand displacement and it changed the electrical signals as shown in the I-V curve and the corresponding electrical resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene channel (4 × 6 mm) was transferred onto a silicon oxide-coated wafer using an established method (37, 41); 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) was used to link graphene and the amine group at the N side of DS probe (27, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pyrene group of PASE and graphene were attached to each other by - stacking interactions to covalently link graphene/PASE to the amine group at the N side of DS prove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The process of graphene functionalization was monitored at each step using an atomic force microscope (AFM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in AFM images (Fig 3A), topography of a bare graphene surface is mostly flat with some defects and wrinkles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene wrinkles 4 to 7 nm in height are observed; these heights and shapes are in good agreement with the previously published results (32, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PASE functionalization of graphene surface does not change the graphene surface roughness or morphology (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after immobilizing DNA on the graphene FET device through PASE and amine reaction, surface morphology was dramatically changed with the appearance of distinct globular structures (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average height of these globular structures is 3.6 ± 1.4 nm and varies between 26 nm (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of these structures seem consistent with the conformation of the standing DNA strands in fluid; a typical height of dsDNA lying flat, as detected by AFM imaging in air is 2 nm (45), which is significantly shorter than the height of globular structures in fluid observed in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA strands on the graphene FET device were further imaged in air after drying the graphene surface (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After drying, the appearance of dotted globular structures of dsDNA observed in fluid condition have changed to distinctive rod shapes of 2 nm in height as shown in details of the inset image (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were validated by the analyses of AFM images of graphene and PASE-functionalized surfaces with and without DNA, which were also imaged in air (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DS probe consisted of a 40-bp double-strand section and a 7-nt single-strand overhang; in total the estimated length is 15 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the rod shapes of the DNA strands in the air AFM images show about 15 to 20 nm of length (SI Appendix, Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, AFM images of devices in fluid and air conditions indicated that the PASEamine functionalization strategy was working appropriately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conformation and position of the DS probe on the graphene surface is a critically important factor for the electrical detection of strand displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 7 nt of single-stranded toehold of the 47-bp DNA becomes double-stranded after the strand displacement compared with the initial DS prove (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the DS probe is lying down or absorbed on the surface, the signal difference would be too small to be detectable by recognizing the charge difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AFM image in Fig 3C shows that DS probe is observed as islands in liquid, whereas it was grain-boundary-shaped in air (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the surface was fully covered by PASE and ethanolamine, the DS probe was not exposed and not absorbed into graphene except amineamide bonding; otherwise, nucleotides can be absorbed to graphene by - stacking interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations have shown that DNA established an upright conformation to the silica surface, fluctuating only around 10° from vertical at stable state (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus concluded that the positioning of DS probes is perpendicular to the graphene surface in liquid and the functionalization strategy was successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The source and drain electrodes were applied by silver paste, and silicone rubber was used before the DNA probe functionalization to insulate the electrodes and create a solution reservoir (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample in buffer solution was placed in the reservoir, and a gate voltage was applied directly to the top of the buffer solution (27, 31, 34, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the surface charge was changed by strand displacement, the charge built up and the I-V curve shifted to left side and the resistance was increased (27, 37, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionalization of the DS probe changed electrical signals of FET (SI Appendix, Fig S6).The I-V curve was measured after PASE was fixed on the graphene channel with 1× PBS buffer solution as liquid gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After DS probe was bonded on the PASE, the measurement was repeated again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I-V curve shifted to left side after the bonding of DS probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting unique U-shaped I-V curve is attributable to the ambipolar characteristic of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the electrical resistance increased and shifted the I-V curve lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Debye length should be considered when detecting electrical charge in ionic solution (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be written for aqueous solution at room temperature as(nm)=14IBizi2i,where  is the Debye length expressed in nanometer, IB is Bjerrum length which is about 0.7 nm, zi is valencies of the various types of ions, and i is number densities or number of molecules per volume (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the Debye length is an estimate of the distance where Coulomb interactions are ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the region near a point charge where opposite-charge counterions can be found is also ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Debye length represents the net length of the electrostatic effect in ionic solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charges are electrically screened outside the sphere whose radius is the Debye length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1× PBS solution, which is generally used as a DNA buffer solution, its Debye length is less_than1 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More diluted PBS such as 0.1× or 0.01× PBS allows detection of the longer part of the hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the DS probe requires a high ionic concentration to stably operate the strand displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the ionic concentration of buffer solution is too low, its double-helix structure can be unstable and could fail in strand displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measuring the effect of strand displacement, 12.5 mM MgCl2 and 30 mM Tris buffer were used to increase Debye length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This MgCl2 concentration is known to be equivalent to about 1× PBS for DNA helix stabilization (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MgCl2 is 2:1 electrolyte (e.g., Mg2+:2Cl), and its Debye length of 12.5 mM MgCl2 is calculated by the above equation to be 1.6 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrical effect of DNA is reported to be rapidly decreased, and only a few sequences that are close to the graphene surface determine the electrostatic potential on the sensor (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the first few sequences would have effective charges on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tests were also conducted with 1× PBS and compared with MgCl2 buffer solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MgCl2 buffer solution generated clearer discrimination (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the specificity of the graphene FET sensor, perfect-match and single-mismatch samples were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Target strands in different concentrations (100 nM to 100 M) were incubated on the sensor for 8 h (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the perfect-match T was treated on the graphene sensor, the U-shaped I-V curve shifted down and to the left, which indicates increasing resistance and imposition of the n-doping effect (27, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding resistance change was observed as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 100 nM of T strands, which is equivalent to about 3.011 × 1012 of T molecules in 50 µL of buffer solution, DS probe showed clear discrimination of single mismatch (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the concentration of the perfect-match T was increased, I-V curve kept shifting left and down and the shape of the curve became flatter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the Fig 4C, the Dirac point of the I-V curve was shifted approximately 50 mV with 100 M of perfect-match T and approximately 11.6 mV with single-mismatch T (4.3-fold difference).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more detailed graph of Dirac point shifts is shown in SI Appendix, Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different values of source voltages were also tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I-V curve also showed the same trends of Dirac point shifts (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, the single-mismatch T made much smaller shifts and the I-V curve was saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is reasonable to believe that a single-mismatch T could not result in the proper strand displacement, whereas a perfect-match T could induce a proper strand displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another set of data with different dimension of the graphene channel is presented in the SI Appendix and also showed a convincing distinction of single mismatches (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show a clear discrimination of a single mismatch in the 47-bp DNA probe, suggesting that it could be possible to detect single mismatch in a longer DNA strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resistance change of the channel was measured and compared between the perfect-match and the single-mismatch targets at different concentrations (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When DNA is accumulated on the graphene surface, its resistance increases (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immobilization of DS probe and addition of target strands increased the resistance of the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resistance increased 40% to 60% when the probe was anchored on the graphene surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the Fig 4C, perfect-match T increased the resistance significantly more than single-mismatch T. The largest difference was observed at a target concentration of 100 nM, with the resistance changes of 26.0% and 6.8% (3.8-fold difference) for the perfect-match and the single-mismatch T, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum difference was observed at the target concentration of 100 µM with the resistance changes of 84.9% and 46.0% (1.8-fold difference), for the perfect match and the single mismatch, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In control experiments, single-strand probes were tested using only the N side of DS probe, to confirm that the discrimination of single mismatch in 47 bp resulted from using DS probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-mismatch target strands were tested with the concentration ranging from 10 pM to 1 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S11 shows that when a single-mismatch target strand was hybridized with the N side of the probe, this probes signal transferred as much as that of the DS probe with the perfect-match target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of the T strand required to saturate the I-V curve transfer was much lower because it does not have the W side of DS probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When it was a DS probe, the T strand required more energy (higher concentration) to displace the W strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-mismatch T strand shared identical 27 and 19 nt with the perfect-match target and the melting temperature of hybridization of single-mismatch T and N side is 5565 °C, with a concentration range of 10 pM to 10 M (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stable hybridization of single-mismatch target and the N strand made the discrimination of the single mismatch impossible when the probe was single-stranded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the superior capability of DS probe on graphene FET to discriminate a single mismatch in long DNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Originally, microarrays used photolithography to fabricate microsized spots inspired by transistors array in electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed graphene FET biosensor can also be integrated in the form of microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These array sensors would not need fluorescence labeling or optical components and would reduce the required number of spots for individual sequences by detecting strand displacement of longer DNA strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems likely that specificity of the graphene FET sensor described in this work is sufficiently high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would alleviate the need for complex algorithms to analyze vague data for the detection of SNP with current technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the further development and implementation of this technology would allow more affordable and accurate diagnosis of myriad of diseases, including cancer and degenerative, genetic, and other various disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Label-free detection of a single mismatch in a 47-bp probe with high resolution was achieved by using DNA strand displacement on a graphene FET chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This detection was possible by electrical sensing of the inherent charge of DNA with the graphene transistor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a double-stranded probe capable of detecting a single mismatch in a 47-bp double helix, the performance of the sensors appears to exceed significantly the performance of a single-stranded probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of double-stranded part in the probe was changed by strand displacement, and this difference was readable in the electrostatic gating effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP-discrimination results are readily detectable in the I-V curve and the electrical resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical detection of a single mismatch was also correlated with the real-time fluorescence measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work provides a significantly improved platform for SNP detection by combining high-fidelity probe design and a detection scheme that has not been reported previously to our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate the practical utility of the biosensor technology based on a combination of dynamic DNA nanotechnology and 2D nanoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology opens opportunities for the development of more reliable and efficient diagnostic tools, including design and development of miniaturized, point-of-care, and implantable biosensors, for early detection of potentially life-threatening human diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fabrication_of_Graphene_FET  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The top side of graphene on a copper film was spin-coated with PMMA to protect the top side of graphene, whereas the bottom side of graphene was etched away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMA acted as the supporting layer of the graphene after etching the copper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back side of graphene was removed by oxygen plasma etching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was cut into 4 × 6 mm pieces with scissors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper was etched by floating on 0.1 M ammonium persulfate for about 5 h and rinsed in deionized (DI) water overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene supported by PMMA was then transferred on a SiO2-coated silicon wafer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMMA layer was removed by acetone at 60 °C for 1 h.
