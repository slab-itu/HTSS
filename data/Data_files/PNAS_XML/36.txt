The incidence and role of negative citations in science  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Providing a detailed classification of the types of citations that an article receives is important to establish the quality of a study and to characterize how current research builds upon prior work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methodology that we propose also informs how to improve the citation process, for example by having scientists attach additional metadata to their citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is scalable to other fields and periods and can also be used to identify other types of citations (e.g., reuse of methods, materials, empirical tests of theory, and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our methods provide online repositories such as Google Scholar, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus with a way to improve their search and ranking algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Citations to previous literature are extensively used to measure the quality and diffusion of knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we know little about the different ways in which a study can be cited; in particular, are papers cited to point out their merits or their flaws?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We elaborated a methodology to characterize negative citations using bibliometric data and natural language processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that negative citations concerned higher-quality papers, were focused on a studys findings rather than theories or methods, and originated from scholars who were closer to the authors of the focal paper in terms of discipline and social distance, but not geographically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Receiving a negative citation was also associated with a slightly faster decline in citations to the paper in the long run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Out of 762,355 citations from 15,731 articles in the Journal of Immunology (19982007), we identified 18,304 as negative (about 2.4% of the total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 762,355 citations referred to 146,891 unique papers, and of these papers 10,405 (about 7.1%) received at least one negative citation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the incidence on a per-citation basis is relatively low, a nontrivial number of papers received at least one negative citation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, the low frequency may be evidence of a limited, uninfluential role of negative citations, or of the high social cost of making them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, these citations represent a nonnegligible share of the total in our data and, as such, could play an important role in limiting and correcting previous results, thus helping science progress (5, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several features of these citations, described below, lend support to the latter hypothesis, that is, that negative citations have unique functions and deserve consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, Fig 1 shows that the likelihood of receiving a negative citation was higher in the first few years after a paper was published; this is arguably the period in which the underlying science was potentially more novel, untested, and worthy of more attention and scrutiny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, and consistent with negative citations emerging when enough attention is given to a paper, negatively cited studies were of high quality and prominence; the median number of citations to these papers was higher than to papers that never received negative citations throughout their full citation life cycle (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as scientists pay more attention to a study (potentially also because of its novelty and quality), they are also more likely to provide criticisms, extensions, and qualifications to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative citations can be therefore seen as a way to track where scientists place attention at a certain time within a field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, the 4,888 papers (31% of the citing papers) that made at least one negative citation had a distribution of citations that is statistically indistinguishable from the 10,843 articles not making any negative citation (P value for test of equality of distribution = 0.32; the full analysis is in Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negatively citing papers are therefore not just marginal studies, perhaps differentiating themselves through incremental critiques of previous work; they rather appear as equal contributors to the overall advancement of a field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seen in conjunction with the prior observation that negatively cited papers are of higher quality, this result may imply (although more work is needed to test this) that fields where negative citations occur are built on more solid foundations or at least may evolve more quickly because of increased interest by scientists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fourth, we took advantage of the relatively standardized structure of scientific articles in immunology to assess whether negative citations disproportionately appeared in certain sections of an article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows that about 84% of all negative citations occurred in the Results and Discussion section, as opposed to 42% of objective citations (2 test for the equality of distribution of types of citations across sections = 8,700.6, P less_than 0.000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, this suggests that negative citations may serve a specific purpose, at least in immunology (i.e., they mostly focus on findings rather than methods or theories, and are therefore different from other citations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it is possible that negative citations to, for example, theories and methods use language and wording that is more subtle, and thus less likely to be identified by our algorithm than negative citations related to results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this concern, we compared the keywords used in negative citations across different sections of a paper, and in negative and objective citations within the same section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate how similar two citations were, we used the cosine similarity between the vectors of keywords generated by the relevant paragraphs of text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps not surprisingly, the analysis revealed that negative citations in a section were more similar to negative citations in other sections than to objective citations in the same section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, we found no systematic or sizeable differences in the similarity of negative citations when making pairwise comparisons between sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fifth, negative citations were more likely to come from scientists who were close in discipline and social distance to the cited scholars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 reports the coefficient estimates from regressions of the probability that a paper received a negative citation (conditional on ever being cited) on variables measuring the physical distance between authors on the citing and cited papers, whether the citing and cited papers were both in the field of immunology, and whether authors on citing and cited papers were connected through previous collaborations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the first 5 years after publication, negative citations were more likely to come from articles published in other immunology journals, from authors who were more connected to the authors of the cited paper (e.g., coauthors, and coauthors of coauthors), and from scientists who were affiliated with institutions at a distance greater than 150 miles from the closest author in the focal article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being better positioned to understand the work of a focal author, a vast literature shows that scientists who are in the same discipline and socially proximate are more likely to interact and exchange information in a plurality of ways (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is again consistent with the interpretation that awareness and scrutiny are prerequisites for negative citations; moreover, this result hints to the fact that negative citations may be one of the ways in which scientists debate and make progress in their field of research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, geographic proximity was negatively correlated with the presence of a negative citation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An explanation for this result is that social proximity is a more accurate indicator of closeness in knowledge space than physical proximity (colocated scientists who do not have direct or indirect coauthorship links may well be working in unrelated areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interpretation is that it may be socially costly to negatively cite the work of a local colleague.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for geographically colocated scientists other forms of feedback (e.g., personal interactions) may substitute rather than complement more formal negative citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we assessed the impact of receiving a negative citation on the subsequent citation profile of a paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies analyzed the effect of a retraction on the future citations to the retracted paper (2427).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first compared the negatively cited papers to all other papers (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a marked relative decline in citations for the negatively cited papers after the first negative citation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this analysis may be misleading because the comparison was between potentially very different articles; recall, for example, that negatively cited articles were on average more prominent and might have therefore received more attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore matched and compared negatively cited articles to other papers with comparable characteristics, such as age and previous citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6 shows a much more similar citation profile over time for these two sets of articles, both before and after a negative citation occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative decline in overall citations eight or more years after the first negative citation reveals that there is a small, long-term penalty for negatively cited papers, although it takes a long time to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings suggest that negative citations may indeed play a special role in science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for the lack of an immediate penalty from negative citations on the subsequent interest for an article is that negative citations may contribute to refining initial findings and help a field evolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another explanation is that negative citations simply go unnoticed, and that the information they carry may take a long time to diffuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before making a citation, scientists would have to read all of the articles that cite the focal article to verify whether any of its content was updated by a follow-up study: although the focal article might diffuse rapidly, the one carrying the improved or correct information has to start a diffusion process of its own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, tracking the evolution of negative citations, and more generally of the different reasons why previous literature is referenced, is an important exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach has the potential to inform how the citation process could be improved, and what kind of metadata scientists should be invited to attach to their citations to facilitate search, discovery, and knowledge recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The findings in this paper are limited by the fact that they concern only the field of immunology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a small-scale, manual analysis that we performed on 2,860 citations in the mathematics section of PLOS ONE returned a similar rate of negative citations (1.7% of the total), a more comprehensive comparison across disciplines is necessary before results can be generalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that future research will build on the methodology presented here to cover additional fields and historical periods, and to address some of the conjectures and open questions generated by our results as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis was based on 15,731 full-text articles in the Journal of Immunology (19982007) and the 762,355 citations (to studies published in any journal) contained in those papers, which we extracted, parsed, and linked to the full bibliographic information on the citing articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The database used for the retrieval of the information on the citing papers was ISI Web of Science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to match 486,600 (64%) of the 762,355 citations to their full bibliographic details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the incidence of negative citations was statistically indistinguishable between all citations (2.40%) and the sample of citations for which we could retrieve the full bibliographic data (2.44%; P = 0.146).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify negative citations, we first developed a training set of 15,000 citations (i.e., sentences in a paper that contained the reference to another paper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A team of immunology PhDs and researchers manually reviewed these citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experts classified as negative citations references that pointed to the inability to replicate past results, disagreement, or inconsistencies with past results, theory, and literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other references that were simply referring to or building on past work were classified as objective citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quotes below report examples of negative citations as identified by our experts:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used NLP to run the full set of citations and automatically assign them using our training set of labeled data to the two types of citations: objective and negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We relied on the Python NLTK library to perform the classification; when a citation paragraph was analyzed, the algorithm decomposed it into its grammar components (e.g., adjectives, verbs, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These components were then stored into a presence dictionary and used to build a feature set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feature set was the basis for a Bayesian model of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the NLTK Naive Bayes algorithm (www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/classify/naivebayes.html) and probabilistically assigned the remaining citations to the two types of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the training set grows in size, this approach allows us to accurately process large sets of citations in a relatively short time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the similarity in the wording used in a negative citation in different sections of an article, we transformed our citation paragraphs into vectors of keywords (after removing symbols and special characters from the text) and calculated the similarity between all pairs of citations coming from the different sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we calculated the similarity between negative citations coming from the Results and Discussion section and the Materials and Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the similarity between objective and negative citations within the same section (e.g., negative and objective citations in the Introduction section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measure of similarity comes from the Scikit-Learn Python module (scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html), which calculates the L2-normalized dot product of two vectors of keywords (cosine similarity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the analyses reported in Fig 6, finally, we matched negatively cited articles to objectively cited control articles using the coarsened exact matching procedure (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control sample that allowed us to compare the effect of being negatively cited consisted of objectively cited papers that were similar to the negatively cited papers in citation profile, cohort, and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of our cited papers, we constructed discrete bins for the year in which the paper was published (cohort), the age of each cited paper when it was first cited by a paper in the Journal of Immunology (age), the number of citations received 1 year before the citation in the Journal of Immunology, and the cumulative number of total citations received 1 year before the citation in the Journal of Immunology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created individual strata for each bin and selected a random objectively cited paper from each stratum that also contained a negatively cited paper to serve as the control paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to find suitable control articles for 7,741 of the 10,405 negatively cited articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Algorithm_for_Definition_and_Identification_of_Negative_Citations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis was based on the full text of all of the 15,731 articles published in the Journal of Immunology for the period 19982007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These articles contained 762,355 citations, which we extracted, parsed, and matched back to their bibliometric information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to match 486,600 of these citations with their bibliographic details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a training set of 15,000 of these citations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A team consisting of two experts with a PhD in immunology, one PhD student in immunology, one researcher with an MS in biomedicine and expertise in immunology, and one medical student with a research interest in immunology manually checked whether these 15,000 citations contained a negative element, that is, they were questioning of previous results or referring to inconsistency with the literature, as opposed to citations that were simply referring to or building on past work (examples are reported in the main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural language processing (NLP) was then used to run the full set of citations and automatically assign them using our training set to our two types of citations: objectives and negatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the Python NLTK library to perform the classification; when analyzing a citation paragraph, the algorithm decomposed it into its grammar components (e.g., adjectives, verbs, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These components were then stored into a presence dictionary, and used to build a feature set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feature set was, in turn, the basis for a Bayesian model of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the NLTK Naive Bayes algorithm (www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/classify/naivebayes.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Bayesian model, we probabilistically assigned the full set of citations to the two types of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Algorithm_to_Determine_the_Matching_Sample_for_the_Analyses_Reported_in_Fig_6  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We matched negatively cited articles to objectively cited articles using the coarsened exact matching procedure (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control sample that allowed us to compare the effect of being negatively cited to being objectively cited consisted of objectively cited papers that were similar to negatively cited ones in citation profiles, cohort (year of publication), and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for each of the cited papers, we constructed discrete bins for the year in which the paper was published, the age of each cited paper when it was first cited by a paper in the Journal of Immunology, the number of citations received 1 year before the citation in the Journal of Immunology, as well as the cumulative number of total citations received up to 1 year before the citation in the Journal of Immunology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created individual strata for each bin and selected a random objectively cited paper from each stratum that also contained a negatively cited paper to serve as the control paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to find suitable control articles for 7,741 of the 10,405 negatively cited articles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cosine_Distance_Measure_for_Similarity_of_Negative_Citations_Across_Section_and_of_Negative_and_Objective_Citations_Within_Section  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the Scikit-Learn python module (scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html), which calculates the L2-normalized dot product of the two vectors of keywords x and y asCosineSimilarity(x,y)=xyTxx,where x and y are obtained from the text containing the focal citations (after we remove symbols and special characters from the text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerator represents the dot product of the two vectors, and the denominator is the product of their Euclidean lengths (see nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dot-products-1.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that if the two vectors are identical, then the cosine similarity is equal to 1, whereas if they have no overlap at all, the similarity measure is 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table S4 reports the results of this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first four rows compare negative citations to objective citations within the same section (given the extremely large number of pairs, for the Introduction and Results and Discussion we selected a random sample of pairs to calculate the cosine similarity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cosine similarity is similar across rows, which suggests that negative and objective citations have the same degree of overlap in language across different sections of a paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following 12 rows compare the language of negative citations between different sections: negative citations tend to be more similar to each other, in wording, than they are to objective citations in the same section (the value of the cosine similarity is always higher in rows five and below than in the first four rows); moreover, we do not observe any systematic difference in cosine similarity within negative citations across different pairs of sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we do not find evidence for systematic differences in how negative citations are expressed across different sections of a paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
