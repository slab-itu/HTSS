US daily temperature records past, present, and future  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future changes in temperature extremes over the continental United States are represented by the ratio of daily record high maximum temperatures to daily record low minimum temperatures and computed as a function of mean temperature increase that does not depend on scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nonlinear empirical fit of the relation between this ratio and average temperature, using observations from 1930 to 2015, is extended to 2100 and compared with the climate model projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projections of the ratio are somewhat higher than the empirical projection from observations, continuing a positively biased trend in daily record high temperatures in the 20th century in the models, which we link to less-than-observed summer precipitation and evapotranspiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observed temperature extremes over the continental United States can be represented by the ratio of daily record high temperatures to daily record low minimum temperatures, and this ratio has increased to a value of about 2 to 1, averaged over the first decade of the 21st century, albeit with large interannual variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different versions of a global coupled climate model (CCSM4), as well as 23 other coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) models, show larger values of this ratio than observations, mainly as a result of greater numbers of record highs since the 1980s compared with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly because of the warm 1930s in the observations, which made it more difficult to set record highs later in the century, and partly because of a trend toward less rainfall and reduced evapotranspiration in the model versions compared with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute future projections of this ratio on the basis of its estimated dependence on mean temperature increase, which we find robustly at play in both observations and simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of this relation also has the advantage of removing dependence of a projection on a specific scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An empirical projection of the ratio of record highs to record lows is obtained from the nonlinear relationship in observations from 1930 to 2015, thus correcting downward the likely biased future projections of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for a 3 °C warming in US temperatures, the ratio of record highs to lows is projected to be 15 ± 8 compared to the present average ratio of just over 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in previous studies (1), probability theory states that, in the case of a sequence of independent random variables identically distributed, the expected number of records decrease as 1/n, where n is the number of realizations of the independent variable accumulating as it is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our application, n is the year for which the values of a calendar day maximum and minimum temperature are observed since the beginning of the observational record considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each day of each year, values are compared with the standing record highs and lows for the specific calendar day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As years (and records) accumulate, it becomes increasingly difficult for a stationary process to break a record, asymptotically as difficult as an event with probability 1/n (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the number of years a station has been operating is an important factor in accounting for the expected number of records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of observed station data for the continental United States has shown that starting a 1/n calculation by taking all stations available in the mid-20th century produced a credible accounting of records with distinct seasonal and geographical features up to the more recent decades (since about 1980), when observed behavior begins departing from expected (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same analysis also showed that two factors influence changes in the numbers of records that deviate from the theoretical 1/n relationship, involving different natural variability translating into a wider or narrower variance of the climatologic distribution of temperature coupled with changes in the mean of the distribution over time (i.e., the presence of temperature trends).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following from the same theory, under stationarity, the ratio of daily record high maximum temperatures to daily record low minimum temperatures should be near one, as the decay of the number of record highs and lows follows the 1/n time evolution for both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any systematic and prolonged change from a ratio of one indicates a change from the expected numbers of record highs, record lows, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 1, we compare the annual values of the ratio between the total number of record highs and the total number of record lows over the continental United States from 1930 to 2015 for observations (black dots) and all values (gray dots) from the simulations by two CCSM4 model versions we consider here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a 1° resolution version, run with a large ensemble (termed LE) of 30 initial condition ensemble members (Fig 1A), and a more computationally expensive half-degree version (hereafter Hdeg), run with four initial condition ensemble members (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual median values across the ensemble of individual model simulations are shown as red dots in both panels in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is considerable interannual variability, indicated by the vertical spread of the dots (e.g., the observed value of the ratio in 2012 was around six, whereas it was less than one in 2013), and it is evident that the ratio in models and observations has been increasing, such that there are more values above one since about 1980, as was shown previously for a shorter record (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the observations (black dots) lie below the red dots (median model values) for most of the time series, indicating a systematic overestimation of the ratio in the models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extending this ratio into the future in the two models, following representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (10) (Fig 1 C and D), the nonlinear nature of the increasing ratio is evident (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other notable, if expected, feature of Fig 1 C and D for projected future climate is that the variance of the ratio of record highs to lows gets larger with higher mean temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the denominator in the ratio (the number of record low minima) becomes increasingly small as record lows become less frequent and the ratio becomes more variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that using a different scenario would produce a different projection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus there is a desire to generalize the future changes of the ratio as a function of mean temperature change over the United States that does not involve a specific scenario, following an approach that has been used to advantage in other applications of future projections (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine reasons for the different characteristics between models and data, Fig 2 shows the actual number of daily record highs and record lows for observations and model simulations, with the same plotting convention as in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a close correspondence between both models median values and the observations for the record low minimum temperatures, with both following the expected 1/n time evolution until moving below 1/n after about 1980, thus indicating a significant reduction in record low minima (Fig 2 C and D) compared with their expected number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for record highs in Fig 2 A and B, the models median values track the 1/n line until about 1980, when the red dots move above the 1/n line, indicating a significant increase of record highs above the expected number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is the mirror image of the record-low behavior and reflects the shift of the mean values of the temperature distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the observations, starting in the late 1930s, actually track below the 1/n line, indicating lower-than-expected record highs, and then remain there until about 1980, when a few values finally move above the 1/n line, but are still below the median model values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effects of the warm 1930s on how records accumulate, Fig 3 shows the same analysis, using different start dates (pushing the start date even farther back in time before 1930 is not feasible because of the lack of data with sufficient coverage to represent conditions over the continental United States).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is a very warm period at the beginning of the tabulation of records at a station, it will be difficult to set daily high maximum temperature records later in the century, when daily maximum temperatures cooled somewhat before warming again at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the effects of a start year in 1930, 1950 (Fig 3B), and 1970 (Fig 3C), with annual values from observations as black dots and the green line being an 11-y running mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the record compilation starts with successively cooler initial decades, the dots move progressively closer to the expected 1/n line (moving from left to right in the figure), but note that they still have a tendency to remain below the expected 1/n level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the warm 1930s has an effect on where the observed daily high maximum records lie in relation to the 1/n line, but it appears that something else has contributed to relatively low numbers of record highs compared with the modeled values, even when taking a less extreme starting date (1950).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the daily low temperatures have recovered recently to values above the 1930s (Fig 4), the behavior seen for record highs (i.e., the dependence on the starting date) should not affect as strongly the compilation of record lows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, moving to successively more recent start dates for compilation of record lows does not have nearly as much influence as for record highs, with the record lows falling well below the 1/n line after about 1980 for all start dates (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been noted that the warm 1930s were mostly a result of natural internal decadal variability associated with tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (12), but notably, when considering the ability of models to replicate such an event, the warm anomalies were intensified by disastrous land use practices over large parts of the central United States (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these explanations of the observed warm anomalies, the models ensemble response (represented by the median values in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) could not be expected to capture the observed behavior of record highs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the 30 individual ensemble members, however, shows a behavior of maximum temperatures similar to the observed, either, confirming the importance of land use change effects and feedbacks that the land model in CCSM4 could not have replicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar analysis of record high behavior across the available daily output from a CMIP5 ensemble of 24 models confirms that none of them shows a similar behavior to the observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of them, in lesser or larger measure, simulated the increase in record highs from the expected 1/n stationary behavior, starting in the early 1980s (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned earlier, even with a start date in the relatively cooler year of 1970 (Fig 3C), the observed record high maxima still lie mostly near the 1/n line, whereas in Fig 2 A and B, the model median values lie mostly above the 1/n line after about 1980, indicating that the extraordinary 1930s are not the only culprit for the different characteristics of the model or models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An additional factor that has been shown to have a preferential influence on daily maximum temperatures compared with daily minimum temperatures is evaporation from the land surface, with drier soils and reduced latent heat flux (and thus reduced evapotranspiration) contributing to higher daytime maxima preferentially in the warm seasons (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a version of Fig 3A for the JuneJulyAugust (JJA) season shows a preference for the record highs to be below the 1/n estimate compared with DecemberJanuaryFebruary for the post-1980 period (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pinning down a connection between record highs (which can be represented by daily high temperatures, as in Fig 4) and evapotranspiration in observations is somewhat problematic, as a time series of observed evapotranspiration over the continental United States from 1930 to the present does not exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a number of factors that contribute to evapotranspiration can be studied in the models, with the goal of using a well-observed quantity as a proxy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evapotranspiration depends on a number of interrelated processes, starting with precipitation that is intercepted by vegetation and bare soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bare soil evaporation is dependent on top soil layer moisture (which is a function of evaporation, infiltration, and the soil moisture profile below it), the specific humidity gradient through the surface layer into the lower atmospheric boundary layer, the reference height wind speed, the surface roughness, and the atmospheric stability of the lower boundary layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetated fluxes that contribute to evapotranspiration also depend on those same factors and are complicated by within-canopy turbulent transfers and by water availability in the canopy and root zones (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil moisture effects on temperature extremes are manifested both by sensible heat flux and latent heat flux through evapotranspiration (15), with the latter playing a major role in daytime high temperatures (hereafter Tmax) during summer (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are soil moisture products that aim to represent observed quantities, they can involve satellite-observed measures of skin wetness that may not represent total moisture available for evapotranspiration from an upper layer of soil (18) or model-derived soil moisture metrics (19), and span relatively abbreviated periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A well-observed quantity covering the same period as the temperature observations noted earlier, which relates directly to evapotranspiration and can be compared with the model output, is precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown to be a credible proxy to represent soil moisture, and consequent evapotranspiration properties, during the summer season (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A distribution of precipitation trends for JJA is shown for observations and the two model simulations (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observations show a distribution shifted toward a preponderance of relatively large positive precipitation trends (Fig 3D, Upper) compared with smaller values and less substantial asymmetric behavior in the distributions of JJA precipitation trends in the two model simulations (Fig 3D, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy would be consistent with an increase in warm season evapotranspiration since 1930 in the observations compared with what the models would experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connection between JJA daily Tmax and precipitation trends is shown in Fig S4, where there is a shift in the observed distribution of Tmax to negative trend values (Fig S4B) compared with a shift to positive values of precipitation trends (Fig 3D, Upper, and Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the observed negative trends in Tmax occur in the central United States, corresponding to positive precipitation trends in that same region (Fig S4 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reflected in negative correlations between Tmax and precipitation there in the observations (Fig S5A), and is illustrated with an example from the LE model results (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship does not change in the future climate in the model and, if anything, is stronger and more geographically widespread (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To connect Tmax and precipitation to evapotranspiration (using the LE model as an illustrative example, the Hdeg model shows similar results), Fig S6 shows that JJA trends in Tmax (Fig S6A) are negatively correlated with comparable trends in evapotranspiration (i.e., higher Tmax associated with lower evapotranspiration, Fig S6C: the pattern correlation of 0.5 is significant at the 5% level, as long as we can assume that at least 12 of the grid-point locations in these fields are independent of each other, which should be the case, even given the spatial correlation characteristics of these fields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest negative associations occur in the Western United States and Great Plains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, JJA trends in precipitation (Fig S6B) are positively correlated with trends in evapotranspiration (Fig S6C), as could be expected from the discussion earlier (i.e., more precipitation associated with greater evapotranspiration; positive pattern correlation of +0.4, significant at the 5% level if at least 15 independent locations can be assumed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest positive associations are in similar areas as the negative connections between precipitation and Tmax noted earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these linkages in the model simulations, the large areas of negative precipitation trends in the observations associated with comparable negative trends in Tmax would then likely be associated with increased evapotranspiration that would contribute to the negative Tmax trends and fewer daily record high temperatures in the observations compared with the models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This relationship in the model simulations between Tmax, precipitation, and evapotranspiration, if not directly tested for lack of long records, can be inferred here for the observations and is consistent with physical process understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such connections are consistent with previous studies (14, 16, 17), particularly in the central part of the United States (20), and help us understand the model tendencies of producing greater numbers of daily record high maximum temperatures compared with observations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With regard to the future and whether these relationships could change in some way, Fig S7 shows there is still a negative link between JJA Tmax (Fig S7A) and precipitation (Fig S7B) for trends in the LE model from 2006 to 2100 (pattern correlation of 0.5), and a positive connection between JJA precipitation trends (Fig S7B) and evapotranspiration (Fig S7C, pattern correlation of +0.6, significant at the 5% level if at least seven independent locations can be assumed), both consistent with the 19302015 trends in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another factor that could be producing lower daytime maxima in observations compared with models is the rise of irrigation over certain regions of the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence from some areas shows that irrigation produces lower daytime temperatures in summertime, but does not have an effect on nighttime temperatures (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the models do not include the effects of irrigation, this could be another contributing factor to the models simulating greater daytime maxima compared with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This assessment of possible biases in the simulation of record highs vs. lows in the models brings us to the idea of trying to relate the behavior of the record ratio with mean temperature changes, known to be better simulated by climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first quantify the nonlinear time evolution of the ratio of record highs to record lows seen in Fig 1 for the observations as a function of mean temperature (across the same set of stations) by fitting the log of the ratio of record highs to record lows to US mean annual temperature (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fit has an R2 value of 0.50 and a slope of 0.66 (SD, 0.07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar plots for the two model versions, in which we use all ensemble members individually (i.e., without computing the ensemble mean, but using ensemble members as replicates) are shown in the rest of Fig 5, with black dots plotted for the values from 1930 to 2015, and red dots for the rest of the time series, using RCP8.5 to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonlinear fit has a large R2 of 0.93 in both cases, with slopes of 1.16 (SD, 0.004) for the LE and 1.05 (SD, 0.01) for the Hdeg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship is therefore similar between the two model resolutions, with a steeper slope for the 20th century compared with observations because of the issues noted earlier regarding the effects of the warm 1930s and the differences inferred for precipitation trends, and likely the implied evapotranspiration trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that if we fit individual log-linear relationships to the single ensemble members, we still obtain relationships showing a substantial positive bias in all cases (see Fig S8, where we plot histograms of the log-linear coefficients from the individual ensemble members and compare them with the observed values for the three starting dates used in our analysis of 1930, 1950, and 1970).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mean temperatures increase in the 21st century, the nonlinear relationship holds strongly for both model versions, but we propose comparing the model projections with a projection made from the observed relation and accounting for its uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As already mentioned, for the observations starting in 1930, the slope is 0.66 with a SD of 0.07.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a start date in 1950, the coefficient is 0.90 with the same SD, and for a 1970 start date, the slope is 0.89 with the same SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate a value for the future slope that factors in both the uncertainty relating to the starting date and the uncertainty in the fit, we use the lowest and highest values from the three observation-based fits (0.66 and 0.90) and add and subtract two times their SDs (2 × 0.08), obtaining a range for the future slope of 0.501.06.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that even by using this wide range based on observed behavior, one that includes a period (starting from 1970) when models and observations are in better agreement, our proposed future slopes are only barely overlapping with the model-based slopes (values of 1.05 and 1.16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure therefore notes a likely positive bias in the model simulations of these future ratios, and at the same time relates the behavior of the ratio to what we know is a better simulated quantity, mean temperature, while divorcing the projections from any specific scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for a 3 °C annual average warming over the United States, the ratio of record highs to record lows is projected to be 15 ± 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This article builds on an earlier study (1) that examined US daily record high maximum and daily record low minimum temperatures in observations and a model from 1950 to 2006, as well as future changes of the ratio to 2100 in one future climate change scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the period of the observations is expanded to include the warm 1930s, and is updated with more recent observations to 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations from a climate model at two different resolutions (CCSM4 at one degree and at a half degree) are analyzed for historical forcings in the 20th century (taking the same period as the observations) and future climate simulations, using RCP8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two models have similar characteristics, with regard to record highs and lows, as the larger set of CMIP5 models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set out to test the robustness of our previous findings when considering the warmer starting period of the 1930s, and in the process, we investigate model biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that some systematic shortcomings in the simulation of maximum temperature may be at play (besides the difficulty of simulating an especially warm period that was a result of not only internal variability but also anthropogenic forcing through land use malpractice and its feedbacks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose an approach to evaluate the credibility of the model projections in the context of observations, while also generalizing future increases in the ratio of record highs to record lows as a function only of future mean temperature increases over the continental United States that are independent of scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier results (1) are confirmed, in that the ratio of daily record highs to record lows over the United States has been increasing, such that the average value in the first decade of the 20th century was about 21, even when starting from a period as warm as the 1930s in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newer CCSM4 simulations at both resolutions, as well as 23 other CMIP5 models, show a greater number of record highs compared with observations, although with a comparable decrease in record lows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in part a result of the warm 1930s over the United States, such that starting a compilation of daily temperature records in the warm decade of the 1930s makes it more difficult to set daily record highs later on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is evidenced by the observed values of record highs lying below the expected 1/n line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting the compilation at successively more recent start dates in decades cooler than the 1930s produces better agreement with the expected 1/n values, but still points to a persistent warm bias in the model versions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assuming the warm 1930s was partly a result of naturally occurring internally generated climate variability related to tropical Pacific SSTs, and partly a result of disastrous land use practices in large parts of the United States that exacerbated the warmth of the 1930s, we would not expect model simulations to capture those features of the observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional factor that has been identified in other studies as affecting the behavior of high temperature extremes is increased evapotranspiration, which can contribute to lower daytime maxima during summer, but does not have a particularly large influence on nighttime minima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the well-observed quantity of precipitation as an indicator of evapotranspiration (daily Tmax is negatively correlated with precipitation, whereas precipitation is positively correlated with evapotranspiration), observations over the United States show a trend toward greater precipitation that is not matched in the two model versions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the model simulations likely have decreased evapotranspiration compared with the observations, and this contributes to a greater number of simulated record high maxima than observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is then desired to generalize future projections of temperature extremes, as represented by the ratio of record highs to record lows, as a function of mean temperature change, so that the projections of the ratio in the future are independent of scenario and independent of future precipitation trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the latter, we have demonstrated how the effect of observed precipitation trends on Tmax trends is reproduced by CCSM4, and is therefore implicit in modeled future Tmax values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An empirical calculation involving a nonlinear fit for observations as a function of mean temperature is extended to future warmer mean temperatures and compared with a similar calculation from the future projections in the two model versions for 20th and 21st century climate (RCP8.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach not only provides a way to evaluate model projections in the context of the available observations but also allows quantification of future changes of extremes as a function of mean temperature increases that are independent of scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique shows that future model projections of the increase in the ratio are likely biased somewhat high mainly because of the model systematic error of simulating greater numbers of daily record highs compared with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, for example, for a 3 °C annual average warming over the United States, the ratio of record highs to record lows is projected to be 15 ± 8 compared to the present average ratio of just over 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use maximum, minimum, and precipitation daily records from a subset of stations in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA/NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily, Version 3.20) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of stations with coverage beginning at least by 1930 and updated to current dates is 1,408.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not perform any additional quality control (beyond what is already performed over the stations in the GHCN), but we include all of the stations available after checking that over the period 19502004; the results obtained on the basis of the set of stations going back to 1930 are consistent with the results based on the (larger) set of stations used in our 2009 study going back only to 1950.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the new set, we expand the period under consideration from 1950 to 2006 (1) back to 1930 and forward to 2015, such that the warm 1930s are included in the analysis, and the results are updated closer to present day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are presented as totals over the entire continental US region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We are aware of two possible sources of observational bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is likely that record low minima for some stations are somewhat skewed to a cool bias (e.g., more record lows than should have occurred) because of changes of observing time (1, 24), although this effect is considered to be minor and should not qualitatively change the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some stations used two types of thermometers to record maximum and minimum temperatures (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a switch to the Max/Min Temperature System in the 1980s at about half the US stations, such that thermistor measurements are made for maximum and minimum, although this effect is considered to be small (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model data are from two versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One has the standard 1° latitudelongitude resolution in the atmosphere (CAM4) that was run for simulations of 20th-century and 21st-century climate within the CMIP5 protocol (26), where for the 20th century, both natural (volcanoes and solar) and anthropogenic [greenhouse gasses (GHGs), ozone, and direct effect of sulfate aerosols] forcings are included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this particular experiment, however, a large ensemble of 30 realizations from slightly perturbed initial conditions was run, starting from 1920 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other model version uses the same configuration of ocean, sea ice, and land surface components, but the atmospheric model is configured to run at a higher resolution of one-half degree in latitude/longitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The half-degree version is run for four realizations of 20th-century climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two model versions, differing only in resolution of the atmosphere, are then run for a future climate simulation to 2100, using RCP8.5 with the same number of ensemble members as in the 20th-century simulations (i.e., 30 and 4, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full discussion and description of evapotranspiration-related processes in the models is given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The response of the models ensemble members in the main text (represented by the median values in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) shows a behavior of more maximum temperatures falling above the expected 1/n line compared with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observations have most maximum temperature values below the 1/n line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar analysis of record high behavior across the available daily output from a CMIP5 ensemble of 23 additional models confirms that none of them shows a similar behavior to the observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of them, in lesser or larger measure, simulate the increase in record highs from the expected 1/n stationary behavior, starting in the early 1980s (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A version of Fig 3A in the main text shows a preference for the JJA season for observed record highs to be below the 1/n estimate compared with DecemberJanuaryFebruary for the post-1980 period (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The connection between daily Tmax and precipitation trends is shown in Fig S4, where there is a shift in the observed distribution of Tmax to negative trend values compared with the shift to positive values of precipitation trends (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the observed negative trends in Tmax occur in the central United States, corresponding to positive precipitation trends in that same area (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reflected in negative correlations between Tmax and precipitation there in the observations (Fig S5A), and is illustrated with an example from the LE model results (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship does not change in the future climate in the model and, if anything, is stronger and more geographically widespread (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To connect Tmax and precipitation to evapotranspiration (using the LE model as an illustrative example; the Hdeg model shows similar results), Fig S6 shows that JJA trends in Tmax (Fig S6A) are negatively correlated with comparable trends in evapotranspiration (Fig S6C; pattern correlation of 0.5), with the largest negative associations in the western United States and Great Plains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, JJA trends in precipitation (Fig S6B) are positively correlated with trends in evapotranspiration (Fig S6C), as could be expected from the discussion earlier (positive pattern correlation of +0.4), with the largest positive associations in similar areas as the negative connections for precipitation noted earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With regard to the future and whether these relationships could change in some way, Fig S7 shows there is still a negative link between JJA Tmax and precipitation for trends in the LE model from 2006 to 2100 (pattern correlation of 0.5), and a positive connection between JJA precipitation trends and evapotranspiration (pattern correlation of +0.6), both consistent with the 19302015 trends in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S8 compares the values of the regression coefficients for the log-linear fit when using individual ensemble members, as opposed to fitting a single line to all of them jointly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three panels correspond to the same type of analysis with different starting dates of 1930, 1950, and 1970.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each panel, the histogram describes the distribution of 30 values from the 30 ensemble members of the LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid red line marks the value of the coefficient in the observed relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
