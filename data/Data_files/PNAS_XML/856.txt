Self-organization process in newborn skin organoid formation inspires strategy to restore hair regeneration of adult cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study opens avenues to improve the ability of adult skin cells to form a fully functional skin, with clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our investigation elucidates a relay of molecular events and biophysical processes at the core of the self-organization process during tissue morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecules key to the multistage morphological transition are identified and can be added or inhibited to restore the stalled process in adult cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principles uncovered here are likely to function in other organ systems and will inspire us to view organoid morphogenesis, embryogenesis, and regeneration differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of these findings will enable rescue of robust hair formation in adult skin cells, thus eventually helping patients in the context of regenerative medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organoids made from dissociated progenitor cells undergo tissue-like organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in vitro self-organization process is not identical to embryonic organ formation, but it achieves a similar phenotype in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies genetic codes do not specify morphology directly; instead, complex tissue architectures may be achieved through several intermediate layers of cross talk between genetic information and biophysical processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use newborn and adult skin organoids for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated cells from newborn mouse skin form hair primordia-bearing organoids that grow hairs robustly in vivo after transplantation to nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed time-lapse imaging of 3D cultures revealed unexpected morphological transitions between six distinct phases: dissociated cells, cell aggregates, polarized cysts, cyst coalescence, planar skin, and hair-bearing skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome profiling reveals the sequential expression of adhesion molecules, growth factors, Wnts, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional perturbations at different times discern their roles in regulating the switch from one phase to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, adult cells form small aggregates, but then development stalls in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative transcriptome analyses suggest suppressing epidermal differentiation in adult cells is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results inspire a strategy that can restore morphological transitions and rescue the hair-forming ability of adult organoids: (i) continuous PKC inhibition and (ii) timely supply of growth factors (IGF, VEGF), Wnts, and MMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comprehensive study demonstrates that alternating molecular events and physical processes are in action during organoid morphogenesis and that the self-organizing processes can be restored via environmental reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tissue-level phase transition could drive self-organization behavior in organoid morphogenies beyond the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dissociated_Progenitor_Cells_Form_Planar_Skin_in_Vitro_via_a_Stepwise_Self-Organizing_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neonatal mouse dorsal skin is separated into epidermis and dermis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tissue is then dissociated into single cells (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of epidermal and dermal cells is grown as 3D cultures on cell-culture inserts in a Transwell system, forming an airliquid interface (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase-contrast microscopy shows white patches are formed at day 1 (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining for K14 and K10 indicates those patches originate from basal epidermal cells rather than from suprabasal epidermal cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, immunostaining and H&E staining showed these epidermal aggregates display morphological changes during culture (Fig 1 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S1 D and E), which reveal a self-organization process through six consecutive stages:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ratio of epidermal to dermal (E:D) cells influences epidermal cell aggregation (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with aggregate formation using combinations of epidermal and dermal cells (1:9 ratio), very small aggregates form when only epidermal cells are cultured, indicating that the self-organization process is dermal cell-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that a higher E:D ratio would lead to larger aggregate formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, a higher E:D ratio causes smaller aggregates to form, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next sought to isolate pure epidermal and dermal populations using FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed cultures of pure populations from FACS-sorted K14GFP+ epidermal and PdgfraEGFP+ dermal cells at a ratio of 1:9 produced similar-sized aggregates (SI Appendix, Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adult_Cells_Fail_to_Self-Organize  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When adult mouse cells are used in a parallel mixed-cell reconstitution assay, epidermal cells form only a few small aggregates, which do not grow, as demonstrated by immunostaining for specific markers (Fig 1 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowering the E:D cell ratio to 1:30 produces larger aggregates which undergo terminal differentiation and fail to coalesce at day 4 (SI Appendix, Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplanting those adult cells at different E:D ratios to the dorsum of nude mice produced very few hairs compared with the robust hair follicle regeneration seen with newborn mouse cells (Fig 1D and SI Appendix, Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These assays demonstrate that cells from newborn mice have a greater capacity for self-organization and tissue regeneration in this assay than cells derived from older ( greater than 2-mo-old) mice and that the self-organization capacity of cells is required for prospective tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm that dermal cells are required for epidermal cell self-organization, we performed a recombination assay, including newborn epidermal cells plus adult dermal cells (NE+AD) and newborn dermal cells + adult epidermal cells (ND+AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result shows that the ND+AE group undergoes a self-organization process more similar to that of the newborn mouse cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epidermal cells form small aggregates at day 1, which grow larger and form cysts at day 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial cysts undergo coalescence at day 4 and form a double-layered epidermal plane at day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the epidermal cells from the NE+AD group form very small aggregates at day 1, which cannot further polarize at day 3 or coalesce at day 4, resulting in terminal differentiation at day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When transplanted onto the nude mice, those cells form very few hairs compared with the ND+AE group, which form numerous hairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Live_Imaging_of_Cellular_Behaviors_During_Organoid_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To observe how cells behave in this assay, we set up a time-lapse live-imaging system using fluorescent confocal microscopy to visualize and quantify cell motility (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five major stages of cellular behaviors were observed before hair placode induction based on live imaging of K14-GFP mouse (25) cells showing the epidermal basal component (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell tracking revealed that epidermal cells move in an undirected manner, i.e., with low directional persistence, throughout the experiment (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cell velocities decrease as more cells are in clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we were motivated to describe epidermal cell aggregation, as a first approximation, using the Smoluchowski coagulation equations with a size-dependent aggregation rate (SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical solutions to these equations match aggregate cluster size distributions from the initial stage of the aggregation process (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only free parameter in this model is the overall aggregation rate constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to fitting the numerical solution to the data, we collapse the size distributions from different time points onto a single curve (SI Appendix, Fig S3G) by rescaling relative to the average cluster size at each time point, thus confirming the aggregation model in a parameter-free manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size distributions from the 48-h time point do not scale as predicted by the theory (SI Appendix, Fig S3G), indicating a change in cluster growth dynamics during the transition to stage 2, when aggregates develop polarity and interact with dermal cells through the formation of a basement membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined dermal cell behavior by observing Pdgfra-EGFP mouse cells (Movie S3), which represent all dermal cell lineages (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six major stages were observed comparable to the stages in epidermal cells (Fig 2J):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transcriptome_Profiling_During_the_Self-Organization_Process_to_Form_Skin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the molecular basis of the self-organization process, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in duplicate at seven time points (SI Appendix, Fig S4A), showing six groups of genes that were differentially expressed at different stages (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4 AC and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those genes were further classified into four major categories based on cellular processes (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatiotemporal_Genes_Expression_During_the_Self-Organization_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the spatiotemporal expression of genes identified by RNA-seq, we performed immunostaining and in situ hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the specific genes and pathways based on three principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The functional annotation of the selected pathway should have significance (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The genes in those pathways selected for immunostaining or in situ hybridization should be at a detectable level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we checked the gene expression by looking at their RPKM (reads per kilobases per million reads) value (usually larger than 25 for gene-expression studies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The phenotypes observed in the morphological transition processes were also matched with functional annotations to target the potential genes or pathways in these top enriched pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed that adhesion molecules, including -catenin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), P-cadherin (Cdh3), and E-cadherin (Cdh1), are strongly expressed in the epidermal cells, particularly at the border of the cyst (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also selected one sample gene representing each highly enriched signaling pathway for testing by in situ hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that Igfbp3, Vegfa, and Tgfbi are expressed in the dermis surrounding the epidermal aggregates (SI Appendix, Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A basement membrane forms at the outer part of the cyst, shown by collagen type I and type IV, and Lamc2 expression (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many cells in the center of the cyst undergo apoptosis and stop proliferating after day 2 (SI Appendix, Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At day 4, during epidermal aggregate coalescence, the chain of cells that protrudes from the aggregates expresses E-cadherin, P-cadherin, -catenin, Dsc3, and Dsg3 (SI Appendix, Fig S5E), indicating its epidermal identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MMPs may play a role in breaking the basement membrane to release the epidermal cells from the aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested Mmp14 and Mmp13 expression, which was highly up-regulated based on our RNA-seq analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mmp14 is observed both in the basal layer of the aggregate and in the dermal cells surrounding the aggregate at day 3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, Mmp14 expression was occasionally observed in the dermal chain (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mmp13 is preferentially expressed at the liquid phase of the aggregates from day 3.5 (SI Appendix, Fig S5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The inner part of the cyst fuses together after the cyst coalesces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ hybridization shows genes involved in epidermal differentiation are expressed in this same region, which becomes the suprabasal layer of the planar skin (Fig 4D and SI Appendix, Fig S5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the spatiotemporal expression of molecules in both epidermal and dermal cells may trigger epidermal and dermal interactions in different phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the dermal microenvironment secretes ECM, including collagens that facilitate basement membrane formation at day 2, and then is broken by the MMPs at day 4, which may lead to the dynamic cellular behaviors observed between stage 1 and stage 4 during the self-organizing planar skin-forming process (SI Appendix, Fig S5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that different classes of molecules are required to transition between different stages of skin organoid morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted these are early events that precede periodic formation of hair primordia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Perturbation_of_the_Skin_Organoid_Formation_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dermal_Cells_Used_for_Periodic_Patterning_Are_from_Papillary_Dermis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to epidermal cell patterning, we examined which dermal cell population enhanced planar skin formation in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lrig1 and Dlk1 are expressed in the upper and lower dermis, respectively, during skin development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those different populations have different hair follicle-regenerative abilities during reconstitution (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, RNA-seq data showed that Dlk1 expression was quickly lost at day 1, and Lrig1 was decreased but was maintained at a certain level during culture, indicating that the dermal cells of the reconstituted skin originated from the upper dermis (SI Appendix, Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a K14-GFP/Lef1-RFP mouse in the reconstitution assay, we observed that Lef1-RFP+ cells that belong to the papillary dermis were located adjacent to the epidermal plane (SI Appendix, Fig S7F, Upper and Movie S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also indicated by Lef1 immunostaining, which shows that three or four layers of Lef1+ cells are located beside the epidermal plane (SI Appendix, Fig S7F, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dermal cells can form dermal condensate-like structures that are alkaline phosphatase-positive (SI Appendix, Fig S7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dermal condensate was also observed by culturing skin cells from a Sox2-EGFP transgenic mouse at day 11 (SI Appendix, Fig S7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplanting these cultures into nude mice results in the formation of hair follicles with irregular spacing between each hair follicle, compared with the evenly spaced buds between hair follicles that are physiologically developed during embryogenesis in mouse (SI Appendix, Fig S7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the reconstituted skin is competent to form new placodes, but competence in different parts of the explants may not be achieved at the same time, giving rise to the irregular pattern observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More studies will be needed to investigate this phenomenon further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rescuing_the_Hair_Regeneration_Ability_of_Adult_Mouse_Skin_Cells_by_Restoring_the_Self-Organization_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further tested whether the principles governing morphological transitions in newborn mouse cells could be applied to restore the self-organizing abilities of adult mouse cells ( greater than 2 mo old) to form hair-bearing skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed RNA-seq using adult-cellderived organoid cultures and compared the results with those using newborn cells at corresponding time points (SI Appendix, Fig S8 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both newborn and adult cells can form small aggregates, but adult cell aggregates stall before the aggregates grow larger (Fig 1 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we selected genes that are up-regulated in both newborn cells and adult cells at 6 h that foster cell aggregation and genes up-regulated only in newborn cells but not in adult cells at day 1 and day 2 that may be responsible for later phase-transitionlike events (Fig 6A and SI Appendix, Fig S8 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gene ontology results show that genes involved in the Igf and Vegf signaling pathways are highly enriched in both newborn and adult cells at 6 h but are up-regulated in newborn cells compared with adult cells at day 1 and day 2 (SI Appendix, Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some Wnt genes such Rspo2, Wnt3a, and Wnt10b are also expressed at a higher level in newborn cells (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biggest difference we observed is that adult cells quickly differentiate in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the newborn culture, in which epidermal differentiation genes become enriched at later stages (D7), many EDC genes start to be enriched from 6 h or day 1 in adult cultures (Fig 6B and SI Appendix, Fig S8F), which could be one of the main reasons that cells lose their competence to regenerate hairs and terminally differentiate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on transcriptome analyses and functional studies, we have found that altering the expression of just one molecule at a time does not produce impressive advances in restoring hair formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, guided by our concept learned from newborn skin cultures, we are able to design a systemic pathway to restore the organoid formation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set up a stepwise method to reinduce the self-organization process per our RNA-seq analyses (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first added multiple growth factors, including IGF and VEGF, at the initial stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then added Wnt3a or Wnt10b recombinant proteins at day 1, due to their dual function in newborn cells, including enlarging aggregate size and accelerating aggregate coalescence, and their reduced expression in adult cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we added MMPs from day 3 to trigger the coalescence of aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, to prevent epidermal cell differentiation, we added PKC inhibitors throughout the whole cultivation period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results show that the addition of IGF2, IGFBP3, or VEGF2 recombinant proteins led to an enlarged aggregate size (Fig 6 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig S8 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, a single addition of IGF2, IGFBP3, or VEGF2 recombinant proteins is sufficient to induce aggregates to enlarge significantly in size at day 1 and day 2, but then they terminally differentiate at day 3 (SI Appendix, Fig S8G), indicating those factors can enhance cell adhesion but cannot maintain planar skin-forming properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of Wnt3a or Wnt10b recombinant proteins at day 1 further increases aggregate size at day 2 and induces epidermal cell chain protrusions at day 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a single addition of Wnt3a or Wnt10b at time 0 is also sufficient to enlarge aggregate size at day 2, although with a probability of less dense hair regeneration upon transplantation (SI Appendix, Fig S8 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coalescence of aggregates occurred when MMP14 recombinant protein was added subsequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coalesced aggregates can descend directly to the liquid phase and form symmetric epidermal layers, indicating that signals involved in aggregate descent are induced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These restored adult organoids were then transplanted to the dorsum of nude mice, where regeneration of hair follicles increased from 0 to around 40% of the levels seen with newborn cell organoid cultures (Fig 6 D and F and SI Appendix, Fig S8H, n = 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K14-GFP shows the regenerated hair follicles are derived from donor cells (SI Appendix, Fig S8L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Self-Organizing_Process_of_Planar_Skin_Formation_from_Dissociated_Cells_Is_Counterintuitive  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have developed a 3D in vitro organoid model in which dissociated newborn mouse skin cells are cultured at high density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives us the unique opportunity to visualize the process leading from individual cells to skin with time-lapse movies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within a 10-d period, we observed that the dissociated cells progress through a series of morphological phase transitions to achieve a planar layer of presumptive skin with hair primordia (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grafting of this explant to nude mice with a full-thickness skin wound leads to well-formed reconstituted skin with robust hair growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hair follicles have normal architecture and can undergo cyclic regeneration, fulfilling the definition of tissue-engineered hair follicles (19, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, close inspection of this process revealed two surprises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in skin development, presumptive skin covers the body surface; then periodically arranged dermal condensation and epidermal placode start to emerge around embryonic day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, it is remarkable, because the dissociated cells, having lost all external cues in developing embryos, can reroute and traverse a different morphogenetic path to acquire the same phenotype they have in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not what one would expect if morphogenesis were to occur based on a simple molecular blueprint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it indicates that more fundamental self-organization principles are followed by the dissociated cells to achieve their final morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, planar skin has a simple configuration consisting of an epidermis and a dermis, with a basement membrane in between.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one may intuitively consider that dissociated epidermal and dermal cells, mixed in suspension, could simply sort themselves out and form sandwich-like cellular layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the cells in our assay take a tortuous route from dissociated cells  aggregate  polarized cysts  coalescing cysts  planar hair-bearing skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that direct formation of the final, layered skin may well violate the physical constraints imposed by the nature of the active material that the mixture of cells constitutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the morphological phase-transitionlike events we describe here may represent the most efficient, feasible way for cells to self-organize along a path of least resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, the straight line is the shortest distance between two points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the morphospace of multicellular configurations (Fig 7), a straight path may not be the shortest path: It may be easier for cells to take a winding route through a landscape of possible tissue architectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What, then, are the guiding principles that determine this route?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue-Level_Morphological_Phase_Transitions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we look at the phenomenon of multicellular self-organization from the biophysicists perspective, borrowing the concepts of phase transitions at the tissue level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term phase transition is most commonly used to describe the transformation of matter from one phase/state to another as a function of changes in internal variables or the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase transitions have recently been shown to mediate cytoplasmic organization at the subcellular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembly and disassembly of nucleoli and other nuclear bodies cycle between liquid-phase droplets and solid-phase condensations and can be modulated by rRNA transcription (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase transition of the microtubule-associated zinc finger protein plays an essential role in the assembly of the spindle apparatus and its associated components (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is compelling to extend this biophysical concept to multicellular self-organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider cells in our assay as particles with certain surface properties, performing a random walk (approximately, see Fig 2E) in a crowded 3D environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two major particle categories, epidermal (E) and dermal (D), so the major interparticle interactions are EE, DD, and ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially epidermal cells form aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these aggregates reach a certain size, apicalbasal polarity develops, leading to the formation of a cyst-like structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apicalbasal polarity means the inner core and the outer shell of the cyst exhibit different affinities to the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside the cyst, the interaction of basement membrane with dermal fibroblasts and the presence of MMPs destabilize the cyst structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The merging of cysts, the fusion of smaller lamellar planes, and thus the eventual large-scale planar configuration may simply be a straightforward consequence of interactions between cell aggregates whose physical properties are changing over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biophysical analogy we draw here, although the size scale and dynamics are different from those in soft-matter systems, may shed light on how the system self-organizes into different multicellular configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_and_Physical_Events_of_Organoid_Formation_from_Newborn_Skin_Inspire_a_Strategy_to_Restore_Hair_Formation_in_Adult_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To profile the molecular events associated with the observed morphological transitions, we analyzed the skin cells transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there are four peaks of molecular expression, each corresponding to a tissue phase transition: growth factors for the aggregate formation stage (days 02); ECM including collagens for apicalbasal polarity and cyst formation (days 14); Wnts and MMPs for coalescence of the aggregates (days 36); and NFkb and laminin for tissue remodeling in the planar formation stage (days 610) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional perturbation with inhibitors of the key molecules at each phase-transition stage can suppress or accelerate the phase-transition process (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The components of these organoid cultures are difficult to dissect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of getting into spatial dissection, we decided to do time-point analyses of the whole culture first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis will provide us with the first level of information about which molecular pathways are important for the morphological transition between stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells from adult mouse skin are quiescent and normally fail to form hairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the logic of our biophysical analogy, we reasoned that we should be able to restore the phenotype by supplying the necessary molecules to the adult cells to reestablish phase-transitionlike self-organization behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the cellular and molecular properties of adult cells to find ways to restore their morphogenetic ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By mapping the cell configuration back to the morphospace of Fig 7, we can appreciate that adult cell cultures are stuck in the aggregation phase (x axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By RNA-seq, we found that epidermal differentiation genes appear at an early stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To restore the ability of adult cells to form hair-bearing skin, we designed a protocol based on the knowledge derived from newborn cell cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we added inhibitors to PKC to keep cells in undifferentiated states longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we sequentially added three categories of molecules: (i) IGF2/Vegf, (ii) Wnt3a and Wnt10b, and (iii) MMP14 recombinant proteins at days 0, 1, and 3, respectively, to facilitate progression through the morphogenetic stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, keratinocyte differentiation is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, under the induction of these sequentially added proteins, the morphological transitions are reestablished, and adult cells become competent to reconstitute skin that, upon transplantation, forms hairs robustly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified multiple positive and negative regulatory modules directing the progression of morphological transitions during skin organoid formation (Fig 5I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of focusing on a single molecule, we think the successive phase-transitionlike events are the key to successful self-organization (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, dissociated cells can self-assemble to form many possible multicellular configurations (cell aggregates, cysts, tubes, sheets, and other configurations) in a hypothetical morphospace (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between each phase, activators and inhibitors work as a feedback control to stop the earlier phase and initiate the next phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, simply getting bigger cell aggregates is not useful if they do not progress into cyst stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphospace in Fig 7 can also be useful to appreciate the diverse morphogenetic phenotypes by different epithelial organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, reconstituted primary mammary myoepithelial cells and luminal cells can form glandular cystic aggregates when placed on Matrigel substrates (2, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when FGF2 is provided, the cysts undergo branching morphogenesis (36) and do not coalesce toward a planar configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the end point is a planar skin with hairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest there are molecular specificities among different cell types that steer the transitions through morphospace to different multicellular configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we propose that the combined use of molecular signals and biophysical processes may be a basic principle used by nature to drive morphological transitions from one phase to the next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the progression of these phase switches, not the specific molecules, that is the key to the success of self-organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing more examples of organoid morphogenesis in this context, we stand to learn more about how different physical principles are combined with intrinsic cellular properties to achieve self-organization, thus enhancing our ability to apply these principles to advance tissue engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In_Vitro_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 1A, cells were prepared according to our previously described method (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Usually, the E:D ratio in a piece of back skin from a newborn mouse is about 1:9 when we dissociate the back skin into single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the preparation of adult cells, the skins (n  3) from 2-mo-old mice, in which hair follicles are at refractory telogen phase, were peeled off before the hair fibers were plucked through waxing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the s.c. fat was removed from the skins by scissors, and the skins were floated on a 0.25% trypsin solution at 4 °C for overnight digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epidermis was scrapped off the dermis by a scalpel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then epidermis and dermis were dissociated into single cells as in the preparation of newborn cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociated epidermal cell and dermal cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:9 and were dropped onto to a Transwell culture insert (Fisher Scientific) that was put in a six-well culture plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower part of the culture insert was filled with 1.5 mL DMEM/F12 (1: 1) (Gibco) culture medium containing 10% FBS (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with the culture medium being changed every other day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal procedures were performed upon approval of the University of Southern California (USC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S3A, cells were cultured on a Transwell insert placed in a glass culture plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate was covered by a latex membrane to avoid evaporation of the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was kept at 37 °C by placing the plate on a heating platform and by heating the lens, which was immersed in the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A LSM5 meta confocal microscope was used to film the cellular behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting 4D (3D space plus time) cellular images were then tracked using commercially available Imaris software (Bitplane) at the Broad California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) Center at the University of Southern California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
