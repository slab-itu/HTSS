Restructuring of nutrient flows in island ecosystems following human colonization evidenced by isotopic analysis of commensal rats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The arrival of humans and human-introduced species to Pacific islands resulted in significant, long-lasting transformations to local ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct measurements of deep-time human effects can be difficult to quantify from archaeological datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopically reconstructed diet of the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), a commensal species introduced by humans during one of the most dramatic archaeological examples of past human migration and ecosystem alteration, can provide insight into resource availability and utilization within the human-commensal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight significant long-term restructuring of nutrient flows through ecosystems resulting from human arrival and subsequent land use on three Polynesian islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that stable isotope analysis of often-ignored commensal taxa represents a tool for tracking human activities and ecosystem effects more broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of humans in shaping local ecosystems is an increasing focus of archaeological research, yet researchers often lack an appropriate means of measuring past anthropogenic effects on local food webs and nutrient cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable isotope analysis of commensal animals provides an effective proxy for local human environments because these species are closely associated with human activities without being under direct human management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such species are thus central to nutrient flows across a range of socionatural environments and can provide insight into how they intersected and transformed over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we measure and compare stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) skeletal remains across three Polynesian island systems [Mangareva, Ua Huka (Marquesas), and the Polynesian Outlier of Tikopia] during one of the most significant cases of human migration and commensal introduction in prehistory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrate widespread 15N declines across these islands that are associated with human land use, intensification, and faunal community restructuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local comparison of rat stable isotope data also tracks human activities and resource availability at the level of the settlement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the large-scale restructuring of nutrient flows in island ecosystems that resulted from human colonization and ecosystem engineering activities on Pacific islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also demonstrate that stable isotope analysis of often-ignored commensal taxa can provide a tool for tracking human land use and environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Full stable isotope results, bone collagen evaluation criteria, and contextual information for Tikopia, Mangareva, and Ua Huka archaeological materials are presented in SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3, with statistical analyses of rat 13C and 15N from all sites reported in SI Appendix, Tables S4S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistically significant temporal declines in rat 15N values across archaeological strata are seen across all islands studied except for Agakauitai Island, Mangareva (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Kamaka Island (Mangareva), a KruskalWallis test indicates a significant decline in 15N (P less_than 0.05), although the pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test did not produce clear differences between layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when samples were grouped into culturally meaningful time periods (SI Appendix, Table S8), differences in rat 15N at Kamaka were significant (from 16.6 ± 2.3 to 13.9 ± 1.8, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Taravai Island (Mangareva) this shift to lower 15N values occurs from layer II to I in the TAR-6 site (from 11.7 ± 1.8 to 7.8 ± 2.5, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Ua Huka Island (Marquesas), it occurs from phase I to III in the Hane site (14.6 ± 2.2 to 11.5 ± 1.0, P less_than 0.05), cooccurring with a transition in site use from intensive occupation to a more ceremonial function (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, declines in rat 15N on Tikopia Island occur at the transition between two archaeologically defined cultural periods on the island: the early Kiki and subsequent Sinapupu Phases (13.2 ± 1.3 to 9.5 ± 1.2, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, a trend of declining rat 15N after human colonization across Polynesian islands is strongly evidenced (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single exception to this pattern is the Agakauitai Island rat sequence, which displays no significant change in 15N values through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest shifts in 15N values occur on Taravai, Ua Huka, and Tikopia Islands, with mean 15N values declining by 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Smaller shifts occur in rat collagen 13C on Agakauitai, Ua Huka, and Tikopia Islands (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Tables S4S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in 13C reflect broad transformations to terrestrial landscapes, as well as changes in human subsistence practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Agakauitai Island, rat 13C becomes significantly higher from layer IV to layer II, suggesting greater inputs of C4 or marine resources (from 17.7 ± 1.7 to 15.9 ± 2.5, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most introduced Polynesian crops (except sugarcane) are C3 and thus display lower 13C values, it is likely that these higher 13C values reflect increased dietary inputs of marine resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the elevated 15N values also displayed in the same samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Pacific rats are strictly terrestrial, they are most likely to have obtained marine resources as anthropogenic subsidies in the form of human meal scraps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, on both Ua Huka and Tikopia Islands, rat 13C becomes significantly lower over time, indicating larger inputs of terrestrial C3 resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Ua Huka Island, this shift occurs alongside declines in 15N, from phase I to phase III (from 15.5 ± 2.2 to 18.2 ± 0.7, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, on Tikopia, lower 13C occurs simultaneously with declining 15N values at the transition from the Kiki to Sinapupu Phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in rat 13C between phases on Tikopia were statistically significant (KruskalWallis, P less_than 0.05), with post hoc analysis not producing statistically significant differences between layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the Sinapupu and Tuakamali Phase samples are grouped together, differences in 13C become significant (from 17.4 ± 1.9 to 20.1 ± 1.7, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower 13C values coupled with declining 15N suggests an increasing dietary focus on introduced, terrestrial C3 resources such as breadfruit, taro, and yams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temporal changes in rat collagen 13C and 15N presented here from three island systems demonstrate wide-scale reorganizations of island nutrient flows across Pacific islands over the course of pre-European human occupation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biogeographic characteristics of each island system, coupled with unique human cultural developments (including agricultural regimes and subsistence strategies), influenced the spatiotemporal patterning of rat collagen 13C and 15N across the study islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant trend of declining rat 15N values through time is evident in all cases with a single exception (Agakauitai Island, Mangareva; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the observed declines in 15N occurred at different times on each island, and oceanic 15N baselines appear to have been relatively stable through this period until approximately AD 1850 (30, 31), it is not likely that these declines are related to climate-induced shifts in island baselines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, these declines in rat 15N can largely be attributed to a suite of human land use activities and ecological effects, the most important of which include faunal extinctions (particularly seabirds), resource depression, and the intensification of agricultural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human land use practices are known to alter soil and plant baseline 15N values in different ecosystems around the world (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 and 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural and anthropogenic fires have been shown to enrich foliar 15N up to +8.6 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects can last for decades and produce plant 15N values similar to those observed with manuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire was likely important on the Polynesian Outlier Tikopia, where excavations in the Rakisu agricultural zone document an early period of intensive fire use for forest clearance and swidden agriculture [Kiki Phase, approximately 800 BC to AD 100 (34)], followed in the subsequent Sinapupu Phase (approximately AD 1001200) by a decline in the use of fire and the development of a multistory arboricultural system (agroforestry) that mimicked natural forest cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the Tuakamali Phase (approximately AD 1200), fire was no longer in use on the island (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changing fire management practices were influential in driving rat 15N declines through time on Tikopia, especially as the development of intensive agroforestry renewed available avifaunal habitat across the island (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fire use may also have affected 15N values on other islands, there is no similar archaeological evidence for a transition from intensive fire use to its complete elimination in the other cases presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Declines through time in rat 15N values in Pacific island ecosystems are also likely linked to human effects on native faunal populations, especially birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land birds and ground-nesting seabirds were particularly vulnerable to extinction from habitat destruction and predation by humans and introduced species, including the Pacific rat (16, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major reductions in the populations of both seabirds and land birds, leading in many cases to extirpation and extinction, are well documented for Tikopia, the Marquesas, and Mangareva (3740).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat 15N likely decreased through time as contributions of avifaunaparticularly seabirdsto rat diet declined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were compounded by the gradual removal of 15N-enriched seabird guano from terrestrial systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seabird guano can be a critical source of soil nutrient (P and N) inputs, particularly on small islands (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental studies have shown that animal fertilizers can significantly increase plant 15N values, with seabirds having the largest potential effect of up to 44.7 (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has previously been argued that seabird population declines on Mangareva accelerated soil nutrient depletion, lowering island baseline 15N values and terrestrial productivity (39, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On both Ua Huka (Marquesas) and Tikopia, rat 13C values also decreased alongside declining 15N values (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fire ecology and avifaunal extinctions largely influence 15N values, lower 13C values indicate a rat dietary change toward greater inputs of terrestrial, C3 resources through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger size of Ua Huka and the geologically young and nutrient-rich soil substrates of Tikopia provided ample environments for the development of intensive agricultural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By European contact, both of these islands featured intensive agricultural and arboricultural systems focused on C3 crops (35, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also evidence for marine resource depression and changing fishing practices on both islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Tikopia, natural shoreline progradation significantly increased areas of cultivable land on the island, while simultaneously decreasing the area of exploitable reef habitats over time (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faunal remains from the site support declines in shellfish procurement and increased pig populations from the Kiki to Sinapupu Phases (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Ua Huka, analyses of fishhook assemblages and fish remains indicate a shift from offshore pelagic fishing to exploitation of lower trophic level resources in the nearshore environment (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing quantities of pig and shellfish remains at the Hane Dune site after AD 1400 further suggest a later focus on terrestrial and nearshore resources (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend toward lower 15N and 13C in Pacific rat remains marks this transition from early exploitation of native fauna to the generation of new, anthropogenic subsistence landscapes dominated by introduced terrestrial C3 cultivars and domesticates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relatively consistent 15N values displayed by rats on the island of Agakautai within Mangareva are the exception that proves the general rule of direct human influence on rat diet, particularly with regard to marine resource availability to rat populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agricultural potential of the Mangarevan Islands was limited by steep slopes with old, nutrient-poor soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These islands were subject to severe deforestation with limited opportunity for regeneration (48), further exacerbating seabird extirpations through habitat destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Mangarevas extensive and rich barrier reef/lagoon system appears to have experienced little to no resource depression following human colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethnohistoric evidence indicates that the Mangarevan people depended more heavily than most Polynesians on fishing for their subsistence base (49), and the dominance of fish remains across archaeofaunal assemblages from Mangareva indicates that this pattern extended into the deeper past (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term access by rats to abundant marine resources in the form of human meal scraps is reflected in the elevated 15N values at the continuously occupied Nenega-iti Rockshelter site on Agakauitai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat 15N values are observed to decline on the other two study islands within Mangareva, Kamaka and Taravai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the sites on these two islands were not continuously occupied by humans throughout their archaeological sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kamaka Island was intermittently inhabited, whereas the Onemea site on Taravai Island was abandoned after phase II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During periods of low site activity, rats would have received fewer marine dietary inputs through anthropogenic subsidies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these rats would have been reliant on foraging within a terrestrial environment that may have simultaneously undergone a decline in baseline 15N from the removal of seabird guano inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat collagen 13C at the Mangarevan sites changes little, or becomes higher over time, further suggesting frequent access to marine resources and a terrestrial landscape less dominated by introduced C3 agricultural plants in comparison with Tikopia or Ua Huka (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation conforms to previous isotopic analyses of human remains from the Fiji islands, which suggest that people inhabiting smaller islands with limited agricultural potential retain marine-focused diets into late prehistory (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacific rat 13C and 15N values are also influenced by the intensity and nature of human activities on the scale of the individual site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly apparent at the sites on Taravai and Ua Huka Islands (Fig 3C), which both contain rats from a late precontact phase that postdates intensive site occupation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Onemea site on Taravai Island underwent intensive use throughout phase II and was subsequently abandoned in phase I (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, activities at the Hane dune site on Ua Huka Island in the Marquesas appear to transition from an intensive habitation site to ceremonial complex at approximately AD 1400 (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat diet during intensive human activity phases in both instances appears to include inputs from high trophic level marine resources which rats likely procured from human meal scraps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The departure of humans from these sites resulted in 15N declines of around 4.0 [approximately one trophic level (22, 24)], reflecting the removal of anthropogenic marine subsidies from rat diet, and shifting to a diet more reminiscent of wild foraging (43, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pacific rat stable isotope analysis demonstrates the significant influence of human land use on restructuring local landscapes and nutrient pathways within the context of one of the most dramatic archaeological examples of past human migration and ecosystem alteration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal shifts in rat 13C and 15N reflect cultural and environmental transformations on islands that had not previously been subject to human occupation, including species extinctions and introductions, terrestrial and marine resource depression, landform change, and intensification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that these processes affected resource abundances and nutrient flows throughout entire island systems, which can then be traced through the diets of archaeologically recovered commensal remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable isotope data, as a proxy for the diets of commensal rats sharing the human niche, can demonstrably distinguish differences in human activity on a spatial scale between sites, as well as a temporal scale between contexts within a given site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The arrival of humans and human-translocated plant and animal species to previously uninhabited Pacific islands had profound effects on nutrient cycling throughout entire island systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a consistent pattern of lasting resource flow restructuring across islands and in particular a trend of declining 15N values that can be linked to patterns of island resource depression and agricultural intensification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of human activity in shaping Pacific island environments has previously been identified (14, 53, 54), our study provides a direct, quantitative measurement of the deep-time effects of human land use on restructuring nutrient pathways through anthropogenic island food webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that stable isotope analysis of the commensal Pacific rat is an effective method for investigating the effects of human ecosystem engineering activities on nutrient cycling at both region-wide and local scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is significant as interest grows in identifying the scale and nature of human ecosystem alterations in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring the extent of anthropogenic influences on ecological processes through quantitative changes in commensal diets also allows archaeological research to begin to make contributions to discussions of contemporary humanecosystem crises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With adequate spatial and chronological control, such analyses can be applied toward investigating the timing, intensity, and nature of anthropogenic effects in both island and continental regions, as well as enabling past instances of human landscape transformation to be compared with modern datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tikopia samples were selected from assemblages excavated by Patrick Kirch and Douglas Yen in 19771978 and housed in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analyzed with permission from the museum through a destructive analysis loan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples used in analysis, including those previously published, were preliminarily identified as Pacific rat by site excavators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifications were reconfirmed using comparative skeletons of brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), black rat (Rattus rattus), and Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) on loan from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species determinations were based primarily on size categories (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pacific rat is the only rat species present on Mangareva and the Marquesas until European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large spiny rat (Rattus praetor) was also present prehistorically on Tikopia; however, the femoral elements of these two species can be distinguished with a high degree of confidence based on size differences (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Minimum number of individuals was calculated within each site, unit, and layer to maximize sample sizes while minimizing the chance of sampling from the same individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femora were selected for analysis whenever possible because these elements preserve well and often possess species-diagnostic metric traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between levels, femora were compared for potential matching pairs to further eliminate double sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the Tikopia site, a total of 87 Pacific rat femora were selected from sites representing the Kiki (TK-4 and TK-36), Sinapupu (TK-35), and Tuakamali (TK-35) cultural phases (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stable_Isotope_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stable isotope data reported here from rat specimens recovered from Tikopia, as well as the previously published results from Mangareva and the Marquesas, were all derived using the same collagen extraction methods (after ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57, detailed in SI Appendix, Bone Collagen Extraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were conducted at the Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dry samples were weighed into tin caps and analyzed simultaneously for C and N contents (percent dry weight) and C and N stable isotope ratios using a CHNOS (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) Elemental Analyzer (vario ISOTOPE cube; Elementar) and Isoprime 100 mass spectrometer (Isoprime Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were normalized to international scales [Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPBD) and atmospheric nitrogen; Ambient Inhalable Reservoir (AIR)] using Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): NIST SRM 1547 (peach leaves) and in-house standards of fish meal (17.7 ± 0.1, 16.3 ± 0.2) and spirulina (32.1 ± 0.1, 11.0 ± 0.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term external precisions based on reference material NIST SRM 1577b (bovine liver) are 0.1 and 0.2 for 13C and 15N, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collagen was evaluated for preservation and contamination using the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (percent by weight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples displaying C:N ratios outside the range of 2.73.6 were eliminated from analysis (5759).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 46 samples were eliminated from the Tikopia analysis for not meeting this criterion, with the unfortunate effect of reducing representation of the Tuakamali phase to a single sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percent by weight carbon, percent by weight nitrogen, and percent collagen are reported in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern bone collagen contains roughly 35% carbon and 1116% nitrogen, and well-preserved, uncontaminated archaeological samples should approximate these values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of 0.5% preserved collagen is recommended for archaeological bone samples recovered from tropical environments (60), and all samples included in the analysis met this criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistically significant differences in rat 13C and 15N values between archaeological layers were evaluated using a KruskalWallis test followed by a post hoc Pairwise MannWhitneyWilcoxon test when P less_than 0.05 (SI Appendix, Tables S5S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for low sample sizes, archaeological strata were further grouped into early and late periods based on culturally meaningful distinctions for each island (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A KruskalWallis test was not run for samples from Taravai Island, because only two samples were compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.2 (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
