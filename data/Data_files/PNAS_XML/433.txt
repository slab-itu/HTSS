title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
New nutrients exert fundamental control on dissolved organic carbon accumulation in the surface Atlantic Ocean  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is, at 662 ± 32 petagrams of carbon (Pg C), one of Earth's major, exchangeable carbon reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With its large inventory and biologic turnover, the pool has been invoked as a principal source/sink of atmospheric CO2 driving paleoclimate variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls on past source/sink functions remain unknown, but insights can be gleaned from the modern ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we find that new nutrients introduced to the euphotic zone exert a fundamental and predictable control on the net production of DOC, in turn playing a large part in determining the surface distribution and concentrations of the pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate-driven changes in surface ocean renewal of nutrients will ultimately control the source term, dictating the inventory of carbon residing in marine DOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The inventories of carbon residing in organic matter dissolved in the ocean [dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] and in the atmosphere as CO2 are of the same order of magnitude, such that small changes in the DOC pool could have important consequences in atmospheric carbon and thus climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOC in the global ocean is largely formed in the sunlit euphotic zone, but identifying predictable controls on that production is an important yet unrealized goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a testable and causative correlation between the net production of DOC and the consumption of new nutrients in the euphotic zone of the Atlantic Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that new nutrients introduced to the euphotic zone by upwelling in divergence zones and by winter convective overturn of the water column, and the primary production associated with those nutrients, are the ultimate driver of DOC distributions across the Atlantic basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As new nutrient input will change with a changing climate, the role of DOC in the oceans biological pump should likewise be impacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DOC concentrations (micromoles per kilogram) in the surface Atlantic Ocean: (A) Observed DOC concentrations; (B) Observed DOC (colored dots) underlain by DOCcalculated; (C) Observed DOC (colored dots) underlain by DOCcalculated subjected to circulation and remineralization, and with the addition of terrigenous DOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cruise season: A20 (AprilMay 2012), A22 (MarchApril 2012); A16N (AugustOctober 2013); A16S (December 2013February 2014); A10 (AugustOctober 2011); A13.5 (MarchApril 2010); A05 (JanuaryFebruary 1998); CAIBOX (JulyAugust 2009); OVIDE (JuneJuly 2002); Good Hope (NovemberDecember 2004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
New primary production depends on an external supply of new nutrients reaching the euphotic layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although nitrogen fixation and atmospheric deposition can be important sources of nutrients in specific regions, two physical processes (Fig 2) dominate the supply of marine nutrients: wintertime vertical mixing and upwelling in the ocean divergence zones (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern North Atlantic, strong, cold winds associated with winter storms remove heat from the surface ocean, progressively increasing its density and thus deepening the mixed layer by convective overturn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaching mixed layer depths 200 m in some northern locations (7), water column overturn is the main process bringing nutrients to the euphotic zone there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonal warming and restratification supports development of spring phytoplankton blooms (8) with an associated net production of DOC (9); each winter, the system is reset with deep vertical mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upwelling, in contrast, dominates the equatorial system due to easterly trade winds combined with Ekman transport, together producing divergent, poleward flows of near-surface waters that are replaced from below with cold, nutrient-enriched waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upwelling is also important in the eastern boundaries of the Atlantic, particularly the Canary (northwest Africa) and Benguela (southwest Africa) upwelling systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Southern Ocean, divergence and subsequent upwelling is driven by the strong, regular westerlies, dominating the system at 45°S (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we associate net DOC production with nitrate deficits observed throughout the surface Atlantic; the relationship (DOC/NO3) is then applied to climatological nitrate distributions (from which deficits are estimated) to predict DOC concentrations at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both DOC and NO3 are calculated as the difference in DOC and NO3concentrations, respectively, between surface and underlying source waters (Methods); the effect of lateral circulation on vertical supply is addressed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO3 is then converted to units of carbon, thus providing an estimate of the net community production (NCP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ratio DOC/NCP, hereafter the Net DOC Production ratio (NDPr), was calculated from observations of nitrate and DOC along the lines shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting ratios (Fig 2C) largely fell between 0.10 and 0.40, as reported previously in a variety of environments (9, 1113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exception was the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (NASG) where the ratios were both wide-ranging and high, reaching 0.80 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly high values, up to 0.70, were observed in that system during spring blooms (9), but the ratio subsequently decreased during the course of the summer season because net DOC production halted after the spring bloom while export production as sinking particles continued, thus making NDPr in the NASG subject to the time frame considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in the Arabian Sea NDPr was found to be 0.8 during the NE monsoon, after new nutrients reach the euphotic zone through convective overturn of the water column (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest NDPr values (Fig 2C) were from the westernmost NASG lines (A20 and A22, Fig 1A), occupied within the time frame of the spring bloom there (MarchMay 2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify a single NDPr with greatest applicability to the entire Atlantic basin, a sensitivity test was conducted to determine the ratio generating the smallest error between calculated and observed values; a NDPr = 0.17 was the best fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was applied to observed nitrate deficits on the lines in Fig 1A to obtain the DOC added to the euphotic zone as a result of the consumption of new nutrients (Methods), usingDOC=NO3-*6.6*0.17=NCP*0.17,[1]where 6.6 is the molar conversion from N to C units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly compare DOC with the observed DOC concentrations, it was necessary to sum the estimate with the average DOC concentration found in the underlying source waters [i.e., adding the background DOC concentration (DOCsource) to the predicted increase in concentration associated with NCP]; this background value varied with latitude (Table 1 in Methods):DOCcalculated=DOC+DOCsource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]DOCcalculated showed significant agreement (R2 = 0.64, P less_than 0.001) with observed DOC (Fig 3) in all regions of the Atlantic with the exception of the western North Atlantic, with that discrepancy being strongest in the southern sector of the NASG (considered further below; those anomalous data are not included in the regression statistics given above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the DOCsource is not added to DOC, the regression between DOCcalculated and DOCobserved is a bit lower but still high and significant (R2 = 0.525; P less_than 0.0001; n = 268), indicating that the contribution of DOC to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is 82.2% and, therefore, that new nutrients, as they control NCP, are the main driver of DOC accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given validation of our approach using the observed nutrient and DOC fields (Fig 3), we applied the same calculations to climatological NO3 data taken from the World Ocean Atlas (see details in Methods) to develop a basin-wide view of the DOC distribution (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, DOCcalculated (Fig 1B, color background) matches well with the observations (Fig 1B, dots), with an error of 8.94% (root-mean-square error, rmse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest DOCcalculated concentrations are in the tropics, with maxima north and south of the equatorial upwelling (76 µmol kg1) and at the eastern boundary upwelling systems (Angola and Guinea Domes 78 µmol kg1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern North Atlantic, observed DOC values ranging from 60 to 65 µmol kg1 are also well reproduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Southern Ocean (45°S), strong water column vertical mixing precludes a high accumulation of DOC, resulting in low concentrations ( 50 µmol kg1) both in the observed and calculated fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applying a 17% NDPr to the total organic carbon export in the Atlantic (export is taken to be equivalent to basin-wide NCP), with estimates for total export ranging from 4.15 Pg C y1 to 4.3 Pg C y1 (15, 16), net DOC production of 0.700.75 Pg C y1 occurs over the whole basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Atlantic contributes 36% of the global net DOC production of 2 Pg C y1 (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some areas of the tropical Atlantic are permanently stratified (e.g., southwestern NASG), thus negating the validity of our approach in those areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the season in which the observations were made could cause a mismatch to calculated DOC, such as may have existed in the NASG above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, the calculation results in reasonable agreement between observed and calculated variables throughout the vast majority of the ocean basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the mismatches between the calculated and observed DOC concentrations in the southwest sector of the NASG, advection is an important process not considered in our static view of the system (Fig 1B); neither are terrestrial DOC inputs accounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these shortcomings, we added the climatological NO3 values to a steady-state ocean circulation model including terrestrial DOC inputs and DOC remineralization (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zonal advection of DOC in the tropics is evidenced in the model result by enrichment in, for example, the Caribbean Sea (Fig 1C; color background shows improved consistency with observations) relative to that system absent advection (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inputs of terrestrial DOM are evident near the outflow of the Amazon River (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mismatches between the model (Fig 1C) and observations (Fig 1A) in the NASG remain, with the overall error (rmse = 8.71%) only slightly improved relative to the values in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exclusion of southwestern NASG data improved the fit neither in DOCcalculated (rmse = 8.91%) nor in DOCmodel (rmse = 8.62%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas observations made as a snapshot at sea (Fig 1A) were compared here to estimates based on nutrient climatology (Fig 1B) and steady-state ocean circulation (Fig 1C), we do not find that advection or terrigenous DOC explains the remarkable DOC anomaly in the western North Atlantic, with observed DOC exceeding DOCcalculated by up to 13 µmol kg1 near, e.g., 2027°N, 4361°W (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, applying a higher NDPr ratio to the NO3 in that area will give closer DOCcalculated to the observations, but as this system is more permanently stratified, that solution is likely artificial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhanced DOC feature is present in field observations made both in 2003 (17) and 2010 (data used in this analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two alternative sources are (i) local production due to new nitrogen additions beyond local vertical mixing and (ii) allochthonous inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Possible sources of new nitrogen are diazotrophic N2 fixation, atmospheric deposition, and river runoff, although none of these appear to explain the anomalously high DOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2 fixation is higher in the North than in the South Atlantic likely because of the higher dust inputs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DOC flux inferred from the reported dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) released by N2 fixation is far too low to contribute to the DOC excess observed [up to 0.09 nmol N L1h1 DON released (19), converted to carbon at a ratio of 7:1 (0.6 nmol C L1h1), and assuming recalcitrance to biological consumption, would require several years to reach the excess 13-µmol kg1 accumulation].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric deposition, such as of North African dust, is another source of new nutrients in the North Atlantic (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aerosol optical depth data suggest higher deposition in the eastern than in the western North Atlantic (19), where an excess of DOC is not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, deposition likely does not appreciably contribute to the anomalous DOC signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advection of DOC from the closest major rivers, the Amazon and Orinoco, does not reach as far north as the region of excess DOC, according to surface salinity distributions [e.g., World Ocean Atlas (WOA) 2013].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, evaporative concentration of the DOC signal is not the cause of the elevated values, given that salinity normalization does not erase the signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the anomalous DOC coincides with a maximum in DON and a light-stable isotope composition (15N avg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) in the particulate organic nitrogen fraction (21); the source of those signals too is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
New nutrients (here as NO3 consumption) fundamentally control net DOC accumulation in the surface Atlantic Ocean, so climate-driven changes in ocean dynamics will in turn affect the supply of those nutrients to the euphotic zone, thus varying DOC inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensification and spatial homogenization of coastal upwelling systems due to climate change have been predicted (22, 23), which should in turn increase the vertical nitrate flux and net DOC production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ocean warming should also intensify thermal stratification, reducing nutrient flux by vertical mixing (24, 25) in regions away from coastal upwelling systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that climate change could affect the NDPr value because it likely depends on the autotrophic and heterotrophic community compositions, although outside the NASG the variability in that ratio was modest (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertain poise set by these counter influences will impact the future course of the oceanic DOC inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed data used in this work were collected from several cruises within the US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography: A20 (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A20_2012/) and A22 (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A22_2012/); A05 (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/ar01woce/); A16N (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A16N_2013/); A16S (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A16S_2013/); A13.5 (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A13.5_2010.data/); and A10 (cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/A10_2011/); as well as three Spanish cruises: OVIDE (26); Good Hope (27); and CAIBOX (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most data were collected during the local summerfall season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOC and NO3 data were made on full water column conductivity-temperature-depth casts at 60-nautical mile resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample analyses from A16, A20, A22, A13.5, and A05 were performed by the D. A. Hansell laboratory at the University of Miami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from section A10 were analyzed by the C. A. Carlson laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara; OVIDE, Good Hope, and CAIBOX data were analyzed by the X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. Álvarez-Salgado Laboratory at the Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Vigo, Spain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climatological nitrate data were downloaded from WOA13 (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OC5/woa13/woa13oxnu.pl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data climatologies providing the best fit between DOCcalculated and DOCobserved (lowest rmse) were WOA annual climatology for 23.5 °N and WOA summer climatology for less_than 23.5 °N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Descriptions of analytical methods and sampling during US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography program cruises are summarized in the data reports cited above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOC samples from the OVIDE, CAIBOX, and Good Hope sections were filtered through precombusted GF/F Whatman filters using a glass filtration system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After acidification to pH less_than 2, the samples were stored in heat-sealed glass ampoules and stored at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOC was analyzed by high-temperature combustion using a Shimadzu TOC-5000 analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potassium hydrogen phthalate was used as standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep seawater and low carbon references waters as provided by the Hansell CRM Program (29) were measured regularly to assess day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient analyses were performed on board by standard colorimetric methods using an Alpkem auto analyzer (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_Net_DOC_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the correlation between net DOC production (DOC) and deficits in nitrate (NO3), differences in observed concentrations of those variables between the underlying source and surface waters were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected underlying source water varied with the latitude (Table 1): depth source = 0 26.5 isopycnal for tropical and coastal areas experiencing upwelling, representative of the water upwelled in equatorial upwelling systems (31); in the northern North Atlantic, depth source = 200 m because winter vertical mixing commonly reaches that depth (7); for the Southern Ocean, depth source = 100 m was based on the NO3 observations (Fig 2A) and WOA (2013) climatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several combinations of NDPr (between 10% and 25%), DOC backgrounds and source depths were tested and the best fits determined by minimizing the model-data misfit for the Atlantic basin, using the mean-normalized rmse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 was also applied to the nitrate deficits from the WOA climatology, calculated using the same source depths explained above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_the_Atlantic_DOC_Distribution_with_an_Ocean_Circulation_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Atlantic DOC distribution including advection and terrigenous inputs was estimated using an offline model of DOC cycling that considers (i) the production of nonrefractory DOC from NO3-diagnosed net community production, (ii) addition of terrigenous DOC via rivers, (iii) transport with the ocean circulation, and (iv) DOC remineralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The governing equations for DOC areDOCNRt+TDOCNR=fNCPDOCNR,[3]DOC=DOCNR+DOCR+DOCT,[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where DOCNR = nonrefractory DOC, DOCR = refractory DOC, and DOCT = terrigenous DOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady-state, annual ocean circulation was represented as a tracer transport matrix (T) created from output of the Parallel Ocean Program 2 ocean circulation model using CORE-II forcing (32), including parameter value changes to the isopycnal diffusivity to improve the simulation of unresolved equatorial jets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model has a nominal 1°×1° horizontal resolution with 60 vertical levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source for DOCNR production was a variable fraction, f, of annual NCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual NCP was estimated using the spatial map of (NO3source-NO3surface) from the WOA climatology (interpolated onto the circulation model grid and converted to C units with multiplication by 6.6) and multiplied by the depth of the annual average mixed layer or euphotic zone depth, whichever is shallower, diagnosed from a recent simulation of the Community Earth System Model-Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model (4), to obtain the upper ocean depth integrated rate of NCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOCNR was remineralized with a uniform decay rate, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOCR was estimated at 52 µmol kg1 for latitudes north of 38 °S and 45 µmol kg1 south of 38 °S, based on an empirical linear regression of the DOC observations for the Atlantic basin (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOCT was estimated from year 2000 fluxes of river DOC export from the Global Nutrient Export from WaterSheds 2 model (33) and assumes a 99% nonrefractory, 1% refractory ratio with 7- and 16,000-y lifetimes, respectively (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear equation 3 was solved for DOCNR by direct matrix inversion for a range of parameter values for f and  in the range f = 0.100.25, -1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 y. DOCNR was substituted in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and the resulting modeled DOC distribution was compared against the DOC observational dataset for the Atlantic basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-fit values of f and  were determined by minimizing the model-data misfit for the Atlantic basin, using the mean-normalized, rmse between corresponding DOC observationDOC model estimate pairs found in the upper five levels (50 m) of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the plots were performed using Ocean Data View software (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
