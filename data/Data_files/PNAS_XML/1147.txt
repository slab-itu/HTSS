History meets palaeoscience: Consilience and collaboration in studying past societal responses to environmental change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
History and archaeology have a well-established engagement with issues of premodern societal development and the interaction between physical and cultural environments; together, they offer a holistic view that can generate insights into the nature of cultural resilience and adaptation, as well as responses to catastrophe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grasping the challenges that climate change presents and evolving appropriate policies that promote and support mitigation and adaptation requires not only an understanding of the science and the contemporary politics, but also an understanding of the history of the societies affected and in particular of their cultural logic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But whereas archaeologists have developed productive links with the paleosciences, historians have, on the whole, remained muted voices in the debate until recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we suggest several ways in which a consilience between the historical sciences and the natural sciences, including attention to even distant historical pasts, can deepen contemporary understanding of environmental change and its effects on human societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Problem  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is clearly a need to better understand interactions between past societies and their environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collaboration between the historicalarchaeological and the paleoenvironmental sciences is essential to this effort, but it has been slow to materialize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While archaeology and history have always worked hand-in-hand, and while their research questions often overlap to a large degree, our concern here is with the fact that professional historians themselves rarely engage with recent developments in paleoscientific research, in part because history is a very fragmented discipline, one that is still figuring out how to open cross-field intrahistory discourse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has a crucial contribution to make to these interdisciplinary collaborations: besides corroborating or challenging paleoclimatic research findings, historians are able to warn against overhasty assumptions about the relationship between societal complexity and resilience toward environmental stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interactions within socio-environmental systems are hardly simple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many societies, for example, have evolved precisely in locations where the environment was difficult to control: complex sedentary groups first arose in flood-prone river basins rather than more stable environmental contexts, suggesting that solving environmental problems contributed to the development of these societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus here on the fact that states and societies have varied in their capacity to respond to environmental change; the complexity of a system and its ideology have always been key aspects in this respect, as our four case studies demonstrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Societies need to be understood as existing within a specific socio-geographic environment upon which they impact (an aspect we do not directly address here) and with which they interact and adapt to, as part of a transformative feedback system, our main focus (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
State_of_the_Art  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This paper is intended to open discussion and suggest ways to move forward rather than present a final statement about the ways history can contribute to the paleosciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The historical record provides a conceptual laboratory in which hypotheses developed by both natural scientists and social scientists can be tested using parallel chronological and spatial comparisons (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Former contributions have pointed out that it is all too easy to find some past environmental event, for example through proxy data, and link it to identifiable changes in the historical or archaeological record based on a few high-profile case studies (36), and that a more nuanced approach is required (711).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collapse of Bronze Age civilizations in the Mediterranean, the end of Classic Period Maya civilization, the fading away of Norse settlement in Greenland or of the Rapa Nui (Easter Island) peoples have all been ascribed to environmental stressors as much as to socio-environmental interactions (3, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because correlation does not imply causation, many such interpretations are oversimplifications of a complex and interconnected system with multiple independent variables and feedback loops (710, 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an increasing awareness of the importance of environmental degradation and societal impacts on the environment has tended to popularize such a catastrophist perspective with regard to these historical examples and others (for literature critiques, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11, 14, and 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interpretations not only tend to minimize the complexity of the causal relationships involved, as articulated in a previous PNAS special feature (e.g., see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 8), but also encourage a simplistic approach to contemporary problems and policy development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scholars have already recognized that what is needed is an approach that integrates societal and environmental factors through consilience: that is, using different disciplines to examine the same question (e.g., see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 8; for a recent example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains the case that most studies of past humanenvironment interaction focus on comparing archaeological evidence with paleoenvironmental proxy and model data to make the case that the environment or society did or did not have the impacts they had generally been assumed to have (extensive literature is cited in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1720).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While effectively establishing correlations between climate shifts and regional political and societal transformation and collapse, for example, such work often ignores more detailed analyses of historical social-structural and institutional relationships, often allowing for a very wide chronological margin of error, even if statistically persuasive (21; for contrast see, for example, refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2225).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the perspective of a historical analysis, the causal mechanics of the relationship between society and environment remain obscure or at best hypothetical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A truly integrated approach thus remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex historical societies were often resilient to adverse climate change and feedback loops between climate and society occurred under very specific conditions (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18, 20, 22, and 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate such relationships, a thorough and nuanced examination of the effects of environmental pressures and climate forcing within any given society and context is thus needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn requires consilience not just between archaeology and the paleosciences, each with its own set of narratives and methodological tools, but alsoand cruciallywith history (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is an established tradition of humanenvironmental science engaging with historicalarchaeological themes, in which archaeologists and anthropologists, as well as ecologists and geographers, have largely been at the forefront (see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 and 27 for discussion and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28 for an example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this approach still remains marginal to both the sciences and the social sciences (14, 15, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While several historians have recently attempted to bridge this gap (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 and 32), it remains the case that historians do not collaborate enough and in a multidisciplinary-team environment sufficiently to resolve issues of method and approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The need to incorporate the complex interactions and feedback mechanisms within a historical cultural system alongside the impacts of a range of environmental and climate-related factors with their own dynamics has been recognized (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has rarely been followed through with a grounded historical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is not only the physical or socialinstitutional impact of changing environmental circumstances or sudden catastrophes that are fundamental, but also the perceptions of such events upon the cultural logic of a society: how people understand what happens in their world directly determines how they respond and how they transform their environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historical analysis is crucial to such study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These points were underlined by Butzer and Endfield (8), who set out a powerful agenda for the integration of insider history based on historical records with the archaeological and natural science paradigms that have dominated the field, in this case in terms of both collapse and resilience to environmental challenges (for examples, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33, 35, and 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Key research questions for this shared agenda include identifying the severity, abruptness, and duration of climatic events and changes that had the potential to influence history (37); reconstructing past environmental conditions in selected regions, as well as the physical means available to society to respond to environmental change; deploying an archaeologicalhistorical approach that utilizes environmental data to address societal linkages to climatic and environmental change and associated episodes of crisis and adaptation; and integrating the study of both human agency and cultural perceptions or world-view into societal responses (17, 3842).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Issues_of_Integration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Integrating instrumental, documentary, paleoenvironmental proxy model results and archaeological records to produce socio-environmental narratives is key.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three disciplines we focus on here have different training emphases and research methodologies, as shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variance leads to challenges: historians and archaeologists, trained with a particular approach to their data and the results they generate, can misuse environmental data, generalizing from limited datasets or misappropriating low-resolution data insensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paleoclimate scientists can misconstrue the nature of societal complexity and draw deterministic or simplistic conclusions about causal relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these groups is in a position by themselves to integrate all of the data necessary for a multicausal analysis that explains rather than simply describes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is relatively easy to generalize at a global level, but integrated local and regional studies are needed to test methodologies, collect multidisciplinary data, and ultimately derive holistic interpretations (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of differences in the quantity and scope of the available evidence, the study of the societal effects of climate change differs considerably between regions and periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some there is a considerable amount of written evidence, whereas in others historical data are insufficient to infer specific reactions and ways of coping with, for example, the extreme weather events sometimes associated with climate fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insufficient high-quality paleoclimatic and archaeological data complicate attempts to establish firm links between climate and societies and foster more hypothetical/simplistic analyses, which in turn draw attention away from more robust case studies (4345; for similar criticisms, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3840 and 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating the potential causal relationships and assessing socio-economic political resilience thus requires a collaborative consilient research program, sharing data, and developing common interpretive strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining the microregional level in particular can generate in-depth analyses of specific historicalenvironmental conjunctures to analyze local impacts and responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Improving_Integration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research needs thus to prioritize microregion case studies where the various classes of data are available in sufficient quantity to permit correlation and cross-checking across disciplines and data types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This minimizes the range of interpretive options in understanding the mechanics and nature of the interaction between anthropogenic and natural complex systems, disentangling the causal association between them (38, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe the results of some recent and ongoing research that is informed by this integrative approach below, and that reinforce the message imparted by some other case studies (e.g., see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four broad outcomes demonstrate the potential contribution of history to paleoscience research: integrative research generates innovative questions and new insights; it reveals more complex sets of causal interrelationships than hitherto understood; it challenges existing interpretations of historical processes; and it provides more detail and nuance of tipping points in historical socio-environmental systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Properly integrating paleoenvironmental data and research into historical and archaeological scholarship allows both natural and social scientists to work together in multidisciplinary teams and generate and answer new questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case study of Sicily and the southern Levant illustrates the interaction within a socio-environmental system through a feedback loop, where environmental change generated politicaleconomical changes, facilitating the rise and subsequent decline of formerly marginal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Carolingian case study reveals the deficiencies of depending on one source of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving away from simple climate determinism, it shows that reported years of subsistence crisis are not always associated with identifiable environmental triggers and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that resilience or vulnerability to detrimental environmental stressors was not constant even on a semidecadal scale, signaling the extent to which premodern societies could mitigate these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paleoenvironmental research can revise existing historical narratives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case of Caracol, a Maya city in Central America, uses better climate reconstructions to change the interpretations of the causes of its decline and collapse, revealing that societal conflict, rather than drought, caused the citys abandonment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the consilient approach uncovers tipping points in historical socio-environmental systems in greater detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case of early modern Poland illustrates how a resilient society appears able to mitigate a given set of unforeseen environmental challenges for decades, as long as the stress factors do not interact with contemporary shifting political and societal vulnerabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impacts of the Little Ice Age on the country were easily weathered in times of peace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The context of increased warfare and its accompanying socio-economic stressors, however, pushed the system beyond a threshold, bringing about swift and unexpected economic collapse and political breakdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all of these examples, we would repeat the key point that simple correlation does not imply causation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through multidisciplinary collaboration, historians, archaeologists, and natural scientists can better determine societal response to environmental change and therefore rewrite and replace well-worn narratives of collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All four case studies reveal the potential synergy that collaborative work between historians, archaeologists, and paleoscientists has for illuminating the causal interactions between environment and premodern society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article we have demonstrated the unique contribution of history for untangling societalenvironmental linkages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consilient approach can generate new research questions and insights, challenge facile interpretations, revise existing narratives, and identify tipping points in socio-environmental systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Sicilian and Levantine case study considered the same timeframe but from the perspective of two formerly marginal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both managed, within very demanding political and economic situations, to respond to climate change and develop their agrarian output, in effect creating and maintaining for a time climatesociety feedback loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Carolingian survey highlighted the fallacy that adverse climate events universally triggered dearth and death in premodernity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By focusing on an occasion in which detrimental weather does not coincide with dearth in the surviving historical evidence, this case study moved away from environmental determinism and instead suggested ways in which past societies could demonstrate resilience by mitigating environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The case study of Caracol built upon scientific and interdisciplinary scholarship to revise existing narratives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier work covering the broader regions containing the premodern metropolis argued that Caracol society declined and collapsed as a direct result of environmental stressors, namely droughts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has integrated new paleoenvironmental data and scientific approaches toward humanenvironmental interaction to argue that this society successfully attenuated environmental stressors and eventually collapsed as a result of internal factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the external socio-economic infrastructure of the Maya never fully recovered, the collapse resulted in the permanent depopulation of Caracol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the case of Poland in the 16th17th centuries illustrates how societal context can determine the impact and effects of environmental stress factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human conflict, its mediation through particular ideologies, and the ways in which it interacted with the physical environment, rather than an all-powerful deleterious environment, brought the system to its tipping point and transformed contemporary urban centers and economic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All case studies examined historical periods and places in which existing paleoclimate, archaeological, and historical data sources overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have argued that a consilient approach, which exploits this convergence, is critical to establishing more robust and nuanced causal interpretations about the links between human societies and their environment, while taking account of the interactions and feedback mechanisms between both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach moves away from studies that analyze broader chronological and spatial ranges with less available historical and archaeological data yet still equate causality with correlation and argue for environmentally triggered societal collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the supposedly clear chain of cause and effect in these studies is attractive, it is rarely robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We argue that future research on premodern humanenvironmental linkages should prioritize cases on which social and natural scientists can work in multidisciplinary teams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such cases would contain richer data over a more limited spatial and chronological scope and, where possible, offer historical documentation that can link social action more broadly to aspects of a cultural belief system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where such data are not available, space needs to be left within the explanatory framework to permit theorization of the possible roles this played (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above examples make it clear that societal decline or collapse is never monocausal and never predetermined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the environment is a continuous factor with which human societies interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it can adversely affect these societies, the causal relationship between them is complex, malleable, and has a differential impact within a given society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The contribution of scholarly historical analysis to the study of the interaction between past societies and the environment is directly relevant for 21st century debates about climate change and its effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a consilient perspective to interpret the intricate causal relationships underlying how past societies mitigated their challenges, contemporary policy-makers can develop more resilient and robust strategies to tackle the challenges of our own changing environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holistic interpretations, nuanced arguments, and careful causal analyses are the potential contribution of the discipline of history to these discussions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
