Emergence of function from coordinated cells in a tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A basic problem in biology is understanding how information from a single genome gives rise to function in a mature multicellular tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome dynamics stabilize to give rise to a protein distribution in a given cell type, which in turn gives rise to the identity of a cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We build a highly idealized mathematical foundation that combines the genome (within cell) and the diffusion (between cell) dynamical forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trade-off between these forces gives rise to the emergence of function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define emergence as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our setting of emergence may further our understanding of normal tissue function and dysfunctional states such as cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work presents a mathematical study of tissue dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine within-cell genome dynamics and diffusion between cells, so that the synthesis of the two gives rise to the emergence of function, akin to establishing tissue homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce two concepts, monotonicity and a weak version of hardwiring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These together are sufficient for global convergence of the tissue dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

1_Simple_Example  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we model two cells, separated by a membrane, that each have a same single protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider the following system,Cell1:dxdt=a(xx0)[1a]Cell2:dydt=b(yy0),a,b,less_than0,x0,y0 greater than 0,[1b]where x and y can be interpreted as protein concentration, x in cell 1 and y cell 2, both positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, x,y×=[0,c]×[0,d], where c and d represent the maximum concentration of proteins x and y, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibria are x=x0 and y=y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce Turing-type (diffusion) coupling by adding a term with  greater than 0 as follows:dxdt=a(xx0)+(yx)[2]dydt=b(yy0)+(xy), greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The equilibrium for the above system is obtained by solving the system derived from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 by setting the right-hand sides equal to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a linear system in two equations and two variables and we obtainx=abx0+ax0+by0a+bab[3a]y=aby0+ax0+by0a+bab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3b]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not hard to see from Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3a and 3b that if , x and y converge to the same value ax0+by0a+b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this system approaches a common protein concentration and the example exhibits the role of diffusion, even with different cell dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this as an emergent equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix (see 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Genome Dynamics of One Cell and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turings Paper on Morphogenesis) for the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 at equilibrium and finite  are expressed as12(a+b)+12(ab)2+4212(a+b)12(ab)2+42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the eigenvalues are real negative, this pair (x,y) of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 is a stable equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Success_of_Emergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The magnitude of (xy) from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 measures the departure from the emergence asxy=ab(x0y0)(a+b)ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If x0y0 is big and  is small, there is ill-conditioning as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a=0 in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, the solution is x=y0 and y=y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a0, no matter how small, and =0, the solution is x=x0 and y=y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, for any finite  the equilibrium for the pair (x,y) has x and not y if x0y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We might say then that the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is not emergent (for any finite ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows a numerical example of this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remark 1: Here the  anticipates the Fiedler number of a Laplacian defined by the cellular network of the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce the concept of a hardwiring hypothesis, which implies x0=y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion is unnecessary in our example for emergence [and in fact it can defeat emergence (!)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as we will see].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand diffusion can have a stabilizing effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is an example of linear dynamics of one protein and one cell with stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dynamics although linear are also a good approximation of the general stable dynamics in a neighborhood of the equilibria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the global dynamics of the basin of the stable equilibrium are qualitatively equivalent to the linear example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


2_The_Genome_Dynamics_of_One_Cell  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the setting of our paper on genome dynamics (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a single-cell state space = [0,cj], where cj is the maximum concentration of protein j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sometimes we use cj=.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner product is Cartesian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome dynamics are expressed as ddt=(), where  is a function from n to n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally recall the notion of stable equilibrium 0 of  for ddt=(), as well as its basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If every eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of first partial derivatives of  at 0 has negative real part, then all trajectories that start near 0 approach it as t. The basin (0) is the set of all points that tends to 0 when t. Then 0 is a stable equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamics on the basin are linear provided that the :n, =n, has the form ()=lin(0), where lin is a linear map, nn,  belongs to , and 0 is the equilibrium in .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppose that  is the dynamics, not necessarily linear, with stable equilibrium 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then  at 0 has the above form in a neighborhood of 0 (lin is the derivative of  at 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it can be shown that the dynamics on the basin are topologically equivalent to the linear dynamics as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a main theorem about stable equilibria is that the linear dynamic in n is equivalent to the dynamics of ddt=() in the basin (0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means there is a homeomorphism from n to the basin (0) that preserves the solution curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the dynamics of (0) are the same topologically as the linear dynamics above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Browder (5) and Hirsch and Smith (6) have extensively studied the topic of monotonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide our version of monotonicity that has a common element with Hirsch (5) and Browder and Smith (6), but is quite different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definition 1: Monotonicity condition: Suppose we have dynamics ddt=() on a domain  in a Euclidean space with its inner product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monotonicity condition for , and a point 0, is then,(0)less_than0for all0in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proposition 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For any dynamics ddt=() on  k, 0  , the monotonicity condition for , 0, implies that (t)0 is a decreasing function of t for all nontrivial solutions (t) in , where (t) is defined for all t greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proof: Suppose Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 is true.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note thatd((t)02)dt=d(t)0,(t)0dt=2d((t))dt,(t)0=2(t),((t)0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quantity at the end is negative by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, the monotonicity condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One could call the  of Proposition 1 a monotonic basin for the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions 0 is an equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, monotonicity on ,0 implies that (t) is monotonically converging to 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives a stability of 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The converse is not true not even in the linear case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can take for an example a spiral sink where the axes are different (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the solution is going in the direction of the long axis, then (t)0 is not decreasing, whereas 0 is a stable equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example helps us understand the famous Turing phenomenon (5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turings Paper on Morphogenesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Example 1: Let =(0), where  is a linear map nn, not necessarily symmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then  is negative definite exactly when monotonicity holds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us return to the biological setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell dynamics are those of dynamics on a basin  as in our previous work on genome dynamics (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the basin  is that of an equilibrium 0 and are excluding periodic attractors in the present paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means we are identifying a cell with its basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium of genome dynamics of a cell exhibits the distribution of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That distribution can be identified with that cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now examine explicitly the conditions for monotonicity in the linear case of one cell with two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This case can be represented by the systemddt==(0),=(1,2),where =(abcd) and ddt=0 when =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then  (Jacobian matrix at 0) is stable and (t)0 when all eigenvalues have negative real parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eigenvalues of  are given by the characteristic equation 2+=0, where=trace()=a+dand=det()=adbc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Then 1=+242,2=242 are the eigenvalues of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For stability  must satisfy two criteria: (i) The trace, a+d, must be negative, and (ii) the determinant, adbc, must be positive (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To derive the conditions for monotonicity, consider the quadratic form associated with : Q(u,v)=au2+dv2(b+c2)uv, and suppose a,dless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, +T2=(ab+c2b+c2d), and +T2 is symmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix of a quadratic form can always be forced to be symmetric in this way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The condition for monotonicity is ,(0)less_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amounts to (0),(0)less_than0 or that the eigenvalues of (+T2) are negative, which is equivalent to  being negative definite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the determinant of +T2 is positive,ad greater than (b+c2)2,a,dless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary the stability condition is bcless_thanad and the monotonicity condition is ((b+c)2)2less_thanad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the excess of the left-hand sides of the previous inequalities is ((b+c)2)2bc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the excess is positive or zero, monotonicity implies stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excess is never negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, as a consequence of Proposition 1 we can prove the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proposition 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For linear dynamics on n monotonicity implies stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 shows an example of monotonicity and stability conditions in the bc plane, where a,d=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the monotonic region and hence is part of the stable region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red solid circle in Fig 3 represents Turings two-cell example [Turing (1) and Chua (9)], discussed in 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turings Paper on Morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hardwiring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genes present in the human genome are the same in all cell types and all individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now we describe a property of a family of cells, which we called hardwiring (2), motivated by the universality above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our network in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 puts an oriented edge (between two nodes), between two genes, i and j, if it is possible for the protein product of gene i to bind to the promoter of gene j and activate transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene i will bind to this promoter only in some cell types, at certain stages of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can happen that gene i as a transcription factor may be silenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case gene i can be removed from the network together with its edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, this phenomenon can occur through failure of chromatin accessibility (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We say that a family of cells is hardwired provided that the genome dynamics are the same for every cell in the family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the example of Turing [also Chua (9) and Smale (11)] below, hardwiring is assumed extensively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Definition_of_Weak_Hardwiring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, the family is hardwired provided that the dynamics of each cell in the family are the same; in particular, the equilibrium of each cell is the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the protein distribution at the equilibrium of each cell is the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the last property is true, then we say that the family satisfies weak hardwiring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea of the weak hardwiring concept is that in a single cell type all cells have the same equilibrium distribution of proteins (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This helps justify the identification of a tissue with its protein distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


3_Cellular_Dynamics_and_Their_Architecture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We define a graph  as a mathematical model for the cellular structure for a single tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, consider the m cells of the single tissue and a single protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main biological object is the cellular architecture of a tissue that consists of m cells in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graph  consists of nodes corresponding to the cells of the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weighted edges of the graph are associated with the membranes between two cells and define the notion of adjacency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adjacency is represented by a number that represents the diffusion between two cells and it depends on the interactions at their cell membranes (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number could be interpreted as the product of the permeability and the area of the membrane between cell i and cell j, a quantity represented by a matrix element aij.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We write =(aij).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix  is an m×m symmetric matrix, the adjacency matrix of the architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that  does not depend on the protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus,  is a weighted graph whose nodes are i=1,,m and edges aij.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the graph is connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What we have discussed here is a network whose nodes are cells and it is not to be confused with the genome network in 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular Dynamics and Their Architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model applies more literally to diffusion in the case of small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definition_of_a_State  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A state associated to the graph is a set of protein levels 1,,m, where i is the level of a single protein in the ith cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a state  is a function of nodes i and with value at node i written as i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The states form a linear space  and feasible states, the subspace of functions with nonnegative values +.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function  is harmonic provided that i is a constant function of i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By our hypothesis that the graph  is connected, it follows that the space of harmonic functions is one dimensional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For n proteins we generalize the notion of i and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now i is a distribution of proteins in the ith cell; i.e., i=(i1,,in).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this expression can be thought of as a function of i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the membrane structure of the tissue affects all of the proteins equally [this is a strong idealization, but it can be relaxed easily as in Turings example (1) in 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turings Paper on Morphogenesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Laplacian_Matrix  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let  be the diagonal matrix with the ith element of the diagonal defined by aij.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the Laplacian is given by=.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
 is a (m×m) real symmetric matrix, and together with the nonnegativity of the weights, this implies that it is positive semidefinite (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an operator on .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diffusion dynamics defined by the cellular architecture may be written as follows:didt=jmiaij(ij),i=1,,morddt=.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 is a linear system of ordinary differential equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remark 2: Harmonic functions are exactly a set of , such that  = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that our definition applies not just to a single protein, but also to an n-tuple i belonging to n, and the feasible ones to (+)n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proposition 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system is globally stable with equilibrium set, the harmonic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proof: ,0 and ,=0 if and only if  = constant; i.e., 1=2==m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 is denoted by (t) with initial conditions (0)=, m. Now the solution is(t)=et.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Then ddt(t),(t)=2(t),(t)less_than0, unless (t) satisfies 1(t)=2(t)==m(t)= constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the solution converges to a harmonic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the n-protein case, the harmonic functions form an n-dimensional space defined by 1=2==m, where 1 is an arbitrary element of n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


4_Dynamics_of_a_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use both the notations i= [0,cj] and the basin, ii with its equilibrium 0,i for the domain of the genome dynamics, where cj is the maximum concentration of protein j and n is the number of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  i is important for the lapse of emergence and dealing with different cell types (different tissues) as in 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lapse of Emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  i is suited for single-tissue theory as in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome_Dynamics_for_m_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a single cell say i, i is the domain of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cell i, i:in represents the genome dynamics in cell i,didt=ii,ii,i=1,m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the case of cells of a tissue = i,i=1,,m where m is the number of cells in the tissue and  is the state space of 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular Dynamics and Their Architecture extended to n proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an inner product on  derived from the inner products on i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, i corresponds to cell i with stable equilibrium 0,i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now we take the product of the dynamics over all of the cells at once to get :N(or better(n)m), where =(1,,m),N=nm andddt=,.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [9]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 is rephrasing Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the genome dynamics of the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this tissue has genome dynamics and separates into individual cell dynamics i for cell i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let 0 be the point of  defined as 0=(0,1,0,2,,0,m), where 0,i is the equilibrium in i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak-hardwiring hypothesis asserts that the 0,i are all the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 0 is the equilibrium for genome dynamics for the whole tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the rest of this paper we assume the weak hardwiring for the cells in the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extension_of_Monotonicity_to_the_Genome_Dynamics_of_the_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extension of the definition of monotonicity to many cells is given by,(0)less_than0,=i,0=(1,2,,m)and1=(11,12,,1n)1,etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here ij denotes the amount of the jth protein in the ith cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ddt= is the dynamics on the basin =i,0=(0,1,0,2,,0,m) and 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observe from weak hardwiring 0,1=0,2==0,m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Example 2: =(0), where = i, so that  is a multilinear map and each i:mm is linear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then i, for each i, is negative definite exactly when this monotonicity holds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, we are not assuming the linearity of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot get even a good model of robust stability of equilibria in the linear setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot model dynamics with two separate equilibria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diffusion_Dynamics_for_n_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recall in 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular Dynamics and Their Architecture, the diffusion dynamics between cells in a tissue for a protein distributionddt=ordidt=ifor alli=1,..,m.[10]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here =(1,,m),in is an n-tuple of proteins or a distribution of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Basin_Hypothesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells described by i:im have the same basin i and the same equilibrium 0,i (this is a consequence of the hardwiring hypothesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also suppose that the basins i are convex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two hypotheses are made so that the diffusion terms in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 below make sense and are called the basin hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the spirit of Turings paper, we may combine two dynamics (genome dynamics within the cell and diffusion dynamics between cells) into a system (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) that is the object of the study in this paper:ddt=,=i=1i[11]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We emphasize that differential Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 is not necessarily linear in contrast to Turing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main theorem of this paper is as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theorem 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamical system ddt= of a tissue (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) is globally stable with equilibrium 0 provided the basin hypothesis is satisfied and  satisfies monotonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lemma 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If  is monotone relative to ,0, then () is monotone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proof of Lemma 1: Lemma 1 is true if  is monotone and if  is monotone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, ,(0)0 is proved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From weak hardwiring  is harmonic and so =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ,0 for any , because  is negative semidefinite (4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamics of a Tissue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ,(0)0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because 0=0, thus it remains only to prove ,(0)less_than0 for 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But  is monotone by hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By Proposition 1 applied to =() and Lemma 1 we obtain the global stability of equilibrium 0, thus proving Theorem 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We name the property of ddt= in Theorem 5 emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theorem 5 establishes that monotonicity implies global convergence of the tissue dynamics to the equilibrium; that is, all cells have the same protein distribution, in a strong stable sense (robustness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives a biological justification for the concept of weak hardwiring in a tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we give a model for emergence of function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ours is not the first paper to address the issue of convergence after Turings paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Wang and Slotine (14) have conditions designed to show convergence in systems resembling ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work in Proposition 1 and Theorem 5 deals with a wider class of spaces as our basins and their products correspond to dynamics of protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also we do not use a derivative of  in our condition, and we do use a point 0 in n, not the origin, as an equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly the convergence results in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 do not imply ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous paper (15) follows our current perspective, with a passage from one basin to two basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is motivated by the biological example of Gardner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also Chua (9) has convergence results for systems related to ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two authors work in linear spaces with nonlinear equations, whereas we work in nonlinear spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remark 3: Recall the linear case ddt=(0), where =(1,,m) and () is not singular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in the form ddt=, where = and =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The explicit solution (17) is (t)=exp(t)((0)1)+1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


5_Turing_s_Paper_on_Morphogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The work of Alan Turing plays an important role in our paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main differential Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 owes much to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are some important differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we use nonlinearity for the cell dynamics in contrast to the Turing linear setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonlinearity allows us to address issues of stability, where the second derivative plays a crucial role and we are able to use associated domains of the cell dynamics more in accord with the biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, Turing developed his work in a partial differential equations framework, with reaction diffusion equations that reflect a continuum perspective of the nature of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That leads to some applications in morphogenesis, such as patterning in Zebra stripes (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our own perspective differs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We feel that some of the basic features of morphogenesis must deal with few cells (embryogenesis, cell differentiation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent work of Chua (9) also develops Turings contributions in a different direction from our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Turing found an important example of the system of the same type we used in 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamics of a Tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The example shows how a system that is stable without diffusion becomes unstable in the presence of diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turing was motivated to understand morphogenesis with this example of instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The example consists of two cells and two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variables x1,y1 represent concentrations of molecules (or proteins) for the first cell and x2,y2 represent those for the second cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turings two-cell reactiondiffusion example can be written asdx1dt=(5x16y1+1)+0.5(x2x1)[12]dy1dt=(6x17y1+1)+4.5(y2y1)dx2dt=(5x26y2+1)+0.5(x1x2)dy2dt=(6x27y2+1)+4.5(y1y2),x1,y1,x2,y2 greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two cells are identical in this example and we can describe the cell dynamics as dx1dt=(5x16y1+1), dy1dt=(6x17y1+1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is easy to transform the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 into our form, ddt=().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome_Dynamics_of_the_Turing_Example  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now show that a key phenomenon of this example is the failure of the monotonicity condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is necessary to give rise to instability (morphogenesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us then study the monotonicity of 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Genome Dynamics of One Cell as well as perform a 2D analysis for the Turing example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First we construct matrix  for a single cell of the Turing example: a=5,b=7,c=6,d=7, and =(5667).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the Turing example assumes two identical cells and we can write the monotonicity condition as (5x6y,6x7y),(x,y)less_than0 for all x,y greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 5x27y2less_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If x=2,y=1, we can see that 5x27y2 greater than 0; therefore the Turing two-cell example fails the monotonicity condition (red solid circle in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monotonicity is only a sufficient condition for stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now we check for stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trace()=2, and det()=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the eigenvalues of  are given by i()=1,i=1,2 [and the eigenvectors are given by vi=(1,1),i=1,2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the genome dynamics are stable for one cell and hence for two cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diffusion_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diffusion dynamics in the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 are expressed by the terms 0.5(x2x1) and 4.5(y2y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the diffusion dynamics are represented by the negative Laplacian matrix as in 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular Dynamics and Their Architecture, their eigenvalues are nonpositive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Full_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining genome dynamics and diffusion dynamics gives the Turing example of the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear part of the system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 is=(4.560.50611.504.50.504.5604.5611.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The system in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 has a unique equilibrium that is obtained by solving the right-hand side of the equation set equal to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eigenvalues of  can be computed to be 2.0,1,1,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is a positive eigenvalue, the system with diffusion is unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the Turing system not only has a possibility of failure of stability but also in fact is unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summarizing, the Jacobian at the equilibrium has four eigenvalues, one of which is positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the full system with diffusion is not stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way Turing showed that at equilibrium the two-cell example without diffusion is stable, but with diffusion has lost stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have remarked further on the role of monotonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wang and Slotine (20) examine a condition on the dynamics that depends on the diffusion coupling whereas our monotonicity depends only on the dynamics in each cell and not on the diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But each condition plays a main role in the convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Smale (11) examined similar equations with nonlinear cell dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He considered each of two cells as having a global stable equilibrium, and therefore the cells were dead in an abstract mathematical sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But upon coupling the two cells by diffusion, he proved that the resulting system has a global periodic attractor, and hence the cells become alive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward this end Smales work was a mathematical model similar to the Turing two-cell example but with dynamics of each cell not linear, leading to the modeldxkdt=R(xk)+ik(xixk)isetofcellsneighboringkthcell,[13]where k=1,,N and (xixk)m. The first term above, R(xk) gives the dynamics for the kth cell and the second term describes the diffusion processes between cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal case considered by Smale (11) is m=4, N=2, and shows for the appropriate choice of parameters (R,k), the system has stable equilibria without diffusion and with diffusion has a global periodic attractor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 is precisely a form of our main equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again the phenomenon depends on the failure of monotonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(Easy)_Conjecture_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generically monotonicity of a linear system in Euclidean space is equivalent to all eigenvalues negative (and real).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


6_Lapse_of_Emergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we discuss an avenue to study the departure from emergence, using our setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider the Jacobian of ddt= (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) at the equilibrium 0; that is,(())0,0=(0,1,,0,m),where 0,i is the equilibrium of the dynamics of the ith cell and 0,i are all equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main cause of lapse of emergence is the vanishing of the determinant of (())0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in our paper (15), the pitchfork bifurcation is signaled at a bifurcation parameter , where the det(())0 first becomes zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because 0,i are equal, 0=0 and 0 belongs to the n-dimensional harmonic space, kernel().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generically  is contracting to kernel(); that is, the eigenvalues of  are k=0 for kn, and for k greater than n,kless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now look at ()0=((1)0,1,,(m)x0,m) on the basin .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each (i)0,i is contracting before the bifurcation, say for less_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At =0, one can expect one of these contracting derivatives to become singular; for example, (1)0,1 with one eigenvalue is equal to zero and the rest are negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the beginning of the lapse of emergence in this scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now restrict the dynamics to the protein space of the first cell to study the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this protein space we can expect the dynamics after the bifurcation to have two basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the setting of the pitchfork bifurcation paper (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This paper can be used to examine the end of emergence in terms of cell division (symmetric or asymmetric or cancer) (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
