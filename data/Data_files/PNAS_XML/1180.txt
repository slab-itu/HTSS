Activation of AMPK by metformin improves withdrawal signs precipitated by nicotine withdrawal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe withdrawal symptoms are the reason most people have a hard time quitting smoking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of energy homeostasis and is activated in response to cellular stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that the AMPK pathway is activated following chronic nicotine use but is repressed following nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that increasing pAMPK levels pharmacologically might reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After giving mice metformin, an AMPK activator, we were able to reduce nicotine withdrawal, and found that this was dependent on the presence of the AMPK protein in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that AMPK activation could be a target for smoking cessation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, with more persons dying from nicotine addiction than any other preventable cause of death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though smoking cessation incurs multiple health benefits, the abstinence rate remains low with current medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in the hippocampus is activated following chronic nicotine use, an effect that is rapidly reversed by nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing pAMPK levels and, consequently, downstream AMPK signaling pharmacologically attenuate anxiety-like behavior following nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that metformin, a known AMPK activator in the periphery, reduces withdrawal symptoms through a mechanism dependent on the presence of the AMPK subunits within the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides evidence of a direct effect of AMPK modulation on nicotine withdrawal symptoms and suggests central AMPK activation as a therapeutic target for smoking cessation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genes of the AMPK pathway bound by CREB in the mouse hippocampus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we evaluated the effects of chronic nicotine and 24-h withdrawal on AMPK pathway activation in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotine treatment caused a significant activation of this pathway in the hippocampus, as shown by the elevated pAMPK/AMPK ratio and the increased phosphorylation of the AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, this is the sole brain region examined that shows this pattern of pAMPK activity (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we determined whether pharmacologic activation of the AMPK pathway could ameliorate nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we treated mice with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an allosteric activator of AMPK (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AICAR caused a significant activation of the AMPK pathway in the hippocampus, indicating that it crosses the blood-brain barrier (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety-like behaviors in mice, which can be evaluated using two behavioral tests: novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) and marble-burying (MB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction in anxiety-like behavior was demonstrated by a reduced latency to feed in the NIH test and a reduced number of marbles buried in the MB test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both assays, AICAR treatment completely abolished the effects of nicotine withdrawal (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we used the Food and Drug Administration-approved diabetes drug metformin, which targets AMPK activation in the liver (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One week of systemic metformin pretreatment resulted in activation of the AMPK pathway following nicotine withdrawal compared with saline-pretreated animals (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, systemic metformin also completely prevented anxiety-like behaviors caused by nicotine withdrawal (Fig 2 D and E) at a dose that did not impact body weight, food consumption, or glucose levels under both fed and fasted conditions (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, both AICAR (Fig 1D) and metformin (Fig 2D) reduced the latency to feed in the NIH test in na√Øve mice, suggesting that activation of AMPK may provide a novel target for general anxiolytic activity as well as anxiety induced from nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metformin is known to have multiple peripheral targets, including liver and skeletal muscle, and activation of the AMPK pathway in these organs might indirectly contribute to behaviors observed following withdrawal from nicotine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether metformin acts centrally to improve nicotine withdrawal symptoms or whether peripheral effects contribute, we implanted mice with osmotic minipumps connected to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  guide cannulas to centrally deliver either metformin (50 g/d) or saline for 1 wk before withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dose of i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metformin was chosen because it does not alter peripheral glucose metabolism (21) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, 7 d of i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metformin caused AMPK activation in the hippocampus, but not in the liver (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, centrally administered metformin completely prevented nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety behaviors, as shown by a reduced latency to consume novel food (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly support the notion that central, not peripheral, actions of metformin ameliorate nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metformin has been shown to activate a variety of cellular targets in addition to AMPK (19, 20, 2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that AMPK is the relevant target of metformin-mediated reduction of anxiety-like behaviors following nicotine withdrawal, we used Ampk1loxP/loxP;Ampk2loxP/loxP mice harboring conditional alleles for both -subunits of AMPK (AMPKloxP/loxP hereinafter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Cre recombinase (AAV-Cre) was microinjected directly into the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of AMPKloxP/loxP mice, generating site-specific deletion of AMPK (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the anatomic and temporal resolution of our injection coordinates, AAV-GFP (green fluorescence protein) was injected into the hippocampi of AMPKloxP/loxP mice, and its presence in the expected location was confirmed 8 wk later through GFP immunohistochemistry (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed that total levels of AMPK were decreased in the hippocampi at 8 wk after AAV-Cre injection in AMPKloxP/loxP mice, but remained unchanged in other brain regions, such as the cortex (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, levels of phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase (pACC) were also reduced in the hippocampi, demonstrating a functional reduction in the pathway (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess anxiety-like behaviors, mice were trained in the NIH paradigm at 4 wk after intrahippocampal injection of AAV-Cre and tested at 8 wk after viral injection to ensure full AMPK ablation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with nicotine and metformin for 1 wk, followed by 24 h of nicotine withdrawal before behavioral testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4D, the AMPK-deficient mice treated with metformin showed a dramatic and significant increase in the latency to feed on the novel food compared with the nicotine-treated mice, indicating that the positive effects of metformin on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety are mediated, at least in large part, by the presence of AMPK in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have explored the influence of targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) for smoking cessation therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the limited success and adverse side effects of these aids call for investigation beyond targeting nAChRs to abrogate nicotine withdrawal symptoms, such as negative affect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have used pharmacologic, behavioral, and genetic approaches to identify central AMPK activation as a potential novel therapeutic approach for nicotine cessation therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Withdrawal from nicotine produces physiological, affective, and cognitive effects (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative affect experienced during withdrawal is directly associated with early smoking relapse, with successful quitters exhibiting a greater positive affect compared with those who relapse (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smokers also report that one of their top concerns when considering the consequences of abstinence is the loss of nicotine as a tool to cope with negative affect (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To mechanistically examine the anxiogenic effect of nicotine withdrawal in preclinical models, we used behavioral paradigms that reliably demonstrate the anxiety impairments observed in humans following withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NIH and MB tests are two validated tests for evaluating anxiety-like behavior in rodents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic nicotine use reduces anxiety-like behavior, as measured by a decreased latency to eat a palatable food in a novel environment in the NIH test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, latency is significantly increased following nicotine withdrawal (13, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, chronic nicotine use decreases anxiety-like behavior as measured by a reduction in the number of marbles buried in the MB test, while withdrawal increases the number of marbles buried in this test (6, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our findings demonstrating the preclinical efficacy of metformin in alleviating anxiety-like behavior following nicotine withdrawal, we propose that AMPK activation in the brain via metformin can be repurposed as a novel pharmacotherapy for nicotine cessation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proven preclinical efficacy of metformin in alleviating withdrawal symptoms along with its well-established safety profile for diabetes treatment should encourage investigators to translate these findings into future clinical trials for higher continuous abstinence rates in smokers, with the added benefit of normalizing glycemic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of AMPK activation on mediating anxiety-like behavior and cognition in preclinical models of nicotine withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, mouse studies were conducted in which mice received treatment with an osmotic minipump containing saline or nicotine (18 mg/kg/d) for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous withdrawal from nicotine occurred following physical removal of the minipump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All behavioral responses were measured at 2448 h after nicotine withdrawal, because the first 2 d of withdrawal are associated with the highest rate of relapse in humans (31) and with peak affective withdrawal symptoms in mice (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMPK activators (AICAR and metformin) were chronically administered before nicotine cessation, and behavioral outcomes were evaluated using two behavioral paradigms, the NIH and MB tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimenters blind to treatment group assignment assessed two behavioral endpoints: latency to consume (NIH) and number of marbles buried (MB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis was used to quantify protein levels of AMPK within hippocampal tissue following AICAR or metformin administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we used an AAV vector to deliver Cre recombinase into AMPKloxP/loxP mice harboring a conditional allele for AMPK to determine whether AMPK is necessary for mediating the anxiolytic effects of metformin during withdrawal from nicotine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male 129SvEv; C57BL/6J F1 hybrid mice age 68 wk were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and used in the behavioral paradigm tests, i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  drug experiments, and molecular studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All AAV-Cre experiments were conducted in previously derived and described AMPKloxP/loxP mice (AMPK1loxP/loxP mice previously crossed with AMPK2loxP/loxP mice) (23, 33) from the Viollet laboratory (Institut Cochin, INSERM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were maintained on a standard light cycle (lights on between 0600 and 1800 h) and had free access to food and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvanias Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in compliance with the National Institute of Healths Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nicotine_Delivery__Dose__and_Withdrawal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were anesthetized with an isoflurane/oxygen mixture (13%), and osmotic minipumps (model 1002; Alzet) were placed s.c. using aseptic surgery techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ()-Nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt (MP Biomedicals) was dissolved in sterile 0.85% saline and administered via the osmotic minipumps at a dose of 18 mg/kg/d (dose expressed as freebase weight) for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control (saline-treated) mice received osmotic minipumps filled with 0.85% saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following treatment, the minipumps were surgically removed from one-half of the mice receiving saline and the mice treated chronically with nicotine to initiate spontaneous withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Drug_Treatments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metformin (Spectrum) was dissolved in saline and administered at 250 mg/kg by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AICAR (Toronto Research Chemicals) was dissolved in saline and administered at 500 mg/kg by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vehicle was 0.85% saline administered by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All injections were started at 7 d before withdrawal from nicotine and were given once daily between 0900 and 1000 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracerebroventricular_Administration_of_Metformin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osmotic minipumps (model 1002; Alzet) for i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  delivery were filled with either 0.85% saline or metformin (50 g/d), connected to silicone tubing (CT24SR; PlasticsOne), push-fit into guide cannula (3300/SP; PlasticsOne), and allowed to equilibrate to 37 ¬∞C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One week after mice were implanted with nicotine minipumps, mice were again anesthetized with vaporized isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minipump was inserted contralateral to the nicotine minipump, and the guide cannula was placed above the right lateral ventricle (anteroposterior, 0.8 mm; mediolateral, +1.5 mm) and fixed with dental cement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nicotine minipumps were removed at 6 d after the surgery, and behavioral testing was performed at 24 h after withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein analysis was performed as described previously (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, tissue was lysed in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol, Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixtures 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and Protease Inhibitor Mixtures 1 and 2 (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amounts of protein were run on NuPage 412% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following SDS/PAGE and blocking, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 ¬∞C with one of the following antibodies: AMPK, phospho-AMPK, ACC, phospho-ACC, or GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein quantification was performed using ImageJ software according to the provided protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densities were calculated for each sample and analyzed across conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viruses_and_Microinjections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The packaging, purification, and determination of vector titers for the AAVs AAV9.CMV.PI.eGFp.WPRE.bGH and AAV9.CMV.PI.CRE.rB were performed at the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection titers and stereotaxic coordinates were determined as described previously (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV-Cre or AAV-GFP virus was stereotaxically microinjected into the dorsal and ventral hippocampi (anteroposterior 2.1, lateral ¬± 1.4, dorsoventral 2.0 and anteroposterior 2.9, lateral ¬± 3.0, dorsoventral 3.8, respectively) at a final titer of 6.534 √ó 1010 gc/L over 20 min using a pressure-injection system (KD Scientific) at 0.1 L/min, 5 min per coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral testing began at 8 wk after surgery to allow time for recovery and viral expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Marble_Burying  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MB test was conducted as described previously (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h of acclimation in the room in which MB testing was performed, the mice were placed in a small cage (26 √ó 20 √ó 14 cm) with 5-cm deep bedding, on top of which were placed 20 equally distributed marbles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were left undisturbed for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 15 min, an investigator blinded to the treatment group returned the mouse to its home cage and counted the number of marbles that were buried in bedding (3/4 or more coverage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Novelty-Induced_Hypophagia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NIH test was conducted as described previously (13) with mice housed in groups of two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were placed in a testing room with dividers separating their home cages and allowed to acclimate for 1 h before presentation of a palatable food (peanut butter chips; Nestle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Training was repeated over 10 d with latency to consume the food measured on days 410.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following training, mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group, and the osmotic minipumps were implanted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following treatment, latency to consume peanut butter chips over a 15-min period was measured in the home cage as a baseline, and then measured again 24 h later in a novel environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The novel environment consisted of a standard cage with no bedding placed within a white box with bright light (approximately 2,150 Lux) and a novel smell (1:10 Pine Sol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software), and all data are presented as mean ¬± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between two groups (e.g., Western blot quantification) were done using Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons among multiple groups at one time point (e.g., MB test) were done using one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, comparisons between multiple groups at different time points (e.g., NIH test) were performed using repeated-measures two-way ANOVA to determine significant differences, with time (home day, novel day) as the within, repeated-measures independent factor and drug treatment as the dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold for statistical significance was set at P less_than 0.05, and Bonferronis multiple-comparison test was used for all post hoc analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
