Cytoskeleton dynamics control the first asymmetric cell division in Arabidopsis zygote  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In animals and plants, the zygote divides unequally, and the daughter cells inherit different developmental fates to form a proper embryo along the body axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytological events leading to zygote polarization have remained unknown in flowering plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the two essential components of the cytoskeleton, microtubules and actin filaments, are both disorganized on fertilization and then, arranged to form a transverse ring leading directional cell elongation and longitudinal arrays underlying polar nuclear migration, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide insights into the intracellular dynamics of zygote and the specific roles of cytoskeletons on zygote polarization in flowering plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The asymmetric cell division of the zygote is the initial and crucial developmental step in most multicellular organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In flowering plants, whether zygote polarity is inherited from the preexisting organization in the egg cell or reestablished after fertilization has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How dynamically the intracellular organization is generated during zygote polarization is also unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used a live-cell imaging system with Arabidopsis zygotes to visualize the dynamics of the major elements of the cytoskeleton, microtubules (MTs), and actin filaments (F-actins), during the entire process of zygote polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining image analysis and pharmacological experiments using specific inhibitors of the cytoskeleton, we found features related to zygote polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preexisting alignment of MTs and F-actin in the egg cell is lost on fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, MTs organize into a transverse ring defining the zygote subapical region and driving cell outgrowth in the apical direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actin forms an apical cap and longitudinal arrays and is required to position the nucleus to the apical region of the zygote, setting the plane of the first asymmetrical division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that, in flowering plants, the preexisting cytoskeletal patterns in the egg cell are lost on fertilization and that the zygote reorients the cytoskeletons to perform directional cell elongation and polar nuclear migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MT_Arrays_Are_Disorganized_on_Fertilization_and_Form_a_Subapical_Transverse_Ring_During_Zygote_Elongation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To perform live-cell imaging of the cytoskeleton in the polarizing zygote, we developed a set of markers labeling MTs and F-actin with nuclear reporters (MT/nucleus and F-actin/nucleus) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and Fig S1) that could be imaged using two-photon excitation microscopy (2PEM) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We captured the dynamic behavior of MTs by time-lapse imaging until the first zygotic cell division (Fig 1, Fig S3, and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before fertilization, the egg cell showed a vertically elongated shape and a clear polar organization with the nucleus at the apical pole (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MT arrays aligned longitudinally (Fig 1 B and K and Fig S3 A, C, and D), as shown by the small average angle of the fibers against the cell longitudinal axis () (Fig 1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After fertilization, the cell markedly shrank (Fig 1 C and M), as reported in several species of flowering plants (15, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleus moved to the cell center, and the MT pattern lost its original longitudinal orientation (Fig 1 C and N and Fig S3E) as indicated by the increased  (Fig 1L) and the reduced parallelness of each fiber (Fig S3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 2 h, transverse MTs accumulated in the subapical region (Fig 1D) and organized an MT ring, above which a bulge emerged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bulge rapidly outgrew above the transverse MT ring, thus elongating in the apical direction (Fig 1E and Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During zygote elongation, the MTs formed spiral oblique cortical arrays in the basal part of the cell (Fig 1E and Fig S3F), and the nucleus gradually followed to the apical region (Fig 1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This MT reorganization during zygote elongation was quantified by increased values of parallelness (Fig S3H), fiber density (Fig S3I), and skewness of the intensity distribution (a metric for the appearance of bundled cables) (Fig S3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, higher  values in the apical region than in the basal area supported the difference between the subapical transverse MT ring and the basal oblique MT arrays (Fig 1O and Fig S3 KN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the completion of zygote elongation, the subapical transverse MT ring dispersed (Fig 1F and Fig S3G), and thus,  values in the apical and basal regions no longer significantly differed (Fig 1O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before spindle formation (Fig 1H), another transverse ring of cortical MTs appeared surrounding the nucleus as a preprophase band (Fig 1G), indicating the site of the first cell division of the mature zygote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, mitosis took place, and the phragmoplast formed between the daughter nuclei (Fig 1I) before the completion of cytokinesis (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, fertilization triggers a loss of longitudinal MT arrays in the egg cell, and a subapical transverse MT ring appears specifically during zygote elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a transverse MT ring in the immature zygote is in agreement with the previous observation by immunofluorescence staining of the nontransgenic plants (21), supporting that our system visualizes the native dynamics of MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

F-Actin_Is_Also_Rearranged_from_a_Disorganized_State_and_Forms_an_Apical_Cap_and_Longitudinal_Bundle_Along_the_ApicalBasal_Axis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we performed time-lapse imaging and quantification of F-actin (Fig 2, Fig S4, and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the egg cell, we observed a meshwork consisting of thick parallel cables (Fig 2 A and H and Fig S4A), as shown by large skewness (Fig S4D) and parallelness (Fig 2I) values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fertilization, F-actin cables were disorganized in the shrunken zygote (Fig 2B and Fig S4B), as quantified by lower parallelness values than in the egg cell (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the cables became thinner, as shown by reduced skewness values (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that the F-actin pattern in the egg cell was disrupted on fertilization, as observed for MTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the apical pole in the emerging bulge and elongating tip, we found F-actin accumulation at the apical end (Fig 2 C and D), similar to the apical cap, a typical structure of tip-growing cells, which guides vesicle trafficking to promote cell elongation (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to a report in which the apical cap was detected only in the growing tip (25), the cap structure disappeared after zygote elongation was completed (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both elongating and mature zygotes, F-actin was also aligned longitudinally (Fig 2 D and E and Fig S4C), as indicated by an increase of parallelness (Fig 2I) and a reduction of  (Fig 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, F-actin cables become thick and dense, as shown by increases in skewness (Fig S4D) and density (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During cell division, F-actin accumulated at the phragmoplast (Fig 2F), as MTs did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the preexisting F-actin pattern in the egg cell was lost on fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the elongating zygote, F-actin was rearranged into an apical cap and a longitudinal array, both of which are typically associated with directionally elongating cells (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTs_and_F-Actin_Regulate_Directional_Cell_Elongation_and_Polar_Nuclear_Migration__Respectively  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the respective roles of MTs and F-actin, we analyzed how their inhibitors affected zygote polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we confirmed that MTs and F-actin in the zygote were specifically disturbed when their respective inhibitors were added to the in vitro ovule cultivation media (Fig S5 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filamentous pattern of the MT/nucleus marker disappeared after a 1-h treatment with an MT polymerization inhibitor (oryzalin) (Fig S5B), whereas the control DMSO and the actin polymerization inhibitor [latrunculin B (LatB)] had no detectable effect (Fig S5 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the F-actin signal became diffuse only when LatB was applied (Fig S5 DF), confirming that these inhibitors were specific and efficient in our experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the effects of these inhibitors on zygote polarization with the MT/nucleus marker using a multiposition live-cell imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MT filament pattern could not be visualized with this spinning disk confocal system, but it was suitable for high-throughput measurement of cell shape and nuclear positioning (Fig 3 AC and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on mature zygotes, we measured the cell length (Fig 3D), cell width (Fig S5G), and nuclear position (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the control treatment (Fig 3A and Movie S3), oryzalin treatment resulted in loss of the restriction of zygote elongation, and thus, the zygotes became shorter and wider than control zygotes (Fig 3 B and D and Fig S5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the nucleus properly migrated to the apical region (Fig 3E), cell division failed in the presence of oryzalin (Fig 3B), probably because of the inhibition of the mitotic and cytokinetic apparatus, such as spindle fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with LatB caused distinct effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It slightly inhibited cell elongation (Fig 3 C and D and Fig S5G) but more severely blocked nuclear migration (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LatB did not disturb the completion of nuclear division and cytokinesis, and thus, cell division was close to symmetrical (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that MTs regulate zygote cell elongation, whereas F-actin promotes polar migration of the nucleus to the apical tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study showed that fertilization triggers the loss of the preexisting organization of the cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disorganization occurs coincidentally with the dispersion of the vacuole at the basal region of the egg cell (4, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a large vacuole occupies much of the egg cell volume in most flowering plants (15, 22), fertilization would trigger vacuole shrinkage to lose the dominant fiber orientation in the egg cell and also, reduce the cell volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of cytoskeletal array after fertilization suggests that the polar organization of the egg cell is associated with fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, cytoskeletal elements are redeployed to establish a pattern required to establish the embryo axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is supported by the observation that the central cell consumes the F-actin array for gamete nuclei fusion (20) and by the wrky2 mutant, which generates proper egg cell polarity but fails to repolarize the zygote, resulting in an abnormal embryo shape (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics identified an essential role for the MT ring in defining the site of cell outgrowth that sustains unidirectional zygote elongation (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This role likely explains the absence of zygote elongation in the pilz mutant, which is deficient in MT assembly (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar roles for MT rings have been observed in directionally elongating cells, such as fern protonema (29) and Arabidopsis trichome branches (30), suggesting that MT rings play a general role in defining the zone of apical growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because diverse species, including flowering plants and brown algae, have vertically elongated zygotes (3133), similar polarization might be a general strategy of plant zygotes in contrast to most animal zygotes that undergo cell division in the absence of cell growth (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observed an apical cap and longitudinal bundles of F-actin in the zygote (Fig 3F), which are general features of tip-growing cells in various plant species (25, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because fern protonema elongates in tip-growing manner (29) and Arabidopsis trichome outgrows as polarized diffuse growth (30), it is intriguing to determine which manner is used in the zygote elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because tip growth is an ancient mechanism observed in the gametophytes of bryophytes (37) and budding yeasts (38), it might be natural for the zygote, the origin of sporophytic cells, to use this machinery for the first polarization step to establish the body axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is supported by the fact that the tip growth machinery is conserved between gametophytes in bryophytes and sporophytes in flowering plants (39) and the analogy between the budding of yeast and the bulge outgrowth of the Arabidopsis zygote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diffuse growth is a common form of cell expansion in land plants (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Arabidopsis roots, pericycle cells directionally elongate and then divide asymmetrically, giving rise to lateral root primordia (41), and epidermal cell elongation is accompanied with the establishment of new polarity to generate root hair (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These facts imply some relation between the polarized diffuse growth and the acquisition of novel cell fate, which would be also important for the zygote to initiate embryogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional experiments would identify the growth manner of zygote by determining whether the entire cell surface evenly expands (i.e., diffuse growth) or new cell wall materials are preferentially deposited at the apical apex (i.e., tip growth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The in vitro ovule culture followed a previous report with some modifications (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An AxioImager A2 (Zeiss) was used for wide-field epifluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2PEM live-cell imaging was performed using an A1R MP (Nikon), and confocal imaging was done with a CV1000 (Yokogawa Electric), except for the comparison of 2PEM and confocal images in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In the MT/nucleus marker, the 463-bp EGG CELL1 (EC1) promoter (43) was fused to the GFP variant Clover, the full-length coding region of -tubulin TUBULIN ALPHA6 (TUA6; AT4G14960), and the NOS terminator in a pAlligator-derived binary vector (20) (EC1p::Clover-TUA6; coded as MU1882).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EC1p::Clover-TUA6 and EC1p::Lifeact-Venus (20) were combined with the nuclear markers ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4)p::H2B-tdTomato and DD22p::H2B-mCherry to generate the MT/nucleus and F-actin/nucleus markers, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABI4p::H2B-tdTomato is an egg cell/zygote-specific nuclear marker containing the 2.6-kb ABI4 promoter (46), the full-length coding region of H2B (AT1G07790), tdTomato, and the NOS terminator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DD22p::H2B-mCherry is a central cell/endosperm-specific nuclear marker, consisting of the 1.0-kb DD22 promoter (47, 48), the full-length coding region of H2B, mCherry, and the NOS terminator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABI4p::H2B-tdTomato and DD22p::H2B-mCherry were combined in the pPZP211 binary vector with a seed-specific fluorescent marker (At2S3p::mCherry) as in a pAlligator-derived binary vector (20, 49) (coded as MU1937).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis using the floral dip method (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Ovule_Cultivation_for_Zygote_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro ovule culture was performed as in a previous report with some modifications as follows (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-pollinated flowers were dissected under a stereomicroscope to collect the ovules, which were transferred to autoclaved Nitsch medium [5% (wt/vol) trehalose dihydrate (Wako Pure Chemical), 0.05% (wt/vol) MES-KOH, pH 5.8, 1× Gamborgs vitamin solution (Sigma)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four-well glass-bottom (Matsunami Glass) and 96-well glass-bottom (Greiner) dishes were used for live-cell imaging with an A1R MP (Nikon) and a CV1000 (Yokogawa Electric), respectively (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fertilized ovules were distinguished from unfertilized ovules based on the difference in nuclear location in the egg cell and young zygote in addition to the number of nuclei in the central cell and the endosperm (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For wide-field epifluorescence microscopy, the ovules were placed in water, and the images were obtained with an AxioImager A2 (Zeiss) using a 40× objective lens (40× Plan-Apo, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.95; Zeiss), a band-pass filter of 46HE for Clover and 43HE for tdTomato and mCherry (Zeiss), an AxioCam HRm Camera (Zeiss), and the AxioVision software (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Except for the zygote measurement analysis, all confocal microscopy and 2PEM for zygote imaging were performed using a laser-scanning inverted microscope (A1R MP; Nikon) equipped with a Ti:sapphire femtosecond pulse laser (Mai Tai DeepSee; Spectra-Physics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired with excitation at 488 nm (confocal) or 950 nm (2PEM) and a 40× water-immersion objective lens (CFI Apo LWD WI, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.15, working distance = 0.590.61 mm; Nikon) with Immersol W 2010 (Zeiss) immersion medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence signals were detected by external nondescanned GaAsP PMT Detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two dichroic mirrors, DM495 and DM560, and two band-pass filters: 534/30 nm for Clover and Venus and 578/105 nm for tdTomato and mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse images were taken at 31 z stacks with 1-µm intervals every 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images for the quantitative analysis of cytoskeleton patterns were taken at 62 z stacks with 0.5-µm intervals and two times averaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Live-cell imaging for the zygote measurement analysis was performed with a box-type confocal microscope system harboring a stable incubation chamber from 18 °C to 22 °C (CV1000; Yokogawa Electric), which was equipped with a 488-nm laser, a 561-nm laser (Yokogawa Electric), and an Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device camera (ImagEM C9100-13; Hamamatsu Photonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were collected using a 40× objective lens (40× UPLSAPO, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.95; Olympus) at seven z stacks with 5-µm intervals every 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a band-pass filter of 520/50 nm for Clover and 617/73 nm for tdTomato and mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was performed using the NIS-Elements AR 4.10 software (Nikon), CV1000 software (CellVoyager; Yokogawa Electric), or ImageJ (imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ImageJ was also used to optimize the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Analysis_of_Cytoskeleton_Patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Image processing for measurements of cytoskeleton pattern metrics was performed as previously reported (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure parallelness and the average angle against the cell longitudinal axis (), MIP images (Fig S3A) were skeletonized using the ImageJ plugin KbiLineExtract (45) with the following parameter set: giwsIter = 10, mdnmsLen = 15, pickup = aboveZero, shaveLen = 10, and delLen = 10 (Fig S3 C and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skeletonized images were masked with binary cell images (mask images) (Fig S3B) that were manually segmented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the parallelness was measured in the skeletonized images using the ImageJ plugin KbiLineFeature (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was defined as={|cellcytoskeleton|if|cellcytoskeleton|90|cellcytoskeleton|90if|cellcytoskeleton| greater than 90where cell and cytoskeleton are the angle of the major axis of the cell fit ellipse and the mean angle of the skeletonized cytoskeletons, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cell was measured from the manually segmented cell images using ImageJ-Analyze-Measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cytoskeleton was measured using the ImageJ plugin KbiLineFeature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell area was measured with the manually segmented binary cell image (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fiber density was calculated by dividing skeletonized pixel numbers by cell area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the skewness of intensity distribution, the serial optical sections were skeletonized using the ImageJ plugin KbiLineExtract with the parameter set described above, and then, MIP images of the skeletonized images were obtained and masked with the binary cell image (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 DG and S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the processed images, the skewness of the intensity distribution, which is an indicator of cytoskeletal bundling (44), was measured using the ImageJ plugin KbiLineFeature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
