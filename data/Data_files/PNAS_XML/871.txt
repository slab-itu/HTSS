Local gene therapy durably restores vestibular function in a mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1G  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hearing and balance impairments are major concerns and a serious burden for public health, but still lack an effective curative therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed inner ear functions in a mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1, a developmental disorder characterized by profound congenital deafness and balance deficit, after local gene therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral transfer of the wild-type cDNA to the inner ear of the mutant mice shortly after birth resulted in a partial restoration of hearing and a long-lasting, almost complete, removal of the balance defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present results provide a basis for future clinical trials in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inherited forms of inner ear deficits has considerably improved during the past 20 y, but we are still far from curative treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated gene replacement as a strategy for restoring inner ear functions in a mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1G, characterized by congenital profound deafness and balance disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice lack the scaffold protein sans, which is involved both in the morphogenesis of the stereociliary bundle, the sensory antenna of inner ear hair cells, and in the mechanoelectrical transduction process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a single delivery of the sans cDNA by the adenoassociated virus 8 to the inner ear of newborn mutant mice reestablishes the expression and targeting of the protein to the tips of stereocilia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic gene restores the architecture and mechanosensitivity of stereociliary bundles, improves hearing thresholds, and durably rescues these mice from the balance defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results open up new perspectives for efficient gene therapy of cochlear and vestibular disorders by showing that even severe dysmorphogenesis of stereociliary bundles can be corrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AAV8 vector (Penn Vector Core) transduces vestibular and cochlear hair cells with different efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Diagram of the mouse inner ear and viral injection through the round window of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vestibular sensory epithelia [AC, ampullar crista(e) of the three semicircular canals; SM, saccular macula; UM, utricular macula] and cochlear sensory epithelium (OC, organ of Corti) are drawn in pink and in red, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of an AC and the OC are presented on the left side and right side of this diagram, respectively, with the hair cells (IHCs, OHCs, and VHCs) drawn in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AAV8-Sans-IRES-GFP (Penn Vector Core) recombinant virus injected through the cochlear round window of a mouse on P2.5 transduces the vast majority of VHCs (B, Upper) and transduces cochlear IHCs and OHCs more efficiently in the apical region than in the basal region of the cochlea (C, Upper), as shown by the GFP labeling (green) on P8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All hair cells are stained red by an anti-myosin VI antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher magnification views of the AC (B, Lower) and the OC (C, Lower) from the cochlear apical region are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bars: Upper, 50 m; Lower, 10 m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Viral_cDNA_Transfer_Restores_Sans_Expression_and_Targeting_in_Cochlear_and_VHCs_of_Ush1g__Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of AAV serotypes and over 100 naturally occurring AAV variants have been isolated from adenovirus stocks or from human/nonhuman primate tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They display different cell tropisms (14), but there are some discrepancies in their reported transduction efficiencies and cell tropisms in the inner ear (2629).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus investigated the ability of several AAV vectors to transduce the inner ear hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested recombinant AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8 vectors containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene driven by a hybrid promoter (CAG) consisting of the CMV enhancer fused to the chicken -actin gene promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single viral injection through the round window membrane separating the middle ear from the inner ear was performed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice on postnatal day 2.5 (P2.5) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensory epithelium of the cochlea (organ of Corti) and the vestibular end organs were microdissected on P8.5, and immunolabeled for otoferlin or myosin VI to visualize the inner ear hair cells, as well as for GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These recombinant AAV vectors transduced the inner ear cell types with different cell tropisms and transduction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cochlea, AAV1 (SignaGen) and AAV2 and AAV5 (Penn Vector Core) mostly transduced supporting cells of the organ of Corti, namely, Deiters cells and inner phalangeal cells (Fig S1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV8 from SignaGen (with the CAG promoter) mainly transduced cochlear ganglion neurons (Fig S1D), whereas AAV8 from Penn Vector Core (with the same promoter) efficiently transduced hair cells and supporting cells (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two types of cochlear hair cells: the inner hair cells (IHCs), which are the genuine auditory sensory cells that transmit the encoded sensory signal to the central nervous system, and the outer hair cells (OHCs), which function as fine-tuned amplifiers of the sound stimulus (30) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injection of AAV8 from Penn Vector Core, more IHCs expressed GFP at the apex of the cochlea (84 ± 3%) than at the base (40% ± 0.5%), whereas OHCs were transduced with roughly the same efficiency at the base (28 ± 3%) and at the apex (24 ± 2%) (n = 23 mice; Fig S1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surgery and intracochlear injection of the virus did not affect auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) tested from 2 to 12 wk after injection (Fig 4A and Fig S4; MannWhitney test, P = 0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the efficiency with which the recombinant AAV8-Sans-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP virus (Penn Vector Core) containing the murine cDNA Sans, encoding the unique spliced transcript of Ush1g, transduced inner ear hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ush1g+/ mice were injected with the recombinant virus on P2.5, and 6 d later, the sensory epithelia of the cochlea and vestibular end organs were microdissected and immunolabeled either for GFP and myosin VI or for GFP and sans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hair cell transduction efficacy of AAV8-Sans-IRES-GFP was similar to that of AAV8-GFP (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of IHC transduction (i.e., GFP-expressing IHCs) was 87 ± 4% at the cochlear apex, gradually decreasing to 45 ± 6% at the cochlear base, and the rate of OHC transduction was 33 ± 6% at the apex, gradually decreasing to 25 ± 5% at the base (n = 24 mice; Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, in the vestibular end organs of the injected ears, the hair cells were transduced at a much higher rate, 91 ± 24% (n = 17 mice; Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the injection of AAV8-Sans-IRES-GFP into the cochlea of Ush1g/ mice restored a normal targeting of the sans protein to the tips of the stereocilia of transduced IHCs, OHCs, and VHCs on P8.5 (24, 25) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viral_Transfer_of_the_Sans_cDNA_to_the_Hair_Cells_Rescues_Ush1g__Mice_from_Hair_Bundle_Defects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) onward, cochlear hair cells of Ush1g/ mice display fragmented hair bundles with reduced numbers of stereocilia and mispositioned kinocilia (24, 25), and nearly all VHCs have collapsed hair bundles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degeneration of the middle and short rows of stereocilia in IHCs and OHCs and the collapse of the VHC hair bundles are even more pronounced at P2.5 (Fig 3A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether the viral expression of the Sans cDNA in the hair cells rescued the mice from these defects by scanning electron microscopy analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the injected Ush1g/ mice, the vast majority of hair bundles of IHCs, OHCs of the cochlear apex, and VHCs displayed a typical staircase pattern (81 ± 3% for cochlear hair cells, n = 72 cells and 70 ± 1% for VHCs, n = 304 cells from 10 mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the stereocilia of the short and middle rows in most IHCs (93 ± 2%, n = 27 cells) and OHCs (68 ± 5%, n = 55 cells) in the apical region of the injected cochlea had prolate tips pointing toward their taller neighbors, just like in Ush1g+/ control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stereocilia tips of most VHCs had their characteristic prolate shape too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolate tips are considered a hallmark of the presence of functional tip links resulting from the pulling force exerted by these links on the tips of the stereocilia (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the stereocilia tips had prolate shapes in only 4% of the VHCs (n = 204 cells) and none of the cochlear hair cells (n = 147 cells, from seven mice) of uninjected Ush1g/ mice (Fig 3A, Insets; MannWhitney test, P less_than 104 for all comparisons between injected and uninjected Ush1g/ mice), which is consistent with the loss of tip links in these mice (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we estimated the numbers of stereocilia per hair bundle, their projected heights, and their spacing, based on our scanning electron micrographs (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant differences in any of these parameters between the injected Ush1g/ mice and Ush1g+/ mice (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the cochlear and vestibular hair bundles of injected and uninjected wild-type mice did not differ in appearance either, suggesting that the injection through the round window membrane did not impair the morphological development of the hair bundles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In keeping with the morphological rescue of the hair bundles, the transduced IHCs and OHCs of injected Ush1g/ P8.5 mice, identified on the basis of GFP fluorescence, displayed mechanoelectrical transduction currents of much higher peak amplitudes (424 ± 69.4 pA in IHCs, n = 11 and 641 ± 35 pA in OHCs, n = 12) than IHCs and OHCs of uninjected Ush1g/ mice (110.8 ± 30.8 pA in IHCs, n = 5 and 47.3 ± 5.7 pA in OHCs, n = 4; Students t test, P less_than 0.01 for each comparison; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the sensitivity of the transduction current response to hair bundle displacement was similar in injected Ush1g/ mice and injected Ush1g+/ (control) mice (calculated mean sensitivity values: 1.12 ± 0.19 m1 and 1.30 ± 0.14 m1 for IHCs, and 1.73 ± 0.2 m1 and 2.24 ± 0.15 m1 for OHCs of injected Ush1g+/ and injected Ush1g/ mice, respectively; unpaired t test, P  greater than  0.1 for both comparisons) (24) (Fig 3B and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Partial_Restoration_of_Hearing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ush1g/ mice are profoundly deaf and show no identifiable ABRs, even in response to sounds of intensities up to 110 dB sound pressure level (SPL) (24) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After gene transfer, ABR waves could be recorded in 2- to 12-wk-old Ush1g/ mice for sound intensities exceeding 75 dB SPL, indicating a substantial improvement in cochlear function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sounds in the low-frequency range (515 kHz), the hearing threshold elevation was about 50 dB on P30, instead of a complete hearing loss in the uninjected mutant mice (n = 18 injected mice; one-way ANOVA test, P less_than 0.01; Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improvement of hearing thresholds was less noticeable at higher frequencies (2040 kHz), which is consistent with the decrease in cochlear hair cell transduction rates from the apical region to the basal region of the cochlea, where high-frequency tones are analyzed (32) (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that a partial hearing rescue was still present at the age of 12 wk, the oldest age at which the mice were tested (33) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a single intracochlear injection of the transgene during the neonatal period was able to restore the hearing of loud sounds (75 dB) of low frequency in Ush1g/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Complete_Restoration_of_Vestibular_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Video-tracking in an open-field chamber showed that injected Ush1g/ mice explored the field in a manner similar to control mice, without circling behavior (1.5 ± 0.4 turn in 2 min for injected Ush1g/ mice, n = 10, vs. 20.3 ± 2.8 turns in 2 min for uninjected Ush1g/ mice, n = 7; Students t test, P less_than 0.01; Fig 4B, Fig S3B, and Movies S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional behavioral tests were carried out to assess the vestibular functions in these mice, up to 53 wk after injection (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the balance platform test (SI Materials and Methods), the uninjected Ush1g/ mice (n = 7) were unable to stay on the platform, whereas the injected Ush1g/ mice (n = 10), like the Ush1g+/ control mice (n = 9), were able to spend about 1 min on the platform (58.4 ± 0.9 s vs. 27.6 ± 10.6 s for injected Ush1g/ mice and uninjected mutant mice, respectively; Students t test, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the injected Ush1g/ mice responded normally in the trunk curl test, and were able to reach a horizontal landing surface rapidly when suspended by the tail, without curling the trunk toward their tail, whereas the uninjected mutant mice were unable to land on the horizontal surface, instead curling toward the base of the tail when suspended (Pearsons 2 test, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a contact righting test, the injected Ush1g/ mice could reorient their bodies rapidly upon inversion of the tube in which they were held, whereas the uninjected Ush1g/ mice could not (Pearsons 2 test, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the swim test described by Hardisty-Hughes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34), the injected Ush1g/ mice behaved just like the wild-type mice, whereas the uninjected Ush1g/ mice displayed underwater tumbling, and had to be lifted out and rescued at once (Pearsons 2 test, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that gene replacement therapy by early postnatal injection of AAV8-Sans into the inner ear restores the vestibular function in Ush1g/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this effect persisted in the long term, as no difference was found between the Ush1g+/ and injected Ush1g/ mice when these tests were carried out 53 wk after treatment (platform test: Students t test, P  greater than  0.1; swim test: Pearsons 2 test, P  greater than  0.1; n = 5 mice for each genotype).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then evaluated the long-term contributions of the different vestibular end organs to the improvement in equilibration up to 67 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functions of the semicircular canals and otolith organs (saccule and utricle) were assessed by recording vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) and macula-ocular reflexes (MORs) in response to specific turntable movements, respectively (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No compensatory eye movements in response to turntable rotation could be detected in Ush1g/ mice, indicating a complete loss of function for both the semicircular canals and otolith organs, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, all of the injected Ush1g/ mice showed compensatory eye movements in the VOR and MOR tests (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vestibulo-ocular responses were indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice in two of the five injected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the other three mice, semicircular canal organ responses were restored to a lesser degree than otolith organ responses, which were not significantly different from those of controls, demonstrating that a single intracochlear injection of the transgene results in a long-lasting complete restoration of the vestibular function in Ush1g/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viral_Vector_Constructs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used AAV1-CAG-GFP and AAV1-CMV-GFP, from SignaGen Laboratories, at a titer of 1.2 × 1012 genome copies (gc)/mL; AAV1-CAG-GFP, from Penn Vector Core, at a titer of 1.1 × 1013 gc/mL; AAV2-CAG-GFP, from Penn Vector Core, at a titer of 6.4 × 1013 gc/mL; AAV5-CMV-GFP, from Penn Vector Core, at a titer of 1.13 × 1013 gc/mL; and AAV8-CAG from SignaGen Laboratories and Penn Vector Core at titers of 1.6 × 1012 gc/mL and 1.4 × 1013 gc/mL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The murine cDNA, Sans, corresponding to the unique spliced transcript of Ush1g reported (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NM_176847), followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the cDNA sequence of the GFP reporter gene, was inserted into the pENN.AAV.CB6.PI.rBG plasmid (Penn Vector Core), which was then packaged into the AAV8 capsid and produced by Penn Vector Core facility at a titer of 1.47 × 1013 gc/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracochlear_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institut Pasteur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracochlear viral transduction was carried out as described by Akil et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were anesthetized by hypothermia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A left postauricular incision was made and, using the cochlear basal turn and stapedial artery as landmarks, the otic bulla was exposed and opened.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A glass micropipette with an outer tip diameter of 10 m containing 2 L of the viral vector preparation, with similar numbers of viral particles, was then inserted into the round window membrane, and the liquid was gently injected into the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pipette was removed, the hole in the membrane was plugged with connective tissue, and the incision was sealed with biological glue (3M Vetbond).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After dissection, inner ears were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cochleas and vestibular end organs were microdissected, rinsed three times for 10 min, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 20% normal horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-sans (1/100), chicken anti-GFP (1:500; Abcam), antiotoferlin (1/250), and/or anti-myosin VI (1/200) (40, 41) in PBS supplemented with 1% horse serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with ATTO-550conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500 dilution; SigmaAldrich) and ATTO-488conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG antibody (1:500 dilution; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin was labeled with ATTO-647Nconjugated phalloidin (1:200 dilution; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z-stack images were captured with a Zeiss LSM-700 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hair_Cell_Counting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GFP reporter gene expression was used to evaluate the rate of transduction in injected ears: We divided the total number of IHCs or OHCs producing GFP by the total number of IHCs or OHCs immunolabeled for myosin VI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mature stages, the rate of transduction was calculated in the middle and apical regions of each cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiological_Recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrophysiological whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction currents were performed in cochlear explants from P8 mice, as previously described (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cochleas were finely dissected, and the sensory epithelium (organ of Corti) was placed under nylon meshes and observed under a water immersion 40×/0.8 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olympus objective mounted on an Axioscope Zeiss microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extracellular and dissecting solutions both had the following compositions: 146 mM NaCl, 5.8 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.7 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4, 305 mosmol/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular solution contained 130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM K2ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, and 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.3, 290 mosmol/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Borosilicate patch pipettes (electrical resistance of 23 M) were brought parallel to the hair cell rows through a hole in the reticular lamina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair cells were whole-cell voltage-clamped at room temperature (2025 °C), at a holding potential of 80 mV, with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No correction was made for liquid junction potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Series resistance was always below 10 M and was compensated to 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were sampled at 100 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each hair bundle was mechanically stimulated by applying axial step displacements with a rigid glass rod that had been fire-polished before the experiment to yield a tip diameter of 23 m. The probe was systematically positioned against the top of the hair bundle in the bundles plane of bilateral symmetry toward the tallest row of stereocilia, at an angle of 30° relative to the apical cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe used for mechanical stimulation of the hair bundles was secured to a stack-type piezoelectric actuator (PA8/12; Piezo System Jena) driven by a low-voltage power supply (30V300; Piezo System Jena).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offline measurements were obtained with a displacement monitor containing photodiodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 2 ms of the time course of probe motion were well described by an exponential increase, with a time constant of 100 ms. Data were analyzed in MATLAB, version 7.0 (MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curves for mechanoelectrical transduction channel opening probability as a function of hair bundle displacement [Po(X)] were fitted with a three-state Boltzmann relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sensitivity measurements, the mean value of the derivative of the three-state Boltzmann relationship was calculated for displacements corresponding to Po values between 0.2 and 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Audiological_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABRs to sound stimuli were recorded and analyzed as previously described (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, mice were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine, and placed in an attenuated-sound room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three electrodes were placed at the vertex, the ipsilateral mastoid, and the lower back as the ground electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pure-tone stimuli were used at frequencies of 5, 10, 15, 20, 32, and 40 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sound intensities of 10 to 110 dB, in 10-dB steps, were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thresholds were determined as the lowest stimulus level resulting in recognizable ABR waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated circling behavior with tracking software (Ethovision de Noldus Information Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers of turns made in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions were counted in an open-field chamber (37 cm long and 18.5 cm wide) over a period of 120 s. We also did various tests to assess vestibular function, as previously described (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trunk curl test was carried out by holding the mouse by the tail and observing whether it managed to reach a horizontal landing surface (score of 1) or whether it curled its trunk toward its tail (score of 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated balance with the platform test: The mouse was positioned on a small platform (7 cm × 7 cm) at a height of 29 cm, and we observed how many times the mouse fell off the platform over a period of 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contact righting test was carried out by placing the mouse in a closed transparent tube and observing whether the mouse was able to right itself when the tube was rotated by 180° (score of 1 if the mouse can right itself and score of 0 if the mouse cannot).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also scored the swimming ability of each mouse in a container filled with water at 2223 °C (score of 1 the mouse can swim and score of 0 if the mouse cannot swim).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate a long-term restoration of inner ear functions in a mouse model of USH1 by using a single AAV-mediated local gene therapy at an early postnatal stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombinant AAV8, with the CAG promoter driving transgene expression, was found to be the most efficient of the AAV vectors tested for the transduction of inner ear hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus injection through the round window membrane on P2.5 had no deleterious effect on inner ear development in wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no adverse side effects were detected in the mice for up to 63 wk after virus injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach therefore appears as a promising one to attempt in future extension to human patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate that Sans cDNA delivery restores the production and localization of the sans protein in the IHCs, OHCs, and VHCs, suggesting that the exogenous protein was correctly targeted to the tip-link insertion points (24, 36) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the transduced cochlear hair cells of injected Ush1g/ mice displayed markedly improved mechanoelectrical transduction currents in ex vivo experiments on P8.5 cochlear explants, which indicates that expression of the Sans cDNA in these cells effectively compensates for the absence of the native protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we can infer that the exogenous protein most probably interacts with the other members of the USH1 protein complex (i.e., cadherin-related protein 23, cadherin-related protein 15, myosin VIIA, harmonin), as required for the correct functioning of the mechanoelectrical transduction channels (24) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduction currents can first be recorded on P0 and P2 in the hair cells of the cochlear basal and apical regions, respectively (37), whereas the transduction apparatus of VHCs is already functional on E17 (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the Sans cDNA was delivered by a viral vector on P2.5, and expression of the cDNA was first detected 48 h later (i.e., about 10 d after the normal onset of Ush1g expression on E14.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this delay, gene replacement therapy efficiently restored the structure and function of inner ear hair cells in Ush1g/ mice and prevented the balance deficit while limiting the hearing impairment for low sound frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time window for treating deafness and balance disorders by gene transfer in patients with USH1 may therefore be larger than initially thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the almost complete restoration of vestibular functions reported here reveals unanticipated temporal flexibility for the effective treatment of other early-onset balance disorders of genetic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to determine why the transgene injection did not fully restore cochlear function in Ush1g/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher rates of hair cell transduction in the vestibular end organs than in the cochlea raise the hope of a full restoration of hearing by increasing the transduction rates in the cochlear hair cells (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worthy of note that hearing thresholds were significantly improved for sounds in the low-frequency range (515 kHz), which are analyzed in a cochlear apical region that, owing to its high curvature, cannot be reached by the electrode arrays of cochlear implants (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this gene therapy approach might be effective in association with current cochlear implants by partly restoring the tonotopic information that these implants cannot provide, and thus allowing for better sound perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study constitutes a significant step toward the virus-mediated cure of a form of genetic deafness in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, before considering translation to clinical trials, these results must be reproduced in larger animal models that are better predictors of responses in humans than rodents, based on the size and the kinetics of maturation of their cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
