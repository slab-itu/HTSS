BRD4 is a novel therapeutic target for liver fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are chronic liver diseases, resulting in life-threatening conditions with no FDA-approved therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) as a critical regulator for enhancer-mediated profibrotic gene expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, we find BRD4-loaded enhancers are associated with multiple profibrotic pathways in HSCs and that pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 blocks HSC activation into myofibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors of BRD4 are not only protective against, but can limit the fibrotic response in CCl4-induced fibrosis in a mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our studies implicate BRD4 as a global genomic regulator of the fibrotic gene regulatory network and suggest bromodomains as potential therapeutic targets to treat fibrotic complications in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liver fibrosis is characterized by the persistent deposition of extracellular matrix components by hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived myofibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the histological manifestation of progressive, but reversible wound-healing processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unabated fibrotic response results in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, a pathological precursor of hepatocellular carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a member of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, abrogate cytokine-induced activation of HSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cistromic analyses reveal that BRD4 is highly enriched at enhancers associated with genes involved in multiple profibrotic pathways, where BRD4 is colocalized with profibrotic transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that JQ1 is not only protective, but can reverse the fibrotic response in carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis in mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results implicate that BRD4 can act as a global genomic regulator to direct the fibrotic response through its coordinated regulation of myofibroblast transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests BRD4 as a potential therapeutic target for patients with fibrotic complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BRD4_Mediates_a_Profibrotic_Response_in_Activated_HSCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous demonstration of genomic crosstalk between transcription factors determining the fibrotic response in myofibroblasts implicates regulatory enhancers as key genomic mediators in tissue fibrosis (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study suggests that selective manipulation of their activity could globally disarm the fibrotic gene network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that epigenetic pathways are important for the profibrotic response in myofibroblasts, particularly given their critical roles in determining cellular and tissue identity as well as modulating disease-relevant enhancer activity (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, an RNAi-based genetics screen implicated the BET family member BRD4 (9) as a potential regulator for the fibrotic response in LX-2 cells, a human-activated HSC cell line (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-mediated depletion of BRD4 resulted in a fourfold reduction of COL1A1 gene expression, a prominent ECM component of tissue fibrosis (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, depletion of BRD4 similarly reduced COL1A1 levels in the presence of TGF-1, a master profibrotic cytokine (2, 3) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore the role of BRD4 in fibrosis, we compared the effects of three structurally distinct BRD4 bromodomain inhibitors, JQ1 (9), I-BET-151 (11, 12), and PFI-1 (13), in profibrotic gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, all three inhibitors comprehensively suppress profibrotic gene expression, both in the absence and presence of TGF-1 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies demonstrate that BRD4 binds to the COL1A1 enhancer locus and this occupancy is significantly reduced by JQ1 treatment (Fig S1A), suggesting a direct role of BRD4 in modulating profibrotic gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to delineate the molecular mechanism linking BRD4 to the fibrotic gene network, we examined the genome-wide distribution of BRD4 binding relative to histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), an epigenetic mark for active enhancers using ChIP coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, BRD4 colocalizes with active enhancers marked by H3K27ac (Fig 1C), implying that BRD4 is involved in transcriptional regulation of profibrotic genes through regulatory enhancer elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further determined the changes in BRD4 binding at these enhancer regions in the absence or presence of the inhibitor, JQ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the resulting cistromes reveal that JQ1 treatment dramatically reduces BRD4 occupancy at these active enhancers (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer examination of the BRD4 binding sites revealed a significant enrichment in motifs for prominent profibrotic transcription factors such as ETS1 (14), SRF (15), SMAD3, and NF-B (16) (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all these factors have been shown to be closely involved in cellular proliferation as well as hepatic stellate cell activation, it is interesting to observe the great overlap between these factors and BRD4, implying the close relationship in hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent characterization of the genomic locations of these profibrotic transcription factors revealed  greater than 40% overlap with BRD4 sites, consistent with the de novo motif analyses (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology (GO) analyses of BRD4 putative target genes include the major profibrotic pathways such as focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, integrin signaling, smooth muscle contraction, PDGF signaling, NF-B signaling, and JNK/MAPK signaling (5, 17) (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that BRD4 plays critical roles in mediating profibrotic transcription factors to regulate the fibrotic gene network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BRD4_Inhibition_Blocks_HSC_Activation_into_Myofibroblasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intrinsic capability of BRD4 enhancers to control profibrotic gene expression prompted us to investigate their regulatory potential in myofibroblast activation using integrative chemical genetics and functional genomics in a conventional HSC-to-myofibroblast self-activation system (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in vitro spontaneous differentiation recapitulates the key cellular events such as wound healing, typical of stellate cell activation (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor gene expression changes during this transformation, mRNA-Seq was performed on quiescent primary HSCs (day 1, baseline) and during myofibroblast conversion (days 3 and 6) in the absence or presence of JQ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis identified  greater than 900 up-regulated genes during HSC activation, of which  greater than 400 are suppressed by JQ1 treatment (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene expression changes based on the highest magnitude of JQ1-mediated suppression showed that BRD4 regulates inducible gene expression during HSC activation (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further gene ontology analysis for the induced genes that are suppressed by JQ1 revealed that BRD4 facilitates the expression of a wide spectrum of biological processes and cellular components known to play critical roles in HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts and liver fibrosis (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include extracellular region, extracellular matrix, collagens, integrins, muscle contraction, and focal adhesion, consistent with the GO analysis of BRD4 target genes in LX-2 cells (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, JQ1 treatment during HSC activation to myofibroblasts represses the induction of key marker genes, including Col1a1, Acta2, Col1a2, and Des to near baseline levels (Fig 2A and Fig S2E), suggesting that BRD4 is essential for myofibroblast activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, JQ1 treatment of HSCs is sufficient to arrest the phenotypic changes associated with transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, JQ1-treated cells do not adopt the characteristic, fibroblast-like morphology induced by activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, JQ1 dramatically reduced the level of smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and significantly increased lipid content close to the level in quiescent cells (day 1) (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BRD4_Is_a_Critical_Mitogenic_Regulator_of_HSC_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pathological contributions of activated HSCs in liver fibrosis include not only the induction of profibrotic genes in individual cells, but the necessity of activated cells to proliferate to help repair tissue damage (4, 5, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the striking results on smooth muscle actin production in Fig 2A, we examined whether BRD4 inhibition would also inhibit HSC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, JQ1 exhibited significant antiproliferative activity against activated HSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out the possibilities that the effects resulted from increased apoptosis or cellular senescence, we performed TUNEL assay (Fig 3B and Fig S3A) and measured beta-galactosidase activity (Fig 3C and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that JQ1 inhibits cellular proliferation, supporting BRD4 as a mitogenic regulator in HSC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, JQ1 treatment significantly reduced BrdU incorporation into activated HSCs (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the inhibitory effect of JQ1 on cellular proliferation forces cells to enter quiescence stage; however, this needs to be further assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the prominence of PDGF signaling in myofibroblast mitogenicity (21) and our finding that the PDGF pathway is directly targeted by BRD4 enhancers (Fig S1B), we speculated that BRD4 functionally communicates with this pathway to regulate proliferation in activated HSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, JQ1 treatment selectively disrupted the induction of the key PDGF pathway component Pdgfrb as well as the downstream mitogenic target Ccnd1 (22) during HSC activation without perturbing Ccnd2 or Myc expression (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings were obtained in LX-2 cells (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the proposal that BRD4 not only controls profibrotic gene expression, but functions as a critical mitogenic regulator of myofibroblast activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BRD4_Inhibition_Is_Protective_Against_Liver_Fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of JQ1 to attenuate multiple facets of HSC activation led us to evaluate BRD4 inhibition as a potential pharmacological treatment for liver fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a standard carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mouse model of liver injury (Fig S5A), C57BL/6J mice develop extensive bridging fibrosis and substantial collagen deposits after 4 wk of CCl4 exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although JQ1 does not alter the extent of CCl4-induced liver injury, as assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (Fig S5B), cotreatment dramatically reduces the histological indicators of fibrosis, as well as HSC activation markers Col1a1, Acta2, Timp1, and Tgfb1 (Fig 4A and Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, JQ1 treatment in combination with CCl4 suppresses the induction of a network of key fibrotic marker genes in the liver (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HSC activation marker ACTA2 (Fig 4 C and G), Sirius red staining, hepatic hydroxyproline content (Fig 4 E and F), and histological fibrotic scoring (Ishak score, Fig 4D) are all significantly attenuated in JQ1-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

JQ1_Is_a_Potential_Therapeutic_for_Liver_Fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dramatic antifibrotic properties of JQ1 in vitro and in vivo led us to ask whether BRD4 inhibition could reverse liver fibrosis as an intervention therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, liver fibrosis was initiated in C57BL/6J mice by 3 wk of CCl4 exposure followed by CCl4/JQ1 cotreatment for an additional 3 wk (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the preexisting damage, JQ1 appears to reverse or at least prevent the further progression of liver fibrosis as determined by histological scoring, quantitation of Sirius red staining, hepatic hydroxyproline content, and profibrotic marker gene expression (Fig 5 BF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CCl4-induced HSC activation is dramatically reduced by JQ1 treatment, as measured by quantitative ACTA2 immunohistochemistry (Fig 5 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings demonstrate that small molecule-mediated bromodomain inhibition of BRD4 has the capability to ameliorate liver fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fibrosis is a complex disease, driven at the cellular level by activation of quiescent HSCs and characterized by the sustained induction of a fibrotic gene program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unabated fibrosis, such as with viral infection or fatty liver disease, eventually progresses to liver failure and results in the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that traditional antifibrotic therapies typically target single pathways, their limited clinical benefits are perhaps not surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite the recent FDA approval of pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) as first-line antifibrotic therapies, additional new therapies are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our recent study of genomic regulatory pathways critical for liver fibrogenesis identified the vitamin D receptor as a key mediator of liver maintenance and stellate cell activation (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work led us to explore the epigenetic foundation that underpins the switch between HSC activation and quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further screening analyses identified BRD4 as a potent driver of the fibrotic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment of BRD4 binding at the distal enhancer of profibrotic genes provides previously unidentified mechanistic insight into the injury response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the remarkable efficacy of the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 in preventing liver injury and reversing or limiting the progression of existing fibrosis is, in part, due to the enhanced sensitivity of BRD4-enhancer association to pharmacological intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, our studies on BRD4-mediated profibrotic enhancer activity identified intrinsic genomic and epigenetic mechanisms that can be exploited pharmaceutically to ameliorate liver fibrosis (Fig 5J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that myofibroblasts are a common pathological cell type underlying nearly all fibrotic diseases, targeting profibrotic enhancers through bromodomain inhibition may have clinical benefits in a wide variety of poorly controlled scarring responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Primary HSCs or LX-2 cells cultured on four-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, 154917) in the presence of DMSO (0.1%) or JQ1 (500 nM) were stained for senescence using a -galactosidase staining kit (Cell Signaling, 9860s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Droplet_Accumulation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary murine HSCs were seeded onto chamber slides (Nunc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After overnight attachment, cells were treated with DMSO or 500 nM JQ1 for another 5 d. Media were aspirated and cells were washed twice with PBS (Gibco) and fixed in 10% (vol/vol) buffered formalin at room temperature for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixative was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then stained with 1 g/mL 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene (BODIPY 493/503, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature, protected from light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dye was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS, then mounted using Vectastain mounting medium (Vector Labs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence was visualized through the GFP filter on a Leica DM5000B fluorescent microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear counterstaining was performed using DAPI (Vector).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary murine HSCs were seeded onto chamber slides (Nunc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After overnight attachment, cells were treated with DMSO or 500 nM JQ1 for another 5 d. Media were aspirated and cells were washed twice with PBS (Gibco) and fixed in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixative was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were then blocked with 3% BSA and incubated with rabbit anti-ACTA2 antibody (at 1:100 dilution; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing, the slides were incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (at 1:200 dilution; Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the slides were analyzed for fluorescence using an all-in-one type fluorescent microscope (BioZero BZ-9000; Keyence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear counterstaining was performed using DAPI (Vector).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liver samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following antigen retrieval with the target retrieval solution (Dako), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After immersion in diluted normal rabbit serum, the sections were sequentially incubated with rabbit anti-ACTA2 antibody (at 1:2,000 dilution; Abcam) for 1 h at 25 °C and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, followed by biotinylated enzyme-conjugated avidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color was developed by incubating the slides for several minutes with diaminobenzidine (Dojindo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterstaining was performed using Haematoxylin (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chromatin_Immunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LX-2 cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%) or JQ1 (500 nM) for 16 h. Cells were then harvested for ChIP assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental procedure for ChIP was as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after fixation, nuclei from LX-2 cells were isolated, lysed, and sheared with a Diagenode Bioruptor to yield DNA fragment sizes of 2001,000 bp followed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies listed below: ETS1 (Santa Cruz, sc-350), SRF (Santa Cruz, sc-335), NF-B (Santa Cruz, sc-372), SMAD3 (Abacm, ab28379), BRD2 (Bethyl, A302-583A), BRD3 (Bethyl, A310-859A), BRD4 (Bethyl, A301-985A) (1), PAF1 (Bethyl, A300-173A) (2), CDK9 (Santa Cruz, sc-484) (D0913), Pol II (Santa Cruz, sc-899) (C1413), Pol II S2p (Abcam, ab5095) (GR104063-1), and Pol II S5p (Abacm, ab5131) (GR104067-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP-Seq_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The procedure was as previously described (7, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, short DNA reads were demultiplexed using Illumina CASAVA v1.8.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were aligned against the human hg18 (NCBI Build 36.1) using the Bowtie aligner allowing up to two mismatches in the read.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only tags that map uniquely to the genome were considered for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent peak calling and motif analysis were conducted using HOMER, a software suite for ChIP-Seq analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methods for HOMER, which are described below, have been implemented and are freely available at biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One tag from each unique position was considered to eliminate peaks resulting from clonal amplification of fragments during the ChIP-Seq protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks were identified by searching for clusters of tags within a sliding 200-bp window, requiring adjacent clusters to be at least 1 kb away from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold for the number of tags that determine a valid peak was selected for a false discovery rate (FDR) of less_than0.01, as empirically determined by repeating the peak finding procedure using randomized tag positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks are required to have at least fourfold more tags (normalized to total count) than input or IgG control samples and fourfold more tags relative to the local background region (10 kb) to avoid identifying regions with genomic duplications or nonlocalized binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks are annotated to gene products by identifying the nearest RefSeq transcriptional start site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of ChIP-Seq results was achieved by uploading custom tracks onto the UCSC genome browser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data are presented as means ± SE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-tailed unpaired Students t test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferronis multiple comparison was used to determine the significance of difference between datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences were considered statistically significant when P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
