title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure of a prereaction complex between the nerve agent sarin, its biological target acetylcholinesterase, and the antidote HI-6  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enzymatic reactions can be difficult to study using X-ray crystallography, because conformations and reacting species are temporally and spatially averaged, and many reactions proceed to completion before intermediates can be trapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the combined use of diffusion trap cryocrystallography, density functional theory calculations, and kinetic measurements to investigate the reactivation of the essential cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase by the nerve agent antidote HI-6 after covalent inhibition by the nerve agent sarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have determined prereaction conformations of HI-6 and propose that the reactivating cleavage of the enzymesarin bond is preceded by a change in the sarin adducts binding pose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures presented in this work will facilitate additional mechanistic analysis and the development of novel antidotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organophosphorus nerve agents interfere with cholinergic signaling by covalently binding to the active site of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inhibition causes an accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, potentially leading to overstimulation of the nervous system and death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current treatments include the use of antidotes that promote the release of functional AChE by an unknown reactivation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used diffusion trap cryocrystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine and analyze prereaction conformers of the nerve agent antidote HI-6 in complex with Mus musculus AChE covalently inhibited by the nerve agent sarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses reveal previously unknown conformations of the system and suggest that the cleavage of the covalent enzymesarin bond is preceded by a conformational change in the sarin adduct itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with data from the reactivation kinetics, this alternate conformation suggests a key interaction between Glu202 and the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, solvent kinetic isotope effect experiments using deuterium oxide reveal that the reactivation mechanism features an isotope-sensitive step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insights into the reactivation mechanism and provide a starting point for the development of improved antidotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work also illustrates how DFT calculations can guide the interpretation, analysis, and validation of crystallographic data for challenging reactive systems with complex conformational dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A) The catalytic S203 (blue) of mAChE is phosphonylated by sarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adduct is reactive and can undergo multiple chemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The nerve agent reactivator HI-6 binds close to the adduct in (C) the deep, narrow, and highly aromatic active site gorge of mAChE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) In previous crystal structures (PDB ID code 2WHP), the O-isopropyl of the sarin adduct sterically shields the phosphorus, and the electron density maps do not define the position or conformation of the nucleophilic oxime moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus are shown in red, blue, and orange, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Capturing_Low-Energy_Intermediates_Using_a_Diffusion_Trap_Strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reactivation in the crystalline state was investigated in multiple time-dependent soaking experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HI-6 antidote was allowed to diffuse into mAChE crystals pretreated with sarin during an incubation period of 1, 2, 3, or 4 min, which was followed by rapid vitrification to trap the conformational states of the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progress of the reactivation reaction was visualized using electron density maps (specifically, simulated annealing Fo  Fc omit maps), which showed a time-dependent decrease in the intensity around the sarin adduct (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that HI-6assisted reactivation occurs in the crystalline state at a timescale that can be captured by the diffusion trap experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To improve the sampling of the system and capture prereaction conformational states, we performed over 80 soaking experiments using an HI-6 incubation time of 3 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent diffraction experiments yielded nine refined crystal structures with resolutions ranging from 2.2 to 2.7 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems chemical and structural complexity was clearly shown by the feature-rich electron density maps of nine datasets, which show a common principal density representing the scaffold of HI-6 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, each of the nine electron density maps had unique features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest were two datasets showing interconnected electron density maps corresponding to HI-6 and the sarin adductwe postulated that the interconnection might make it possible to model the previously missing HI-6 oxime moiety in the 2WHP structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One dataset was selected for additional refinement (resolution of 2.4 Å) (Fig 2C and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were amenable to conventional crystallographic refinement, generating an initial model (3minHI-6sarinmAChE) with a superficially acceptable fit to the electron density map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the electron density corresponding to the sarin adduct was weak and partly absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak electron density is likely a consequence of a reduced occupancy because of partial reactivation (Fig 2A), partial aging with loss of the O-isopropyl chain (Fig 1A), and/or spatial averaging because of conformational dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the data suggest that sarin is bound to Ser203, the electron density maps were considered too weak to allow reliable crystallographic refinement of the adduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the entire HI-6 molecule was defined by electron density, with the E and Z isomers of the oxime having similar fits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the initial refinement of 3minHI-6sarinmAChE, the occupancy was set to 0.3 and 1.0 for sarin and HI-6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the density defining HI-6 and the sarin adduct, there were unaccounted positive difference peaks, especially close to the indole ring of Trp86.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite efforts to model all of the features observed in the active site, the identities of several positive difference peaks remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ambiguity is probably because of the temporal and spatial averaging of the system, some of which is attributable to the reactivation reaction (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the features observed in the vicinity of the indole ring of Trp86 indicate the presence of a ligand, possibly combined with conformational mobility of one or several side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features were more pronounced in the B monomer, revealing an unproductive conformer of the system in which HI-6 is nearly parallel to the indole ring of Trp86 (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to model the reactivation product, the phosphonylated HI-6, yielded inconclusive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a reference, the half-life of phosphonylated HI-6 is short, probably less than 1 s (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the timescale of this experiment is not suitable for trapping the phosphonylated HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other previously reported conformations and/or conjugation states that were considered during the refinement are shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Refinement_of_Low-Occupancy_Conformers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the limitations of conventional crystallographic refinement of low-occupancy conformers, we used a quantum chemical cluster approach (14, 15, 17, 18) using DFT to optimize the positions of heavy atoms (with hydrogens added where necessary) in key fragments of the 3minHI-6sarinmAChE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To preserve the milieu of the protein interior, while reducing the number of atoms to a level compatible with quantum mechanical calculations, all atoms beyond the 3minHI-6sarinmAChE interface were disregarded or prevented from moving during optimization by fixing their coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected atoms in the vicinity of the sarin adduct (5859 atoms) were allowed to move during these optimizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3minHI-6sarinmAChE systems comprising 280281 atoms in total were optimized using DFT (Table S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting atomic coordinates were visually compared with the experimentally determined electron densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a final structure of the complex, the DFT optimizations were integrated with the crystallographic refinements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several alternative systems with different coordinates and protonation states for atoms with positions that could not be unambiguously determined from the electron densities of the initial crystallographic model were subjected to DFT geometry optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformations obtained by DFT were then used as input coordinates in a second round of crystallographic refinement processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By iteratively performing DFT optimizations and crystallographic refinements in this way, a model was obtained that both converged in the DFT optimizations and was consistent with the experimental electron density maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deposited crystal structure (PDB ID code 5FPP) was generated in the final set of crystallographic refinements and includes both the E and Z isomers of the oxime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plausible_Near-Attack_Conformation_of_HI-6_and_a_Previously_Undescribed_Conformation_of_Sarin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final structure generated by DFT calculations and crystallographic refinements includes a previously undescribed conformation of the sarin adduct featuring an interaction between the isopropyl moiety of sarin and the oxygens of Glu202 (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sarin conformation provides space around the phosphorus atom, which is thus exposed to both isomers of the HI-6 oxime (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen of the E isomer is within van der Waals contact distance (3.3 Å) of the sarin phosphorus atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carboxy amino-substituted pyridinium ring of HI-6 forms a sandwich with the arenes of Tyr124 and Trp286 similar to that described previously (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Key interactions involving HI-6 and/or the sarin adduct in the active site were investigated by computing the gas-phase interaction energies (Egas) of suitable fragment systems using dispersion-corrected DFT (Fig 3D and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions between the sarin adduct and the E- and Z-oxime isomers were attractive; both isomers yielded similar interaction energies, regardless of their protonation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations also indicated that, for the studied fragments, the protonated forms of the oxime were energetically more favorable than the deprotonated forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions formed by the Ser203sarin conjugate to Glu202 were also attractive, with interaction energies between 16.0 and 14.2 kcal/mol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformation of the sarin adduct seems to be stabilized by a nonclassical CH···O hydrogen bond formed between the isopropyl of sarin and the carboxylic acid of Glu202, with an interaction energy of 7 kcal/mol (Fig S3 and S4 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction strength of the CH···O hydrogen bond is in accordance with the energy of previous identified nonclassical hydrogen bonds in AChEligand complexes (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previously determined binary and ternary structures of mAChE phosphonylated by sarin, the O-isopropyl moiety of the sarin adduct was aligned along the axis of the active site gorge in a conformation that sterically shielded the sarin phosphorus against nucleophilic attack by the antidote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the structure presented here, the side chain of Glu202 did not interact directly with the sarin moiety; instead, it was coordinated to a water molecule that acted as a bridge between Glu202 and the sarin O2 atom (6, 10, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the sarin adducts conformation, we determined the structure of the binary complex formed by sarin and Homo sapiens acetylcholinesterase (hAChE; sarinhAChE), which has a different space group than mAChE (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A superposition of sarinhAChE and sarinmAChE showed that the O-isopropyl group is positioned in a way that shields the phosphorus atom in both crystal forms, suggesting that the shielding conformation is a preferred conformer rather than merely being induced by crystal packing effects (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reactivation_Kinetics_Measurements_Show_the_Importance_of_Glu202_and_Reveal_a_Hydrogen_Transfer_Step  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clarify the role of Glu202 in the context of reactivation, the structure and interaction energy calculations were complemented with kinetic studies on HI-6s ability to reactivate AChE phosphonylated by sarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of the reactivation kinetics of WT- and Glu202Asn-substituted mouse and human AChE showed that the mutation caused a 39- to 77-fold reduction of the reactivation rate in both the human and mouse enzymes (Fig 4A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the binding affinity of HI-6 to the phosphonylated enzyme was only marginally reduced by the mutation (1.1- to 2.6-fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large reduction in the reactivation rate and the negligible effect on the binding affinity support our finding that Glu202 has a key role in the reactivation process but little effect on the binding of HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results are consistent with the structure and interaction energy calculations, which suggested that Glu202 stabilizes the O-isopropyl moiety of the sarin adduct in a conformation that enables nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu202 has previously been reported as a key residue of AChE with an important role in catalysis (21), phosphylation (22), and aging (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we also observed, in addition to the interaction with the O-isopropyl moiety, an interaction between Glu202 and the methylene of Ser203 with an interaction energy of 7 kcal/mol (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the reaction, its solvent kinetic isotope effect was measured in H2O and D2O using WT human AChE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a transfer of one or more protons occurs in the rate-limiting step, the reaction rate in D2O will be lower than in H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both solvents will yield similar rates if the reaction only requires the complex to be in a particular protonation state (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4B, the rate in D2O was lower than in H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the reactions pH optimum is 7.0, but its pD optimum is 8.0 (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shifts in this direction are commonly observed for enzymatic reactions and reflect the difference between deuterium and protium ionization (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Binding_Poses_During_HI-6Assisted_Reactivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural and kinetic data for the 3minHI-6sarinmAChE complex presented herein suggest a prereaction complex that agree with previously reported reactivation kinetics of site-directed mutants (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 and references therein) (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in conjunction with the previously reported structures, the prereaction complex makes it possible to identify many of the chemical species and conformational changes that are involved in the reactivation cycle (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The substrate of HI-6 is represented by the binary crystal structure of AChE inhibited by sarin (sarinmAChE and sarinhAChE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these structures, the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin is directed toward the indole ring of Trp86 and interacts with Glu202 through a bridging interaction with a conserved water molecule (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pose is the preferred conformation of the sarin adduct in the crystal structures of both the human and mouse enzymes (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The complex formed by the initial binding of HI-6 to the binary complex is assumed to correspond to the structure determined after 1 min of incubation in HI-6 (1minHI-6sarinmAChE; PDB ID code 2WHP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding pose of the sarin adduct in this ternary complex is very similar to that of the binary complex: it retains the bridging water molecule between Glu202 and the sarin moiety, and the systems coordination is largely unaffected by the binding of HI-6 (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a significant change in the conformation and position of Trp286 that allows the nonreactive carboxyamino-substituted pyridinium ring of HI-6 to form a sandwich with the arenes of Tyr124 and Trp286.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformation of Trp286 is equivalent to the pose observed in the binary HI-6mAChE (PDB ID code 2GYU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another striking feature of the structure collected after a 1-min soak is its partially disordered electron density map, which suggests that the oxime-pyridinium of HI-6 is highly mobile, a conclusion also supported by molecular dynamics simulations (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure determined from data collected after a 3-min incubation (3minHI-6sarinmAChE; PDB ID code 5FPP) and DFT calculations suggests that the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin undergoes a conformational change and forms a direct stabilizing interaction with Glu202, displacing the bridging water molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the oxime moiety is positioned apically within contact distance of the sarin phosphorus atom, oriented in a way that is consistent with a nucleophilic inline attack, although other mechanisms may be possible (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of the asymmetric units B monomer reveals a potential additional binding site for HI-6 close to Trp86 (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, arene stacking interactions with Trp86 in this structure would place the nucleophile in an unfavorable position for reaction, and therefore, it probably represents an unproductive HI-6 binding pose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proposed scheme implies that the carboxylic acid of Glu202 acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor that stabilizes the sarin O-isopropyl moiety through a CHO hydrogen bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics measurements indicate that the Glu202Asn substitution reduces the rate constant of the reactivation reaction by a factor of 3080 but has only a marginal effect on the dissociation constant (Fig 4A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant reduction of the rate constant supports the hypothesis that Glu202 stabilizes the adduct in an oxime-accessible conformation, whereas the small effect on the dissociation constant indicates that Glu202 does not directly influence the binding of HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with the 3minHI-6sarinmAChE structure and earlier studies of Glu202 substitutions (25, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously suggested that His447 and a water molecule activate the oxime by a hydrogen transfer mechanism to generate a deprotonated species that is presumed to attack the phosphorus atom (6, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposal has been challenged by kinetics data, which suggested that the oxime binds in its deprotonated form (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential transfer of a hydrogen was investigated by measuring the solvent kinetic isotope effect during HI-6assisted reactivation of AChE inhibited by sarin (Fig 4B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the rate constants in H2O and D2O (Hkr/Dkr) was 3.1, indicating that a hydrogen transfer occurs close to the rate-limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most likely acceptor is His447, possibly assisted by a water molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presented reactivation cycle (Fig 5) shows multiple structurally distinct conformations that call for a review and maybe an expansion of the currently used kinetic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it opens up for new approaches in computational design of new antidotes, including attempts to shift the equilibrium to favor productive prereactive conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent advances in methods for preserving and analyzing conformational ensembles together with computational approaches for extracting alternative protein and ligand conformations have made it possible to use X-ray crystallography to investigate rare conformations and molecular motions (12, 13, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have combined diffusion trap cryocrystallography and DFT calculations to generate and analyze crystallographic data for a system comprising the nerve agent sarin, its biological target AChE, and the therapeutic antidote HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system is inherently complex and challenging to study using conventional crystallographic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a structure that is consistent with our DFT calculations and the reactivation kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure shows a previously unknown conformation of the sarin adduct that allows the nucleophilic oxime moiety of HI-6 to approach and bind close to the sarin adducts phosphorus atom, with the carboxylic group of Glu202 stabilizing the adduct in the oxime-accessible conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of this interaction is supported by a Glu202Asn substitution that reduces the rate of reactivation by factors of 39 and 77 in mAChE and hAChE, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solvent isotope effect measurements show a decreased reaction rate and an increase in pL optimum (L = D or H) when H2O is exchanged for D2O, suggesting that a hydrogen transfer occurs close to the rate-limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As illustrated herein, the integration of DFT calculations with X-ray crystallography is a powerful combination that provides unexplored possibilities for computational chemistry and structural biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of techniques allowed us to determine a structure that may provide a starting point for analysis of reaction pathways and structure-based design of improved nerve agent antidotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

mAChE and hAChE were expressed in HEK293F cells and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein crystallization was done by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HI-6sarinmAChE complexes were generated using a diffusion trap approach, and data were collected at beamlines I911-3 and I911-2 at Max Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial crystallographic refinement was performed using conventional methods, whereas the late-stage refinement included DFT geometry optimizations, focusing on areas within the active site that showed ambiguous electron density maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All-atom protein models were prepared from the X-ray coordinates of 3minHI-6sarinmAChE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems were thereafter reduced, and a chemical cluster approach (14, 15, 17, 18) was adopted, where subsets of the atoms were fully flexible during geometry optimization using implicitly dispersion-corrected DFT [M06-2X (33) /631G**].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After additional reduction of the systems, interaction energies (Egas) were calculated around selected fragments (molecule pairs) using BLYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations were run at the High Performance Computing Center North (www.hpc2n.umu.se).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

WT and mutant AChE derived from Mus musculus and Homo sapiens was expressed using HEK293F cells (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mAChE protein was purified and crystallized as previously reported (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For crystallographic studies, a gene encoding human AChE (hAChE) was designed according to a previous report (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genes codon use was optimized, after which it was synthesized and incorporated into a pD603 vector (DNA2.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting construct was transfected into adherent HEK293F cells maintained in DMEM, Glutamax-I, 4.5 g/L d-glucose, and 25 mM Hepes-Pyruvate (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS (Biochrome) and 50 µg/mL Gentamicin (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 wk of incubation in media supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL Geneticin (Gibco), 174 individual clones were selected and expanded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of hAChE secretion by different clones was evaluated using the Ellman assay (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clone with the highest expression was expanded in suspension using Freestyle 293 and Glutamax (Gibco) media containing 20 µg/mL Gentamicin (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before purification, the supernatant was centrifuged at 11,200 × g for 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleared supernatant was subsequently loaded on an HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) column and washed with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6 and 0.5 M NaCl, after which the purified hAChE was eluted in a buffer composed of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 M NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dialysis against 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole, the hexahistidine tag was cleaved with Tobacco Etch Virus protease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0 and 10 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with a well solution composed of 12% (wt/vol) PEG 3350 and 0.24 M KNO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystals used for structure determination were generated using the streak seeding method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binary complex between hAChE and sarin was generated as previously reported (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ternary complexes between sarin, HI-6, and mAChE were generated using a diffusion trap approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A soaking solution, termed OX buffer, was prepared by dissolving 1020 mg HI-6 in 500 L 28% (vol/vol) PEG 750 monomethylether, 100 mM Hepes at a pH of 7.0 (termed X buffer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stock solution was stored in liquid nitrogen and subsequently used for all soaking and control experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were first allowed to slowly equilibrate in X buffer at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X buffer supplemented with 2 mM sarin was then added to the equilibrated crystals in 10 portions of 1 µL over a period of 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete inhibition by sarin under these conditions was verified by determining the binary crystal structure of sarinmAChE without any addition of HI-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure is available from the PDB (PDB ID code 2Y2V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min of incubation with sarin, the crystals were transferred to 24 µL OX buffer and incubated for 14 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All soakings were terminated by flash-freezing of the crystal in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction data were obtained at the MAXlab Synchrotron at beamlines I911-2, I911-3, and I911-5 on MAR Research CCD or Marmosaic 225 (Rayonix) detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity data were indexed and integrated with XDS and scaled using Scala (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 80 crystal-soaking attempts, 9 yielded datasets of sufficient quality to justify additional analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures were solved by difference Fourier methods using Refmac (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent crystallographic refinement and manual rebuilding were carried out using the Phenix software suite and COOT (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordinates of the active site ligands HI-6 and sarin were modeled according to the 2|Fo|  |Fc| and |Fo|  |Fc| maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angles and bonds for atoms bound to the phosphorous atom as well as for HI-6 were determined by geometric optimization using the eLBOW AM1 algorithm as implemented in phenix.elbow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulated annealing omit electron density maps were used for analysis and model building of the structural data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates and reflection files not locally available were downloaded from the PDB (www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates for appropriate atoms (typically the sarin adduct and HI-6) were subsequently removed from the coordinate file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three cycles of simulated annealing were performed using the phenix.refine software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The |Fo|  |Fc| (FCFOFCWT/PHFOFCWT) maps were calculated and/or superposed using the Calculate maps and Superpose maps software (Phenix program suite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final rounds of refinement of the ternary complexs structure were performed with the assistance of DFT calculations (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional information about the binary complex between hAChE and sarin is given in Fig S5.

The protein preparation wizard implemented in Maestro (43) was used to prepare all-atom protein models starting from the X-ray coordinates of 3minHI-6sarinmAChE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preparation involved adding missing hydrogen atoms, creating disulfide bonds, capping termini, and removing all atoms other than the A monomer, the ligand, and water molecules within 5 Å of the remaining heavy atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where required, missing side chains were added using Prime (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protonation states of HI-6 and the Glu334 and His447 residues were set manually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrogen atoms were fully energy minimized in gas phase using the MMFF94s force field (45, 46) as implemented in MacroModel (47), whereas all heavy atoms were allowed to deviate by up to 0.2 Å from their initial positions before a force of 100 kcal/mol Å2 was applied (i.e., constrained energy minimization was performed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems were thereafter reduced according to the information in Tables S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where the systems were cut, the broken bonds were replaced with hydrogen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The added hydrogen atoms were energy-minimized in the gas phase using the MMFF94s force field (45, 46) in MacroModel (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A chemical cluster approach (17, 18) was adopted where subsets of the atoms (5859 atoms) of the reduced systems (280281 atoms) were fully flexible during geometry optimizations, whereas remaining atoms were fixed at the x, y, and z coordinates obtained from the constrained force field minimization (Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry optimizations were performed using the DFT hybrid functional M06-2X (33) with the 631G** basis set as implemented in Jaguar (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fine-grid density option was used, and SCF calculations were run at the accurate level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct inversion of the iterative subspace was used to achieve convergence, with the maximum number of SCF iterations set to 48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy and rms density matrix change values were set to 5·105 and 5·106 hartrees, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting atomic coordinates were manually inspected to be in agreement with the experimentally determined electron densities (i.e., by assessing their compatibility with calculated omit maps and generating new electron density maps based on the optimized geometries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations were run at the High Performance Computing Center North.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3minHI-6sarinmAChE systems, geometry-optimized using the chemical cluster approach, were further reduced centered around selected fragments (molecule pairs) for which interaction energies were calculated (mapped interactions are shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronic interaction energies (Egas) of fragments representing the E and Z isomers and the sarin adduct as well as Ser203sarin and Glu202 were calculated according to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1:Egas=E(complex)E(protein)E(ligand).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]E(complex) corresponds to the electronic energy of the acceptordonor fragment, E(protein) is the acceptor monomer, and E(ligand) is the donor monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronic interaction energies were calculated using the BLYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional calculations were performed to approximate the contributions from Ser203 and the sarin adduct to the overall Ser203sarin···Glu202 interaction energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction energies could be approximated by manually altering the dihedral angle to move the substituent to be disregarded away from Glu202, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms were fixed (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are presented in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The role of Glu202 was investigated by introducing Asn substitutions in hAChE and mAChE using the previously reported method (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HI-6 dichloride monohydrate ( greater than 95% by 1H NMR) was provided by John Clement (Defense Research Establishment Suffield, Ralston, AB, Canada).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5,5-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCh) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other chemicals were from Merck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sarin stock solutions were prepared in acetonitrile or dichloromethane and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HI-6 stock solutions were prepared in distilled water or D2O [99.9% (vol/vol)] and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Working solutions were appropriately diluted in distilled water or D2O just before the experiment and kept on ice until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All solutions were prepared either in H2O or D2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AChE activities were measured with a modified Ellman assay (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reactivation kinetics measurements on WT and Glu202Asn AChE, 1 mM ATCh was used as a substrate, and 0.2 mM DTNB was used as a chromogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measurements of the solvent isotope effect, the substrate (ATCh) concentration was 0.45 mM, and the chromogen concentration (DTNB) was 0.3 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All activity measurements were performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a temperature of 30 °C (for analyses of mutants) or 37 °C (for measurements of the solvent isotope effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All quoted concentrations are final concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified AChE was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with a large molar excess of sarin (20 nM) to achieve  greater than 95% inhibition of AChE activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the instability of sarin in phosphate buffer, no residual inhibitor could be found after incubation of inhibited and native AChE which was verified by incubating untreated control samples with treated samples (30 min at 37 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots were stored at 80 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibited AChE was incubated with HI-6 at t = 0 to initiate the reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measurements in D2O, the pH was adjusted according to the formula pD = pH + 0.41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After specified time intervals, aliquots were transferred to tempered cuvettes containing phosphate buffer and DTNB to measure AChE activity after the addition of ATCh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least five different oxime concentrations were used to determine the reactivation rate constants in duplicate experiments (n = 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activities of OP-inhibited AChE and AChE activity after time-dependent reactivation were evaluated with reference to the activity of uninhibited WT AChE, and the resulting figures were used to compute the degree of reactivation as a percentage:[EP]+[OX]Kd[EPOX]kr[E]+[POX].The reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE by oximes can be described by a two-step reaction (Scheme S1) and quantified by determining the appropriate reactivation rate constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scheme is the OP-inhibited AChE ([EP]), the oxime ([OX]), the Michaelis type OPAChEoxime conjugate ([EPOX]), the reactivated enzyme ([E]), and the phosphonylated oxime ([POX]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kd stands for the apparent dissociation constant, which is inversely proportional to the oximes affinity for [EP]; kr is the rate constant for the removal of the [OP] residue from [EPOX] by the oxime and thus, quantifies the conjugates reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hybrid reactivation rate constant kr2 was calculated from the ratio of kr and Kd and resembles a second-order rate constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cases where complete reactivation is achieved and [OX]  greater than  greater than  [EP]0, a pseudofirst-order rate equation can be derived for the reactivation process (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2):kobs=kr×[OX]Kd+[OX].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]kobs was computed by regression analysis using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3:vt=v0×(1ekobs×t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Finally, kr and Kd were obtained from the nonlinear fit of the relationship between kobs and [OX], and kr2 was calculated from the ratio of kr and Kd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental data used to determine the different kinetic constants were processed by nonlinear regression analysis conducted using curve-fitting programs provided by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual datasets were analyzed to obtain kobs, and these constants were used to compute kr, Kd, and kr2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
