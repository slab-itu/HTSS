Lignin engineering in field-grown poplar trees affects the endosphere bacterial microbiome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The composition of bacterial populations in the human digestive tract is known to affect our well-being, to influence our ability to overcome diseases, and to be tightly linked with the host genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the extent to which variation in the plant genotype affects the associated bacteria and, hence, plant health and productivity remains unknown, particularly of field-grown plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically modified poplars, down-regulated for cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, substantially influence the microbiome of the plant endosphere without perceptible impact on the rhizosphere microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unraveling the host genotype-dependent plantmicrobe associations is crucial to comprehend the effects of engineering the plant metabolic pathway and possibly to exploit the eukaryoteprokaryote associations in phytoremediation applications, sustainable crop production, and the production of secondary metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), an enzyme central to the lignin biosynthetic pathway, represents a promising biotechnological target to reduce lignin levels and to improve the commercial viability of lignocellulosic biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, silencing of the CCR gene results in considerable flux changes of the general and monolignol-specific lignin pathways, ultimately leading to the accumulation of various extractable phenolic compounds in the xylem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluated host genotype-dependent effects of field-grown, CCR-down-regulated poplar trees (Populus tremula × Populus alba) on the bacterial rhizosphere microbiome and the endosphere microbiome, namely the microbiota present in roots, stems, and leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant-associated bacteria were isolated from all plant compartments by selective isolation and enrichment techniques with specific phenolic carbon sources (such as ferulic acid) that are up-regulated in CCR-deficient poplar trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial microbiomes present in the endosphere were highly responsive to the CCR-deficient poplar genotype with remarkably different metabolic capacities and associated community structures compared with the WT trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the rhizosphere microbiome of CCR-deficient and WT poplar trees featured highly overlapping bacterial community structures and metabolic capacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the host genotype modulation of the plant microbiome by minute genetic variations in the plant genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, these interactions need to be taken into consideration to understand the full consequences of plant metabolic pathway engineering and its relation with the environment and the intended genetic improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collection_and_Processing_of_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT and CCR-deficient (CCR) field-grown poplar (P. tremula × P. alba cv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7171-B4) trees (15) were sampled in October 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sampled poplar trees were part of a field trial planted (May 2009) in a randomized block design (density = 15,000 trees per ha, interplant distance = 0.75 m) (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were collected from four compartments (number of individual trees sampled: nWT = 12 and nCCR = 12): rhizosphere soil (strictly defined as soil particles attached to the roots) and root, stem, and leaf compartments defined as plant tissues depleted of soil particles and epiphytic bacteria by sequential washing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nonselective_and_Selective_Isolation_of_Bacterial_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, to compare the total number of bacterial cells, we isolated them from the rhizosphere soil and surface-sterilized plant compartments of WT and CCR poplar trees with a nonselective approach on nutrient medium (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cell counts (cfus per g) were highly comparable between WT and CCR poplars across all compartments, indicating that the CCR gene silencing had no major effect on the rhizospheric and endophytic colonizations and on the stable establishment of bacterial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, within each genotype, the abundance of the bacterial cells (cfus per g) consistently decreased from the rhizosphere soil over the root to the stem, implying a normal colonization pattern of plant-associated bacteria (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil-residing bacteria initially colonize the rhizosphere and rhizoplane, largely driven by chemoattraction to rhizodeposits (carbohydrates, amino acids, root cap border cells, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that are released into the root zone by the host plant (8, 2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following rhizosphere and rhizoplane colonization, only certain soil-borne bacteria can, through passive or active mechanisms, cross physical barriers (such as endodermis and pericycle) to reach the xylem vessels and further colonize the roots, stems, and leaves (8, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial cell count was slightly (not significantly) higher in the leaves than in the stems, most probably attributable to endophytic colonization via the stomata (Fig 1A) (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To link the influence of the CCR gene silencing and resulting changes in the poplar xylem composition with modifications in the metabolic capacities of the bacterial communities, we selectively isolated bacterial cells from all four compartments (WT and CCR trees) by using specific phenylpropanoids (ferulic acid, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid) as sole carbon sources in the nutrient medium (Fig 1 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferulic and sinapic acids, and derivatives thereof, had previously been shown to be up-regulated in the CCR poplar (17) and ferulic acid to be even incorporated into the lignin polymer (17, 18, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the nonselective approach, the bacterial cell counts were higher in CCR poplar than those in the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in bacterial cell counts between genotypes were exclusively found inside the plant (root, stem, and leaf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the rhizosphere soil, pairwise comparison of bacterial cell counts between genotypes revealed highly comparable bacterial abundances across the various phenolic carbon sources, indicating that the host genotype has a profound effect on the metabolic capacities present in the endophytic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity to degrade specific phenolic carbon sources was clearly enhanced in the endosphere of the CCR poplar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the most pronounced differences occurred with ferulic acid as sole carbon source, of which increased levels had previously been identified in CCR-deficient genotypes (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selective_Enrichment_of_Bacterial_Cells__Cell_Counts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, we selectively enriched bacterial cells (ferulic acid as carbon source, 36 d of incubation) from the rhizosphere soil and surface-sterilized plant tissues of WT and CCR poplar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined bacterial cell counts (cfus per g) (Fig 2A) as well as the bacterial community structures (16S rRNA Sanger sequencing) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the selective isolation from the rhizosphere soil, highly similar numbers of bacterial cells (cfus per g ± SD) were obtained from the CCR poplars (8.33 × 107 ± 1.44 × 107) compared with the WT (9.16 × 107 ± 1.93 × 107) (P = 0.613), but bacterial abundances inside roots (P = 0.0011), stems (P less_than 0.001), and leaves (P less_than 0.001) of CCR trees were consistently higher (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, this result indicates that CCR gene silencing and the ensuing changes in xylem composition drive the metabolic abilities present in the endosphere toward an increased degradation potential for specific phenolics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we observed considerably more variation in the bacterial cell counts from the CCR trees than in those from the WT (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy can be attributed to variation among the genotypes in the levels of gene silencing that are reflected by different intensities of the red-brown xylem coloration associated with CCR down-regulation and the related variation in the xylem composition (17, 18), thereby potentially influencing the plant-associated bacterial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selective_Enrichment_of_Bacterial_Cells__Species_Composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare species composition within the different sampled compartments and genotypes, we grouped all isolated bacterial strains based on their morphology to create provisional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were validated with full-length 16S-rRNA Sanger sequencing and we determined abundance data (cell counts) for each bacterial OTU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OTU abundance data were square-root-transformed and similarities were displayed with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with BrayCurtis distances (26, 27) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both genotypes, NMDS analyses revealed strong clustering of the bacterial communities according to the different compartments (rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To statistically support the visual clustering of the bacterial communities in the NMDS analyses, we compared the different compartments by means of permutation-based hypothesis tests: analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), an analog of univariate ANOVA, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All compartments rendered microbiota significantly dissimilar from each other (P less_than 0.001) (Fig 2B and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each plant compartment represents a unique ecological niche with specific available nutrients (10), an active systemic colonization originating from the rhizosphere, and a resulting endophytic competence limited to specific strains (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbiome niche differentiation at the rhizosphere soilroot interface has been reported previously (10, 2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the influence of the host genotype on the bacterial communities, we compared the genotypes pairwise within each compartment by means of NMDS with BrayCurtis distances (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the rhizosphere soil, bacterial communities showed no relevant clustering according to the genotype as visually apparent by the NMDS analysis (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ANOSIM and adonis statistically confirmed that the bacterial communities of both genotypes were highly comparable within the rhizosphere (ANOSIM: R less_than 0.01, P = 0.40; adonis: P = 0.43) (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in agreement with the report in which transgenic poplar lines modified in lignin biosynthesis normally formed ectomycorrhiza (EM) and in which variations in the EM community structure between the different transgenic poplar lines were similar to variations in commercial poplar hybrids (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, colonization by arbuscular mycorrhiza or other fungi was not altered in barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutants at a lignin production-influencing locus rob1 (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to the rhizosphere soil, the poplar genotypes differed significantly in the endosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these differences were highly consistent throughout the various plant compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMDS analyses and permutation-based hypothesis tests of the bacterial communities in the roots, stems, and leaves revealed strong clustering according to the genotype (Fig 2C and Fig S3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clustering according to genotype was the most pronounced in the stems, where no visual overlap between the bacterial communities was seen (ANOSIM: R = 0.51, P less_than 0.01; adonis: P less_than 0.01) (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the lignification process is the highest in the stem xylem (13), the most distinct effects of CCR gene silencing and changes in xylem composition are expected to occur in the stems (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, lumen colonization of xylem vessels by bacterial endophytes has been reported as a route for bacterial dispersal to vegetative plant parts, ensuring direct contact between endophytes and nutrients available in xylem cells (7, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In roots and leaves, the clustering according to genotype persisted with small visual overlaps between WT and CCR poplar trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairwise statistical analyses of the genotypes in roots and leaves confirmed the significance of the visually observed differences with NMDS at the 95% significance level (Fig S3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selective_Enrichment_of_Bacterial_Cells__Univariate_Ecological_Measures_and_SpeciesGenotype_Association_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we calculated OTU richness (Margaleff), evenness (ShannonWiener), and diversity (inverse Simpson) within each compartment and genotype based on OTU abundance (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all ecological indices, the average values were highly similar between WT and CCR poplar trees in the rhizosphere soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the endosphere, OTU richness, evenness, and diversity were consistently lower in CCR trees than those in the WT, except for the OTU richness in the leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High variation in the indices reduced the significance of the results, but borderline significant differences were found for the OTU evenness in roots (P = 0.095) and stems (P = 0.075).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairwise comparison of the total endophytic evenness (calculated as the average of roots, stems, and leaves) between WT and CCR poplar trees revealed a significant decrease in the total endophytic evenness (P = 0.023) of the CCR-deficient trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain the bacterial species responsible for the observed community differentiation in the endosphere of poplar, we used a speciesgenotype association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associations were calculated with the DufreneLegendre indicator species analysis routine (Indval, indicator value) in R (Table S2) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a significant association in roots (R = 0.85, P less_than 0.01) and stems (R = 0.98, P less_than 0.01) of the CCR trees for Pseudomonas putida, which is known for its diverse metabolic capacities and adaptation to various ecological niches, including the ability to thrive in soils and sediments with high concentrations of toxic metals and complex organic contaminants (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. putida strains are routinely found as plant growth-promoting rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria (34, 35) and several degradation pathways have been elucidated in P. putida for lignin-derived low-molecular-weight compounds (such as the ferulate catabolic pathway) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundance of P. putida in roots and stems was 26.3% and 75.9%, respectively (Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective pressure exerted by the host genotype, specifically changes in the accessible carbon and energy sources (up to 2.8-fold increase in soluble phenolics) in the xylem as a consequence of CCR gene silencing (17) yielded endophytic bacteria more adapted to degrade complex phenolic compounds, such as P. putida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Analyses__Ferulic_Acid_Degradation_Capacity_of_Isolated_Bacterial_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to quantify the ferulic acid degradation capacity of each isolated bacterial OTU and thereby evaluate the effects of the CCR gene silencing on the individual bacterial metabolisms, we evaluated the bacterial strains of all identified OTUs respirometrically with Biolog MT2 plates (in triplicate) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the results of the respirometric analysis supported the results at the population level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the rhizosphere soil, the average ferulic acid degradation capacity of all bacterial OTUs from WT and CCR poplars was highly similar (P = 0.560).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, bacterial metabolisms within the endophytic communities were significantly dissimilar between both genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respirometric response was significantly higher in bacterial endophytes isolated from CCR poplars in the roots (P less_than 0.001), stems (P less_than 0.01), and leaves (P less_than 0.05) than that from the WT, indicating a higher ferulic acid degradation capacity of the bacterial endophytes present in the CCR trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether the significant differences observed in the average respirometric responses were attributable to a limited number of bacterial strains, we also assessed the metabolism evenness (Shannon) of the bacterial OTUs within each compartment and genotype (Fig 3C and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all compartments, the evenness values were highly comparable, except in the stem, where the community metabolic evenness of the CCR poplar was significantly lower than that of the WT (P less_than 0.05), indicating that the higher respirometric response in CCR was limited to specific strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we evaluated the individual respirometric response of each identified OTU (Fig 3B and Fig S5) within each compartment and genotype, to relate the OTU abundance to the respirometric response to ferulic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. putida from roots and stems of the CCR poplar clearly possessed the highest degradation capacity for ferulic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the high relative OTU abundance of P. putida in roots (26.3%) and stems (75.9%) (Fig S1 B and C) of the CCR trees can be attributed to their efficient ferulic acid degradation (Fig 3B), whereas in the WT trees no such relation was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Field_Trial_and_Sampling_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study site was a field trial established in May 2009 (Ghent, Belgium) with 240 poplar trees down-regulated for cinnamoyl-CoA reductase-encoding gene (CCR), corresponding to 120 copies of two independent transgenic lines each, and 120 WT poplar trees (P. tremula × P. alba) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetically engineered poplar trees were generated as described (17) and the field trial has been described previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, both CCR and WT poplar trees were simultaneously micropropagated in vitro, acclimatized in a greenhouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six-month-old greenhouse-grown poplars (2 m high) were pruned and transferred to the field 10 d later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trees were planted in a randomized block design (six blocks of 20 trees each) at a density of 15,000 trees per hectare and an interplant distance of 0.75 m (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A border of WT poplar trees surrounded the field to reduce environmental effects on tree growth (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poplar trees (WT and CCR) were coppiced in February 2010 and allowed to grow further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trees were sampled in October 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve biologically independent replicates (individual trees) were sampled for WT and CCR-deficient poplar trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were spread, as much as possible, between different randomized blocks, taking into account the level of down-regulation as assayed on the samples derived from the first harvest in February 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sampled trees corresponded to redness class 5 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our main interest was the influence of the genetic modification (CCR down-regulation) of poplar on the plant-associated bacterial communities, we sampled poplar trees with the highest CCR down-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of the CCR gene is associated with a visible phenotype, namely a red-brown xylem coloration, allowing sampling according to phenotype and, hence, somewhat bypassing unequal levels of gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples included rhizosphere soil, roots, stems, and leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Root samples were collected at a depth of 510 cm below ground level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of 10 g of roots was sampled per individual poplar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root samples were placed into 50-mL plastic tubes containing 20 mL of sterile 10 mM PBS (130 mM NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4, 3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil particles adhering to the roots were collected as rhizosphere soil, whereas for the stem and leaf samples one complete offshoot of every individual poplar was gathered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To standardize and maximize reproducibility of stem samples, five to seven small stem cores with bark (1 cm each) were taken from the base to the top of each offshoot to represent the stem compartment and selected stem cores with highly red wood coloration were selected, indicative for high CCR down-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the leaf samples, all leaves from the sampled offshoot were collected to represent the leaf compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processing_of_Rhizosphere_Soil__Root__Stem__and_Leaf_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rhizosphere soil was strictly defined as soil in the immediate vicinity of the roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, root samples were washed in 10 mM PBS buffer for 10 min on a shaking platform (120 rpm) and then transferred to clean 50-mL plastic tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil particles directly dislodged from the roots represented the rhizosphere samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plastic tubes were preweighted to correct bacterial cell counts to cfus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the focus was on rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria that colonize the internal plant tissues, the epiphytic bacteria were removed from the surface of the plant tissues by sequential washing with (i) sterile Millipore water (30 s), (ii) followed by immersion in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol (2 min), (iii) sodium hypochlorite solution [2.5% (vol/vol) active Cl, 5 min] supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 80, (iv) 70% (vol/vol) ethanol (30 s), and (v) five times with sterile Millipore water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the absence of epiphytic bacteria on the surface of the plant tissues and also guarantee the aseptic conditions during the sterilization process, aliquots (100 L) of the final rinse water were spread on solid rich medium 869 containing 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 1 g d-glucose, and 0.345 g CaCl2·2H2O (pH 7) per liter of deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates (negative controls) were examined for bacterial growth after 3 d of incubation at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant samples were portioned into small fragments with a sterile scalpel and subsequently were macerated in sterile PBS buffer (10 mM) with a Polytron PR1200 mixer (Kinematica A6) in cycles of 2 min (four times) with cooling of the mixer on ice between cycles to reduce sample heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to take into account the biological and microbiological variations, the resulting homogenates (rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf) from three trees were pooled, resulting in four independent biological replicates derived from 12 individual poplars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, for each biological replicate, a technical replicate was added to all experimental setups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial cells were isolated from the resulting homogenates of rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf tissues via (i) a direct nonselective and selective isolation technique with a standard carbon source mix and specific phenolic lignin precursors as sole carbon sources, respectively, and (ii) a selective enrichment technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, for all isolation procedures, negative controls (plates and flasks containing only nutrient medium) were included and grown in conditions identical to those of the experimental samples to ensure sterility of the isolation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Univariate_Analysis_of_Bacterial_Community_Structures_and_Bacterial_Diversity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Univariate community measures (species richness, species evenness, and species diversity) reduce the large amount of species information into single summary indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods are less robust and sensitive than multivariate analyses (NMDS, canonical analyses) to detect changes in bacterial communities, but represent a valuable addition to the multivariate analysis by providing a higher level of visualization and interpretability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species richness was calculated with Margalefs richness index: Dmg = (S  1)/ln (N), where S represents the number of OTUs in the samples and N the total number of clones in the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species evenness was calculated with Pielous evenness index: J = H/ln (S) where H represents the ShannonWeiner diversity index (H=  pi ln pi) and S the number of OTUs in the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species diversity was calculated with the inverse Simpson index: D = 1/ pi2, where pi is the proportion of clones in the ith OTU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Respirometric_Metabolism_Analysis_of_Pure_Cultures_with_Biolog_MT2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the ferulic acid degradation capacity of each isolated bacterial strain and evaluate the effect of the CCR down-regulation and the resulting change in xylem composition and available carbon sources on the individual bacterial metabolisms, all isolated bacterial strains were semiquantitatively evaluated with MT2 plates (Biolog).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biolog MT2 plates use redox chemistry to semiquantitatively assess the degradation of external carbon sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each well of the Biolog MT2 microplates (96 wells) contains tetrazolium violet redox dye that is highly sensitive to bacterial respiration and a buffered nutrient medium optimized for a wide variety of bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial respiration (i.e., degradation of the added carbon source) results in the reduction of tetrazolium violet to formazan that can be spectrophotometrically quantified at 595 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the Biolog MT2 respirometric assay, pure bacterial cultures were grown in liquid rich medium 869 overnight (18 h, 30 °C, 120 rpm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the exponentially growing cultures were washed twice (4,000 rpm, 20 min) with sterile 10 mM PBS buffer and absorbance of all bacterial suspensions was adjusted to 0.200 (600 nm) with sterile 10 mM PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cultures were incubated at 30 °C on a shaking platform (120 rpm) for 18 h to deplete residual carbon nutrient content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each well of the Biolog MT2 plates was filled with 5 mM ferulic acid (30 L) and 115 L of the designated bacterial suspension at absorbance600 = 0.20, resulting in a final concentration of 1 mM ferulic acid per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each bacterial strain was tested in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive control wells were filled with 5 mM of d-glucose and three different bacterial strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative control wells were inoculated with 5 mM ferulic acid (30 L) and 115 L of sterile deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inoculated plates were placed in self-sealing plastic bags (VWR) containing a water-soaked paper towel to minimize evaporation from the wells and were incubated at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance was measured at 595 nm with an OMEGA plate reader (Fluorostar) immediately after inoculation (0 h) and at 3, 6, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h. Actively respiring bacterial strains, namely those that degraded the added ferulic acid as sole carbon source, reduced tetrazolium violet to formazan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raw absorbance data for all bacterial strains from each time point (3, 6, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h) were collected and individually standardized by subtracting the corresponding absorbance value measured immediately after inoculation (0 h) (reaction-independent absorbance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to semiquantitatively evaluate the degradation capacity of each bacterial strain in the kinetic Biolog dataset, the net area under the absorbance versus time curve was calculated according to the trapezoidal approximation (40)i=14((vi+vi=1)/2)(ti+ti=1)=50.The resulting value calculated via the trapezoidal approximation summarizes different aspects of the measured respirometric reaction, including differences in lag phases, increase rates, maximum optical densities, and so on (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally the average respirometric responses of all bacterial strains, indicating the ferulic acid degradation capacity, were calculated for the rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf samples of WT and CCR poplar trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Host genotype effects that are reminiscent of the host genotype-dependent associations that shape the human microbiome (4, 5) have been identified in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host genotype had a profound effect on the metabolic capacities and bacterial species in the endosphere of CCR-deficient poplar trees, without perceptible effects on the bacterial communities of the rhizosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that the effects of CCR down-regulation go beyond those that could have been expected from perturbation of the lignin biosynthesis as described in textbooks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, compounds that accumulate because of perturbations in the CCR gene expression are apparently further metabolized by the endophytic community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new metabolites may interfere with the intended phenotype caused by the perturbation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, these interactions need to be taken into account when engineering the plant metabolic pathways and to understand their relation to the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this study, we chose a targeted methodology to isolate cultivable bacteria that predominantly focused on the differential accumulation of phenolic carbon sources in the WT and CCR-deficient poplar trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing high-resolution 16S rDNA sequencing technologies could further elucidate the host genotype-dependent modulation of the plant microbiome by CCR-down-regulation and possibly contribute to the exploitation of the eukaryoteprokaryote associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Field_Trial  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study site was a field trial established in May 2009 by the VIB with 120 CCR-deficient clonally replicated trees of two independent transgenic lines and 120 WT poplar trees (P. tremula × P. alba).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both CCR and WT poplar trees were simultaneously micropropagated in vitro, acclimatized in a greenhouse, and 6-mo-old greenhouse-grown poplars (2 m high) were pruned and transferred to the field 10 d later (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Collection_of_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples from four compartments (rhizosphere soil, root, stem, and leaf) were collected from the poplar trees in October 2011 (nWT = 12, nCCR = 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were spread, as much as possible, between different randomized blocks, taking into account tree health, general appearance, and CCR down-regulation level visualized by the red wood coloration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sampled trees corresponded with redness class 5 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processing_of_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant tissues were depleted of soil particles and epiphytic bacteria by surface sterilization with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and 0.1% (vol/vol) NaClO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cells were isolated from all four compartments via (i) direct nonselective and selective isolation techniques with a standard carbon source mix and specific phenolic compounds (ferulic acid, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid) as sole carbon sources and (ii) a selective enrichment technique with ferulic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Genomic DNA was extracted from all purified morphologically different bacterial strains in triplicate with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplification of bacterial small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes (16S) was done with the 26F/1392R (Escherichia coli numbering) primer pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sequences were queried against Greengenes (37) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI BLAST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the ferulic acid degradation capacity, all isolated bacterial strains were semiquantitatively evaluated with MT2 plates (Biolog).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis of the multivariate ecological species data included (i) robust unconstrained ordination (NMDS), (ii) rigorous statistical testing of the hypothesis (ANOSIM and adonis), and (iii) indicator species analysis (DufreneLegendre).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with packages and scripts developed in R (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
