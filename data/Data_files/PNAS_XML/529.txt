Fisheries management impacts on target species status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is broad public interest in the health of our oceans and marine life at local, national, and international levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years there has been increasing concern about whether our fisheries can sustainably provide seafood without overfishing fish stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several papers have described the global status of fish populations (i.e., their abundance and exploitation rates) and have hypothesized influences of fisheries management, but this report is unique in being a comprehensive analysis of how specific management attributes (which are numerous and operate simultaneously) affect population status across oceans, countries, and taxonomic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our report integrates management policies and population ecology to assess sustainable harvesting outcomes of target species in marine fisheries; results have important global food security implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fisheries management systems around the world are highly diverse in their design, operation, and effectiveness at meeting objectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of management institutions, strategies, and tactics are used across disparate regions, fishing fleets, and taxonomic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a global level, it is unclear which particular management attributes have greatest influence on the status of fished populations, and also unclear which external factors affect the overall success of fisheries management systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used expert surveys to characterize the management systems by species of 28 major fishing nations and examined influences of economic, geographic, and fishery-related factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Fisheries Management Index, which integrated research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomic attributes, showed wide variation among countries and was strongly affected by per capita gross domestic product (positively) and capacity-enhancing subsidies (negatively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among 13 management attributes considered, three were particularly influential in whether stock size and fishing mortality are currently in or trending toward desirable states: extensiveness of stock assessments, strength of fishing pressure limits, and comprehensiveness of enforcement programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support arguments that the key to successful fisheries management is the implementation and enforcement of science-based catch or effort limits, and that monetary investment into fisheries can help achieve management objectives if used to limit fishing pressure rather than enhance fishing capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Countries with currently less-effective management systems have the greatest potential for improving long-term stock status outcomes and should be the focus of efforts to improve fisheries management globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Summarized survey answers by dimension and country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses are weighted by both respondent expertise and confidence in individual answers provided, and are adjusted for observed differences among respondent background categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Countries (n = 28) are sorted by FMI values, a composite of research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summary statistics of survey answers by dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses for individual questions within dimensions have: (A) weighting by confidence score in the answers provided for individual questions; or (B) equal weighting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FMI is a composite of research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions with equal weighting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diagonals show histograms of survey responses (n = 191) across all countries and respondents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower panels show scatterplots between pairs of dimensions, with correlation ellipses (black lines), loess smoothers (red lines), and bivariate medians (red circles) overlaid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper panels show Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs of dimensions with font size scaled to r.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

FMI values and average values of research (R), management (M), enforcement (E), socioeconomics (S) and stock status (B) dimensions by country under different weighting and adjustment schemes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effects of fisheries management attributes in research (R), management (M), enforcement (E), and socioeconomics (S) dimensions on the current status and trends of biomass (B) and fishing mortality (F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher values of response variables indicate increasingly desirable states or trends toward desirable states with respect to management targets (i.e., high values of F do not indicate F  FMSY, but rather F  FMSY).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Line thicknesses are proportional to predictor variable importance scores from random forest analyses for each response variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Panels are sorted left to right by the sum of standardized variable importance scores across all four response variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response and predictor variables are weighted by confidence in individual answers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variables range from 0 to 1, but vertical axes are truncated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rug marks at bottom show deciles of predictor variable values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Expert_Surveys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fishery experts familiar with the management systems of one or more countries were invited to participate in a survey characterizing the management system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 28 countries included in this study include the top 20 countries in terms of global marine catch; the remaining 8 countries were selected from 5 continents, including Oceania to ensure global representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ensured that a variety of backgrounds were represented by respondents; 191 completed surveys across 28 countries were provided by 182 individuals (or groups): government scientists (n = 60), government managers (n = 28), and members of industry associations (n = 16), universities (n = 35), environmental NGOs (n = 27), and external organizations (n = 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respondents were instructed to complete a spreadsheet survey for 10 major fished species in the country of question using one of two formats: in survey A, answers were provided for each of 46 criteria for each of the 10 species separately, whereas in survey B a single answer was provided for each criterion across all 10 species together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Midway through the survey mailing period, only survey A was sent to respondents because this was the preferred format for most respondents and also provided higher-resolution data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respondents were instructed to provide answers in a global context, recognizing that similar surveys were being conducted across countries differing in the development of their fisheries governance systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full instructions provided to respondents are contained in the original survey file (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respondents were given the option of being acknowledged for their contribution or remaining anonymous; see SI Extended Acknowledgments for a list of expert survey participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Management attributes surveyed included aspects of research (programs for collection of landings data and body size/age data, surveys, stock assessments), management (management plans, limits on fishing pressure, capacity to adjust fishing pressure), enforcement (monitoring and observing programs, penalties, protection of sensitive habitats, discarding or by-catch measures), and socioeconomics (access into the fishery, transparency, community involvement, absence of subsidies), as well as stock status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey hierarchy was such that individual criteria were nested within attributes, which were nested within dimensions (Table 1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The list of 10 species for each survey file was semirandomized and biased toward species with greater volumes and values of landings by the country in question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FAO capture-production database (25) was used along with global ex-vessel price estimates (26) to compile time series of landings and landed values for each species (or other taxonomic group) in the FAO landings database caught by the country in question in the FAO areas adjacent to the main EEZ of the country (i.e., excluding distant-water catches and from overseas territories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arithmetic means of landings and landed values in 5 recent years (20072011) were calculated for each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four species with greatest landings and four species with greatest landed values (which often overlapped) were included in all survey files for the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining two to six species were randomly sampled in proportion to their joint probability of standardized landings and standardized landed values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in species lists reflecting the major species caught by the country, but occasionally including minor species also.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Respondents provided answers to the survey criteria, a confidence score for each criterion to reflect the uncertainty in the answers provided, additional comments, and a self-assigned level of familiarity with the countrys fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answers of 0, 0.5, 1, or not applicable indicated the degree to which each of 46 criteria were met for each of 10 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confidence scores for individual criteria (A, B, C, or D) were later used as weighting terms for aggregating survey criteria within attributes and within dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-assigned familiarity (level of expertise; also A, B, C, or D) was later used as a weighting term for individual respondents in analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Level of expertise varied across respondent background categories as expected (Fig S3), with government managers and scientists indicating greater familiarity with national fisheries management systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All comments provided by respondents were reviewed in detail to ensure that survey questions were interpreted as intended and to occasionally adjust answers to ensure consistency across respondents in the interpretation of questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clarifications were made before finalizing a set of responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a completed survey was returned, the respondent was asked to self-identify into a primary background category: government science, government manager, fishing industry, university, environmental NGOs, or organization external to the country, such as the FAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analyses accounted for possible influences of background category on the answers provided by respondents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Filtering_of_Survey_Responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the review of surveys and quality-assurance procedures, additional filters were applied to the compiled dataset before analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refer to Dataset S1 for the full wording of the criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following filters were applied:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Country-Level_Covariates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twelve country-level numerical variables (Table S1) were considered in the mixed-model analysis to explain variability in FMI values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original list of possible country-level explanatory variables was longer, including other indicators related to population, economics, governance, development, transparency, food security, environmental performance, as well as current and historical levels of fishery catch, landed values, and international trade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these variables showed high correlation, so the list of possible variables to include in analyses was shortened.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, groups of related variables were plotted together in paired scatterplots and correlation coefficients were calculated between pairs of variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When high correlations (0.7) were observed, one of the two variables was eliminated from consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, all variables carried forward from the initial groups were pooled and again visually inspected to remove highly-correlated variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, after remaining variables showed low-to-moderate levels of correlation (less_than0.7), variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to further assess possible confounding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variables with high levels of covariation with other predictor variables were removed from the list until all variables had VIF less_than 6, leaving 12 variables for consideration in analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most variables were log-transformed to avoid overly skewed distributions, and all variables were standardized to mean = 0 and SD = 1 for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of covariates for each country are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fishery experts from diverse backgrounds were invited to complete a survey characterizing the management systems for 10 species in their country of familiarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Institutional review board approval was not required for these surveys and Respondents were given the option of being acknowledged for their contribution or remaining anonymous; see SI Extended Acknowledgments for a list of expert survey participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 191 surveys were completed by 182 individual respondents; the number of returned surveys per country ranged from 2 to 17 (mean = 6.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range represented an overall 41% response rate from 467 invitations originally extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survey responses for research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions were aggregated into a Fisheries Management Index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation among countries in the FMI was attributed to geographic, economic, and fishery-related influences using mixed-effects models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, the influence of management-related attributes on the current status and trends in stock abundance and fishing pressure were evaluated using random forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Materials and Methods for details and Dataset S1 for the survey file listing specific attributes and criteria within each dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
