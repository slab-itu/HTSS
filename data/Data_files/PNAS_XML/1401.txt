MAVS deficiency induces gut dysbiotic microbiota conferring a proallergic phenotype  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growing evidence suggests that prominent changes in the gut microbial communities (dysbiosis) play a key role in the development of allergic disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used a murine model of human allergic contact dermatitis to demonstrate a regulatory role of the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) RIG-Ilike receptors on disease outcome by modulating gut barrier function and bacterial ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight an unexpected role of the RIG-IMAVS pathway in maintenance of intestinal barrier function and modulation of gut commensal flora to prevent the development of inflammatory diseases such as allergy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide a rationale for manipulating the gut microbiota as a therapeutic intervention in subjects at risk of developing allergy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prominent changes in the gut microbiota (referred to as dysbiosis) play a key role in the development of allergic disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice contributed to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of human allergic contact dermatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a negative regulatory role of the RIG-Ilike receptor adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) on DTH by modulating gut bacterial ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohousing and fecal transplantation experiments revealed that the dysbiotic microbiota of Mavs/ mice conferred a proallergic phenotype that is communicable to wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DTH sensitization coincided with increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation within lymphoid organs that enhanced DTH severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we unveiled an unexpected impact of RIG-Ilike signaling on the gut microbiota with consequences on allergic skin disease outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primarily, these data indicate that manipulating the gut microbiota may help in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human allergic skin pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MAVS_Deficiency_Leads_to_Significant_Differences_in_Gut_Microbial_Composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify specific gut bacterial communities that can be regulated by the RLR pathway, we performed two independent 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing comparisons of the variable bacterial 16S rRNA genes on feces from Mavs/ and WT single-housed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed microbial dysbiosis in Mavs/ mice compared with either separated Mavs+/+ littermates (Mavs+/+litt) or WT animals, suggesting that MAVS genetic deficiency is responsible for dysbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same dysbiosis was observed in Mavs/ mice bred in another animal facility, demonstrating that this effect is due to Mavs deficiency and is not inherent to the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen from multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1), Mavs/ and WT mice exhibited substantial differences in overall gut microbial composition but no significant differences in the number of species by Chaos index of species richness (Fig 1B) or in measures of alpha diversity by inverse Simpson index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further taxonomic analysis identified a 30-fold increase in the Deferribacteres phylum, driven by Mucispirillum schaedleri, in Mavs/ compared with Mavs+/+ and WT mice (P less_than 106) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus was significantly increased in Mavs/ animals (P less_than 109) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increased_Delayed-Type_Hypersensitivity_Observed_in_Mavs__Mice_Is_Inhibited_by_Antibiotics_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess potential links between RLR signaling, gut microbiota, and risk for skin allergy, we measured the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to the strong hapten 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) (SI Appendix, Fig S2A) in mice deficient for the RLR adaptor MAVS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-housed Mavs/ mice showed increased DTH severity demonstrated by a significant increase in ear swelling (Fig 2A), while hapten-induced tissue irritation (SI Appendix, Fig S2B) and DTH response kinetics (SI Appendix, Fig S2C) were similar to those in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhanced DTH response was characterized by an increased immune cell infiltration (Fig 2B) and cytokines characteristic of DTH reactions (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S3) (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher infiltrate coincided with increased dermal edema and vascular enlargement as determined histological analysis on Mavs/ ear sections (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define whether disease risk is related to impaired immune cells in Mavs/ mice, we performed a multiparameter immunophenotyping of lymphoid organs and blood at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mavs/ and WT mice showed a similar composition of main immune subsets in vivo (SI Appendix, Fig S4) and equivalent T cell proliferation in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease risk in Mavs/ mice is not due to increased hapten penetration, as no skin structure (SI Appendix, Fig S6 A and B) or permeability abnormalities (SI Appendix, Fig S6C) were observed at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, MAVS deficiency did not affect hapten uptake, skin dendritic cell (DC) migration, or T cell priming in the draining lymph node (dLN) during DTH response (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the gut microbiota contributes to the Mavs/ DTH phenotype, Mavs/ and WT animals were orally treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX), including ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin, shown to deeply impact gut but not skin microbiota (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflammatory edema was strongly inhibited in ABX-treated Mavs/ mice, whereas no impact was observed in WT-treated mice (Fig 2E), demonstrating that the gut microbiota is a trigger for the higher severity of the DTH response in Mavs/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Increased_DTH_Response_Is_Transmissible_by_the_Gut_Microbiota  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next evaluated whether differences in the gut microbiota composition may be linked to disease risk in Mavs deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT and Mavs/ mice were cohoused for 4 wk, and the DTH response was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohoused WT and Mavs/ mice exhibited the same increased edema as single-housed WT mice (Fig 3A), suggesting that the Mavs/ inflammatory phenotype is transmissible to WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that cohousing resulted in successful transfer of microbial species, as the PCA scatter plot showed an intermediate position of cohoused WT and Mavs/ mice compared with single-housed animals (SI Appendix, Fig S8), demonstrating that dysbiosis is transmissible by coprophagia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next validated these results using littermates generated from in-house heterozygous crossing and housed together from birth to the day of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed no difference in the ear swelling of Mavs/, Mavs+/, and Mavs+/+ littermates cohoused from birth (Fig 3B), suggesting maternal transmission from one generation to another by a dominant effect of MAVS deficiency on dysbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further establish that the Mavs/ inflammatory phenotype is communicable from the mother to offspring, we performed cross-fostering experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT mice cross-fostered (CF) at birth with in-house Mavs/ mothers (CF-WT) developed a severe DTH response compared with Mavs/ mice cross-fostered with in-house WT mothers (CF-Mavs/) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, adult germ-free WT (GF-WT) mice were recolonized with a fresh supernatant from feces of either WT (WT  GF-WT) or Mavs/ (Mavs/  GF-WT) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DTH response was significantly greater in recipients replenished with the fecal microbiota from Mavs/ animals than in WT  GF-WT mice (Fig 3D and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that the Mavs/ microbiota is a dominant proallergenic factor that is likely maternally transmissible from the earliest days of life onwards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Translocation_and_Enhanced_Inflammatory_Cytokines_in_Secondary_Lymphoid_Organs_Correlate_with_Increased_DTH_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to understand how intestinal dysbiosis may influence the skin DTH response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies highlighted an increased intestinal permeability in patients with allergy such as atopic dermatitis (1719).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intestinal histological analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S10) and immune subsets (lamina propria) of Mavs/ mice revealed no defect at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether Mavs/-increased DTH severity may be correlated to modifications in intestinal permeability during sensitization, mice were orally administered FITC-dextran.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FITC-dextran blood level was transiently increased 48 h after skin sensitization in Mavs/ mice as compared with WT mice, whereas no difference was observed at steady state (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CF-WT mice exhibited same increased intestinal permeability as CF-Mavs/ mice, suggesting that dysbiotic microbiota transferred from Mavs/ fostering animals is the key trigger for the intestinal defect during the DTH response (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation were correlated in mice (20), and bacterial translocation into secondary lymphoid organs was shown to be consecutive to intestinal barrier disruption (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus investigate whether bacterial translocation in lymphoid organs could explain the increased DTH response of Mavs/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used fluorescent 16S rRNA-targeted probes to detect translocating bacteria and recovered an increased number of bacteria in dLNs and spleens from Mavs-deficient mice (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified B. vulgatus in dLNs of Mavs/ mice (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secretion by hapten-specific CD8+ T cells of Th1 (IFN, IL-2) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines in skin dLNs after sensitization was markedly increased in Mavs/ mice compared with WT mice (Fig 4F), suggesting that translocating bacteria may provide costimulatory signals enhancing the immune response during DTH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, our results indicate that intestinal dysbiosis increases skin allergy severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that MAVS deficiency leads to changes in the gut bacterial composition that exert their effect through an increased intestinal permeability during DTH sensitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensuing bacterial translocation within lymphoid organs leads to increased cytokine production and DTH severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paradigm revealed an unexpected protective role for a cytosolic surveillance system involved in viral RNA detection in the development of skin allergy resulting from specific changes in the composition of enteric bacterial residents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are complementary to the role of MAVS in monitoring intestinal commensal bacteria and maintaining intestinal tissue homeostasis described by Li and colleagues (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the RIG-I/MAVS pathway activation and subsequent IFN-I signaling were recently shown to maintain gut epithelial barrier integrity (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RIG-I was described as being constitutively expressed at the apical surface of intestinal human biopsies (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations, associated with a leaky gut phenotype described in allergic atopic patients (1719), suggest that intestinal permeability and gut microbiota composition may impact skin allergy in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulation of the gut microbiota, shown to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in anticancer therapy (2426), may represent therapeutics for human allergic skin diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mavs-deficient (Mavstm1Tsc/tm1Tsc) mice were kindly provided by J. Tschopp, Biochemistry Department, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were bred as homozygotes in our animal facility [Plateau de Biologie Expérimentale de la Souris (PBES), Structure Fédérative de Recherche Biosciences] under specific pathogen-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mavs-deficient mice were generated on a pure B6J background (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the pure B6J background by SNP analysis as described by Simon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All control mice were C57BL/6J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal experimental procedures were conducted using 6- to 12-wk-old mice in accordance with the animal care guidelines of the European Union and French laws and were validated by the local institutional review board (Comité d'Evaluations Commun au Centre Léon Bérard, à l'Animalerie Transit de l'ENS, au PBES et au Laboratoire P4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Microbiota_Using_16S_rRNA_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was isolated from fecal pellets using the QIAamp DNA Stool kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16S rRNA gene analysis was done by sequencing the V1V3 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using 27F 5-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3 and 534R 5-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3 primers with barcodes and sequencing primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were purified (AMPure; Beckman Coulter), quantified (Bioanalyzer; Agilent), and pooled in equimolar concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emulsion PCRs were made using the Roche 454 emPCR Lib-A LOVE kit (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing was done using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence processing and analysis were performed using Mothur v1.22.0 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, low-quality sequences and PCR chimeras were removed using the UCHIME algorithm and the Mothur plugin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned to a custom-built reference dataset of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis, sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference dataset, clustered, and binned into the same OTUs if more than 97% similarity was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial diversity indexes (Chao and the Inverse Simpson Index) were also calculated using Mothur software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis was done using an unpaired two-tailed Students t test or two-way ANOVA (Partek 6.0 software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the q-value method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences between groups were visualized using a PCA plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supervised hierarchal clustering was used to make a heatmap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse_Ear-Swelling_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mouse ear-swelling test procedure was used to measure DTH responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female mice were sensitized epicutaneously on the shaved abdomen with 25 L 0.5% DNFB (Sigma) diluted in acetone-olive oil (4:1, vol/vol) on day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 5, DNFB-sensitized and unsensitized control mice were challenged with 5 L of 0.13% DNFB on both sides of one ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other ear was painted with vehicle alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in ear swelling was measured at different time points after challenge using a spring-loaded micrometer (Blet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonresponding animals were excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the interindividual variability of our experimental model, we used 412 mice per experiment to ensure adequate statistical power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No method of randomization was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No blinding to the group allocation during experiments was used except for cohousing and littermates experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cohousing__Cross-Fostering__Fecal_Transplantation__and_Antibiotic_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For cohousing experiments, WT and Mavs/ mice were transferred at a 50/50 ratio into an isolator cage for 4 wk on the same diet before the DTH experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For littermates experiments, Mavs+/+, Mavs+/, and Mavs/ mice were generated from heterozygous crossing and were kept in the same cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DTH experiments were conducted blindly considering genotype at 6 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cross-fostering experiments, newborn mice were exchanged between WT and Mavs/ mothers within 24 h of birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were weaned between postnatal days 2128.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the fecal transplantation experiment, GF-WT mice were generated at the Transgenesis and Archiving of Animal Models-CNRS facility and were transferred into autoclaved sterile microisolator cages before gavage with 200 L of fresh supernatant from feces of WT or Mavs/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DTH experiment was performed 4 wk after fecal transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ablation of the intestinal bacteria, an antibiotic mixture of 1 g/L each of ampicillin (sodium salt; Sigma), neomycin sulfate (Sigma),and metronidazole (Sigma) and 0.5 g/L of vancomycin hydrochloride (Mylan) was added to the drinking water for 4 wk and was changed twice a week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotics activity was gauged by Gram staining of cecal material and quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies per gram of feces that demonstrated depletion of bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Assay_of_Intestinal_Permeability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An in vivo assay of barrier function was performed using FITC-labeled dextran under steady-state conditions and during the sensitization phase of DTH (2 and 5 d postsensitization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, B6J WT and Mavs/ mice were deprived of food and water for 4 h. Then mice were gavaged with the paracellular permeability tracer FITC-labeled dextran 4 kDa (0.6 mg/g of body weight; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was collected retroorbitally after 3 h, and the fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured (excitation: 492 nm; emission: 520 nm; TECAN Infinite 200 machine) in serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FITC-dextran concentrations were determined from a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of FITC-dextran.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FISH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spleens and dLNs harvested 5 d after DNFB sensitization were embedded in paraffin and cut to a thickness of 5 m using a Shandon Finesse ME+ microtome (Thermo Electron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin sections were rehydrated in 100% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and water for 5 min each and with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two washes with PBS, slides were covered with a solution of lysozyme at 10 mg/mL in PBS for 20 min at 50 °C and were washed twice with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min of incubation in hybridization buffer [20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8), 0.9 M NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 30% formamide], slides were incubated overnight at 50 °C in hybridization buffer containing 20 nM of the fluorescent probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing twice in 1× SSC (0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate), slides were covered for 10 s with DAPI (0.125 g/mL in PBS), washed in PBS, and mounted in Fluoromount (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes used were Eub338 5-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3 and non-Eub338 5-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probes were covalently linked with Alexa 555 and FITC, respectively at their 5 ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B. vulgatus probe used was Bvul-R 5-GGCTTCTTACTTTCTCTCTTCCG-3 covalently linked with Alexa 647 at the 5 end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were examined with a Zeiss LSM 780 NLO confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the number of bacteria in each organ, we enumerated the number of red spots in 10 images per organ, taken randomly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ears from B6J and Mavs-deficient mice were collected 24 h after DNFB challenge, fixed, and stained with H&E (Novotec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were observed with a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope and analyzed using ImageJ software (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hairs were plucked from the mouse back skin and examined with a stereomicroscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse coat, four hair types can be distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Awl and guard hairs are straight, and the latter are longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Auchene and zigzag hairs have one or multiple bends, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these morphological hallmarks, the presence of the different hair types was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed by cervical dislocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back skin was shaved and isolated by dissection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole skin samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h and processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained with H&E, and general morphology was investigated with a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Skin_Permeability_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Female mice were acclimatized for 30 min, and measurements were performed at a room temperature of 24.2 °C and 54.6% relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured using a Tewameter TM 300 measuring device (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH) on shaved skin from different areas of the mouse back and belly according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme-Linked_Immunospot_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was developed to estimate the number of antigen-specific IFN-producing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axillary and inguinal dLNs were collected 5 d postsensitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated cells were plated (0.8 × 106, 0.4 × 106, or 0.2 × 106 cells per well) in Multiscreen 96-well filter plates (Millipore) and were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 h with or without DNBS (4 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ELISPOT IFN Kit pair (BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Streptavidinalkaline phosphatase conjugate was obtained from eBioscience, and AEC substrate was obtained from BD Biosciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spots were counted with CTL S6 UV and were analyzed with Immunocapture 5.0 Analyzer Professional DC software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tracking_of_Skin_DC_Migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT and MAVS-deficient mice were painted on the dorsal side of each ear with 10 L of TRITC (Molecular Probes) diluted at 0.1 mg/mL in 10% DMSO (Sigma) and 90% acetone-dibutil phthalate (1:1, vol/vol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-eight hours later, CD11c+ cells from cervical dLNs were collected and were analyzed by FACS for TRITC, I-A/I-E, CD207, and CD103 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled antibodies I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), CD207 (929F3), CD103 (2-E7), and CD11c (N418) were obtained from eBioscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immune_System_Phenotyping_in_Blood_and_Lymphoid_Organs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stainings for flow cytometry were also performed on freshly isolated splenocytes, cells of the dLNs, and blood with the collaboration of the AniRA Phenotyping Facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled antibodies B220 (RA3-6B2), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), TCR (GL3), NK1.1 (PK136), FoxP3 (FJK-16s), Siglec-H (eBio440c), CD205 (NLDC-145), CD11c (N418), CD45 (30-F11), CD3 (2c11), CD25 (PC61), Ly6G (IA8), CD11b (M1/70), CD115 (AFS98), and Ly6c (AL21) were obtained from eBioscience, BD Biosciences, and BioLegend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry_Analysis_on_Ears  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flow-cytometric experiments were conducted on entire ear cells harvested at 8 h and 24 h postchallenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse ear halves were split and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with collagenase (Sigma) and DNase I (Roche) in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 25-mM Hepes (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were next filtrated through a 100-m nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon), stained with labeled antibodies [CD45 (30-F11), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (CT-CD4), CD8 (53-6.7), Ly6G (IA8), CD11b (M1/70), and Ly6C (AL21)], and analyzed by FACS on a BD LSR II flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled antibodies were obtained from eBioscience or BD Biosciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using FlowJo 887 software (Tree Star).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow-count fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter) were used to determine absolute counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ELISA_and_Multiplex_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Challenged mouse ear halves were split and incubated at 37 °C for 30 h. DNBS-restimulated cells from dLNs (1 × 106 cells) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 or 48 h. Cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants were measured by specific ELISAs according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical density was read with a TECAN Infinite 200 machine using i-control software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ELISA kits were obtained from R&D Systems (IFN, IL-1) or BioLegend (IL-17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of IL-2 by CD8+ T cells from DNBS-restimulated dLNs was analyzed in culture supernatant using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse cytokines 23-plex Assay (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence analysis was performed using the Bio-Plex MAGPIX Multiplex Reader, and results were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gut_Paraffin_Sections_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were killed at 6 wk of age, the intestine was quickly removed, and samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before being embedded in paraffin and cut in 5-m-thick sections for histological (H&E staining) and immunohistochemical experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized in methylcyclohexane, hydrated in ethanol, and washed with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were subsequently subjected to antigen retrieval using microwave heating in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Ki67, 1:200; rabbit anti-Lysozyme, 1:1,000) (both from Abcam) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit; 1:500; Jackson Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slide observation and cell counting were done using a Zeiss Z1 Imager.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using a Leica SP5X confocal microscope with an HC PL APO 20× ON 0.7 oil immersion objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
