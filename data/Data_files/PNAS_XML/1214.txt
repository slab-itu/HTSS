Superresolution microscopy reveals structural mechanisms driving the nanoarchitecture of a viral chromatin tether  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus propagates by attaching to host chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tether is essential for viral maintenance, and its disruption represents a potential treatment for persistent infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fundamental questions remain, including how the underlying viral chromatin is folded, how the tether protein is organized, and how it is presented for host attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using superresolution fluorescence microscopy, we have visualized single tethers in cells and built a working model of their structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The folding of the viral chromatin mimics that of active chromatin, driven by nucleosome positioning and DNA bending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tether proteins are arranged in ordered clusters projected outward from the viral chromatin axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These principles are likely to be applicable to the tethers of other DNA tumor viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By tethering their circular genomes (episomes) to host chromatin, DNA tumor viruses ensure retention and segregation of their genetic material during cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite functional genetic and crystallographic studies, there is little information addressing the 3D structure of these tethers in cells, issues critical for understanding persistent infection by these viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to establish the nanoarchitecture of tethers within cells latently infected with the oncogenic human pathogen, Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each KSHV tether comprises a series of homodimers of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) that bind with their C termini to the tandem array of episomal terminal repeats (TRs) and with their N termini to host chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superresolution imaging revealed that individual KSHV tethers possess similar overall dimensions and, in aggregate, fold to occupy the volume of a prolate ellipsoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using plasmids with increasing numbers of TRs, we found that tethers display polymer power law scaling behavior with a scaling exponent characteristic of active chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For plasmids containing a two-TR tether, we determined the size, separation, and relative orientation of two distinct clusters of bound LANA, each corresponding to a single TR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, we have generated a 3D model of the episomal half of the tether that integrates and extends previously established findings from epifluorescent, crystallographic, and epigenetic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also validate the use of dSTORM in establishing novel structural insights into the physical basis of molecular connections linking host and pathogen genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Nanoscale_Dimensions_of_LANA_Tethers_Are_Uniform_and_Consistent_Across_Different_Cell_Types  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, since LANA binds both host nucleosomes and episome DNA, the packaging of TR chromatin could be determined primarily by the state of the host chromatin, by features intrinsic to the viral episome, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish among these alternatives, we examined the tether morphology of the same viral isolate in two different cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) resolved each epifluorescent LANA dot into a cluster of individual emissions from fluorophore-labeled anti-LANA mAbs (Fig 1 BJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these emissions as blinks within a Gaussian localization volume from each conjugated dye molecule present at approximately three dye molecules per mAb (Supporting Information), up to six mAbs bound per LANA dimer (see The 2TR Images Support the Prediction of a LANA Coiled-Coil Domain), and up to three LANA dimers per TR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since all of the episomes from the same virus have the same number of TRs (17, 35), and each TR is 801 bp, we asked whether the polymer architectures revealed by dSTORM would be similarly consistent across multiple tethers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined 65 individual LANA tethers from BCBL-1 cells (a KSHV-positive PEL line) and 34 from SLKp/Caki-1p cells, a human epithelial line exogenously infected with KSHV derived from BCBL-1 (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, while each tether presented a unique shape, their overall dimensions were similar in the two cell lines (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this similarity, we aligned clusters along their three principal axes and calculated their dimensions and radii of gyration, Rg (see Supporting Information), shown in Fig 2 C and D. The median Rg for tethers in BCBL1 cells was 341 nm, 95% CI [309, 353] and in SLKp cells it was 368 nm, 95% CI [323, 405].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no statistical difference between the Rg of BCBL-1 and SLKp tethers (P=0.26, Moods Median Test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity of these parameters in a single viral strain in two different cell types shows that the polymer folding of KSHV LANA tethers is likely to be intrinsic to the viral episome itself, rather than being a result of the cellular milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LANA_Occupancy_Scales_with_the_Number_of_TRs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We postulated that, if the tethers visualized by dSTORM reflect the underlying TR architecture, then their structural parameters should change systematically with different numbers of TR elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To challenge that hypothesis, we examined synthetic tethers with different numbers of TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cotransfected BJAB cells, a KSHV-negative human B-cell line, with two plasmids, one encoding LANA and the other containing two, five, seven, or eight tandem TRs arranged head to tail as in the native episome (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we infected BJAB cells with BAC16 virus that we determined contains approximately 21 TRs (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection with a LANA-encoding plasmid and a plasmid lacking any functional TR sequence (p0TR) resulted only in diffuse nuclear staining by epifluorescence (Fig S2A), consistent with earlier work (12, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, individual tethers in cells harboring plasmids with 2, 8, or 21 TRs showed a progressive increase in size (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accompanying this increase was a corresponding linear rise in the number of dSTORM fluorophore emissions and, therefore, anti-LANA Ab binding (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that an increase in TR number results in a proportional increase in LANA binding argues against a plateau for TR occupancy per plasmid or episome, at least over the range of 1 to 21 TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tether_Polymer_Conformation_Has_the_Characteristics_of_Active_Chromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At present, there is conflicting evidence regarding the conformation of TR chromatin, which exhibits features of both repressed and active conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, TR nucleosomes are tightly packed in a typically closed conformation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, LANA recruits the histone H3 methyltransferase SUV39H1 and establishes HP1 binding to the TR chromatin (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in support of an active conformation, TR chromatin is marked by histone hyperacetylation (29, 31, 32) associated with bromodomain protein BRD4 (9, 39), and the TRs have both promoter and origin of replication functions (14, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the conformational state directly, we took advantage of the fact that the radius of gyration, Rg, of a chromatin polymer follows the power law relationship, RgLc, where L is the DNA length in base pairs and c is the scaling exponent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scaling parameter is a sensitive measure of canonical active, inactive, and repressed states of mammalian chromatin (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By plotting Rg against L, we determined the power law scaling exponent for the LANA-bound TR chromatin to be c=0.36±0.07 (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exponent approximated the value of 0.37±0.02 found by Boettiger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40) for active chromatin and is distinct from values for inactive (c=0.30±0.02) or repressed (c=0.22±0.02) chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results for TR plasmid scaling in COS-7 cells (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding clarifies the long-standing paradox surrounding the chromatin folding state of the TR region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adjacent_TRs_Are_Arranged_with_a_Specific_Asymmetric_Architecture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closer analysis of the dSTORM emissions from individual p2TR tethers revealed that they frequently gave rise to two distinct, resolvable clusters (Fig 3A), and alignment of the complete set of 28 p2TR data (see Supporting Information) reinforced this separation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual clusters had an Rg of 90 nm, 95% CI [82, 96], which is similar to the Rg of 86 nm predicted by extrapolation of the power law function to a single TR (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we interpreted the two clusters as the signals emanating from two adjacent TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results for p2TR dSTORM images acquired in COS-7 cells (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p2TR tethers, individually or as an aligned composite, showed striking asymmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They comprised flat pairs of prominently elongated ellipsoids whose centroids were spaced apart by 174 nm, 95% CI [152, 185] (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the long axes of the two clusters intersected to form a 46° angle (Fig 4B), demonstrating a specific differential placement of the individual TRs within the p2TR structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters provided strong constraints on the underlying folding of the p2TR chromatin tether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_2TR_Images_Support_the_Prediction_of_a_LANA_Coiled-Coil_Domain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To begin to interpret the 2TR tether images at the molecular level, we evaluated the structure of LANA dimers N-terminal to the LBS binding domains, for which previous X-ray crystal structures are known (10, 15, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the primary protein sequence of LANA with Paircoil2 (41) revealed a segment strongly predicted to form a coiled coil (Fig S4A; Pless_than0.025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for the presence of the coiled coil, we measured the number of single-molecule emissions detected by dSTORM for LANA tethers stained with LN53-A647, which recognizes the tetrapeptide epitope EQEQ (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 22 such epitopes within the LANA protein sequence, and this number of mAbs would yield over 18,000 dSTORM emissions per tether (see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 19 of the most C-terminal of these epitopes would be embedded within the putative coiled-coil region of LANA, occluding mAb recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining three epitopes just N-terminal to the coiled coil would yield on the order of only 2,500 emissions per tether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we routinely recovered fewer than 2,000 emissions per tether, consistent with only two to three functional epitopes per LANA protein, providing strong empiric data for the predicted coiled coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the positioning of these available epitopes at the N-terminal end of a rigid coiled-coil domain is supported by the separation between the two emissions clusters in the 2TR images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated a molecular model of LANA dimers incorporating these features (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LANA-Imposed_DNA_Bending_and_Nucleosome_Translational_Positioning_Are_Predicted_to_Direct_TR_Chromatin_Folding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the DNA of each TR is known to be bent by LANA dimer binding (15, 43, 44), and to be occupied by four nucleosomes (31), the constraints these factors impose on tether architecture are currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we varied the parameters of DNA bending and nucleosome positioning in a set of molecular models (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modeled the 113 bp of nucleosome-free DNA that contains the three LBS sites in two modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first, both LBS1 and LBS2 are occupied by LANA dimers, while LBS3 is unoccupied, inducing a 110° bend in LBS DNA (Fig S5C), as previously determined by Wong and Wilson (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second mode, LBS1, LBS2, and LBS3 are all occupied by LANA dimers, inducing a bend of 180° (Fig S5D), as predicted by Hellert et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the remaining 688 bp of TR DNA occupied by four nucleosomes, we adapted the crystal structure of a synthetic tetrasome [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1ZBB] (45) because of its similarity to the spacing of the nucleosomes mapped to the TR (31) (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We digitally joined the tetrasome DNA to the LBS DNA, bent at either 110° (Fig S5E) or 180° (Fig S5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied the position of the joint by a single base pair at a time over a 9-bp span, designated phases 1 to 9, to model the effect of nucleosome translational positioning on tether architecture through an entire turn of a DNA helix (Fig S6 A and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each base pair change in the nucleosome phasing changes the trajectory of the chromatin fiber by approximately 36° (1/10 of a full turn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend the model to include two adjacent TRs, we joined pairs of these single TR models at each of the nine nucleosome phases to produce the complete set of 81 2TR models (nine phases for each tetrasome) (Fig S6 B and F), keeping the repeat length at 801 bp between LBS1 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For models with occupancy of only LBS1 and LBS2, we eliminated 11 of the 81 combinations from further consideration based on steric interference, either between two tetrasomes or the trajectory of connecting DNA (shown in purple and blue, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the models with full occupancy of three LBS sites, 50 models were ruled out (shown in purple and blue, Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of 2TR phase combinations with or without steric hindrance are depicted in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of both LANA-dependent DNA bending and nucleosome translational positioning on the construction of these 2TR models, and the ability of these parameters to eliminate certain tetrasome configurations, demonstrates the importance of these two factors for tether architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Simple_Molecular_Model_Captures_Major_Properties_of_2TR_LANA_Tethers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, our 2TR models captured key features of the dSTORM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the model with full LANA occupancy of all three LBSs on both TRs and the second tetrasome joined to the DNA at phase 8 mimicked features of the image (Fig 5A, and see also Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of three LANA dimers to each TR of the 2TR model produced an elongated arrangement of epitope binding sites and predicted the localization of their associated dye emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the long axes joining the epitope binding sites on each TR give rise to approximately a 45° angle between them by the combination of tetranucleosome positioning and LBS DNA bending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the centers of the two sets of epitopes was 151 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the angle and spacing of emissions in the model approximated those of the experimental data (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the ability of our chromatin models to account for the dSTORM data of individual tethers by optimizing the fit of the modeled epitope sites (dye locations) to the experimental p2TR emissions data (see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then determined the best-fit models by scoring each by the fraction of dSTORM emissions that they captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One example of such a fit is shown in Fig 5B and Movie S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a pair-wise comparison of models with LANA dimers at all three LBS sites versus models with LANA dimers only at LBS1 and LBS2, the full occupancy models were significantly better at accounting for the 28 p2TR datasets (Pless_than3.0 × 1012, Paired t test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the median fraction of dSTORM emissions accounted for by the optimal full occupancy models was 0.72, 95% CI [0.61, 0.83] (Fig 5C) for the p2TR structures assembled in BJAB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out the same analysis of p2TR LANA tethers expressed in COS-7 cells and found the median fraction of emissions covered to be 0.78, 95% CI [0.66, 0.94] (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the optimal phasing between TRs was not the same for all 2TR tethers examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, this parameter varied from tether to tether, with phases 5 to 9 each contributing to the set of best-fit models (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range of phases suggests a basis for the shape variability seen among the individual LANA tethers comprised of larger numbers of TRs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Until now, LANA tethers have appeared as poorly defined nuclear punctae via epifluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization data from this study offer insights into the architecture of the tethers linking KSHV episomes to human chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that the folding of tether chromatin was intrinsic to the viral episome and independent of the cellular environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent shapes and emission counts were measured for comparable TR episomes within the B-cellderived lines BCBL-1 and BJAB, the nonlymphocytic epithelial cell line SLKp, and even the monkey kidney fibroblast cell line COS-7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, regardless of the number, TRs were proportionally occupied by LANA dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This argues for a relatively uniform chromatin environment across the terminal repeats wherein LBS sites are equally accessible to LANA binding in all TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we provided physical proof that TR chromatin folds with parameters characteristic of active chromatin, likely driven by nucleosome-free regions in the TRs, helping to clarify conflicting evidence pertaining to the chromatin state (14, 2933).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, the ability of dSTORM to resolve single TR units within 2TR clusters demonstrates that the episomal half of LANA dimers must be well ordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If LANA dimers radiated randomly from the LBSs or were highly unstructured in their episomal half, we would be unable to separate discrete clusters in the analyses of plasmids containing two TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our data argue that all three LBS sites in individual TRs are likely to be fully occupied by LANA dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrete dimensions and positional asymmetry of the dye emission clusters in the 2TR data are not well accounted for if only two LBS sites are occupied, because the axis through the epitopes of each TR is shortened and there is less bending of the LBS DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, models with three LANA dimers per TR consistently performed better than models with only two LANA dimers per TR in explaining dSTORM data for 26 independent 2TR datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear relationship between LANA dye emissions and TR number suggests that this is true for complete KSHV episomes as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified several key features of tether structure by modeling the 2TR data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the modeling revealed that the internal repeats of LANA likely comprise a coiled-coil domain for the LANA dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This domain was first predicted by in silico analysis, and then supported by quantitative analysis of LN53 mAb binding, and masks all but the two to three N-terminal most mAb binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the modeling highlighted an impact of translational positioning of the nucleosomes for each TR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving each tetranucleosome along the nine possible phases of the DNA helix alters the trajectory of the output TR DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, greatly impacts the relative positions of the LBSs on adjacent TRs and, hence, their associated anti-LANA fluorophore emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The architecture driven by nucleosome positioning and LBS DNA bending positions the LANA N-terminal histone binding domains in a way that facilitates exploration of the surrounding environment, promoting their primary function of tethering to host chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the 2TR model describes most of the tethers well, a few datasets are exceptions mainly due to their having relatively larger Rg values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have proposed large multi-LANA dimer complexes based on crystallography of the C-terminal binding domain (10, 15, 39), and it is possible these 2TR exceptions reflect such assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our current model has some limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it is unlikely that the fixed packing of tetranucleosomes we adapted from the crystallographic structure reflects the full range of conformations adapted by TR nucleosomes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the KSHV tether histones, the histones present in the tetranucleosome crystal structure lacked any posttranslational modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of such modifications might alter the tetrasome structure, potentially loosening or tightening the histone packing, and thereby impact our model and its fit to our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, Chiu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (46) described the clustering of a subset of KSHV episomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we focused on individual TR structures at single-molecule localization precision (10 nm to 30 nm) and excluded any ambiguous structures from our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We occasionally noted single bright LANA dots by epifluorescence, but, most often, dSTORM resolved these into distinct LANA tethers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the N termini of the LANA tethers might have also clustered episomes as Chiu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  suggest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our current working model captures major features of the KSHV tether, detailing the likely stoichiometry and relative positions of its major molecular components emanating from the TR region of the viral genome within the cellular milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model also provides a platform for future experimentation that could include determining the nanoarchitecture of tethers with greater numbers of TRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has broad applicability to a wide variety of persistent viral pathogens, thus potentially contributing to our ability to target them therapeutically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
