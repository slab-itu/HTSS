Mechanosensing drives acuity of  T-cell recognition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T-lymphocyte activation during immune surveillance begins with recognition by its  T-cell receptor (TCR) of a peptide ligand bound to an MHC molecule (pMHC) on infected or otherwise altered cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using optical traps, we show that activation is fostered at the single-molecule level through synergy between external load on the TCRpMHC bond and internal, sustained stepping via motor-dependent transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical thresholds in the absence of load require much higher pMHC density than observed physiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With load, however, T lymphocytes can be reliably activated with 10 pN per TCR molecule, mimicking native shear motions involving a mere two pMHCs at the interaction surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial TCR triggering sensitivity results from synergistic mechanosensing rather than previously postulated serial engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T lymphocytes use surface  T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize peptides bound to MHC molecules (pMHCs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How the exquisite specificity of high-avidity T cells is achieved is unknown but essential, given the paucity of foreign pMHC ligands relative to the ubiquitous self-pMHC array on an APC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using optical traps, we determine physicochemical triggering thresholds based on load and force direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, chemical thresholds in the absence of external load require orders of magnitude higher pMHC numbers than observed physiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, force applied in the shear direction (10 pN per TCR molecule) triggers T-cell Ca2+ flux with as few as two pMHC molecules at the interacting surface interface with rapid positional relaxation associated with similarly directed motor-dependent transport via 8-nm steps, behaviors inconsistent with serial engagement during initial TCR triggering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These synergistic directional forces generated during cell motility are essential for adaptive T-cell immunity against infectious pathogens and cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antigen_Presentation_Assay_to_Mimic_Cell_Triggering_Through_Optically_Trapped_Beads  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TCR triggering was investigated using optical tweezers combined with fluorescence visualization that permits piconewton step force application while simultaneously monitoring Ca2+ flux linked to T-cell triggering (31, 42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study used individual T cells immobilized on the coverslip surface (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before immobilization, cells were preloaded with Quest-Rhod 4 as a Ca2+ indicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Ca2+ flux, an early T-cell activation process, could be visualized by fluorescence enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under bright-field illumination, functionalized beads were held by the fixed trap, and the surface-immobilized T cell was gently repositioned using a piezo stage to facilitate beadcell attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding was visualized directly and through displacement of the bead out of the trap indicated by changes in signal of our position sensing subsystem, which records the bead position at 3 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After binding, the instrument was transitioned to low-light imaging to monitor fluorescence excited by a 532-nm laser with a low light-sensitive Andor Ixon camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were recorded at 0.25 Hz for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under optimal conditions, triggered cells exhibited fluorescence levels that steadily increased, whereas nontriggered cells showed a steady drop in fluorescence caused by photobleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Streptavidin-functionalized 1.09-m beads were coated with biotinylated pMHC (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods of quantification of pMHC on the bead are detailed in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods and Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were subsequently saturated with biotin-labeled BSA (bBSA) to prevent nonspecific interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vectoral piconewton force was generated by stepping the piezo stage to the desired distance to create a displacement X as shown in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trapped bead was calibrated before the attachment, and the trap force was calculated by the product of trap stiffness and X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two different TCRs were used in our studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is the N15 TCR specific for a vesicular stomatitis virus nuclear protein octapeptide (RGYVYQGL) bound to the H-2Kb molecule (VSV8/Kb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is the NP63 TCR specific for influenza A virus PR8 nucleoprotein nonapeptide (NP366; ASNENMETM) bound to the H-2Db molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These TCR epitopes are targets of protective adaptive  T-cell immunity against the two viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable results with these diverse specificities imply the broadness of the dynamic mechanosensing behaviors that we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Chemical_Threshold_for_Triggering_in_the_Absence_of_External_Force_Requires_Numbers_of_pMHC_Molecules_Exceeding_Physiological_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first tested the sensitivity of triggering N15 T cells using beads displaying different VSV8/Kb copy numbers at the beadcell interface in the absence of load, beginning with saturating ligand coverage and diluting until activation was no longer observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were trapped and gently placed on the cell to facilitate attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trap was then immediately turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bead position and fluorescence levels were monitored for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 2A and Movie S1, a saturated VSV8/Kb -coated bead with 2 × 104 molecules at the beadcell interface generated robust TCR triggering (18 of 34 cells) (yellow triangles in Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 200 molecules at the interface, triggering was reduced (4 of 11 cells) with minimal fluorescence increase (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, beads with 29 VSV8/Kb at the interface, a pMHC density found physiologically on normal APCs (44), did not trigger (1 of 28 cells) (green triangles in Fig 2A), and lower pMHC copies (2 VSV8/Kb) did not activate the T cells (0 of 10 cells) (cyan triangles in Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements on T cells with other pMHC ligands were also tested, including the weak agonist L4 [vesicular stomatitis virus nuclear protein octapeptide (VSV8) with p4 V to L VSV8 mutation]/Kb and the unrelated Sendai virus SEV9/Kb complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 200 L4/Kb or SEV9/Kb molecules at the interface, no triggering was observed (0 of 17 cells each) (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed controls with BSA-only coated beads (gray triangles in Fig 2A), with fluorescence signals that were used as background for the nontriggered cells without external trapping force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These control beads manifest no cell surface binding and failed to trigger T cells, despite repeated apposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

External_Force_Enhances_TCR_Sensitivity_to_Achieve_Triggering_Thresholds_with_Limited_Numbers_of_pMHC_Molecules_at_the_Interaction_Interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if external force can facilitate TCR triggering at lower pMHC copy number, a step force was applied by actuating the piezo stage to move the cell relative to the fixed trap, yielding a desired displacement and force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements on T cells with 29 VSV8/Kb at the beadcell interface showed robust triggering (16 of 26 cells) (green circles in Fig 2B) under conditions detailed below using specified directional forces ranging from 10 to 25 pN compared with those without external load (Fig 2 A and B, SI Appendix, Fig S4, and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, beadcell interfaces containing 2 VSV8/Kb molecules yielded 8 of 15 triggered cells at triggering force of 812 pN (cyan circles in Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, with an average 0.5 pMHC copy number per interface, where we expect no more than one TCRpMHC interaction in the beadcell-contacting interface (33), no triggering was observed (Fig 2B, purple circles and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots of fluorescence increase vs. force show a narrow distribution of triggering forces at the 2 VSV8/Kb pMHC copy numbers dependent on force application as described below (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L4/Kb shows triggering at 200 but not at 29 copies per interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the TCR can be triggered with a single sustained interaction, we used one-half anti-TCR V MR9.4 mAb fragment at 0.5 molecules per interface, yielding a robust 12 of 18 cell triggering responses (at 8- to 12-pN shear force) (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S3A, purple).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Triggering_Is_Anisotropic__Preferring_Shear_over_Normal_Directionally_Applied_Loads  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We directly measured the directional dependence of the TCRpMHC interaction with similar step force and identical pMHC numbers at the cellbead interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas step displacements in the shear direction exhibited triggering with as few as two pMHCs at the interface and 10 pN (cyan circles in Fig 2 A and B), forces applied in the normal direction required 18 pN (cyan squares in Fig 2 A and B) to trigger (Fig 2 A and B and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ flux durations triggered by 29 and 2 VSV8/Kb molecules at the interface along the shear direction are 250±92 s (16 cells; ±SD) and 288±119 s (8 cells), respectively, whereas that stimulated by 2 VSV8/Kb at the interface with optimal normal force is only 132±43 s (9 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, beads displaying 29 pMHCs at the interface failed to trigger Ca2+ flux with any force application along the normal direction (green squares in Fig 2 A and B) but triggered along the shear direction (green circles in Fig 2 A and B) using a range of forces examined (Fig 2 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with shear (Fig 2B, purple circles), single molecule-level pMHC (0.5 VSV8/Kb molecules at the interface) failed to trigger TCR with force applied normal to the cell surface (Fig 2B, purple squares and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, triggering with the very weak agonist L4/Kb was only achieved along the shear direction (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggering with the one-half antibody was possible in both shear and normal directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Triggering_Is_Associated_with_Rapid_Relaxation_and_Large_Displacements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our measurements in the absence of force simultaneously monitor bead trajectory and Ca2+ flux caused by T-cell triggering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S5A, cells with pMHC-saturated beads (2×104 VSV8/Kb at the interface) that triggered without force exhibited relatively large displacements (1,000 nm in 200 s) and rapid positional relaxation (peak velocities of 30 nm/s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, during these measurements, the trap is off, only actuated to facilitate the initial bead to cell contact; thus, bead motions originate from the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Change in position is contemporaneous with Ca2+ rise, with peak flux occurring at the end of positional relaxation and within minutes of the initial beadcell association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically, unloaded pMHC-saturated beads with limited displacement (below 625 nm) typically did not trigger (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells which have fewer pMHC molecules at the interface (29 and 2 VSV8/Kb) show little responsiveness, with no correlation between displacement and Ca2+ flux, even for those showing large displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the presence of shear force, cells exhibit complete positional relaxation as shown in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, force increases as a step and steadily decreases as the bead moves back to the trap center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggered and nontriggered traces were pooled, normalized, and fit to a single exponential decay to extract representative time constants for the average forcedisplacement transients (Fig 3B) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force-triggered cells exhibit rapid positional relaxation (Fig 3B, dashed lines) followed by a rise in Ca2+ signal (SI Appendix, Fig S6, red lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traces were also fit individually to map the relation between trigger state, relaxation time, and force (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed fitting procedures are illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S7A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate that, for cells stimulated with 29 VSV8/Kb at the interface, triggered cells relaxed more quickly than nontriggered cells: 0.44±4.65×104 s compared with 52.42±8.82×103 s, respectively, for all measured forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For T cells stimulated with cognate ligands at identical interfacial copy number (two pMHCs), triggered cells can be represented by a window centered around 10 pN exhibiting a relaxation width of 10 s compared with nontriggered cells neighboring this window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subset of particularly fast relaxing, nontriggered cells (average 0.44±4.89×104 s) remained bound but was effectively only under load for a fraction of a second (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few beads with single molecule-level array (0.5 VSV8/Kb) led to abrupt unbinding, where the bead snapped back to the trap center within 5 ms (n = 19) (SI Appendix, Fig S7 B and C) and failed to trigger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C shows clearly that the triggered N15 T cells were centered in the same window irrespective of whether pMHC was competent to bind the CD8 coreceptor (VSV8/Kb) or mutated to abrogate coreceptor binding to the Kb 3 domain (VSV8/Kbm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NP63 TCR-expressing T cells also yielded the same profile using NP366/Dbm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results with triggered N15 and NP63 T cells using VSV8/Kbm and NP336/Dbm beads were pooled and illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S8 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible triggering mechanism is illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S8C, highlighting that, because the pulling direction is shear, TCRpMHC bonds at the back edge of the bead will sustain the load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR-triggered Ca2+ flux requires that the magnitude of pulling force on each single TCRpMHC complex achieve a 10-pN physical threshold as well as an optimal relaxation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A greater force (i.e., 20 pN) is required for TCR triggering with 29 VSV8/Kb at the interface, because the load is distributed across multiple bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For pulls in the normal direction (SI Appendix, Fig S9A), relaxation includes an initial exponential decay and then, a terminal position, where unlike pulling in shear, complete relaxation to the trap center is not achieved (SI Appendix, Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial relaxation portion exhibited exponential time constants (0.110 s) similar to shear pulls above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike pulls in the shear direction, large displacement relaxations in the normal direction were not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S9C, with 2 VSV8/Kb at the interface, the T cell can be triggered and exhibited partial relaxation (n = 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beadcell interface with higher density (29 VSV8/Kb) did not trigger the TCR but exhibited frustrated motion caused by active intracellular processes with a sustained displacement similar to 2 VSV8/Kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-molecule densities (0.5 VSV8/Kb) failed to trigger the TCR because of abrupt unbinding returning to the trap center within 5 ms (n = 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible triggering mechanism along the normal direction is illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S9D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force, shared evenly by the 2 VSV8/Kb molecules, requires 20 pN to reach the TCR triggering threshold for any single TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 29 VSV8/Kb at the interface, however, force is distributed among many TCRs, where any single TCR is below the threshold force for triggering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data and those in Fig 3 also rationalize the distinctions among the vectoral pulling forces required to trigger T-cell activation in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar optimal triggering windows were obtained for L4/Kb and one-half antibody shear triggering (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Regular_Steps_Linked_to_Actomyosin_Machinery_Rather_than_TCR_Serial_Engagement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the prominence of T cell-induced bead motion on TCRpMHC ligation, we studied these movements in greater detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bead motion reveals discrete steps after shear force application at threshold pMHC numbers (2 VSV8/Kb at the interface).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The traces are characteristic of single-molecule motility of motor proteins on cytoskeletal filaments (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular stepping occurs with average displacements and dwells of 7.7 nm for the primary peak (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional step analysis is found in SI Appendix, Fig S11A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out steps being caused by sequentially unbinding and rebinding of TCRs, we stabilized the pMHCTCR interaction with H57 Fab, with a single-TCR binding site on the FG loop of the C domain that leads to a 10-fold increase in bond lifetime (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H57 Fab-ligated T cells exhibited similar step size and dwell times of 8.1 nm (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To unveil the origin of the steps, we challenged the cells with cytoskeletal disrupting drugs, including Nocodazole (Nozo), Cytochalasin D (CytoD), and Blebbistatin (Blebb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drug studies were conducted using concentrations that significantly disrupt the cytoskeleton but avoid cell toxicities that alter overall cell shape or ability to obtain measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step probability and peak location were unaffected by 10 M Nozo, a microtubule depolymerizer (Fig 4C) (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nozo blocks Lck phosphorylation (48) but enhances myosin regulatory light-chain phosphorylation, which induces activation of the motor (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both CytoD, an actin depolymerizer at 500 nM, and Blebb, a myosin inhibitor at 25 M, showed clear reduction in step probability (Fig 4 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig S11B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normally, we can extract 7.5 steps per trace, which were reduced to 3.4 and 1.2 steps for CytoD and Blebb, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebb also shifted the step size distribution to 11.0 nm and reduced bead velocity returning to the trap center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular 8-nm steps were also visualized for another TCRpMHC pair (NP63 TCRNP366/Dbm) (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified, naïve N15 transgenic CD8+ T cells (SI Appendix, Fig S12A) exhibited step-linked triggering (SI Appendix, Fig S12 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cells challenged with drugs did not trigger as expected given the significant role of the cytoskeleton in TCR triggering (Fig 4H, SI Appendix, Fig S13, and Movie S4) (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although H57 typically inhibits triggering (31), at high forces (23 pN), some cells showed an increase in Ca2+-mediated fluorescence but with reduced Ca2+ flux: 85±29 s (8 of 20) above 22 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force relaxation time also shows significant difference when cells are treated with CytoD and Blebb (Fig 4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concept of serial engagement was suggested, because very few pMHC ligands on an APC induced loss of hundreds of copies of surface TCRs on the relevant antigen-specific interacting T cell over a timeframe of many hours (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rather than a direct serial single-pMHC ligation of many TCRs at initial TCR triggering, establishment of a network of cytoskeletal interactions might indirectly modulate TCR distribution and/or surface expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility by developing a two-bead assay, with both beads opposed to a T cell in the absence of external force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One bead is coated with a low copy number of nonactivating anti-CD3 mAb 17A2 (31) to monitor pMHC-unligated TCRs on the cell, while a second bead of different size arrays high density-specific pMHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5 and Movie S5, only in activated T cells (i.e., fluxing Ca2+) does the 17A2 bead move a greater distance to become more proximal to the pMHC bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon may relate to activation of motors in the vicinity of the motor ligated to the triggered (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence of TCRs is consistent with initiation of IS formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothetically, serial engagement in the early timeframe (seconds to minutes) would exhibit random dwell displacements caused by sequential bond rupture and rebinding with step time intervals no greater than 5 ms (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7C, S9B, and S10B), the time measured for a ruptured bead to completely snap back to the trap center, whereas we observed a dwell time between steps ranging from 100- to 400-ms intervals (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S1F shows functional avidity plots of N15 for VSV8 and L4 as well as NP63 for NP366 depicting IL-2 production in response to graded peptide stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the functional avidities differ by 10,000-fold among these receptorligand pairs and no pattern of 5 ms t was observed, the phenomenon of serial engagement is not occurring in this timeframe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TCR_Triggering_Impacted_by_Directional_Tangential_Force  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Failed TCR triggering associated with slow force relaxation could be rescued by rapidly reversing the pulling direction, resulting in a fast relaxation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative studies were performed on beads presenting 29 VSV8/Kb at the interface with N15 T cells (Fig 6A and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TCRs are reported to directly link to actin filaments via CD3 chains (51), the fast- vs. slow-force relaxation could be explained by the assistance or hindrance, respectively, of the optical trap force as shown in Fig 6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordance of force direction resulting from actin motion and optical trap as applied to the TCR could facilitate release of the force-dependent structural transition of the TCR  heterodimerpMHC complex (33, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the structural extension would persist in the case of a pMHC-arrayed bead, slowly relaxing back to trap center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is consistent with that of a T cell performing immune surveillance on an APC surface; force loaded on the TCR through one direction [e.g., cell moving/spreading direction or microvilli protrusion (5355)] may be quickly released by the motion along the other direction (e.g., actin retrograde flow), as shown in Fig 6C (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although N15 T cell-triggering rescue is hard to actuate for 2 VSV8/Kb molecules at the interface, hallmarks distinguishing fast from slow relaxation are evident when the position of the VSV8/Kb-coated bead is close to the trap center (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, bead traces exhibiting fast relaxation smoothly return to the trap center (SI Appendix, Fig S15 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, slow trajectories exhibit fluctuations and even step against the trap at low displacements (SI Appendix, Fig S15C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results reveal a clear force vector directionality linked to successful TCR triggering by pMHC at the single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T cells executing surveillance motions orchestrate a complex process that operates on many length scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells leading edge, microvilli, uropod, and trailing elements exhibit extensions and retractions as adhesions are formed and broken, exerting nanonewton forces to deform the underlying substratum (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the cell, actin structures cycle through states of polymerization, depolymerization, and flow mediated by motors and actin binding proteins that couple filaments, sever filaments, generate branches, cap ends, and facilitate depolymerization (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells cluster their TCRs in the uropod, which is central to the cell and tied to actin structure undergoing retrograde flow (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells exhibit frequent periods of persistent motion but with intermittent stops and turns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying adhesions result in pulling and dragging motions, where shear forces similar in magnitude and direction to those in our experiments can be generated (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that the native environment of the TCR mechanosensor exploits direct coupling to the cell motility machinery for its performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell motions provide the energy to activate the 10-nm×10-pN conformational change, where the equivalent of 100 pNnm work is done on the system (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At physiological pMHC numbers, triggering requires external load (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a triggering preference for shear vs. normal-directed forces as occur when T cells perform their scanning functions (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S9) (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stresses were applied experimentally via loading through our optical trap system, delivering, on average, 10 pN per TCRpMHC interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anisotropic response can be explained, in part, by geometrical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR triggering along the normal direction shares the load equally among each interfacial TCRpMHC complex (SI Appendix, Fig S9D) and thus, requires a greater overall pulling force for any one of them to breach the 10-pN conformational change threshold (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, shear motion distributes the force unevenly at the beadcell interface, concentrating it where fewer TCRs engage (SI Appendix, Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for shear pulls, triggering is seen with both 29 and 2 pMHC interfacial molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Without load, the TCR can be triggered when 2×104 VSV8/Kb molecules are present at the beadcell interface (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the high densities provide a stabilizing interface to create multiple points against which internal cytoskeletal forces can pull to activate TCRpMHC mechanosensors (40, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, triggered cells are associated with large bead displacements along the shear direction (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a high-density array is relevant to exogenously loaded APCs under in vitro conditions but rarely, if at all, to naturally processed viral antigens (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to force, direction impacts coupling of the mechanosensor to the underlying actin machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shear pulls permit motility of TCRs along actomyosin structures, even at low pMHC copy number (2 pMHC) at the interface (Fig 4 A and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulling in the normal direction directs the TCR away from membrane-associated actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with this anisotropic phenomenon, as a much stronger Ca2+ flux is seen with shear over normal pulls (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bead trajectories for cells that trigger reveal processive active transport in the direction of applied shear force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although visually, the bead positional relaxation appears smooth, the high spatiotemporal resolution of our instrument allows discrete stepping of the TCR coupling to the actin machinery to be detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the step size (8 nm) suggests microtubule-based transport, drug inhibition studies and stall force (3.8 pN) measured here (Fig 4 A and F and SI Appendix, Fig S15) are consistent with myosin-based transport (and steps sizes) on actin filaments (6365).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot formally rule out that the transients originate from bulk contraction of actomyosin networks, release of actin cross-linkers or other attachments, or encountering of other obstacles in the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, SI Appendix, Fig S15 shows motion against the trap force, revealing that active transport contributes to bead behavior after an activating manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike the rapid and relatively long-distance bead motion observed in triggered cells, bead trajectories of most nontriggered cells show a slow return to the trap center (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow relaxation further suggests that a strong linkage connects the TCR to cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a fluid-like microenvironment, with TCR uncoupled to the underlying actin structure, results in fast bead relaxation to zero displacement as the large trap force easily overcomes the relatively small drag force of the TCR complex within the membrane (Fig 3B, dotted blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluid-like relaxation is directly seen in some traces, which exhibit distinctly faster timescales relative to observed active motility (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, while naïve cells that triggered showed stepping, those that failed to trigger did not relax to the trap center (SI Appendix, Fig S12D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, rapid fluid-like relaxation is not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the greater densities of TCR and associated actomyosin on the surface of the 4-m-diameter naïve cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct coupling to underlying cytoskeleton is a desirable feature underpinning our mechanosensor model, as TCR activation requires a sustained load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct connection to actin (i.e., a load-sustaining pathway) is likely through a single active motor, because discrete steps are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If multiple motors were transporting the TCR, then that discreteness would be blurred, and the single-molecule nature of the stepping would be lost because of averaging over an ensemble of motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rescue experiments (Fig 6A) also support the model that motility is linked to actomyosin and a single or small number of motors and only permitted in a direction aligned with the polarity of the underlying actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggered T cells manifest actomyosin motion in the direction of force application; thus, load is in a direction that assists motility (SI Appendix, Fig S15A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force in the opposite direction works against motility and opposes transport, setting up a tug of war between the trap and motor, leading to a stall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myosin II stall forces have been reported in the range of 3.4±0.9 pN, consistent with lack of motion against the 10- to 20-pN trap forces applied here (SI Appendix, Fig S15C) (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a handful of motors was engaged and activated, collectively, they would likely overcome the opposing trap force and displace the bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectories of nontriggered cells under load exhibit small amplitude displacements above the thermal noise distribution of the trapped bead, likely driven by TCR-linked actomyosin machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the TCR complex has a wide base, optical trap shear load applied parallel to actin structures, analogous to forces at work during immune surveillance motion, will torque the mechanosensor apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pushing and pulling on signaling structures drive T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observe some bead motion at low force, TCR activation correlates with activation of cytoskeleton motility (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of mechanisms may drive the latter, including phosphorylation, Ca2+ increase, and mechanically triggering activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motors within the neighboring microenvironment may be able to receive these signals and activate their associated TCRs to amplify the signaling cascade (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two-bead experiments, a pMHC array-saturated bead was used to trigger the cell, while a second bead coated with a nonstimulatory anti-CD3 mAb (31) showed motion toward the triggered bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motion was not observed in cases where the pMHC-coated bead failed to trigger the cell, suggesting that the triggering event activates neighboring motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, during T-cell activation, the neighboring, nonengaged TCRs will accumulated at the contact site (67) by direct active transportation of F-actincoupled TCRs and assembly of initial noncoupled TCRs to F-actin through ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, without direct connection to the cytoskeleton to sustain load and drive force generation, the TCRpMHC bond simply unbinds or displaces within the fluid-like membrane, never achieving critical load thresholds required for mechanosensor-based activation, including bond strengthening, conformational change, and other push and pull motions (33, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fluid-like microenvironment does not have the densely organized actin machinery of a motile cell, and thus, second wave signaling after TCRpMHC triggering is muted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, load in the normal direction pulls the TCR away from membrane-associated actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We underscore that mechanosensor activation requires a physical anchor, namely the underlying actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, our pulling geometry capitalizes on cell surface attachment to the coverslip, where an organized actin structure is created (Fig 1B, Inset) (69), similar to that of T cells scanning a cellular substratum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads are placed on the side of the cell adjacent to this structure, where TCRs are engaged with actin machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biomembrane force probe analysis has been used to investigate early T-cell activation events (19) by applying load through pMHC to the distal pole of the T cell, typically opposite the holding micropipette location, where organized actin structure is sparse or lacking (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeat pulls are required to activate individual T cells with force direction normal to the cell surface (which we have shown here is less efficient than shear force).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligated TCRs likely form a locus to organize actin machinery, permitting actomyosin-mediated motility and neighboring TCR signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because signal buildup independent of those originating from a single TCR contributes to T-cell activation, the process is empirically conceptualized as cumulative bond lifetime (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The threshold studies on three different systems show a very similar window for triggering requirements centered at 812 pN (Fig 3C), force ranges and relaxation times consistent with myosin stepping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forces below this region do not permit catch bond formation necessary to create an energized TCRpMHC bond (19, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, higher force regimes also fail to trigger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we believe that these TCRpMHC molecular interactions are capable of supporting conformational change, they may either rapidly rupture or not allow repetitive hopping back and forth between conformational states seen in our single-molecule experiments (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actomyosin-based transport acts as a force regulator, maintaining the TCRpMHC system within this window optimal for conformational transitioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oscillating conformational changes in single TCRs likely foster signal transmission by altering membrane lipids, inducing transmembrane segment conformational change, or exposing interfacial cytoplasmic tail segments for downstream modifications (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our triggering of single cells is quite robust, with 53.3% of T cells triggered by the lowest pMHC density studied here using optimally applied force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frequency is remarkable, assuming a 50:50 chance of applying the correct pulling direction relative to actin polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Supported lipid bilayer (SLB) experiments investigating TCR activation are performed at high pMHC densities, where the T cell is able to elicit signals without an apparent external force and in geometries initially devoid of organized actin (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells are then placed on the bilayer surface, establishing fluid-like areas in which TCRspMHC bonds move freely flanked by rigid supports, where their motion is blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force across the TCR can only be sustained against those supports or within internal cellular actomyosin structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The triggering chemical thresholds are very high for SLB experiments, 0.2 pMHC per 1 m2, which corresponds to 16 pMHC beneath the cell (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least four pMHCs within a single TCR cluster spanning 400×400 nm2 and containing 18100 TCRs are sufficient to induce the Ca2+ flux (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCRpMHC clusters form and begin to organize actin machinery, eliciting transport and IS formation with distal, peripheral, and central supramolecular activation clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggering is not immediate but requires sufficient ligand density and time (minutes) to generate motions and forces necessary for clustering and triggering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mature IS contains all of the features of our mechanosensor-based activation, including shear motions and the ability to generate force across a TCRpMHC bond, processive motility, and activation and transport of neighboring TCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These IS structures are reflective of uropod actin organization for mediating rapid Ca2+ flux and motor activation featured by our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier studies have suggested that only a single or very few pMHC molecules per APC/target cell are required to stimulate T-cell activation (7274).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our lowest pMHC densities capable of triggering cells involve two pMHC molecules at the interface, the bead trajectories with nanometer-scale resolution suggest that a single interaction is sustaining the load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the second molecule serves to stabilize the interaction along a line, defined by two points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with adhesion activation studies requiring two ligands in related systems (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our assay geometry recreates many of the elements found in cells undergoing surveillance, it lacks APC adhesion molecules, such as CD58/48, that are known to be important for cognate recognition by pairing with CD2 on the T cell to enforce the relevant intermembrane spacing between cells forming conjugates (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the context of a T-celltarget cell or T-cellAPC conjugate, one TCRpMHC bond is probably sufficient to trigger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggering with single molecules of the MR9.4 mAb fragment supports this notion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Serial engagement is a leading model for T-cell activation based on a concept of sequential binding and unbinding of a single pMHC molecule to multiple TCRs (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model rests on evidence that many TCRs on a single T cell are down-regulated in the presence of small numbers of pMHC molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial engagement has morphed over years to incorporate arguments germane to 2D vs. 3D apparent binding kinetics (77), rationalizing the requirements for optimal TCR affinity to avoid interactions that are too strong or too weak to achieve repeat binding and sustained T-cell signaling (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) suggested that serial engagement is occurring through early and rapidly accumulated bond lifetimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple observations made here are in direct conflict with serial engagement as being critical for initial TCR activation over seconds to minutes as opposed to hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we observe immediate and direct stepping in trajectories of beads triggering cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate a rapid, sustained, systematic, and strong connection to the actomyosin-based machinery (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in the presence of H57 Fab, which extends the N15 TCR-VSV8/Kb bond lifetime 10-fold, where any unbinding probability is further reduced (33), we observe a similar stepping signature, suggesting that TCRpMHC maintains a single bond throughout the trajectory (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, given known estimates for 2D densities of pMHC and TCRs at the beadcell interface, the probability in our system of pMHC rupturing and binding a second TCR is less than 1% (77, 78) at the single-molecule level (0.5 VSV8/Kb at interface).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we would expect to see only a single binding event during the trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, for experiments where we observe unbinding, beads return to the trap center within 5 ms (SI Appendix, Fig S7C), a time window extremely short with respect to requirements for serially engaging a second receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If serial engagement were occurring, we would observe a single short dwell followed by a single rupture and snap back to the center of the trap position (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we observe regular discrete steps (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also consistent with single-pMHC tracking experiments, showing that reentrapment of the same pMHC with multiple TCRs nearby is unlikely after it is disengaged from the TCR (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, conditions expected to severely reduce serial engagement, such as pulling in the normal force direction where pMHC is moved away from the cell surface, reducing the probability for repeat binding, still allow triggering (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, a wide array of ligand affinities was investigated here, where weaker binding L4 showed reduced triggering over VSV8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sustained binding through a single one-half antibody was capable of triggering cells at the single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixth, we can directly show clustering of pMHC-triggered and pMHC-untriggered TCRs in two-bead experiments (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our two-bead measurements suggest that serial engagement is not required for initiation of IS formation in this timeframe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The translational implications of our findings are significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell activation requires recognition of but a handful of specific pMHC ligands on a given target cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sensitive TCR signal transduction apparatus is dependent on external mechanical force resulting from cell movement and coordinated intracellular retrograde cortical actin flow similarly directed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A correlate is that foreign antigens derived from infectious pathogens or nonsynonymous mutations in tumor exons need not be displayed at more than a few copies on the target, because the TCR functions as an exquisitely sensitive anisotropic mechanosensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly potent CTL for adoptive immunotherapy may be most effectively stimulated in vitro on relevant pMHC molecule arrays using piconewton shear forces to train and expand CTL for subsequent in vivo use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) consisting of an antibody antigen binding fragment of predefined specificity as an ectodomain linked to an intracellular T-cell activation domain originally proposed by Eshhar and coworkers in 1989 (80) have shown great clinical promise recently (81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular features of TCR mechanobiology revealed here should be exploited to optimize the synthetic biology of CAR-T design to confer heightened potency as well as intrinsic regulation features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Various external mechanical force applications using optical traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single pMHC-functionalized bead (d = 1.09 m) was trapped with a 1,064-nm laser (stiffness 0.060.13 pN/nm) and placed alongside a surface-bound T cell with an automated piezoelectric stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bead position relative to the trap was monitored so that contact could be achieved with minimal pushing force (less_than5 pN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After T cellbead contact was verified, differential interference contrast (DIC) images were taken to calculate the contact area between bead and cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contact area was calculated as the surface area of a zone of a spherical cap with its height, which was controlled during the course of the experiment by viewing the position signal along the normal direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shear or normal force was then applied to the bead by displacing the bead-attached cell relative to the fixed trap using fine motions of the piezo stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force on the bead was determined by measuring the trap stiffness before cellbead contact by the equipartition method and by measuring the displacement of the bead from the trapping center via postprocessing of experiment videos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distances between bead and trap center were sampled at 3 kHz, antialias-filtered at 1.5 kHz, and recorded for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, T cells were excited using a 532-nm laser to monitor Ca2+-sensitive Quest Rhod-4 fluorescence every 4 s right after force application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays were performed at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these experiments were done using an automated custom-built optical trap designed for simultaneous force and fluorescence experiments at the single-molecule and single-cell scales (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details can be found in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
