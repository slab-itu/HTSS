Insights into the origin of carbonaceous chondrite organics from their triple oxygen isotope composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Refractory organic matter found in volatile-rich asteroidal materials essentially comprise the elements C, H, O, N, and S, which are thought to be important building blocks for life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the origin(s) of these organics thus constitutes a key step to constrain the origin of life on Earth and appraise the habitability potential of other worlds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how and where these organics formed are still highly debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have determined the oxygen isotope composition of refractory organics from two families of carbonaceous chondrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that these organics formed in the nascent Solar System, possibly through chemical reactions occurring in the disk surrounding the young Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dust grains of organic matter were the main reservoir of C and N in the forming Solar System and are thus considered to be an essential ingredient for the emergence of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physical environment and the chemical mechanisms at the origin of these organic grains are still highly debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report high-precision triple oxygen isotope composition for insoluble organic matter isolated from three emblematic carbonaceous chondrites, Orgueil, Murchison, and Cold Bokkeveld.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the O isotope composition of carbonaceous chondrite insoluble organic matter falls on a slope 1 correlation line in the triple oxygen isotope diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of detectable mass-dependent O isotopic fractionation, indicated by the slope 1 line, suggests that the bulk of carbonaceous chondrite organics did not form on asteroidal parent bodies during low-temperature hydrothermal events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, these O isotope data, together with the H and N isotope characteristics of insoluble organic matter, may indicate that parent bodies of different carbonaceous chondrite types largely accreted organics formed locally in the protosolar nebula, possibly by photochemical dissociation of C-rich precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 17O and 18O values measured by L-SIMS in the Orgueil, Murchison, and Cold Bokkeveld IOM residues range between 23.3 ± 2.4 and +18.9 ± 2.4 and 18.0 ± 2.3 and +16.9 ± 2.3 (uncertainties reported at 2), respectively (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Least-square regression through all of the data yields a line defined by 17O = 1.00 (±0.14) × 18O  3.78 (±1.35) (95% confidence level, n = 36, r2 = 0.86), which is indistinguishable from the relationship known as the carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous mineral (CCAM) line (17O = 0.95 × 18O  4.18) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NanoSIMS data allow determining O isotope ratios with larger uncertainties than those obtained by L-SIMS, but with higher spatial resolution, that is, over region of interests (ROI) that can be selected from ion imaging to minimize the effect of residual oxides and/or silicates, located through analysis of 28Si and 56Fe16O simultaneously with O isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NanoSIMS analyses obtained over 40-m2 areas in Murchison and Orgueil IOM residues show little 28Si hot spots but more abundant micrometer-size 16O-enriched areas (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 16O hot spots are generally associated with 56Fe16O hot spots, suggesting that magnetite and/or chromite are the main mineral phases that have resisted acid maceration treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terms of surface, these 16O-enriched ROIs represent 1618% and 1221% of the total 40 × 40-m areas analyzed in Murchison and Orgueil, respectively, while pure IOM ROIs, defined based on 16O intensity maps (Materials and Methods), comprise 2131% and 1820% of the Murchison- and Orgueil-analyzed areas, respectively (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processed NanoSIMS data indicate that the 17,18O values of the residual O-rich inclusions in Murchison tend to be 2040 lower than the 17,18O values obtained for O-rich inclusions in Orgueil (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17,18O values obtained for Murchison pure IOM areas are around 0 to +10, while Orgueil pure IOM areas tend to have higher 17,18O values around +10 to +30 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the O isotope composition estimated for Murchison and Orgueil pure IOM using NanoSIMS are roughly consistent with the 17,18O-rich end of the trends defined by Murchison and Orgueil acid residues L-SIMS data (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessing_the_Level_of_Contamination_from_Residuals_Microinclusions_in_IOM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main challenge in determining the O isotope composition of IOM isolated from carbonaceous chondrites is related to the presence of residual nanoinclusions to microinclusions that have resisted acid maceration, as shown here by NanoSIMS imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between O isotope values estimated for pure IOM based on high-resolution NanoSIMS analyses and the most 17,18O-rich compositions obtained by L-SIMS for Murchison and Orgueil acid residues, respectively, suggest that the latter provide an accurate estimate for the O isotope composition of Murchison and Orgueil IOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus consider here that the average values calculated from the two most 17,18O-rich compositions measured by L-SIMS on both Murchison and Orgueil provide us with the best estimates for the O isotope compositions of pure IOM end-members in these samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yields 18O = +4.7 ± 7.7 (2 SD) and 17O = +2.9 ± 10.3 (2 SD) for Murchison IOM and 18O = +16.6 ± 0.8 (2 SD) and 17O = +17.0 ± 5.2 (2 SD) for Orgueil IOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 presents the results of mixing calculations, where O isotope compositions have been calculated for mixed compositions between the IOM 17,18O values calculated from the 17,18O-rich L-SIMS data for Murchison and Orgueil and the most negative 17,18O values measured in mineral phases in both Murchison (approximately 40 for spinel; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) and Orgueil (approximately 10 for olivine; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calculations show that up to 50% and 80% contamination of the Murchison and Orgueil O signals, respectively, by 16O-rich residual mineral phases could explain the spread of 17,18O values measured by L-SIMS (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such levels of contamination are consistent with NanoSIMS data obtained over 40-m2 areas selected randomly in Murchison and Orgueil acid residues (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these calculations are also consistent with O-rich contaminants in Murchison being characterized by 17,18O values 2040 lower than those of O-rich inclusions in Orgueil (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Table S2), even though it is not possible to estimate their true 17,18O values corrected for NanoSIMS instrumental mass fractionation since their exact mineralogy was not determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Bulk_and_SIMS-Derived_Oxygen_Isotope_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because O-rich residual contaminants have lower 17,18O values than IOM, it is important to note that the pure IOM O isotope compositions calculated from 17,18O-rich L-SIMS analyses provide minimum estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18O and 17O values estimated for Orgueil IOM by L-SIMS (+16.6 ± 0.8 and +17.0 ± 5.2, respectively) are higher than the bulk 18O and 17O values determined by Halbout et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23) (+6.0 ± 0.8 and +3.4 ± 0.4, respectively), which may indicate that their O isotope ratios were also affected by contamination issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the 18O value estimated for Orgueil IOM by L-SIMS is in good agreement with the bulk 18O value of +14.5 ± 0.6 determined by Alexander et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Murchison IOM, the 18O value calculated from L-SIMS analyses of +4.7 ± 7.7 (2 SD) is lower than the bulk IOM 18O values of +13.8 ± 1.6 (n = 2, 2 SD) determined by Alexander et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors take advantage of the oxidation of sulfides in air over several days to gradually remove them from acid residues (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modification of the O isotope composition of organic O-bearing chemical functions during such oxidation of acid residues in air may be a possibility to explain the discrepancy between bulk and L-SIMS 18O values obtained for Murchison IOM, since atmospheric O2 has a 18O value of approximately +23 to 24 (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that our L-SIMS 18O estimate for Murchison IOM does not correspond to pure IOM but to IOM still contaminated by minute amounts of O-rich residual inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, it is not possible to favor one of these two hypotheses over the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, 18O values obtained on CM chondrite bulk IOM are characterized by much larger variations (from 3.7 in Essebi to +14.4 in Murchison, both meteorites being observed falls) compared with other chondrite types (11, 12), which may either be related to variable contamination issues of bulk analyses or indicate that CM chondrites accreted IOM with variable O isotope compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, further bulk and in situ investigations are required to fully explore this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Triple_Oxygen_Isotope_Constraints_on_the_Origin_of_Carbonaceous_Chondrite_IOM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The O isotope compositions estimated for Murchison IOM (17,18O = approximately +35) and Orgueil IOM (17,18O = approximately +17) fall on the slope 1 line in a 17O vs. 18O diagram (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As highlighted by Alexander et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11), 18O values of the CI and CM chondrite IOM are similar to those of their matrix component (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the bulk and matrix 17O values obtained in CI chondrites appear to be lower compared with the 17O of Orgueil IOM (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, combined with the O isotope composition of CICM chondrite original anhydrous silicates, of matrix silicates, and of primordial alteration waters (which are thought to be similar for CI and CM chondrite parent bodies; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 and 2629), thus seem to rule out scenarios in which the O isotope composition of O-bearing functional groups in CI chondrite IOM resulted from O isotope exchange between organic precursors and silicate components during aqueous alteration on the CI chondrite parent body (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, because of the larger uncertainty associated with the 17,18O estimates for Murchison IOM, its formation during hydrothermal alteration on the CM parent body cannot be totally excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The limited existing O isotope dataset obtained on a handful of CC meteorites so far suggests that IOM in the CI chondrite Orgueil tends to be enriched in 17,18O compared with IOM in the CM chondrite Murchison (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this relationship is consistent with the variations of average H and N isotope compositions in CM and CI IOM, where CI IOM is enriched in D and 15N compared with CM IOM (11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D and 15N enrichments commonly observed in CC IOM have generally been attributed to low-temperature processes (less_than150 K) such as ionmolecule reactions taking place in dense interstellar media or at the surface of the PSN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent experimental studies focused on the IOM molecular structure (9, 39), its bulk D/H (40) and the occurrence of D/H hot spots (41), and its noble gas isotope signatures (9), have argued that CC IOM could be produced by photochemical reactions involving organic radicals and taking place in the PSN regions where solar UV irradiation would have induced dissociation of CxHy molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments have shown that photochemical reactions can produce mass-independent O isotope anomalies (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could thus postulate that the mass-independent isotopic fractionation of oxygen isotopes in CC IOM also resulted from chemical reactions involving radical chemistry of CHON-bearing species in the PSN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If correct, such an effect now remains to be experimentally documented in a setting relevant to organics formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cosmochemical_Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The O isotope compositions estimated for CICM chondrite IOM fall on a slope 1 line in a 17O vs. 18O diagram, which, at a larger scale, describes the O isotope variations of most Solar System objects such as the Sun, high-temperature phases (i.e., CAI and chondrules) formed during the first few million years of Solar System evolution, and terrestrial planets for example (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the origin of this slope 1 line in planetary materials is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible mechanism involves self-shielding of 16O-rich CO gas by UV light during photodissociation (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42), but whether this occurred in the presolar molecular cloud (45) or in the PSN (46) remains debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O isotope compositions of CC IOM appear to fall on a slope 1 line; it could thus be argued that oxygen contained in CC IOM derived from a combination of that found in 16O-rich CO and 17,18O-rich H2O molecules formed as a result of self-shielding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the different CC parent bodies accreted IOM sourced from a common carbonaceous reservoir, formed in the presolar molecular cloud, one may expect the various asteroidal parent bodies to have accreted presolar IOM grains characterized by similar O isotope compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different triple O isotope compositions for Orgueil and Murchison IOM, dispersed along the slope 1 line, do not seem to favor such a scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, and considering that Murchison and Orgueil IOM O isotope compositions are representative of those of CM and CI IOM in general, the observation that 17,18OCM IOM less_than 17,18OCI IOM, consistently with what has been measured for H and N isotope data (DCM IOM less_than DCI IOM and 15NCM IOM less_than 15NCI IOM; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 and 12), may indicate that carbonaceous asteroids accreted IOM that formed locally in the PSN through photochemical radical chemistry involving CHON-bearing species (9, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its elevated D and 15N values, it has been proposed that CR IOM could represent the least processed IOM component accreted in carbonaceous asteroids (see discussion in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the observed relationship between H, N, and O isotope compositions in CI and CM chondrite IOM, we would expect CR chondrite IOM to have 17,18O values higher than those of CI chondrite IOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining with high precision the triple O isotope composition of CR chondrite IOM would thus provide important constraints to further explore the formation mechanism(s) of CC IOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Organic_Matter_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IOM was isolated from the Orgueil, Murchison, and Cold Bokkeveld carbonaceous chondrite meteorites through successive demineralization using a HF/HCl acidic treatment (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powdered meteorite samples were first stirred at room temperature in water, followed by CH2Cl2/MeOH [2/1 (vol/vol)], to remove soluble organic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonates were then removed at room temperature using 6 M HCl to minimize the formation of fluorides during HF/HCl maceration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then centrifuged and washed with distilled water until reaching neutrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation of IOM was achieved through acid maceration at room temperature in a HF/HCl mixture [2/1 (vol/vol)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were further centrifuged and washed with distilled water to reach neutrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neoformed fluorides were then degraded using 6 M HCl at 60 °C for 24 h. After HCl hot-acid maceration, IOM residues were washed with distilled water until reaching neutrality and thoroughly dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SIMS investigations, a few milligrams of IOM samples were pressed into high-purity indium (99.999%) and carbon coated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IMS_1270_80_Secondary_Ion_Mass_Spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Triple O isotope compositions of the IOM samples were measured using the CAMECA IMS 1270 E7 and 1280 HR2 ion probe instruments at the Centre de Recherches Pétrographiques et Géochimiques in Nancy, France, over several analytical sessions, using identical analytical protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative 16O, 17O, and 18O secondary ions produced using a 10-nA Cs+ primary beam, accelerated at 10 kV and rastered over 20-m diameter areas, were measured in multicollection mode with one Faraday cup (FC) on the L2 trolley for 16O and two electron multipliers (EMs) for 17O (central EM) and 18O (H2 EM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize peak flatness, entrance and exit slits were adjusted to achieve a mass resolving power of 8,000 for 17O on the central EM and 2,500 on the off-axis L2 FC and H2 EM (using slit #1 of the off-axis collectors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OM samples contain significant amounts of OH (average 16OH/17O, 97 ± 17, 120 ± 31, and 121 ± 20 in Orgueil IOM, Murchison IOM, and Cold Bokkeveld IOM, respectively), and the protocol used did not completely eliminate contribution from the 16OH tail on the 17O peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this contribution and adequately correct the measured 17O/16O ratios, we assumed that the 16OH peak was symmetrical, calculated the mass difference between the center of the 17O (16.9991 amu) and 16OH (17.0027 amu) peaks, and counted the 16OH tail intensity at mass 17.0063 amu (mass 16OH + [mass 16OH  mass 17O]) for 50 s before and after each analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 16OH tail/peak ratios were 1.5 ± 0.5 × 105 in Murchison IOM, 1.1 ± 0.1 × 105 in Cold Bokkeveld, and 1.9 ± 0.5 × 105 in Orgueil IOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in correction of the measured 17O values by 0.72.8 in Murchison IOM, 1.31.8 in Cold Bokkeveld IOM, and 0.82.4 in Orgueil IOM (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each analysis, the FC background was measured during presputtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead time of the EMs was also calibrated once per analytical session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total analysis time was 260 s (60-s presputtering and 40 cycles of 5 s each measurement time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) for O isotope measurements in IOM samples was corrected by repeated analyses of our Clarno kerogen standard (18Obulk = 14.3 ± 0.1; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48), for which we assumed a 17Obulk of 7.4, that is, a terrestrial O isotope composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Count rates obtained on the Clarno kerogen standard were 0.31.2 × 107 cpsnA1 for 16O, 1.14.5 × 103 cpsnA1 for 17O and 0.62.3 × 104 cpsnA1 for 18O, similar to those obtained on the IOM samples (0.33.1 × 107 cpsnA1 for 16O, 0.11.1 × 104 cpsnA1 for 17O and 0.55.5 × 104 cpsnA1 for 18O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final uncertainties for individual 17,18O values, reported in SI Appendix, Table S1 at the 2 level, include uncertainties related to counting statistics associated with each individual analysis and the external reproducibility measured for 17,18O values on the Clarno kerogen standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over three analytical sessions in February 2016, July 2016, and December 2016, we obtained a weighted average 17O of 0.1 ± 0.4 (95% confidence level, n = 66, mean square weighted deviation = 3.0) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further tested our analytical protocol on the Silurian Zdanow terrestrial kerogen and obtained an average 18OSIMS of 12.4 ± 4.6 (2 SD; n = 9), which is consistent with its bulk 18O of 13.4 ± 0.2 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17O measured on Zdanow was 0.2 ± 1.8 (2 SD; n = 9), indicating that Zdanow sits on the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL), which shows that our L-SIMS protocol accurately measures the triple O isotope composition of organic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The secondary species 12C1H, 16O, 28Si, 32S, and 56Fe16O were collected following O isotope analyses on the same analytical spots using the magnetic peak switching mode and a 10-nA Cs+ beam to identify and filter the IOM data largely affected by contamination by residual silicate and oxide phases (see details in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48 and 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nanoscale_Secondary_Ion_Mass_Spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The triple O isotope composition of the Orgueil and Murchison IOM residues was also measured using the CAMECA NanoSIMS 50L ion probe instrument at The University of Manchester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative 16O, 17O, 18O, 12C2, 12C214N, 28Si, and 56Fe16O secondary ion species produced using a 15-pA Cs+ primary beam, accelerated at 16 kV and rastered over 40 m × 40-m areas, were measured in multicollection mode on seven EMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before analysis, a 100-pA Cs+ primary beam was rastered over 50 × 50-m areas for 5 min to clean the sample surface and reach sputtering equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit the 16OH interference on the 17O peak, a 10-m-wide entrance slit (ES5) was used at the entrance of the mass analyzer, and a 150-m-wide aperture slit (AS3) reduced the beam divergence, resulting in a mass resolving power of 8,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An electron gun was used for charge compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these conditions, the count rates were 15,00035,000 cps for 16O, 5001,800 cps for 12C2, 3,00010,000 cps for 12C14N, and 520 cps for 56Fe16O, ensuring no detector aging over the week-long analytical session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the session, the vacuum in the analysis chamber remained constant at 3 × 1010 mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data acquisition, the 40-m2 areas were divided in 256 × 256 pixels and between 320 and 600 frames were acquired at 1,000 s/px, resulting in a total analysis time of 611 h per analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automatic alignment of the secondary beam (EOS, Cy, and P2/P3) and of the peak positions was performed every 50 frames during each analysis based on scanning the 16O peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IMF for O isotope measurements in IOM samples was corrected by analyzing the same Clarno kerogen standard used for the L-SIMS analyses (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final uncertainties for individual 17,18O values, reported in SI Appendix, Table S2 at the 2 level, include those related to counting statistics for each individual analysis and the external reproducibility measured for 17,18O on the Clarno kerogen standard (±11.1 and ±11.9 for 18O and 17O, respectively; 2 SE, n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NanoSIMS data were processed off-line using the lImage software package (L. Nittler, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 44-ns dead time was applied to all EMs, and individual frames were binned into packages of 610 frames for each analysis to handle these large datasets more easily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROIs were defined using lower and upper thresholds for the different species and comprised, for each analysis, the whole analyzed area, an area with intermediate 16O intensity, and a 16O-rich area corresponding to hot spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A ROI of pure IOM was then defined by subtracting the ROI corresponding to the area with intermediate 16O intensity to the ROI corresponding to the whole analyzed area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17O/16O, 18O/16O, 12C14N/12C2, and 16O/12C2 ratios were calculated using lImage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All processed data are given in SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
