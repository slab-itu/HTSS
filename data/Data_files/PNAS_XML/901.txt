Cbf governs osteoblastadipocyte lineage commitment through enhancing -catenin signaling and suppressing adipogenesis gene expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Age-associated increased marrow adiposity is often coupled with increased bone loss, presenting a significant age-associated osteoporosis health problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying how transcription factors regulate mesenchymal stem cell lineage determination and showed that Cbf plays a critical role in stimulating osteogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis through activating Wnt10b/-catenin signaling and inhibiting adipogenesis regulatory gene (c/ebp) expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insights resulting from this study will fill an important knowledge gap and may facilitate the development of novel bone loss therapeutics that minimize the adverse side effects on bone homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism underlying how transcription factors regulate mesenchymal stem cell lineage commitment remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the role of core-binding factor subunit beta (Cbf) in osteoblast lineage commitment, we generated three mouse models by deleting Cbf at different osteoblast lineage stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice exhibited severe osteoporosis with substantial accumulation of marrow adipocytes resembling aged bone from enhanced adipogenesis, indicating that mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts can be programed and reprogramed, respectively, into adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Cbf-deficient calvarial cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells displayed strong adipogenic potential, with 5- to 70-fold increased adipocyte gene expression, which can be rescued by Cbf overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Canonical Wnt signaling was impeded in the Cbf-deficient cells, with 80% decrease of Wnt10b expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, ChIP and luciferase assays demonstrated that Cbf/RUNX2 binds to Wnt10b promoter driving Wnt10b expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Wnt3a suppressed adipogenesis but did not rescue osteoblastogenesis in Cbf-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, mixing culture of Cbf-deficient with normal cells demonstrates that Cbf functions not only through WNT paracrine pathway but also through endogenous signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis shows that Cbf/RUNX2 inhibits c/ebp expression at transcriptional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that, besides its osteogenic role, Cbf governs osteoblastadipocyte lineage commitment both cell nonautonomously through enhancing -catenin signaling and cell autonomously through suppressing adipogenesis gene expression to maintain osteoblast lineage commitment, indicating Cbf may be a therapeutic target for osteoporosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Loss_of_Cbf_in_MSC__Osteochondroprogenitor__or_Early_Osteoblast_Causes_Increased_Bone_Marrow_Adiposity_Accompanied_by_Decreased_Bone_Mass  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous mouse model with Cbf deficiency (CbfGFP/GFP knock-in mice, Cbf/ embryos rescued by Tek-GFP/Cbf and Gata1-Cbf transgenes, and Cbff/fTwist-Cre mice) exhibited skeletal dysplasia and died around birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of Cbf in osteoblastadipocyte lineage commitment in vivo, we sought to delete Cbf in skeletal cells at various differentiation stages by generating the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre conditional knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice survived to adulthood, and Cbff/fCol21-Cre survived to about 3 wk to 4 wk of age (1518).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, radiographic analysis showed that postnatal Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice had reduced bone density compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microcomputed tomography (CT) analysis of the distal femora of 4-wk-old mouse femurs further confirmed a reduction in bone volume and trabecular bone number, and an increase in trabecular bone separation in the Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice compared with WT controls (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femoral sections from Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice were subsequently subjected to further histological analysis (Fig 1 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that trabecular bone number was largely reduced in the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre (Fig 1G), Cbff/fCol21-Cre (Fig 1F), and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While performing femoral bone histology of the Cbf-deficient mice and their WT littermates, we unexpectedly observed dramatic change in the bone marrow fat content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the high-magnification images, adipocyte-like vacuoles accumulated in the bone marrow of Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice but not WT mice (Fig 1 EG, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm that the adipocyte-like vacuoles observed in H&E staining slides are adipocytes, we performed Oil Red O staining using femoral frozen sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, more adipocytes (red color) were present in the bone marrow of Cbf-deficient mice compared with that of WT (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil Red O+ area per tissue area was increased by about threefold in Cbff/fPrx1-Cre mice (Fig 2 A and D), about threefold in Cbff/fCol21-Cre mice (Fig 2 B and D), and about twofold in Cbff/fOsx-Cre mice (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our histomorphological analysis of femoral sections of 18-wk-old WT mice by Goldners trichrome staining revealed that aged mice showed a dramatic decrease in mineralized tissue and an increase in marrow adiposity compared with 2-mo-old controls (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced bone density due to aging was further confirmed by CT analysis (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Cbf mRNA expression levels in 18-mo-old WT mice were also drastically reduced compared with that of the 2-mo-old group (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that deficiency of Cbf in MSC, osteochondroprogenitor, or early osteoblast leads to high bone marrow adiposity and low bone mass, resembling the bone phenotype in aged WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf-Deficient_Calvarial_Cells_Transdifferentiated_into_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increased bone marrow adiposity caused by knockout of Cbf in MSCs, osteochondroprogenitors, or early osteoblasts indicates that the absence of Cbf favors adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Cbf-deficient calvarial cells transdifferentiate into adipocytes in vitro, calvarial osteoblast precursor cells derived from WT, Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre newborn mice were maintained in the osteogenic medium for 14 d, and adipocyte formation was detected by Oil Red O staining (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significantly higher number of Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells were committed to adipocyte lineage (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient deletion of Cbf in Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of Cbf in Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells partially rescued osteoblast differentiation (Fig S1 C and E) and, meanwhile, completely reduced adipocyte formation rates (Fig S1 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion and overexpression of Cbf were confirmed by Western blot (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, active -catenin (nonphosphorylated -catenin) protein was decreased greatly in the Cbf-deficient cells whereas c/ebp expression was significantly up-regulated (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the expression of adipogenesis-related genes with quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), using cells maintained in the osteogenic medium for 7 d (D7) and 14 d (D14) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At D7 and D14, c/ebp expression was increased by fivefold in Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells, and threefold in Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells, compared with that in WT cells (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, PPAR expression was increased by 10-fold in D7 Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells, 32-fold in D14 Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells, fourfold in D7 Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells, and fivefold in D14 Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells, compared with the WT cohorts (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fabp4 expression was also increased dramatically (more than 30-fold in D7, more than 50-fold in D14) in the mutant cells (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, despite the reduced expression level of active -catenin protein (Fig 3C), -catenin mRNA expression did not change in the WT, Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf_Deficiency_Promotes_Adipogenesis_and_Inhibits_Osteoblastogenesis_in_Marrow_MSC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MSCs derived from WT and Cbff/fPrx1-Cre mice were maintained in the osteogenic medium for 7 d and 14 d. Osteoblast formation was detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining (Fig S2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adipocyte formation was detected by Oil Red O staining (Fig S2 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cbf-deficient MSCs had approximately fourfold more adipocyte (Oil Red O+ cells) formation (Fig S2 B and D) and approximately threefold less osteoblast (ALP+ cells) formation (Fig S2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient deletion of Cbf in Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells was confirmed by qPCR (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to calvarial cells, expression of adipocyte markers (c/ebp, Fabp4, and Ppar) was increased in the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells, whereas -catenin mRNA expression was not changed (Fig S2D) in both D7 and D17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf_Inhibits_-Catenin_Signaling_in_Vivo_and_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In deciphering the molecular basis of Cbfs roles in osteoblastadipocyte lineage allocation, mRNA were harvested from WT, Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre calvarial cells, which were maintained in the osteogenic medium for 7 d. Genes whose expression has been reported to be regulated by -catenin (lef1, tcf1, axin2, and dkk1) were analyzed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of lef1, tcf1, and dkk1 was down-regulated significantly in both Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -catenin needs to translocate into the nuclei to truly exert its transcriptional function; thus we also examined the expression of active -catenin in the cytoplasm and nuclei, separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a lower level of active -catenin in both cytoplasm and nuclei of Cbf-deficient osteoblasts (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The down-regulation of active -catenin in the whole cell of the mutant cells was confirmed by cellular immunofluorescent (IF) staining (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also detected active -catenin expression in the newborn and 3-wk-old WT and Cbff/fOsx-Cre femurs (Fig 4 D and E; negative controls are presented in Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the active -catenin protein level was down-regulated in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of newborn Cbff/fOsx-Cre femurs (Fig 4D), and both primary spongiosa and secondary spongiosa of 3-wk-old Cbff/fOsx-Cre femurs (Fig 4E), compared with that of the WT littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data indicate that -catenin activity was influenced in the absence of Cbf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf_Regulates_Wnt10b_Expression_at_the_Transcriptional_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abrogated -catenin activity might be caused by altered expression of canonical Wnts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we performed qRT-PCR to detect Wnts expression in the WT, Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre preosteoblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, although expression of most Wnts (Wnt1, Wnt7b, Wnt7a, Wnt5a, Wnt11, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was not drastically changed, Wnt4 expression is significantly reduced in Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells but not Cbff/fPrx1-Cre cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the expression of Wnt10b was significantly down-regulated in both Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre cells (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Wnt10b expression is also down-regulated in the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre and Cbff/fOsx-Cre newborn long bone (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an online transcription factor binding site predictive tool (alggen.lsi.upc.es), we identified six binding sites on the Wnt10b promoter for Cbf/Runx complex (+41, 111, 159, 913, 1,258, and 1,737) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP assay showed that Cbf/Runx complex potentially binds to the Wnt10b promoter on the binding sites around 200 bp (predicted binding sites 159, 111, +41) but is not likely to bind to the predicted binding sites 913, 1,258, and 1,737 (Fig 5 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we constructed the pGL3-Wnt10b promoter containing 159, 111, and +41 binding sites (pro1), and pGL3-Wnt10b promoter containing 111 and +41 binding sites (pro2) (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase analysis revealed that Cbf with Runx2 enhances pro1-driven luciferase activity but did not change pro2-driven luciferase activity (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, Cbf/Runx2 regulates Wnt10b expression at transcriptional level, by binding to the Wnt10b promoter at the binding sites 159.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt3a_Suppresses_Lineage_Switch_of_Cbf-Deficient_Calvarial_Osteoblast  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we showed in Cbf Inhibits -Catenin Signaling in Vivo and in Vitro and Cbf Regulates Wnt10b Expression at the Transcriptional Level, Wnt signaling plays an important role in Cbf-mediated lineage commitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we sought to suppress the adipogenesis from Cbf-deficient calvarial cells by potentiating Wnt signaling using Wnt3L conditional medium (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt3L conditional medium suppressed adipogenesis of Cbf-deficient cells (Fig 6 A and C) but did not help rescue osteoblast formation (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Wnt3a dramatically repressed adipocyte-specific gene expression (i.e., fabp4 and pparg) in Cbf-deficient cells, rendering their expression level similar to those in WT cells (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Osx (an osteoblast marker) remained down-regulated in Cbf-deficient cells under the treatment of Wnt3L conditional medium (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, expression of Cbf itself was not changed by Wnt3L conditional medium (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf_Suppresses_Adipocyte_Formation_Through_both_Cell-Autonomous_Gene_Regulation_Pathway_and_Nonautonomous_Wnt10b_Paracrine_Autocrine_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further test whether Cbf antagonizes adipocyte differentiation through Wnt10b paracrine/autocrine pathway, we combined GFP;Cbf-deficient MSCs with GFP+ WT MSCs at different ratios and cultured them in osteogenic medium for 14 d. Then adipocyte formation was stained by Nile Red, and counterstained with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixing culture experiment confirmed that Cbf-deficient MSCs were prone to forming more adipocyte; as more Cbf-deficient MSCs were present in the mixing culture, more adipocytes are formed (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that mixing culture with Cbf-deficient MSCs increased the adipocyte formation rate of GFP+ normal cells (Nile Red+GFP+/GFP+ ratios 0.28%, 0.55%, 1.5%, and 5.9%, based on GFP-:GFP+ ratios 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, and 6:1, respectively) (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher ratio of Cbf-deficient MSC in the mixing culture also increased the adipocyte formation rate of GFPCbf-deficient cells (Nile Red+GFP/GFP ratios 2.5%, 12%, and 40%, based on GFP-:GFP+ ratios 1:1, 3:1, 6:1, respectively) (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From GFP-:GFP+ ratio 3:1 to 6:1, adipocyte formation rate of GFPCbf-deficient cells increases by 2.3-fold (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adipocyte formation rate was 4.55-, 8-, and 6.78-fold higher in Cbf-deficient cells compared with WT type GFP+ cells (Fig 7 B and C) based on GFP-:GFP+ ratios 1:1, 3:1, and 6:1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that, besides autocrine/paracrine signaling, Cbf also regulates adipocyte formation through cell-autonomous pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the online transcription factor binding site predictive tool (alggen.lsi.upc.es), we identified two binding sites on the c/ebp promoter for Cbf/Runx complex (281, 2,400) (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP assay showed that Cbf/Runx complex binds to the Wnt10b promoter on the binding sites around 300 bp (predicted binding site 281) but is not likely to bind to the predicted binding site 2,400 (Fig S4 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we constructed the pGL3-c/ebp promoter with 281 binding site (pro3,4,5) and without 281 binding site (pro6) (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase analysis revealed that pro3,4,5-driven luciferase activity, but not pro6-driven luciferase activity, is inhibited by Cbf overexpression (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, pro3,4,5-driven luciferase activity is more notably inhibited by Cbf/Runx2 cotransfection (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, Cbf/Runx2 regulates c/ebp expression at transcriptional level, by binding to the c/ebp promoter at the binding site 281.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides Wnt signaling, Cbf-mediated c/ebp also contributes to lineage commitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our data demonstrate that Cbf plays a critical role in the maintenance of osteoblast lineage, and the switch from osteoblastogensis to adipogenesis can occur at any stage of osteoblast differentiation (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Cbf suppresses adipogenesis through Wnt signaling and c/ebp expression, whereas it regulates osteoblast differentiation through different mechanisms (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cbf_Is_Essential_to_Preserve_Osteoblast_Lineage_Commitment_and_Maintenance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the genetic dissection tool of conditional gene deletion by the Cre/LoxP system, we discovered that Cbf deficiency from the Cbff/fPrx1-Cre, Cbff/fCol21-Cre, and Cbff/fOsx-Cre mouse models result in bone marrow adipocyte accumulation in vivo, resembling the conditions associated with osteoporosis in aging human bone (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that, besides MSCs, Cbf-deficient osteoblasts lineage cells at different stages of osteoblastogenesis can be reprogramed into adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates the importance of Cbf in osteoblast lineage commitment and maintenance as well as in adipogenesis in aging bone marrow, and that the switch from osteoblastogensis to adipogenesis can occur at any stage of osteoblast differentiation (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Cbf_in_MSC_Differentiation_and_Osteoporosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous studies also showed that Cbf deficiency inhibited chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, and impaired growth plate development due to disrupted IhhPTHrP regulatory loop (1921), which in turn regulated endochondral bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous and current studies showed that Ihh and -catenin signaling plays a role at distinct differentiation stages (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although -catenin signaling is a critical regulator of bone marrow adipocyte (10, 11, 22), adipogenic role of Ihh is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, regarding Cbfs role in osteoblastadipocyte lineage commitment, canonical Wnt might be more critical than Ihh pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Runx_Cbf_Complex_Promotes_Wnt10b_-Catenin_Signaling_and_Inhibits_c_ebpa_Expression_to_Inhibit_Lineage_Switch_into_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wnt/-catenin directs mesenchymal cell commitment to the osteogenic lineage and prevents adipogenic differentiation, resulting in increased new bone formation (10, 11, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of canonical Wnt ligand Wnt10b induces higher bone mass in mice, and Wnt10b inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes and blocks adipose tissue development (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Wnt10b is down-regulated in Cbf-deficient cells and tissues, and ChIP plus promoter activity assay showed that Wnt10b is up-regulated by Cbf at the transcriptional level (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, adipocyte differentiation can be suppressed but osteoblast differentiation cannot be rescued in the presence of Wnt3L conditional medium containing Wnt3a (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those observations indicate that the Runx/Cbf complex inhibits programing and reprograming of MSCs and osteoblast into adipocytes through Wnt10b/-catenin signaling, whereas regulation of osteoblast differentiation by Runx/Cbf is independent of this pathway (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the experiment of mixing culture of Cbf-deficient and GFP+ normal cells, in the presence of higher ratio of Cbf-deficient cells, both Cbf-deficient and GFP+ WT cells have higher adipocyte formation rate, confirming that Cbf inhibits adipocyte formation through paracrine Wnt10b signaling (Fig 7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, adipocyte formation rate is always much higher in the Cbf-deficient cells regardless of mixing ratios, indicating that Cbf also inhibits adipocyte differentiation cell-autonomously (Fig 7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies using ChIP and luciferase assay prove that Cbf/Runx2 complex inhibits the expression of c/ebpa, an important adipogenic transcriptional factor, at transcriptional level (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data show that Cbf regulates osteoblast differentiation from both endogenous and paracrine signaling (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cbf_May_Be_Essential_for_Prevention_of_Human_Age-Associated_Osteoporosis_Resulting_from_Elevated_Adipogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results showed, along with reduced bone mineral density in aged WT mice, Cbf expression was dramatically reduced in aged mice, indicating that low Cbf expression might be a major cause of age-related osteoporosis with increased adipogenesis (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that lineage switch from osteoblastogensis to adipogenesis can occur at multiple stages of osteoblast differentiation in the Cbf-deficient cells (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) demonstrates that Cbf may be essential for prevention of human age-associated osteoporosis due to elevated adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further understanding the mechanism underlying osteoblastadipocyte lineage allocation will fill an important knowledge gap and may facilitate the development of novel bone loss therapeutics while minimizing the adverse side effects on bone hemostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture_and_Osteoblast_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from newborn mice and seeded in culture at 3 × 103 cells per square centimeter as described (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, cells were induced using osteogenic medium and BGJb medium (12591; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 g/mL l-ascorbic acid (A4544; Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 mM glycerolphosphate (G9891; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone marrow MSCs were isolated as described (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were passaged and osteoblastogenesis were induced using osteogenic medium (-MEM medium supplemented with 50 g/mL l-ascorbic acid, 5 mM -glycerolphosphate, and Dexamethasone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osteoblastogenesis was analyzed by ALP staining according to manufacturers manual (A2356; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osteoblast mineralization was examined by Von Kossa staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt3L_Conditional_Medium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wnt3L conditional medium is prepared from L Wnt-3A (ATCC CRL-2647) cells according to manufacturers instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein samples were prepared from calvaria-derived osteoblasts in protein lysis buffer as described (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using a commercial kit (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents; Fisher Inc.) following manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were resolved on SDS/PAGE and electrotransferred on nitrocellulose membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cbf, active-catenin, and C/ebp protein levels were analyzed using the following primary antibodies: rabbitanti-Cbf (sc-56751; Santacruz), rabbitanti-C/ebp (sc-61; Santacruz), mouseanti-active-catenin (05-665; Millipore), and mouseanti-tubulin (E7; DSHB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (7074) and Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (7076) were from Cell Signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mRNA_Preparation_from_2-_and_18-mo-Old_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Femoral bone was isolated from 2- and 18-mo-old mice, and bone marrow was flushed out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prepared samples were then transferred to a tube containing beads (Nextadvance Inc.) and homogenized using a Blender (Bullet BlenderH; Nextadvance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA extraction was carried out under standard procedures using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

qRT-PCR_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells at day 7 and day 14 (as indicated) with TRIzol reagent (15596018; Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 0.5 g total RNA with SuperScript VILO Master Mix (11755050; Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qRT-PCR was performed using the one-step RT-PCR System as previously described (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences are presented in the Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nile_Red_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differentiated cells are fixed by paraformaldehyde, rinsed by PBS, stained by 25 ng/mL Nile Red, counterstained by DAPI, and visualized by fluorescent microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ChIP was performed as described using primary osteoblast lysates (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-Cbf antibody (sc-20693 X) and DNA extraction, quantitative PCR was performed using the primers in the promoter region of mouse Wnt10b genes (primer sequences are presented in the Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Promoter_Luciferase_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The promoter region () and (+) of the mouse Wnt10b gene was amplified by PCR using Wnt10b Bac clone (cat#CH29-27K23; CHORI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences are available in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the promoter regions were inserted into the pGL3-basic vector to construct the pGL3-Wnt10b promoter 1 vector (pro-1) and pGL3-Wnt10b promoter 2 vector (pro-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insertions of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates, and were transiently transfected with a DNA mixture containing the pGL3-Wnt10b construct (0.3 g) and -GAL-expressing plasmids (0.03 g), with or without Runx2 expressing vector (pcDNA3.1-Runx2, 0.3 g) or Cbf-expressing vector (psport6-CMV-Cbf, 0.3 g) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase was detected using Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) 48 h posttransfection as described (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -GAL activity of the cell lysates was analyzed using -Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (E2000; Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of luciferase activity was normalized to the level of -GAL activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
