Beyond sixfold coordinated Si in SiO2 glass at ultrahigh pressures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of multichannel collimator and diamond anvil cells enabled the investigation of the real-space structure of an amorphous material 100 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have measured the structure of SiO2 glass by angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction up to 172 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in agreement with existing data up to 50 GPa showing a sharp change from fourfold to sixfold SiO coordination number (CN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at higher pressures, CN continuously increases to values beyond 6 without sharp structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of SiO2 glass at high pressure serves as a model for more complex silicate glasses and melts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results provide experimental insight into the structural evolution of silicate glasses and melts at ultrahigh pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the structure of SiO2 glass up to 172 GPa using high-energy X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of a multichannel collimator with diamond anvil cells enabled the measurement of structural changes in silica glass with total X-ray diffraction to previously unachievable pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that SiO2 first undergoes a change in SiO coordination number from fourfold to sixfold between 15 and 50 GPa, in agreement with previous investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above 50 GPa, the estimated coordination number continuously increases from 6 to 6.8 at 172 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiO bond length shows first an increase due to the fourfold to sixfold coordination change and then a smaller linear decrease up to 172 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reconcile the changes in relation to the oxygen-packing fraction, showing that oxygen packing decreases at ultrahigh pressures to accommodate the higher than sixfold SiO coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results give experimental insight into the structural changes of silicate glasses as analogue materials for silicate melts at ultrahigh pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dependence of OPF on AO CN for SiO2 glass from this study and GeO2 glass from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare experimental data to calculated values for the Fe2P-type and cotunnite structural polymorphs for SiO2 (red left/right triangles) (30) and GeO2 (white up/down triangles) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereby, different directions of the symbols are for different cutoff values (2.1 and 2.5 Å) for the OO MEFIR distance calculations for these crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed blue line represents the Kepler conjecture (KC) marking the densest possible OPF [0.74 (34)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black diamond represents an ideal hypothetical close-packed AO2 structure where both atoms have the same size and contribute to the close packing equally; thus, AB coordination will be 12, but the OPF N is only two-thirds of the KC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded areas are linear extrapolations from the ideal AO2 structure through the values of predicted crystalline high pressure phases to sixfold coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magenta crosses show the results of the ab initio MD (AIMD) simulation for different densities (716 g/cm3 at 4,000 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ratio of the atomic Si and O radius against pressure for the SiO2 glass and predicted Fe2P-type structure of crystalline SiO2 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The packing fraction of the atoms against pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the total packing (Si + O) against the oxygen packing shows that at low pressures, the total packing is mainly induced by the oxygen atoms, whereas at higher pressures, the Si atoms become more and more important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total packing fraction seems to be more or less constant within error bars 25 GPa and never rises above the total packing fraction of the predicted crystalline Fe2P-type structure of SiO2 at ultrahigh pressures (640 GPa) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are compared with the optimal closed packing of equal spheres defined by the KC at 0.74 and to the optimal RCP of equal spheres at 0.64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at the GSECARS, 13-IDD beamline, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BX90 DAC (36) was used for pressure generation, and all measurements were collected at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An incident monochromatic X-ray beam with an energy of 40 keV and 2.5×3 m beam size was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An MCC as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 with a 50-m inner slit size and 200-m outer slit size was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commercially available SiO2 glass was packed in the pressure chamber in a Re gasket; beveled diamonds with 120-m culet size were used; and no pressure medium was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small piece of gold was added as pressure calibrant, whereby pressure was estimated before and after each measurement based on the known equation of state (EOS) of gold (37), with the reported pressures being the average, and the difference was used as error estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data were collected with a Mar345 image plate detector, which was calibrated by using a LaB6 standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical collection time was 300 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detector calibration, image integration, and intensity corrections for oblique X-ray to detector angle, c-BN seat and diamond absorption were performed by using the Dioptas software package (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting diffraction patterns were corrected for an additional diamond Compton scattering contribution, which was necessary because the background measurement before compression was measured with a thicker sample chamber than the compressed sample material at high pressure (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thinner sample chamber resulted in more diamond in the volume of diffraction constrained by the MCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the sample signal and the additional diamond Compton scattering contribution were corrected for the transfer function of the MCC (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FaberZiman structure factors and pair distribution functions were calculated by using the Glassure software package (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data-processing steps included: (i) normalization to atomic units by fitting the high part of the wave vector Q to the calculated scattering factors of SiO2, (ii) extrapolation of the resulting S(Q) to zero by using a second-order polynomial function with y=a(x2c)+b(xc), with y = 0 for x less_than c, and (iii) optimization of the data using a Kaplow-type correction (41) with typically three iterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of extra diamond Compton scattering ndia was optimized by minimization of the amplitude of the oscillations before the first peak in g(r) after Fourier transformation from S(Q) to g(r) before any Kaplow-type correction (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting ndia are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No Lorch-modification (42) function was used, since it was found to be unnecessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Number densities for calculation of g(r) and CNs were estimated by using two third-order BirchMurnaghan EOSs for different pressure regions: (i) up to 45 GPa with 0 = 2.212 g/cm3, K0 = 18.88 GPa and K = 3.53; (ii) 45 GPa with 0 = 3.86 g/cm3, K0 = 176 GPa and K = 4.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  * These EOSs have been determined by X-ray absorption up to almost 100 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our data did not show any sign of abrupt structural changes 100 GPa, we assumed the estimated EOS parameters to be valid up to 172 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Example analyses at 5 GPa and 172 GPa are shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and Fig S6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CN_Estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle CNs can be extracted from the calculated pair distribution functions g(r) by integrating over the first peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This works directly for monatomic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for materials with two or more elements, there exists no direct solution, since g(r) is influenced by weighing of the partial S(Q) with the X-ray form factors f(Q) for each element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to overcome this is by calculating pseudopartial structure factors through reweighing of the original S(Q) using the X-ray form factors f(Q) for Si and O:wf(Q)=(cSifSi+cOfO)22cOcSifO(Q)fSi(Q)SSiO(Q)=(S(Q)1)wf+1where wf(Q) is the weighing factor, cO and cSi are the relative concentrations of each element (cO=2/3 and cSi=1/3), fO(Q) and fSi(Q) are the X-ray form factors for Si and O, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing the Fourier transform of SSiO(Q), we obtain the pseudopartial pair distribution function gSiO(r):gSiO(r)=wf(0)1+122r0QmaxQ[SSiO(Q)1]sin(Qr)dQwhere  is the number density in atoms per cubic Å (e.g., 0.0662 Å3 for SiO2 glass at ambient conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partial pair distribution function can now be used to estimate the Si-O CN by integrating over the first peak, provided that the peak is only from an Si-O contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we do an integration over the full peak up to the first minimum in the 4r2g(r) curve after the peak:CNSiO=4cO0rminr2gSiO(r)dr.[1]However, this method is only reliable if the peak is well separated and we are sure there is no other contribution (e.g., from O-O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case for the SiO2 glass data at high pressures, this method works very well up to sixfold coordination at 4050 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher pressures, it is known from crystalline polymorphs of SiO2 that the OO distances can be as low as 1.9 Å,for example, for -PbO2 type SiO2 at 120 GPa using the EOS data of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, which will be well within the integration area (the usual rmin is at 2.1 Å) and thus leading to erroneously high SiO CNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid this issue, we can also assume that the peak is symmetric and integrate over the left half of the peak and double the intensity, whereby the rmax will be the maximum in r2g(r) of the first peak:CNSiO=8cO0rmaxr2gSiO(r)dr.[2]This maximum peak integration method is only reliable if the distribution is symmetric, which is often not the case for glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the type of asymmetry of the peak, the different methods will give upper and lower limits of the actual average CN present in the glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analysis of the SiO2 glass presented here, we chose to use Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 for the CN up to 40 GPa, because the peak is well separated, and we can account for the asymmetric peak shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 was used at higher pressures to avoid the artificially high CN due to the extra OO contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison between the extracted CN of both methods is shown in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum method [Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1] leads to very high CNs  GPa, probably due to extra OO contributions, and the peak maximum method leads to slightly higher CNs less_than30 GPa, due to not representing the slight asymmetric nature of the SiO peak and therefore overestimating the CN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CN errors were calculated by the variation within the estimate of the r-space uncertainty used for the SiO distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The AIMD simulations are based on a PBE exchange correlation functional (43) in conjunction with Goedecker-type (44) pseudopotentials as implemented in the CPMD code (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BornOppenheimer simulations were performed in canonical ensemble with a NoséHoover thermostat (46, 47) and with 264 atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An integration time step of 0.3 fs was used, and each density was equilibrated for at least 3 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters from the simulations were extracted from a subsequent production run with a run time of at least 6 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A good compromise between accuracy and computation speed was found for the plane-wave expansion of the KohnSham orbitals with a cutoff of 100 Ry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated O based on box size and number of O atoms in the simulation cell and the SiO CN was estimated by integrating the first peak of the time averaged SiO pair distribution function up to the first minimum after the peak (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starting configuration for the AIMD simulations was produced by classical MD (CMD) simulations using the DL_POLY Classic code (48) in combination with Morse potentials (49, 50) and a time step of 1 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CMD simulations were run in the NPT ensemble with a NoséHoover thermostat (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial randomized cell was created with 264 atoms and a number density of 0.066 atoms/Å3, whereby atoms were moved until all atomic distances were above reasonable cutoff distances (dSiO1.4 Å; dOO2 Å and dSiSi2 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cell was then equilibrated at ambient pressure and 3,000 K for 100 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, the cell was equilibrated at 70 GPa and 5,000 K for 1,000 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure produced by the CMD simulations was further equilibrated by an AIMD run of 30 ps at 4,000 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
