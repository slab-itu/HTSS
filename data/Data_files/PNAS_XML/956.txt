PrimPol is required for replication reinitiation after mtDNA damage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Failure to maintain mtDNA integrity can lead to a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its central role in the development of these disorders, many mechanistic details of mtDNA maintenance are still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present work, we have studied the role of PrimPol, an unusual primase-polymerase, in mammalian mtDNA maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that PrimPol is specifically required for replication reinitiation after DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PrimPol synthesizes DNA primers on an ssDNA template, which can be elongated by the mitochondrial replicative polymerase , a solution to reprime replication beyond DNA lesions and to facilitate lagging-strand replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that PrimPol has biological relevance for mtDNA maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eukaryotic PrimPol is a recently discovered DNA-dependent DNA primase and translesion synthesis DNA polymerase found in the nucleus and mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PrimPol has been shown to be required for repriming of stalled replication forks in the nucleus, its role in mitochondria has remained unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that PrimPol can reinitiate stalled mtDNA replication and can prime mtDNA replication from nonconventional origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results not only help in the understanding of how mitochondria cope with replicative stress but can also explain some controversial features of the lagging-strand replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

PrimPol_Is_Required_for_Repriming_of_Stalled_mtDNA_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (CTNAs) represent a very specific type of problem for DNA replication that can be mainly resolved via repriming and not, for example, by a TLS-type of activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As PrimPol was recently shown to be important in maintaining nuclear DNA replication in the presence of CTNAs (11), we wanted to investigate whether this is also the case for mtDNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Pol  is the only mammalian replicative polymerase capable of incorporating ddC during DNA synthesis (30), resulting in specific blockage of mtDNA replication that can be detected by using 2D agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE; Fig 1 and Fig S1; further details are provided in SI Results and Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Primpol-KO MEFs do not show any obvious replication phenotype under normal conditions (Fig 1C), a 48-h treatment with 175 M ddC results in complete replication stalling and depletion of mtDNA copy number (Fig 1D and Fig S2), revealing major differences in the replication responses between the WT and KO cells (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT MEFs showed a strong increase in replication bubbles, indicating increased replication initiation within the OH-containing region of mtDNA (explained in Fig 1B and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Primpol/ cells seem to lose their replication intermediates upon ddC treatment (Fig 1E), demonstrating that the compensatory increase in replication initiation is fully dependent on the presence of PrimPol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As replication cannot be completed in either cell type as a result of the recurrent ddC incorporation, the WT MEFs show a similar depletion of mtDNA copy number under ddC as Primpol/ (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when ddC is removed from the growth medium, mtDNA copy number recovery is significantly delayed in Primpol/ cells compared with WT MEFs (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference in mtDNA integrity was observed between the two cell lines (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that PrimPol can reinitiate replication when strand elongation is blocked at the mtDNA replication fork, we simulated the situation in vitro by using M13mp18 ssDNA template, purified recombinant Pol AB2 (for simplicity, hereafter referred to as Pol ), and PrimPol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When provided with a normal oligonucleotide primer, Pol  was able to efficiently synthesize [-32P]dGTP-labeled full-length (7.3-kb) product from M13mp18 template (Fig 2A, lane 2, black arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shorter DNA bands observed in this reaction are the result of Pol  pausing in front of secondary DNA structures, which form on this ssDNA template in the absence of single-strand binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of PrimPol to the reaction resulted in additional DNA products (Fig 2A, lane 3, white arrowheads), which differ from the ones caused by Pol  pausing (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PrimPol alone cannot generate these species because PrimPol is unable to synthesize long DNA fragments as a result of its low processivity (Fig 2A, lane 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the published data on inefficient removal of chain terminators by Pol  proofreading activity (30), Pol  was unable to elongate a primer with a 3 ddC-monophosphate (ddCMP) (Fig 2A, lane 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed faint full-length DNA product is likely to result from ddCMP-oligonucleotide impurity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When PrimPol is added to the reaction, it will provide new primers for Pol  and enables DNA synthesis, with the majority of products arising from specific priming events on the M13mp18 template (Fig 2A, lane 6, white arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that Pol  is unable to initiate DNA synthesis in the absence of a primer (Fig 2A, lane 8), but the addition of PrimPol to the reaction enables the synthesis of full-length DNA products (Fig 2A, lane 9), further corroborating that PrimPol can provide DNA primers for Pol  (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During in vivo experiments, addition of ddC to the cell growth media results, after several phosphorylation steps, in a mixed deoxycytide/di-deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP/ddCTP) cellular pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To recapitulate the situation in vitro, we next performed replication reactions with a mixed population of free ddCTP and dCTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, DNA synthesis by Pol  is weak as a result of the frequent termination of polymerization when ddCTP is incorporated (Fig 2A, lane 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of PrimPol leads to substantially more DNA synthesis in the presence of ddCTP (Fig 2A, lane 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Pol , PrimPols polymerase activity is not significantly inhibited by ddCTP (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, primer synthesis by PrimPol is only slightly affected by the presence of ddNTPs (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a strong discrimination in favor of a 3-OH group in the incoming nucleotides guarantees that the primers made by PrimPol do not abort and can be elongated by the Pol  replicase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of PrimPol to assist Pol  by reinitiation of efficient DNA polymerization is hampered only when relatively high concentrations of ddCTP are used (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, Pol  cannot continue DNA synthesis after ddC insertion and requires the priming activity of PrimPol for replication restart (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long as ddCTP is present, recurrent replication stalling will occur despite the presence of PrimPol, resulting in accumulation of partially replicated molecules in vitro and depletion of mtDNA copy number in vivo (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequence-Specific_Priming_by_PrimPol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concentration of PrimPol used (200 nM) equals approximately 40 monomers of the enzyme per M13mp18 template with a potential priming site every 180 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted earlier, instead of observing a range of elongation products, only a major DNA species was observed, indicating a preferred priming site on the offered template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This priming site became dominant over a 32P-labeled synthetic primer at PrimPol concentrations greater than 50 nM, whereas, at higher concentrations (5001,000 nM), more and smaller replication products were obtained (Fig 2B, lanes 8 and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this does not mean that excess of PrimPol is inhibiting DNA synthesis in these reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the same DNA products are separated over a neutral Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) gel, instead of a denaturing gel, it is possible to visualize all DNA products, regardless of gaps between labeled primer and PrimPol-primed DNA synthesis, demonstrating that high PrimPol levels actually support more DNA synthesis (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed main priming site on M13mp18 was highly specific, as the size of the main PrimPol-primed product was dependent on the position of the ddCMP-oligonucleotide primer (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To map this site, we used a modified method for 5-RACE and discovered that DNA priming started opposite the 3-GTCC-5 sequence (Fig 2C), indicating that PrimPol has an identical sequence preference as HSV1 primase (31) and similar to known prokaryotic primases (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PrimPol_Is_Required_for_UV-Induced_mtDNA_Replication_Initiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because UV damage induces similar accumulation of replication intermediates as ddC treatment (21), we sought to identify whether this is also a consequence of PrimPol-dependent replication reinitiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas UV exposure caused a rapid increase in replication bubbles in normal MEFs, this reaction was completely absent in Primpol/ cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interpretation is that UV exposure induces a PrimPol-dependent increase of replication initiation in OH-containing fragments and must be regulated by some damage-response pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the ddC treatment, in which replication intermediates were lost (Fig 1E), UV exposure had no effect on the replication intermediates in Primpol/ cells (Fig 3C) or mtDNA copy number (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PrimPol_Overexpression_Increases_Lagging-Strand_Initiation_During_mtDNA_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As PrimPol is able to synthesize primers on ssDNA, which Pol  can elongate (Fig 2A, lane 9), we decided to next analyze whether PrimPol expression alone could modify ss mtDNA replication intermediates in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found this plausible, as PrimPol interacts with TWNK and Pol  in mitochondria (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, TWNK is also reported as a PrimPol (as CCDC111) partner in the BioPlex database (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To get a view of the whole mitochondrial genome, long-range 2D-AGE analysis of full-length mtDNA, cut once downstream or upstream of OH, was performed (Fig 4 and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PrimPol overexpression notably decreased the levels of the partly single-stranded circles (ssc in Fig 4), it also generally increased all replicative molecules and, more specifically, dsDNA intermediates, such as the double-y forms (dy in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in replication intermediates are dependent on mitochondrially localized PrimPol and, more specifically, on its primase activity, as demonstrated by a primase-deficient variant of PrimPol (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, PrimPol overexpression increases ds mtDNA forms at the expense of partially single-stranded forms (Fig S9C), demonstrating that PrimPol can also prime DNA synthesis on a single-stranded template in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Interpretation_2D-AGE_Patterns_and_mtDNA_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-dimensional BrewerFangman agarose electrophoresis separates nucleic acids according to their size and shape (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first dimension separates DNA molecules primarily by size and the second dimension by size and shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional AGE results are typically presented in orientation whereby size increases from right to left and complexity from bottom to top (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For standard 2D-AGE, a DNA sample is digested with a restriction enzyme of choice, although uncut molecules can also be separated to study DNA topology (40, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After Southern blotting, the membrane is probed against the fragment of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of the molecules will be one restriction fragment size linear molecules (1n), and replication as well as recombination intermediates will form typical arc-like patterns (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, OH containing mtDNA fragments always yield Y-arcs, representing replication forks with gradually increasing length of arms (Fig 1 and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unidirectional replication originating from OH should produce only a bubble arc, which converts abruptly to a truncated Y-arc (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full Y intermediates have been interpreted to arise from bidirectional replication, which has initiated downstream of OH and terminates in the noncoding region of mtDNA (27, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the 2D-AGE data and a single transmission EM observation (39), no other evidence exists on replication initiation outside of OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, unidirectional and highly strand-asymmetric replication originating from OH is supported by numerous in vivo (16, 24, 25, 27) and in vitro (28, 29, 48) studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Convincing support for single leading-strand origin comes also from in organello studies that demonstrated that only the bubble structures in OH-containing fragments incorporate radiolabeled nucleotides (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the exact identity of the Y-forms seen in these fragments is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, Y-forms might represent strand-invasion structures (49), but their existence in animal mitochondria is highly controversial (22, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationship_of_PrimPol_and_mtDNA_Replication_Priming  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assignment of OH as the leading strand origin is based on mapping the free 5-ends in the mitochondrial noncoding region (27, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the leading-strand primers synthesized by POLRMT in vitro terminate specifically at CSBII (28) approximately 200 bp upstream of OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if termination at CSBI is taken into account (51), the proposed primer ends fall 100 bp short from the observed 5-ends of DNA (27, 50, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it has been speculated that efficient primer-removing activity in mitochondria could also degrade the nascent DNA molecules to a limited extent (51), but this is somewhat an unsatisfactory explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, PrimPol cannot fix this gap in understanding the leading-strand priming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PrimPol is required for increased priming from the noncoding region under ddC-induced replication stress (Fig 1E), it is expendable for mtDNA maintenance under normal conditions (2) and is unlikely to play a major role in mtDNA leading-strand replication initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under PrimPol overexpression, specific classes of mtDNA replication intermediates arise, which could correspond to increased priming of the lagging-strand replication, such as the nearly complete Y/dY-arc seen in PvuII 2D-AGE (Fig 4 and Fig S9) and the appearance of a partial bubble arc in BamHI 2D-AGE (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is an interesting observation, at present we cannot say whether this represents a biologically significant mechanism or an artifact caused by excess PrimPol priming any accessible ssDNA during mtDNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the mtDNA replication phenotype observed in PrimPol-overexpressing cells was specific for PrimPol activity in mitochondria and not caused by, for example, arbitrary secondary effects of possible changes in nuclear DNA, we created a mitochondrially targeted PrimPol (MTS-PrimPol) construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an MTS-PrimPol variant with double point mutations in two conserved Zn finger residues (MTS-PrimPolCH) was generated to test whether the primase activity was required for the replication phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CH mutants are similar to Zn finger deletion variants and are primase-dead but polymerase-competent, enabling the separation of the two functions (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the transgenic expression of WT MTS-PrimPol resulted in the similar (albeit slightly stronger) phenotype as regular PrimPol overexpression, MTS-PrimPolCH increased the levels of all replication intermediates (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although similar to the hallmarks of replication stalling, no decrease in mtDNA copy number was observed (Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it is unlikely that a repair polymerase could replace replicative polymerase at the replication fork (53), a likely explanation is that primase-deficient PrimPol binds mtDNA and interferes with replication, slowing down its progress but not enough to cause copy number depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar accumulation of mtDNA replication intermediates, without an effect on copy number, is seen also after UV (Fig 3 and Fig S6) or oxidative damage (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Primpol-KO cells do not show signs of mtDNA replication defect, we regard this as an artificial situation caused by expression of the mutant protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ddC_and_Mitochondrial_Gap_Repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the mitochondrial replication fork, insertion of a chain-terminating nucleotide is highly unlikely to happen under normal physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if replication is rescued by repriming, the initial problem will persist as a result of Pol s inherent insufficiency to remove such nucleotides (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication restart caused by ddC insertion or more natural DNA lesions on the template molecule will result in daughter-strand gap lesions that need to be repaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prokaryotes (54) and eukaryotic nucleus (53), the main mechanism for gap repair is homology-mediated repair by recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other option would be to increase the turnover of gapped molecules by targeting them for destruction, possibly facilitated by their tendency to form double-strand breaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, increased turnover of mtDNA has been suggested to contribute to clonal expansion of deletions in patients treated with chain-terminating nucleotide analogs used in antiretroviral therapy (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, replication restart by PrimPol clearly enhances the mtDNA copy number recovery after ddC treatment (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the gapped molecules were to be turned over, any fork rescue would be futile, as the replicated copies would be lost similarly as in aborted replication (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recombinational repair of mtDNA remains a controversial topic, we can only speculate about the gap repair mechanisms in mitochondria at present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Almost all recently discovered mtDNA maintenance proteins are shared with the nucleus (13), making it difficult to dissect their specific importance for the mitochondrial compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, nuclear DNA damage activates a number of signaling pathways that block cell proliferation or target the cell for apoptosis, making any simultaneous damage in the mitochondrial compartment trivial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same also applies for the role of PrimPol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not essential for life (9), PrimPol is beneficial for nuclear genome maintenance, as its loss influences the mitotic checkpoint responses after damage (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mitochondria also require efficient DNA repair and damage-tolerance mechanisms for long-term survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria have formidable intrinsic sources of DNA damage, most notably reactive oxygen species originating from the electron transport system (35), capable of causing oxidative damage that can block mtDNA replication (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA replication can also stall as a result of impaired replisome proteins (17, 18) or sequence-specific replication pause sites (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless the replication is reinitiated, stalling can lead to replication fork collapse and double-strand breaks, resulting in the formation of pathological deletions (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments provide direct evidence that PrimPol is required for replication reinitiation in mitochondria, identifying it as a central player in mtDNA replication fork rescue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PrimPol_Is_Required_for_Increased_Replication_Initiation_After_DNA_Damage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increase in replication intermediates, especially when accompanied by a decrease in mtDNA copy number, has been treated as a hallmark of replication stalling in a number of studies that used 2D-AGE (17, 18, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the stalled replication forks are actively processed or turned over, an increase in replication intermediates can be obtained only through a concomitant increase in replication initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ddC, the accumulation of replication intermediates is caused by recurrent initiation and stalling events (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of PrimPol, no reinitiation occurs, resulting in the loss of replication intermediates (Fig 1C), further demonstrating that replication reinitiation is required for replication maintenance in the presence of ddCTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown here, the primase and polymerase activity of PrimPol are not significantly affected by the presence of ddNTPs, precluding the formation of abortive primers that could compromise fork restart and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite PrimPols ability to reprime replication after a CTNA, mtDNA will eventually be lost because of the repeated incorporation of ddCTP by Pol  (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the situation of treatment with ddC, PrimPol is responsible for the increased replication initiation after UV exposure (Fig 3), although the damage seems to be tolerated in cells lacking PrimPol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that PrimPol is only one of several players involved in mtDNA damage response and its activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite PrimPol contributing to the defense against a range of genotoxic insults, it is not essential for cell survival after acute damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is apparent also from the fact that PrimPol can facilitate recovery after UV damage to nuclear DNA, but does not influence cell survival (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As stalled replication forks pose a great risk for genome integrity as a result of their tendency to collapse and form double-strand breaks with potentially catastrophic consequences, cells have evolved a number of partially redundant mechanisms to avoid such damage (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PrimPol_Primes_mtDNA_Synthesis_Independent_of_the_Replication_Origin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fully dsDNA replication intermediates exist in mitochondria (39, 40) and have been suggested to originate from bidirectional replication that is initiated downstream of OH (41) (SI Results and Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under normal conditions, dsDNA replication represents the minority of replicative molecules in mitotic cells, and it remains unsettled to which extent these intermediates represent an independent replication and not just more frequent lagging-strand initiation during strand-asymmetric replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, overexpression of PrimPol results in the generation of fully dsDNA replication intermediates (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As PrimPol can provide primers for Pol  on single-stranded substrate (Fig 2A, lanes 79), it is also likely to prime the lagging strand during asymmetric replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased lagging-strand priming would be the easiest explanation for the reduction of partially single-stranded circles (ssc in Fig 4C) as well as the increase in fully dsDNA replication intermediates in PrimPol-overexpressing cells (e.g., dy in Fig 4 and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although replication stalling is acknowledged as an important culprit behind pathological mtDNA deletions (15, 16), almost nothing is known about the fate of stalled replication intermediates, such as their subsequent processing, and which enzymatic players are involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that PrimPol is required for the reinitiation of replication in mitochondria will hopefully pave the way for further understanding of mtDNA replication mechanisms and how the mitochondrial genome is protected against various intrinsic and extrinsic stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Immortalization_of_MEFs_and_Generation_of_Flp-In_T-REx_293_PrimPol_Cell_Line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT Primpol (+/+) and Primpol-KO (/) cells (Fig S1A) were generated from primary MEFs (2) that were immortalized by transfection with an SV40T antigen expression vector using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers recommendation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfection, the cells were grown to confluence and passaged onto 10-cm tissue culture dishes, followed by another five 1/10 passages (i.e., a 1/100,000-fold splitting of the original cells), which exposes the cells to a strong negative selection against nontransformed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells that continue growing after 610 passages are considered immortalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, an inducible cell line expressing WT PrimPol was established by using Flp-In T-REx 293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloning of PrimPol cDNA with a C-terminal flag-tag into the pcDNA5FRTO and the generation of the cell line was performed essentially as in the work of Wanrooij et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, the transgene is expressed upon addition of doxycycline (Dox) to the growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dox 510 ng/mL was determined to give a stable long-term expression of the transgene (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these concentrations, Dox is nontoxic for mitochondrial functions (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

M13mp18 ssDNA (M13ssDNA) was used as a template to assay replication by PrimPol and Pol  in the presence of dideoxynucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pol A, Pol B (forming the holoenzyme Pol AB2), and PrimPol were expressed and purified as described previously (20, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Bis-Tris propane, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DDT, 200 M dNTPs, 1 mM ATP, [-32P]dGTP as radioactive tracer, and the indicated amount of ddCTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When indicated, 12.5 nM Pol A, 18.75 nM Pol B (as a dimer), and 200 nM PrimPol was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was performed by using 5 nM of singly- or nonprimed M13ssDNA (the 28-mer primer is complementary to nucleotides 6,2186,245).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, stopped with 0.5% SDS/25 mM EDTA, purified with G-25 columns (GE Healthcare), and loaded on a 1% alkaline (30 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) agarose gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel was run at 20 V for 16 h (4 °C), dried, exposed to a storage phosphor screen, and scanned with a Typhoon 9400 device (Amersham Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Total protein lysate for SDS/PAGE was extracted from cell pellets by using Totex extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM -glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors) and quantified by using Bradford assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 40 µg samples of total proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE by using a 8% Laemmli gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane in Towbin buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated for 1 h with the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemiluminescent detection and quantification was performed by using a BioSpectrum 810 imaging system detection instrument (UVP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-flag (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABIN871107; Antibodies Online), 1:5,000; mouse anti-vinculin (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V9264; Sigma), 1:10,000; rabbit anti-PrimPol (2), 1:5,000; mouse anti-HSP60 (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABIN361784; Antibodies Online), 1:20,000; rabbit anti-H1.2 (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ab181973; Abcam), 1:5,000; and goat anti-Lamin A/C (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sc-6215; Santa Cruz), 1:500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies used were Novex goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A16104; Life Technologies), goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABIN101744; Antibodies Online), and bovine anti-goat IgG HRP (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sc-2352; Santa Cruz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mitochondrial_Targeted_PrimPol_Constructs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The different variants of PrimPol were cloned with a C-terminal flag-tag into the pcDNA5FRTO vector as done previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MTS-PrimPol, the mitochondrial targeting sequence of human TFAM (aa 150) was inserted at the N terminus of PrimPol-flag using the Acc65I and BamHI restriction sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the MTS-hPrimPol-Flag insert was digested with AflII (BsptI) and ApaI and ligated into the pcDNA5-FRT-TO plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A primase-dead variant of MTS-PrimPol was made by using site-directed mutagenesis to generate a double point mutation (C419G/H426Y) in the zinc finger motif (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generation of the cell lines was performed essentially as in a previous work (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, the transgene is expressed upon addition of Dox to the growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated recombinant proteins were determined to be exclusively mitochondrially targeted (Fig S7C) and to give a stable, long-term expression with 510 ng/mL of Dox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following oligos were used for mutagenesis:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Dimensional_AGE_and_Southern_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 5 g of mitochondrial nucleic acid was digested according to the manufacturers recommendation with BclI or HincII (both from Thermo Scientific) and run on a 0.4% agarose gel in 1× TBE until the fragments of interest had migrated 10 cm into the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel slab was rotated 90°, and a 0.95% agarose gel was cast around it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second dimension was run until the fragment of interest had migrated 10 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long-range 2D AGEs, 5 g of mitochondrial nucleic acids was digested with FastDigest BamHI or PvuII (Thermo Scientific), which cut mtDNA only once, and run on a 0.28% agarose gel in 1× TBE until the linearized mtDNA fragment had migrated 10 cm into the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel slab was rotated 90°, and a 0.58% agarose gel was cast around it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second dimension was run at 2.6 V/cm until the fragment of interest had migrated 10 cm from the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southern blotting was performed by using the standard procedure, and the nucleic acid hybridization was performed by using a PCR probe spanning nucleotides 14,78315,333 (Cytb) of the mouse mtDNA and 4,4705,511 (ND2) or 35611 (NCR) of the human mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probes were labeled by using a Rediprime II random prime labeling kit (GE Healthcare) and [-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autoradiographs were exposed on a Kodak MS film (Sigma-Aldrich) or were captured on a Kodak storage phosphor screen SO230 and detected by using Molecular Imager FX (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mapping of PrimPol priming site was performed by an adapted protocol for 5-RACE (45) using the following primers:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PrimPol-dependent Pol  products were obtained by using the standard reaction on nonprimed M13ssDNA (as described earlier) and purified by using a spin column-based DNA purification system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complementary strand was then synthesized by using a template-specific primer P1; a 5-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 30 s annealing at 53 °C and one-step extension at 72 °C for 30 min with Taq polymerase (Promega GoTaq G2 Hot Start Polymerase) were performed by using the manufacturers recommended reaction mixture composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction products were spin-column purified, and a poly(A)-tail was appended by a 15-min incubation with terminal transferase (NEB) in the recommended buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After deactivation of terminal transferase, the products were diluted fourfold with dH2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first round of PCR amplification was performed by using 1 µL of diluted template, primers P2, PT, and PO, and 30 cycles of amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained products were run on 1% agarose gel and spin-column purified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1 µL of 100-fold diluted products were used as a template for the second round of PCR amplification (30 cycles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions were run according to the manufacturers instructions by using primers P3 and PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both PCRs were performed with Promega GoTaq G2 Hot Start Polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained products were run on a 1% agarose gel, spin-column purified, and sent for sequencing by using primer PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mitochondrial_Fractionation_and_PrimPol_Coimmunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 10-cm dish of T-REx 293 MTS-PrimPol cells was harvested 26 h after induction with 100 ng/mL Dox (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing the cell pellet with ice-cold PBS solution and centrifugation (500 × g, 3 min), the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold 0.1× homogenization buffer (HG buffer; 10× HG buffer, 400 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.8, 250 mM NaCl, and 50 mM MgCl2) containing 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific) and incubated on ice for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were disrupted with 6080 strokes in a glass-glass homogenizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell disruption was monitored with Trypan Blue staining under a light microscope, and 125 µL of 10× HG buffer was added to stop the hypotonic lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by two centrifugation steps at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear pellet of the first centrifugation step was incubated in 995 µL of 1× HG buffer plus 5 µL of 10% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice to lyse unbroken cells and centrifuged (1,200 × g, 3 min, 4 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria in the postnuclear supernatant were pelleted at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 1× HG buffer, and centrifuged again to obtained a crude mitochondrial fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postmitochondrial supernatant was kept as cytosolic fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear and crude mitochondrial fractions were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, and 2 mM EDTA] containing 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each fraction, equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting by using the following primary antibodies: anti-Flag M2 (1:1,000; Sigma), anti-Pol  (1:1,000; Abcam), anti-OPA1 (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  612606; BD Biosciences), anti-GAPDH (1:2,500; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2118; Cell Signaling), anti-histone H2B (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12364; Cell Signaling), anti-lamin A/C (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4777; Cell Signaling), anti-Tom20 (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sc-11415; Santa Cruz), and anti-SSBP1 (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  122121-AP; Proteintech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mitochondria for Proteinase K accessibility assays were isolated according to the procedure described by Frezza et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (57), and the subsequent protocol for the Proteinase K accessibility assay was adapted from Dimmer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (58) In brief, cells from a 15-cm dish were harvested 24 h after induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS solution and centrifuged (500 × g, 3 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of ice-cold IBc buffer (10 mM TrisMops, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTATris, pH 7.4, 0.2 M sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.4) with 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific), and cells were disrupted in a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pestle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell disruption was monitored with Trypan Blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was subjected to a second round of homogenization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatants of both rounds of homogenization were then centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain crude mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria were washed with IBc buffer, centrifuged again (7,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and finally resuspended in 200 µL of IBc buffer before the mitochondrial concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, 50 µg of mitochondria was incubated with 100 µg/mL Proteinase K (Thermo Scientific) by resuspending the mitochondrial pellet in a reaction volume of 100 µL of IBc buffer (protease-treated mitochondria), 2 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 (protease-treated mitoplasts), or 2 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with a final concentration of 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (protease- and detergent-treated mitoplasts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After addition of Proteinase K, samples were incubated for 30 min on ice, and the reaction was inactivated by adding 0.2 µL of 1 M PMSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 50 µL of 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 4% (vol/vol) -mercaptoethanol following an analysis of 10 µL of each sample by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the coimmunoprecipitation, Flp-In T-REx 293 HEK MTS-PrimPol cells were harvested 24 h after induction with 10 ng/mL Dox (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D9891; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, uninduced cells were carried along.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were solubilized in Huttlin lysis buffer [50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40] (33) containing 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78430; Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubating 30 min on ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the protein concentration was quantified by using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23225; Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As input control, 25 µg total cell lysate was collected, while an equal amount of 1 mg of total cell lysate was incubated with 50 µL of anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (50% slurry; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M8823; Sigma) and incubated while rotating for 45.5 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing three times with 500 µL Huttlin lysis buffer (33), the immunoprecipitation was eluted with 50 µL of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1610747; Bio-Rad) containing 4% (vol/vol) -mercaptoethanol (10 min, 95 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluates and input samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting using the following primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-actin (1:5,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A5441; Sigma), anti-Flag M2 (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F1804; Sigma), anti-DNA Pol  (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ab128899; Abcam), anti-Twinkle (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ab187517; Abcam), anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:5,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31460; Invitrogen), anti-mouse IgG HRP (1:5,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31430; Invitrogen), mouse TrueBlot anti-mouse Ig HRP (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  188817-33; Rockland), and rabbit TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:1,000; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  188816-33; Rockland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detection, the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34080; Thermo Scientific) or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34096; Thermo Scientific) was used and detected with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
