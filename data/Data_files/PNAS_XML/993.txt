Trunk neural crest origin of dermal denticles in a cartilaginous fish  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The earliest mineralized skeleton of vertebrates was the dermal skeleton: superficial armor of tooth-like skeletal units composed of dentine and basal bone of attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remnants of this dentinous armor have been retained as teeth in the head of all jawed vertebrates and as dermal denticles in the skin of cartilaginous fishes (sharks and skates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) give rise to dentine-secreting odontoblasts of teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, trunk NCCs are regarded as nonskeletogenic, raising questions about the embryonic origin of postcranial denticles in cartilaginous fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that trunk NCCs give rise to trunk denticle odontoblasts in the skate, Leucoraja erinacea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding expands the repertoire of trunk NCC fates, highlighting the primitive skeletogenic potential of this cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cartilaginous fishes (e.g., sharks and skates) possess a postcranial dermal skeleton consisting of tooth-like denticles embedded within their skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with teeth, the principal skeletal tissue of dermal denticles is dentine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the head, cranial neural crest cells give rise to the dentine-producing cells (odontoblasts) of teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, trunk neural crest cells are generally regarded as nonskeletogenic, and so the embryonic origin of trunk denticle odontoblasts remains unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use expression of FoxD3 to pinpoint the specification and emigration of trunk neural crest cells in embryos of a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cell lineage tracing, we further demonstrate that trunk neural crest cells do, in fact, give rise to odontoblasts of trunk dermal denticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings expand the repertoire of vertebrate trunk neural crest cell fates during normal development, highlight the likely primitive skeletogenic potential of this cell population, and point to a neural crest origin of dentine throughout the ancestral vertebrate dermal skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dermal denticles of the little skate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) A skate hatchling and (B) skeletal preparation exhibit prominent dorsal median (arrow) and paired dorsolateral rows (arrowheads) of dermal denticles extending the length of the trunk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) These denticles (*) are recurved, with a tooth-like morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) A sagittal section through a differentiated dermal denticle (preeruption) at embryonic stage 33 reveals a pulp cavity filled with mesenchyme (Pulp in Di), a morphologically distinct layer of dentine-secreting odontoblasts (Odont.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in Di) lining the wall of the pulp cavity, and a layer of cuboidal enamel-secreting ameloblasts (Amel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in Di).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bars: A and B, 1 cm; C, 750 m; D, 20 m; Di, 10 m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neural crest is a multipotent cell population that undergoes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition from the developing central nervous system of vertebrate embryos and that migrates extensively to give rise to a diversity of skeletal and nonskeletal cell types (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological studies of shark (Scyliorhinus torazame) embryos have revealed that neural crest cells begin to emigrate from the cranial neural tube at developmental stage (S)18 and from the trunk neural tube at approximately stage S19 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, with staging according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the timing of trunk neural crest cell emigration in skate embryos, we conducted a series of mRNA in situ hybridization experiments to characterize expression of the transcription factor, FoxD3a neural crest specifier that is expressed in nascent and early migratory neural crest cells (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At S18 (Fig 2A), we observed FoxD3-expressing cells (i.e., premigratory neural crest cells) in the dorsal trunk neural tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that, as in the shark, trunk neural crest cells begin emigrating in skate embryos at S19, based on the appearance FoxD3-expressing cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition from the dorsal trunk neural tube (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This migration continues through S22 (Fig 2C), at which point we also begin to observe rostral differentiation of trunk neural crest derivatives (e.g., dorsal root ganglia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To label premigratory trunk neural crest cells in skate embryos, we microinjected the lipophilic dye CM-DiI into the lumen of the trunk neural tube at S18 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy ensures focal labeling of the neural tube (including premigratory neural crest cells) and has been used extensively in other systems to test neural crest cell fates (2226).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five days postinjection, labeled neural crest cells could be observed emigrating from the trunk neural tube of CM-DiIinjected skate embryos (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos with CM-DiIlabeled neural tubes were left to develop for 45 mo (to S33, when dermal denticles have differentiated within the trunk), at which point, histological examination revealed CM-DiIlabeled cells in expected trunk neural crest derivatives, such as dorsal root ganglia (Fig 3C) and melanocytes (Fig 3D), as well as in the odontoblast layer of trunk dermal denticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cartilaginous fish dermal denticles, the odontoblast layer is morphologically distinct within the pulp cavity and consists of polarized secretory cells with characteristic cell processes lying adjacent to newly secreted dentine matrix (3) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we recovered 15 CM-DiIlabeled trunk denticle odontoblasts in embryos that were examined histologically (n = 8; Fig 3 E and Fadditional examples provided in Fig S1), indicating their neural crest origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven out of eight examined embryos possessed CM-DiIlabeled odontoblasts, with each positive embryo possessing between one and four labeled cells (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CM-DiIlabeled odontoblasts always occurred singly, with their rarity likely due to dilution of the label through substantial proliferation between labeling and analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some embryos (n = 4) possessed CM-DiIlabeled cells within tissue of the denticle pulp cavity, and some (n = 4) also possessed occasional CM-DiIpositive ameloblasts (Fig S2 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While tooth ameloblasts are generally regarded as an exclusively ectodermally derived cell type (6), one genetic lineage-tracing study using P0-Cre/R26R mice previously suggested that a small number of tooth ameloblasts might, in fact, derive from neural crest cells (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of CM-DiIpositive ameloblasts in chondrichthyan trunk dermal denticles could be indicative of a neural crest contribution to the ameloblast layer of dental organs within the vertebrate dermal skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do observe signs of ectodermal contamination in embryos with CM-DiIlabeled neural tubes (a result of colabeling of some surface ectoderm at the site of trunk neural tube injection), and we therefore cannot rule out ectodermal contamination as the basis of these labeled ameloblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When labeling the trunk neural tube with CM-DiI, we would sometimes contaminate adjacent paraxial mesodermal cells (as evidenced by the presence of some CM-DiIpositive chondrocytes within the axial skeleton of S33 embryos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the paraxial mesodermal origin of teleost scales (1012), we sought to specifically test for mesodermal contributions to skate trunk dermal denticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three S18 skate embryos, we focally labeled the presomitic paraxial mesoderm of the trunk (Fig S3A), which sits ventrolateral to the neural tube (Fig S3B) and again left embryos to develop until S33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon examination, no CM-DiIlabeled odontoblasts or pulp cavity cells were observed in the denticles of any of these embryos, despite extensive labeling of other paraxial mesodermal derivatives, such as chondrocytes of the axial skeleton (Fig S3C) and pectoral girdle (Fig S3D), and trunk musculature (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments therefore provide no evidence of a paraxial mesodermal contribution to the trunk denticles of the little skate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been demonstrated that the trunk neural crest cells of mouse (28), chick (29), and axolotl (30) may be pushed toward a skeletogenic fate through transplantation or recombination with cranial epithelia in vitro, and it has been suggested that this reflects the vestigial skeletogenic potential of trunk neural crest cells that is suppressed in tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our demonstration of a neural crest origin of trunk dermal denticles during normal development in a cartilaginous fish is consistent with this view and points to the likely primitive skeletogenic potential of trunk neural crest cells in vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the mesodermal origin of teleost scales (a likely derivative of the basal-most bony layer of the ostracoderm dermal skeleton), we hypothesize that the multilayered dermal armor of stem gnathostomes may have consisted of a basal, mesodermally derived osteogenic component and a superficial, neural crest-derived odontogenic component (Fig 4), with each of these layers being variously retained, reduced, or lost in different vertebrate lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scales of some nonteleost actinopterygian fishes, such as Polypterus, appear to have retained both the osteogenic and odontogenic components of the postcranial dermal skeleton (15), rendering them an important model system with which to further test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has recently been demonstrated that several well-established neural crest derivatives in both the head (e.g., tooth odontoblastsref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31) and the trunk (e.g., melanocytes, parasympathetic ganglia, and enteric neuronsrefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 and 3234) arise from neural crest-derived Schwann cell precursors associated with nerve fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If trunk denticle odontoblasts share a similar Schwann cell precursor origin, such a cell lineage bottleneck (along with dilution of CM-DiI through extensive proliferation) could account for the small number of CM-DiIpositive odontoblasts observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While further cell lineage-tracing experiments using indelible labels (e.g., genomically integrated fluorescent reporters) will eventually allow us to more accurately assess the precise nature and extent of the neural crest contribution to the postcranial skeleton of cartilaginous fishes, our current findings support the notion that the odontoblast is a potentially uniquely neural crest-derived skeletal cell type (35) and highlights the neural crest as the source of the dentine throughout the primitive vertebrate dermal skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Embryo_Collection_and_Fate_Mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skate (Leucoraja erinacea) eggs were obtained at the Marine Biological Laboratory and maintained in a flow-through seawater system at 16 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CM-DiI was prepared for microinjection as described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For injection of S18 skate embryos, eggs were removed from the water, briefly dried, and a small window was cut in the top surface of the egg case with a razor blade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CM-DiI was microinjected through the jelly layer into the lumen of the neural tube or the paraxial mesoderm using a Picospritzer pressure injector, and the window was then sealed completely using a piece of donor egg shell adhered with a cyanoacrylate adhesive (Krazy Glue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All injected embryos were left to develop in a flow-through seawater system until S33 (45 mo postinjection), at which point embryos were euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 (1 g/L), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C, rinsed three times in PBS, and stored in PBS + 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal work complied with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Skeletal_Preparation__Histology__and_mRNA_in_Situ_Hybridization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-mount skeletal preparations and paraffin sections were produced as previously described (37, 38), and histochemical staining of paraffin sections was performed according to the Massons trichrome protocol of Witten and Hall (39) or according to a standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections of CM-DiIinjected embryos were coverslipped with Fluoromount G + DAPI, imaged with fluorescence, and then decoverslipped (by soaking overnight in water) and stained with Massons trichrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wholemount and paraffin section mRNA in situ hybridization for FoxD3 (GenBank Accession Number MF281542) was performed as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
