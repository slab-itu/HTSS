Transcriptional control of amino acid homeostasis is disrupted in Huntingtons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aberrant amino acid metabolism has been reported in Huntingtons disease (HD), but its molecular origins are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that the master regulator of amino acid homeostasis, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), is dysfunctional in HD, reflecting oxidative stress generated by impaired cysteine biosynthesis and transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, antioxidant supplementation reverses the diminished ATF4 response to nutrient stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a molecular link between amino acid disposition and oxidative stress that underlies multiple degenerative processes in HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disruption may be relevant to cellular dysfunction in other neurodegenerative conditions involving oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agents that restore cysteine balance may provide therapeutic benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Disturbances in amino acid metabolism, which have been observed in Huntingtons disease (HD), may account for the profound inanition of HD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HD is triggered by an expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the protein huntingtin (Htt), impacting diverse cellular processes, ranging from transcriptional regulation to cognitive and motor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that the master regulator of amino acid homeostasis, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), is dysfunctional in HD because of oxidative stress contributed by aberrant cysteine biosynthesis and transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these observations, antioxidant supplementation reverses the disordered ATF4 response to nutrient stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings establish a molecular link between amino acid disposition and oxidative stress leading to cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signaling cascade may be relevant to other diseases involving redox imbalance and deficits in amino acid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Regulation_of_CSE_and_Its_Transcription_Factor_ATF4_by_Cysteine_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier we reported a deficit of CSE in HD, which could account for neuropathologic and clinical features of the disease (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the reverse transsulfuration pathway via which cysteine is generated as a readout to study ATF4 function in HD (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cysteine becomes essential when activity or expression of CSE is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mice deleted for CSE lose weight on a cysteine-free diet (Fig S1A) and die within 2 wk (21, 22) after undergoing massive muscle wastage and associated motor deficits as assessed by the rotarod assay (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These abnormalities, reminiscent of several mouse models of HD, can be reversed by cysteine supplementation (Fig S1B and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deprivation of cysteine for as little as 1 h leads to increased CSE protein levels (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the cysteine concentration at which significant induction of CSE occurs without compromising cell viability, we cultured MEFs in media containing various cysteine levels (Fig 1C and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing basal concentrations of cysteine from 0.2 mM (regular medium) to 0.05 mM doubles CSE levels, whereas in cysteine-free medium CSE levels are about six times the value in regular medium (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a 0.05-mM cysteine (low cysteine, LC) concentration to reflect cysteine deficiency without eliciting major pathologic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under basal conditions SP1 is the principal transcription factor regulating levels of CSE, whereas in response to stress, especially with lowered amino acid levels, ATF4 is a major determinant of CSE expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of CSE and ATF4 occurs in response to cysteine deprivation with particularly striking influences upon ATF4 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For wild-type MEFs, levels of ATF4 are almost ninefold higher with low-cysteine medium than with regular medium, which is significantly greater than in CSE-deleted cells (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, SP1 levels are essentially the same in wild-type and CSE-deleted MEFs with either normal or low-cysteine concentrations (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF4 expression is dynamically and rapidly regulated in response to cysteine (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elevated levels of ATF4 elicited by low cysteine are restored to baseline values within 1 h of cysteine supplementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As HD is characterized by aberrant cysteine metabolism, with CSE as well as cysteine transporters altered alongside abnormalities in amino acid levels (8, 23, 24), we explored the regulation of ATF4 and its targets in a striatal cell culture model of HD harboring the expanded glutamine repeats characteristic of mHtt (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HD, basal CSE expression is diminished due to sequestration of SP1, the basal transcriptional activator for CSE, by mHtt (8) (Fig 1F and Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease observed in the HD striatal cells resembles that observed in CSE-depleted MEFs (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High ATF4 levels, as occur in amino acid deprivation, induce CSE expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, overexpressing ATF4 in Q111 cells rescues CSE expression as well as growth in cysteine-free medium, consistent with a role for ATF4 in regulating CSE in striatal cells (Fig S1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF4 levels are significantly augmented by cysteine depletion at 0.05 mM and progressively increase at lower cysteine concentrations in wild-type Q7 striatal cells, exhibiting a concentrationresponse relationship (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Q111 cells, low-cysteine concentrations fail to induce ATF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deficient ATF4 induction in Q111 cells is paralleled by a similar lack of CSE inducibility (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure of Q111 cells to respond to low-cysteine levels is not an artifact of altered temporal regulation, as at multiple intervals from 1 to 24 h after low-cysteine exposure, ATF4 and CSE levels in Q111 cells remain negligible (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF4 expression steadily increases with time in Q7 cells in 0.05 mM cysteine, whereas in Q111 cells, this increase is virtually absent (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alterations of CSE and ATF4 are not attributable to toxic sequelae of altered cysteine concentrations, as cell survival is not markedly different in Q7 and Q111 cells in regular medium and is only modestly decreased in Q111 cells maintained on low-cysteine medium (Fig S1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Failure_of_ATF4_Induction_Is_Specific_to_Cysteine_Deprivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We monitored transcriptional targets of ATF4, such as the genes for xCT, the transporter for cystine; cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1), a transporter for positively charged amino acids; and LAT1, a transporter for large amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to CSE, these genes exhibit a diminished response to cysteine deprivation in Q111 cells (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As another means of eliciting cysteine deficiency, we treated cells with erastin, which blocks cystine import by inhibiting xCT (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of ATF4 by erastin in Q7 cells is lost in Q111 cells, confirming that the deficient response in HD due to lack of cysteine is linked to regulatory mechanisms for amino acid deprivation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, erastin treatment fails to activate transcription of the ATF4 targets, Cth (Cse), xCT, Cat1, and Lat1 significantly (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Is the deficient response of ATF4 in Q111 cells specific to cysteine deprivation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored the induction of ATF4 by other stress stimuli in striatal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated thapsigargin, a known inducer of ATF4, which elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress by depleting intracellular calcium stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thapsigargin markedly induces ATF4 to a similar extent in Q7 and Q111 cells in addition to the ER stress markers, phosphorylated PERK, and binding Ig protein BiP (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subcellular localization of the transcription factor ATF4 was also monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence analysis reveals selective concentration of ATF4 in nuclei with no notable differences in Q7 and Q111 cells in response to thapsigargin and in Q7 cells in response to low cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No induction of ATF4 is observed in Q111 cells under low cysteine (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deficient response of Q111 cells to low cysteine occurs at the transcriptional level as Atf4 mRNA fails to increase in Q111 cells cultured in low cysteine (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disrupted ATF4 response is unique to cysteine deprivation as in Q111 cells induction of ATF4 by arginine, lysine, glutamine, and leucine deprivation appears normal (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We wondered whether the deficient ATF4 response in HD might stem from abnormalities in amino acid sensing, a process that is reflected by levels of phosphoGCN2 (20) that serve as a marker for amino acid deprivation (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cysteine deprivation elicits a similar augmentation of phosphoGCN2 in Q111 as in Q7 cells, indicating that amino acid sensing is intact in HD (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cysteine is metabolized by CSE to H2S, the diminution of which in HD might be pathogenic, we considered whether a decrease in H2S might be responsible for the aberrant ATF4 induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the H2S donors, GYY4137 and NaHS, fail to rescue the deficient ATF4 responses to low cysteine in Q111 cells (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Low_Cysteine_Promotes_Oxidative_Stress_in_HD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What distinguishes cysteine from other amino acids?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cysteine is unique among amino acids in displaying antioxidant properties so that its depletion might elicit oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEFs from CSE knockout cells display a doubling of basal protein carbonylation as well as enhanced sensitivity to the oxidant H2O2 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, toxic effects of H2O2 and homocysteic acid, an oxidant and analog of glutamate, are increased in neurons of CSE-deleted mice (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of CSE in HD cells appears to influence oxidative stress responses, as oxidative stress is doubled in Q111 cells in normal medium and increased 3.5-fold in cells on low cysteine (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic examination reveals augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) throughout the cells of Q111 preparations compared with Q7 cells, which is accentuated in response to cysteine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the extent of oxidative stress elicited by H2O2 in Q7 cells and Q111 cells cultured in low cysteine (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress levels in Q111 cells are almost doubled by low cysteine, reaching levels similar to that generated by 100 µM H2O2 in Q7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antioxidant_Supplementation_Restores_the_ATF4_Response_to_Cysteine_Deprivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If oxidative stress underlies the abnormal response to low cysteine in HD, then these aberrations might be mimicked by treating normal cells with oxidants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incubated Q7 cells with 100 µM H2O2 to induce oxidative stress equivalent to that observed in Q111 cells under low cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress appears to blunt induction of ATF4 by low cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Q7 cells low cysteine elicits increased ATF4 levels, whereas this increase is diminished in cells exposed to low cysteine in the presence of H2O2 (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses of Atf4 mRNA are similar to the increases elicited in protein levels with low cysteine quadrupling Atf4 mRNA levels in Q7 cells, whereas H2O2 substantially diminishes this response (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, target genes for ATF4, such as Cse, xCT, Cat1, and Lat1, are up-regulated by low cysteine, an effect prevented by H2O2 treatment (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of redox balance in regulating the ATF4 inducibility during low-cysteine conditions is evident in experiments using the antioxidant ascorbate (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a concentration-dependent fashion, ascorbate increases the diminished ATF4 levels of Q111 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elevated oxidative stress in Q111 cells appears to be responsible for the lack of induction of ATF4 in HD (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The principal finding of our study is that disordered amino acid homeostasis in HD reflects dysfunctions of the transcription factor ATF4, a master regulator of amino acid disposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perturbation stems from the oxidative stress generated by cysteine deficits associated with the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to depletion of CSE, the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, levels of two cysteine/cystine transporters, the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3/EAAC1), and the solute carrier family 7, member 11 (SLC7A11/xCT), are also diminished in HD (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF4 regulates transcription of SLC7A11/xCT as well as CSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may reflect a vicious cycle in HD, which commences with the sequestration of SP1 by mHtt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to decreased CSE expression, depressed levels of cysteine, and diminished antioxidant defenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cysteine has antioxidant properties and is a component of the major antioxidant glutathione, depletion of cysteine augments oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low levels of oxidative stress physiologically enhance ATF4 and CSE expression, responses that are disrupted during the chronic oxidative stress of HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of CSE induction leads to further oxidative stress that, in turn, further exacerbates redox imbalance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cycle thereby maintains diminished CSE along with heightened oxidative stress and blunted ATF4 response (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, oxidative stress within a physiological range can be mitigated by the ATF4 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the oxidative stress persists or exceeds a certain level, restorative responses of ATF4 decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest a threshold for oxidative stress beyond which induction of ATF4 is diminished (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ATF4 is a prominent regulator for diverse aspects of amino acid disposition, which include metabolism of cysteine and branched chain amino acids (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of branched chain amino acids has been implicated in muscle shrinkage observed in HD (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a pathogenic role for cysteine deficiency in HD is supported by the beneficial effects of N-acetylcysteine (8, 27) and couples with evidence for cysteine disturbances in other conditions of oxidative stress including aging, neurodegeneration, AIDS, and insulin resistance syndrome (2832).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbances of cysteine disposition in multiple diseases may reflect a form of cysteine stress with widespread impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stimulating the reverse transsulfuration pathway offers therapeutic avenues for mitigating symptoms associated with diseases involving oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
