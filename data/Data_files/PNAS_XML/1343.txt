Junctional membrane Ca2+ dynamics in human muscle fibers are altered by malignant hyperthermia causative RyR mutation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In human muscle with ryanodine receptor (RyR) variants, there is expected to be a change in the basal RyRs Ca2+ leak that may alter local Ca2+ dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not currently possible to assess these basal Ca2+ dynamics in human muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By trapping a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye in the transverse tubular (t)-system of freshly biopsied human skeletal muscle fibers we could detect tiny local RyR-dependent Ca2+ movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that malignant hyperthermia (MH) causative RyR variant human muscle displays a chronically different RyR Ca2+ leak which reconfigures the Ca2+-handling properties by the t-system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach can be used to assess human muscle for function and pathogenicity of other RyR variants of uncertain significance, MH susceptibility, and assessment of drugs targeted to the Ca2+-handling proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the nanometer-wide tubules of the transverse tubular (t)-system of human skeletal muscle fibers as sensitive sensors for the quantitative monitoring of the Ca2+-handling properties in the narrow junctional cytoplasmic space sandwiched between the tubular membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae in single muscle fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The t-system sealed with a Ca2+-sensitive dye trapped in it is sensitive to changes in ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ leak, the store operated calcium entry flux, plasma membrane Ca pump, and sodiumcalcium exchanger activities, thus making the sealed t-system a nanodomain Ca2+ sensor of Ca2+ dynamics in the junctional space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor was used to assess the basal Ca2+-handling properties of human muscle fibers obtained by needle biopsy from control subjects and from people with a malignant hyperthermia (MH) causative RyR variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach we show that the muscle fibers from MH-susceptible individuals display leakier RyRs and a greater capacity to extrude Ca2+ across the t-system membrane compared with fibers from controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a quantitative way to assess the effect of RyR variants on junctional membrane Ca2+ handling under defined ionic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The Ca2+ difference across the t-system membrane at steady state can be determined using rhod-5N trapped in the sealed t-system of a muscle fiber (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sealing of the t-system transforms it into a closed compartment confining changes in [Ca2+]t-sys to movements of Ca2+ across the t-system membrane (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At steady state the Ca2+ movements across the t-system membrane from the cytosolic space to the t-system lumen must be balanced by Ca2+ movements in the opposite direction from the t-system lumen to the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The t-system membrane contains several types of channels that mediate Ca2+ movements down its electrochemical gradient from the t-system lumen to cytosolic space and two Ca2+-extrusion systems that can move Ca2+ in the opposite direction: PMCA (5) and NCX (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific arrangement of the RyRs facing the tetrads (voltage sensors) on the t-system membrane creates a junctional space where the concentration of Ca2+, [Ca2+]JS, must be sensitive to the Ca2+ flux through the RyRs, in addition to the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, [Ca2+]cyto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximity of the PMCA and NCX proteins to the junctional space would also make the Ca2+ extrusion fluxes sensitive to the [Ca2+]JS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, activation of SOCE would enhance the Ca2+ flux down its electrochemical gradient and at the same time could alter [Ca2+]JS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diagrams showing the interaction between different Ca2+ fluxes and their effect on the [Ca2+]t-sys and how we measure them are displayed in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The peak rates of Ca2+ extrusion into the lumen of the sealed t-tubules of mechanically skinned fibers was measured from the maximum rate of Ca2+ rise in the t-tubules {d[Ca2+]t-sys/dt} in a particular solution after the t-tubules had been first thoroughly depleted of Ca2+ in the presence of caffeine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to 30 mM caffeine and low Mg2+ concentration (0.01 mM) depletes Ca2+ in the SR causing activation of the SOCE, which, in turn, depletes Ca2+ in the sealed t-system (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substitution of the caffeine solution with a solution heavily buffered for Ca2+ at 67 nM and containing 1 mM Mg2+ (similar conditions to those in mammalian muscle at rest), causes SR Ca2+ loading, which stops SOCE and allows [Ca2+]t-sys to rise to a steady value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak rate of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules is an indicator of the maximum extrusion rate of the combined PMCA and NCX systems, and the steady-state value of [Ca2+]t-sys reveals the Ca2+ entry rate into the cytosol, which is balanced by the Ca2+ extrusion rate under the respective conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tetracaine (Tet, 1 mM) is a potent and reversible blocker of the RyRs (21) which stops Ca2+ flow through the RyRs and thus prevents Ca2+ leaking out from the SR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of 1 mM Tet in the same solution as in the absence of Tet markedly reduced both the steady-state value of [Ca2+]t-sys and the peak rate of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, abolition of the SR Ca2+ flux through the RyRs under conditions similar to those in the muscle fibers at rest must have a direct impact on the Ca2+ dynamics in the junctional space causing changes in [Ca2+]t-sys, which we can measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of results in absolute [Ca2+]t-sys allows us to pool data collected under identical ionic conditions from different fibers and biopsies (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The radius of the domain centered on the RyRs in the junctional space in which PMCA, NCX, and STIM1Orai1 complexes that support SOCE can be determined from the length constant of the Ca2+ buffer buffer, which approximates the distance that Ca2+ can travel freely from RyRs, before it binds to the free Ca2+-buffer molecules in the cytosolic solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our standard cytosolic solution contains 37.5 mM free EGTA to buffer [Ca2+]cyto at [Ca2+] = 67 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length constant for EGTA at 67 nM [Ca2+]cytu E, is 62.5 nm, calculated with the expression: E, (DE/([EGTA]free.kE))0.5, where DE is the diffusion coefficient for EGTA, 220 m2s1 and kE is the Ca2+ binding rate constant to EGTA, 1.5 M1s1 (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAPTA has a similar diffusion coefficient as EGTA, but a much greater Ca2+ binding rate constant (400 M1s1) than EGTA, such that the length constant B of 1 mM free BAPTA solution is only 22.4 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the t-system to set its steady level was not affected when the length constant was reduced from 62.5 nm to 22.4 nm, but was compromised when it was reduced to 14.1 nm (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that PMCA and NCX, and STIM1Orai1 complexes that support SOCE, must be located within 14.122.4 nm of the RyRs in the human skeletal muscle to be influenced by the Ca2+ flux through the RyRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reversibly blocking the RyRs with 1 mM Tet (RyRs), while maintaining all other conditions the same, significantly reduced the steady-state [Ca2+]t-sys and the peak rate of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules not only at 67 nM [Ca2+]cyto but also at 200 nM as shown in Fig 2 A and B, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that 50 µM dantrolene, was also found to inhibit the Ca2+ leak through the RyRs in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ (23) as judged from changes in [Ca2+]t-sys (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown diagrammatically in Fig 1A, the presence of a Ca2+ leak through the RyRs causes the Ca2+ concentration in the junctional space {[Ca2+]JS} to be greater than that in the cytosol {[Ca2+]cyto}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, [Ca2+]JS becomes similar to [Ca2+]cyto when the Ca2+ leak through the RyRs is completely blocked (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, one can use the results in Fig 2 A and B to estimate [Ca2+]JS in +RyRs by projecting the [Ca2+]cyto at steady state, or the peak d[Ca2+]t-sys/dt data points measured in RyRs onto the [Ca2+]t-sys vs. [Ca2+]cyto or the peak d[Ca2+]t-sys/dt [Ca2+]t-syst vs. [Ca2+]cyto curves in RyRs, respectively, and then read the corresponding values on the [Ca2+]cyto axis as shown in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between [Ca2+]JS and [Ca2+]cyto in the +RyRs is shown in Fig 2C where the predicted average values for the [Ca2+]JS using the curves in Fig 2 A and B are shown by the solid lines in black and green, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected ranges of the [Ca2+]JS values are bounded by the dashed external lines of the same color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower [Ca2+]t-sys at steady-state and peak rates of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules in the presence of Tet (Fig 2 A and B) indicates a decreased Ca2+ extrusion into the t-system lumen and/or increased Ca2+ flux down its electrochemical gradient from the t-tubules to the cytosolic space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since [Ca2+]t-sys is lower in the presence of Tet and Tet also blocks the Na+ channels (24) in the t-system through which Ca2+ may diffuse down its electrochemical gradient, the decrease in [Ca2+]t-sys in this situation must be caused by a decreased Ca2+ extrusion rate from the cytosol into the t-system lumen by PMCA and/or NCX, which are both sensitive to [Ca2+]JS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that [Ca2+]t-sys appears to reach similar maximum values in the presence of Tet as in its absence when [Ca2+]cyto and [Ca2+]JS rise (Fig 2 A and B), indicating that while 1 mM Tet effectively blocks the Ca2+ flux through the RyRs, 1 mM Tet does not markedly alter the NCX and/or PMCA activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The direction of Ca2+ transport by PMCA is always from the cytosol to the lumen of the t-tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the net direction of the movement of the transported ions by the NCX depends entirely on the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and Ca2+ ions because the operation of NCX is fully reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, NCX extrudes Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of the t-tubules when [Ca2+]t-sys/[Ca2+]JS less_than ([Na]t-sys/[Na+]JS)3 eVm F/RT (where Vm is the electrical potential difference across the t-system membrane between the cytosol and the t-system lumen, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature) and transports Ca2+ from the t-tubules to the cytosol when [Ca2+]t-sys/[Ca2+]JS  greater than  ([Na]t-sys/[Na+]JS)3 eVm F/RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dashed curve in Fig 2D shows the relationship between [Ca2+]t-sys and [Ca2+]JS when the NCX system in the t-tubule membrane is at equilibrium ([Ca2+]t-sys/[Ca2+]js = ([Na]t-sys/[Na+]cyto)3 eVm F/RT) under our conditions ([Na+]t-sys  150 mM; [Na+]JS = 36 mM; Vm  75 mV, T = 298 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For [Ca2+]t-sys values below the dashed curve, the NCX system transports Ca2+ in the forward mode from the junctional space into the lumen of the t-tubules and for [Ca2+]t-sys values above the dashed curve, the NCX system transports Ca2+ in the reverse mode, from the lumen of the t-tubules into the junctional space (cytosol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the data shown in Fig 2D, the NCX system works in reverse mode in all [Ca2+]cyto solutions used, except for the highest [Ca2+]cyto solution, where the NCX is effectively at equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that in that solution all Ca2+ extrusion into the t-system is done by the PMCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Fig 2B, the mean value of the maximum rate of Ca2+ extrusion by PMCA in this solution was 0.17 ± 0.04 mM s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During Ca2+ release, when NCX forward mode would be activated, a Ca2+-extrusion rate of 1 mM s1 has been measured (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was no statistically significant change in [Ca2+]t-sys when the NCX was blocked with ORM-10103 (26) at [Ca2+]cyto of 200 nM, indicating that the Ca2+ flux across the t-system membrane is very small (compared with the Ca2+ flux carried by PMCA), when NCX works in reverse mode in the human muscle fibers (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with other studies, which showed that the NCX is regulated by a high affinity activation Ca2+ binding site on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (19, 20) and means that PMCA alone is effectively responsible for the Ca2+ extrusion from the junctional space to the t-system under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Ca2+ influx into the cytosol from the t-system was directly proportional to [Ca2+]t-sys, then the relationship between [Ca2+]t-sys and [Ca2+]JS would follow the dependence of PMCA on [Ca2+]JS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then from Fig 2D one would conclude that the PMCA in human muscle under our conditions has a Kd value of 93.6 ± 10.8 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can now consider the role played by the NCX in the regulation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the intact human muscle fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2E shows the relationship between [Ca2+]t-sys and [Ca2+]JS when the NCX system in the t-tubule membrane is at equilibrium for the conditions prevalent in the intact human skeletal muscle: the ionized Ca2+ in the t-tubules is buffered to the same level as that of the plasma (1.5 mM Ca2+); the extracellular Na+ concentration is 140 mM; the mean intracellular Na+ concentration is 22.85 mM (SI Appendix, Methods); the mean resting membrane potential, Vm is 80 mV, and the muscle temperature is 36 °C (T = 309 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the NCX is at equilibrium when the [Ca2+]JS = 230 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured [Ca2+]cyto in the human skeletal muscle is about 110 nM (27) which corresponds to  greater than 500 nM in the junctional space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig 2E one can see that at [Ca2+]JS  greater than  500 nM, the NCX works in the forward mode transporting Ca2+ from the cytosol into the lumen of the t-tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if [Ca2+]JS was the same as in the cytosol (110 nM) then NCX would work in reverse mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the NCX is close to equilibrium when the muscle is at rest, it suggests that the NCX system plays the major role in regulating the cytosolic Ca2+ level in the human skeletal muscle at rest, when the Ca2+ fluxes are low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCX extrudes Ca2+ when the [Ca2+]JS  greater than  230 nM and effectively stops transporting when in reverse mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 1 mM concentration, Mg2+ exerts a strong inhibitory action on the RyRs in skeletal muscle (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as shown in Fig 1D, reducing [Mg2+]cyto from 1 mM to 0.01 mM in the presence of caffeine, causes SR Ca2+ depletion, which in turn, activates SOCE, resulting in the depletion of Ca2+ in the sealed t-tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2F shows the effect of increasing [Ca2+]cyto from 28 to 1,342 nM on the [Ca2+]t-sys under conditions where the Ca2+ leak through the RyRs was increased by reducing [Mg2+]cyto from 1 mM to 0.13 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the shape of the [Ca2+]t-sys vs. [Ca2+]cyto curve changed from a monotonic rising curve in Fig 2A to a dome-shaped curve when the RyRs were made leakier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, there was a marked decrease of [Ca2+]t-sys in the presence of 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leak through the RyRs rises at higher [Ca2+]cyto due to increased probability of RyRs to open as Ca2+ binds to the activation site on more RyRs (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SR pump is also more active as [Ca2+]cyto rises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined effect is an increased Ca2+ leak through the RyRs at 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto, which activates SOCE and partially depletes Ca2+ in the t-tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that Tet is as effective in blocking the RyRs at 1 mM as at 0.03 mM [Mg2+]cyto, with the data points for [Ca2+]t-sys being very similar in the presence of 1 and 0.03 mM [Mg2+]cyto (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that: (i) the t-system Ca2+ handling/fluxes per se is/are insensitive to [Mg2+]cyto and (ii) the t-system Ca2+ efflux/SOCE observed at 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto must be blocked in the presence of Tet, to allow the steady [Ca2+]t-sys level to reach that in 1 mM Mg2+ and Tet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_MH_Causative_RyR_Variant_Changes_T-System_Ca2+_Handling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in the Ca2+ fluxes in the nanodomain around the t-system membrane were investigated in muscle fibers from 4 MH susceptible (MHS) individuals from the same extended family, with the MH causative mutation on RYR1, c.7300G  greater than  A, p.2434Gly  greater than  Arg (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These individuals had previously displayed positive in vitro contracture tests (IVCTs) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments similar to those shown in Fig 1 were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A summary of the measurements for the steady-state [Ca2+]t-sys and peak rates of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules from the four MHS individuals is shown in Fig 3 A and B for the same range of [Ca2+]cyto as for normal (MHN) subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the results obtained on muscle fibers from MHN subjects shown in Fig 2 A and B, the curves for MHS individuals representing the relationships between [Ca2+]t-sys at steady-state vs. [Ca2+]cyto and peak rates of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules vs. [Ca2+]cyto with +RyRs and RyRs crossed over between the 200 and 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the shape of the curve [Ca2+]t-sys vs. [Ca2+]cyto in +RyRs for muscle fibers from MHS individuals obtained in the presence of 1 mM [Mg2+]cyto resembles the shape of the curve obtained with muscle fibers from MHN individuals in the presence of 0.13 mM [Mg2+]cyto, when the RyRs were made leakier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strongly indicates that the RyRs from MHS individuals are leakier under normal physiological conditions than those from MHN individuals, causing the activation of SOCE which reduces [Ca2+]t-sys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the radius from the RyRs for which Ca2+ leak influences PMCA and/or NCX proteins on the t-system membrane in MHS fibers is very similar to that in MHN fibers (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The higher peak rate of the net Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules of MHS fibers at 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto in the presence of Tet than when the RyRs were not blocked, indicates that the SOCE flux under these conditions was around 0.1 mM s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is 5- to 10-fold lower than the peak SOCE flux previously measured in human muscle fibers (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis of the results obtained at 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto with muscle fibers from MHN and MHS individuals (Fig 3C) shows that: (i) when the RyRs are blocked by Tet and SOCE activation is prevented, [Ca2+]t-sys is significantly greater in MHS than in MHN fibers; (ii) when RyRs are not blocked by Tet, [Ca2+]t-sys is significantly greater in MHN than in MHS fibers; and (iii) [Ca2+]t-sys in the MHS fibers in the absence of Tet is lower than in the presence of Tet, when the RyRs are blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Statistical analyses of results at other [Ca2+]cyto are in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The higher steady-state level of [Ca2+]t-sys in MHS than MHN muscle fibers at 1,342 nM in RyRs (Fig 3C) indicates that the Ca2+-extrusion flux must be more active in MHS than MHN muscle fibers as suggested by the results shown in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower [Ca2+]t-sys values in MHS fibers at 1,342 nM [Ca2+]cyto with +RyRs than RyRs indicates SOCE activation in MHS fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leakier RyRs in MHS than in MHN fibers would cause SR to be less loaded with Ca2+ in MHS than MHN fibers at the same [Ca2+]cyto, which, in turn, would cause faster depletion of Ca2+ in the SR behind the RyRs and activation of SOCE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a combination of leakier RyRs with lower level of SR loading with Ca2+ can produce lower [Ca2+]JS than a combination of less leaky RyRs but higher Ca2+ loading of the SR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When SOCE is activated it is difficult to predict [Ca2+]JS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the resting [Ca2+]cyto was found to be several fold greater in MHS muscle fibers than in MHN muscle fibers (390 vs. 120 nM, respectively; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3 A and B, the steady-state [Ca2+]t-sys and peak rate of Ca2+ entry into t-tubules at 390 nM [Ca2+]cyto in MHS fibers are similar (or lower) in +RyRs than in RyRs, suggesting a low level of SOCE activation with +RyRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because [Ca2+]JS must be higher if there is any leak through the RyRs in the absence of Tet than when the RyRs are blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the extrusion rate of Ca2+ into the t-tubules must be greater in the absence of Tet and consequently [Ca2+]t-sys (and the peak rate of Ca2+ entry into the t-tubules) must be greater when the RyRs are not blocked, unless SOCE becomes activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessing the Ca2+-handling properties of muscle cells with RyR variants in skeletal muscle has mostly been limited to mouse models or cell culture (6, 1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Steele and coworkers used mechanically skinned fibers prepared from biopsies cut for IVCT to show the lowered affinity of MHS human muscle RyR for Mg2+ compared with MHN muscle by assessing the sensitivity of the RyR to agonists and antagonists (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an overall picture of the way that RyR variants in human skeletal muscle affect basal Ca2+ handling at the junctional membranes remains to clearly emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we used muscle tissue excised by the needle biopsy that was at least 10-fold less than typically harvested during an open biopsy that is currently standard for IVCT and prepared mechanically skinned fibers with rhod-5N trapped in the t-system from subjects known to be MHN and MHS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sealed t-system with the Ca2+-sensitive dye trapped in it was transformed into a nanosensor that could detect not only changes in the properties of the RyRs, but also changes in activity levels of PMCA, NCX, and SOCE (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) and showed that the radius from the RyRs in which PMCA, NCX, and STIM1Orai1 complexes that support SOCE must be located, is between 14.122.4 nm in muscle fibers from both MHN and MHS individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in accord with other studies which implied a close arrangement of STIM1Orai1 complexes to RyRs (14, 18, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the effective radius over which the Ca2+ flux through the RyRs influences other Ca2+-dependent processes in the junctional space depends on the properties of the Ca2+ buffer present in the cytosolic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, using 50 mM total EGTA, the effective radius at 67 nM buffered Ca2+ was estimated at 62.5 nm, which is appropriate for using the sealed t-system as a nanodomain detector of basal Ca2+ handling at the junctional membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of 1 mM Tet as a tool for blocking the Ca2+ leak through the RyRs (i.e., RyRs) enabled us to assess the concentration of Ca2+ in the junctional space {[Ca2+]JS} at different Ca2+ concentrations in the cytosolic environment {[Ca2+]cyto}, estimate the dissociation constant of Ca2+ to PMCA and the maximum rate of Ca2+ extrusion by PMCA, and show that the higher [Ca2+]JS than [Ca2+]cyto in the MHN muscle is critical for enabling NCX to work in the forward mode in the human muscle at rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kd value of the PMCA in human muscle under our conditions was estimated at 93.6 nM, indicating that PMCA must be modulated by calmodulin present in freshly skinned muscle fibers (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conclusion from this study of a raised [Ca2+]JS due to basal RyR activity in human skeletal muscle is consistent with direct measurements of [Ca2+]JS in cardiomyocytes, where [Ca2+]JS was also persistently higher than the bulk [Ca2+]cyto due to RyR leak (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Making the RyRs leakier in fibers from healthy adults by reducing the [Mg2+]cyto from 1 mM to 0.13 mM (23, 28) changed the [Ca2+]cyto dependence of the [Ca2+]t-sys from a monotonically rising function over the range 281,342 nM into a bell-shaped curve over this [Ca2+]cyto range, due to increased SOCE activation as the probability of RyRs to open rises at low [Mg2+] as [Ca2+]cyto increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is evidence that the changed basal activity of RyR variants affect the Ca2+ handling at the t-system from mouse muscle fibers and myotube studies (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expected to detect differences in the steady levels of [Ca2+]t-sys in human MHS muscle while applying the same ionic conditions to the cytoplasm of skinned fibers of human MHS, as performed in control human muscle fibers (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the steady-state [Ca2+]t-sys and the peak rate of Ca2+ rise in the t-system in MHS fibers (in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ and functional RyRs) showed the bell-shaped dependence on [Ca2+]cyto similar to that obtained at low [Mg2+] in MHN muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bell-shaped curve could be changed to a sigmoidal curve by removing the influence of the SR on t-system Ca2+ handling by adding Tet which blocked the RyRs and prevented the Ca2+ depletion of the SR and activation of SOCE (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, bell-shaped relationship between [Ca2+]t-sys and [Ca2+]cyto in MHS muscle in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ can be explained by a chronically leaky RyR and as a consequence, a persistent SOCE in human MHS fibers at higher [Ca2+]cyto (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a diagnostic tool for detecting malignant hyperthermia susceptibility can be developed based on these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analyses of the MHN and MHS results in the absence and the presence of Tet show that MHS fibers have a higher Ca2+ extrusion capability than MHN fibers and that SOCE is more readily activated in MHS fibers than in MHN fibers, implying an increased Ca2+ leak through the RyRs in MHS fibers and a decreased SR Ca2+ loading at given [Ca2+]cyto, in line with the positive IVCTs observed in MHS individuals (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The higher Ca2+ extrusion capacity combined with increased SOCE activity in MHS than MHN fibers prevents excessive loss of Ca2+ from MHS fibers when RyR activity increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As RyRs become more unstable, or leaky, the [Ca2+]JS rises which increases the Ca2+ extrusion via NCX and PMCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the larger flux of Ca2+ to the junctional space from the SR terminal cisternae causes a local depletion inside the SR terminal cisternae which stimulate STIM1 and activates SOCE to recuperate the amount of Ca2+ lost from the fiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the reduction in steady-state [Ca2+]t-sys we observed in fibers with leaky RyRs indicates that SOCE flux is  greater than Ca2+ extrusion flux into the t-system under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, [Ca2+]t-sys is not expected to change much in intact MHS muscle fibers because the t-system is open to the outside where the Ca2+ concentration is buffered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a balance is reached, where the increased Ca2+ loss from the fiber due to Ca2+ extrusion via the PMCA and NCX is balanced by Ca2+ entry via the SOCE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the overall Ca2+ content of the fiber is maintained to similar levels as in fibers where the RyR activity is lower, but at an increased energetic cost associated with the increased PMCA activity and increased Na+ entry via the NCX, which needs to be bailed out by the Na+/K+ ATPase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The different Ca2+-handling ability of the t-system of MHN and MHS fibers may be the result of posttranslational modification of STIM1, NCX, and PMCA protein expression levels in response to the different [Ca2+]JS (35) set by the resident RyR Ca2+ leak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that the raised RyR Ca2+ leak of human MHS muscle is not pathological (9) because of adaptation of the local Ca2+-handling environment at the junctional membranes (Fig 3 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have demonstrated in this study that we can use the sealed t-system as a nanodomain detector of functional Ca2+-handling properties of human muscle fibers isolated from needle biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed us to detect basal RyR activity, SOCE, and t-system Ca2+ extrusion under defined ionic conditions in the cytoplasm to highlight differences in Ca2+ handling between human muscle fibers with and without a known MH causative RyR variant and establishes a way to detect differences in the property of RyRs in human muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach may also be useful for assessing the pathogenicity of other RyR variants of uncertain significance; the effects of exercise, aging, disease, or lifestyle factors; and effects of novel drugs on proteins at the junctional membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments were approved by The Human Ethics Committee (The University of Queensland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subjects signed informed consent forms before biopsy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bergstrom needle biopsies were collected under local anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated fibers were exposed to rhod-5N and mechanically skinned, to trap dye in the sealed t-system (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibers were bathed in cytoplasmic solutions, and t-system rhod-5N was imaged on a confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
