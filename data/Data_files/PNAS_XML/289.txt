Transcription factor KLF2 regulates homeostatic NK cell proliferation and survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adoptive transfer of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells into leukemia patients can lead to remission; however, therapies are hindered by inefficient expansion and limited persistence of these lymphocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now report that Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) regulates both NK cell proliferation and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KLF2 limits homeostatic expansion of NK cells in a cell-intrinsic manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, KLF2 instructs mature NK cells to home to IL-15rich niches, which is necessary for continued survival under homeostatic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, targeting KLF2 while providing rate-limiting survival factors such as transpresented IL-15 may improve NK cell engraftment and sustainability in cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that recognize and lyse virally infected or transformed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter property is being pursued in clinics to treat leukemia with the hope that further breakthroughs in NK cell biology can extend treatments to other cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At issue is the ability to expand transferred NK cells and prolong their functionality within the context of a tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of NK cell expansion and survival, we now report that Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a key transcription factor that underpins both of these events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excision of Klf2 using gene-targeted mouse models promotes spontaneous proliferation of immature NK cells in peripheral tissues, a phenotype that is replicated under ex vivo conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, KLF2 imprints a homeostatic migration pattern on mature NK cells that allows these cells to access IL-15rich microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KLF2 accomplishes this feat within the mature NK cell lineage via regulation of a subset of homing receptors that respond to homeostatic ligands while leaving constitutively expressed receptors that recognize inflammatory cytokines unperturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under steady-state conditions, KLF2-deficient NK cells alter their expression of homeostatic homing receptors and subsequently undergo apoptosis due to IL-15 starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel mechanism has implications regarding NK cell contraction following the termination of immune responses including the possibility that retention of an IL-15 transpresenting support system is key to extending NK cell activity in a tumor environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

KLF2_Is_Necessary_for_Conventional_NK_Cell_Homeostasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
KLF2 is necessary to maintain B and T-cell homeostasis (1115).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this transcription factor played a similar role in NK cells, we first verified that KLF2 was expressed under steady-state conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following lineage commitment and initial development in the bone marrow, NK cells home to peripheral tissues, where they continue a differentiation program that is characterized by the surface expression of CD27 and CD11b (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolating individual populations (CD27+CD11b, CD27+CD11b+, and CD27CD11b+), mRNA and protein analysis revealed that KLF2 is expressed early during NK cell development and increases with maturation (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we assessed NK cell homeostasis in Klf2 gene-targeted mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure KLF2 was depleted from the entire NK cell compartment (Fig 1B), Vav-cre transgenic animals were used to excise floxed alleles of Klf2 (Klf2fl/fl) in hematopoietic stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early NK cell development and MHC licensing was intact in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals, as reflected by normal frequencies of bone marrow-derived NK cells expressing activating (NK1.1, NKG2D, NKp46, Ly49H) and inhibitory (Ly49C/I, Ly49D, Ly49G2) receptors (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, loss of KLF2 resulted in increased CD27+CD11b NK cell frequencies in all tissues, with the exception of mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute CD27+CD11b NK cell numbers were also increased in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, the latter two tissues being sites that preferentially harbor immature NK cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells expressed high levels of transcription factor EOMES and were either CD127 (spleen) or CD49b+TRAIL (liver), indicating that they were NK cells and not misidentified NK1.1+ ILC1 cells (24) (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, ILC1 numbers remained constant in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, loss of KLF2 did not affect CD49a+CD49b tissue-resident NK cells in the liver (25) (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that KLF2 limits proliferation associated with CD27+CD11b NK cell differentiation but does not affect homeostasis of neighboring lineages, including ILC1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the increase in early stage NK cells, Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice had significantly fewer CD27+CD11b+ and CD27CD11b+ NK cells relative to littermate controls (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Costaining for CD43+ and CD11b+ (markers for late-stage NK cells) confirmed that KLF2 gene-targeted mice lacked mature CD43+CD11b+ populations in all examined tissues (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that IL-15 is essential for NK cell survival (2628), we hypothesized that KLF2-deficient NK cells were unable to respond to this cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, KLF2-deficient NK cells expressed normal surface levels of CD122 (IL-2R) and CD132 (c) (Fig 1E) that conveyed IL-15mediated signaling events when stimulated ex vivo (Fig 1F), which suggested that defective IL-15R signaling was not responsible for mature NK cell depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [Increased baseline expression of phospho-S6 in immature NK cells reflects elevated metabolism, as noted (17).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it was possible that mature NK cells were present in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice but that they were either misidentified (i.e., KLF2 regulates CD11b and CD43 expression) or located in alternate tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the former option, we used cytolytic activity as a surrogate marker to identify mature KLF2-deficient NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflective of their immature status, total NK cells harvested from Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice expressed low levels of granzyme B (Fig 2A) and had a reduced ability to lyse YAC-1 target cells ex vivo (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, KLF2-deficient NK cells responded to anti-NK1.1 stimulation by increasing surface expression of the degranulation marker CD107a (Fig 2C), which indicated that cell-intrinsic effector functions were not directly regulated by KLF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that mature NK cells are not present in the spleens of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend this finding to additional tissues, in vivo tumor clearance was analyzed in animal cohorts following coinjection of NK cell-sensitive (RMA-S) and NK cell-resistant (RMA) tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with littermate controls, Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals were unable to effectively clear RMA-S target cells (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that effector NK cells are absent in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice and that KLF2 is necessary to support mature NK cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

KLF2-Regulated_NK_Cell_Homeostasis_Is_Cell_Intrinsic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature NK cell survival depends on IL-15 that is typically transpresented as an IL-15/IL-15R complex on the surface of mesenchymal and myeloid cells (2831).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice excised Klf2 within the myeloid compartment, NK cell homeostasis may have been altered because of compromised IL-15 presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, NK cell populations were analyzed in LysM-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice that excised Klf2 in a myeloid-specific manner (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this genetic model, we found normal numbers of CD27+CD11b and CD11b+CD27+ cells, and a slight but statistical decrease in CD27CD11b+ NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that major NK cell phenotypes observed in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were independent of myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a prior study demonstrated that transferring mutant NK cells into wild-type animals could overcome myeloid-specific defects in NK cell development (32); however, KLF2-deficient NK cell survival was not rescued under these circumstances (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that KLF2 intrinsically regulates NK cell homeostasis, lethally irradiated wild-type CD45.2+ mice were reconstituted with a 1:1 ratio of wild type (CD45.1+) versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl (CD45.2+) bone marrow and analyzed 8 wk later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, CD27+CD11b+ and CD27CD11b+ NK cells were primarily derived from wild-type recipients, whereas the majority of CD27+CD11b NK cells were KLF2-deficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that KLF2 maintains late-stage NK cell homeostasis in a cell-intrinsic manner and may a play a role in suppressing early stage NK cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

KLF2_Suppresses_Homeostatic_Proliferation_of_NK_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
KLF2 was originally reported to prevent the spontaneous proliferation of quiescent T cells (33, 34); however, subsequent work demonstrated that this event was not a cell-intrinsic effect (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better characterize KLF2s role in early stage NK cell cycling, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was quantified as a measure of steady-state NK cell proliferation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control littermates, significantly more BrdU+ NK cells were present in the bone marrow of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals, the majority of which were CD27+CD11b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear staining for Ki-67, which identifies proliferating cells, confirmed that immature NK cells were undergoing increased cell cycling in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether KLF2-deficient NK cells had increased access to proliferation-inducing factors in vivo, NK cell cycling was examined under controlled ex vivo conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre system, NK cells harvested from T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl versus littermate control mice were cocultured (1:1 ratio) in media supplemented with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and IL-2, the latter cytokine added to support cell cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 d in culture, increased numbers of CD45.2+ cells from T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were recovered relative to CD45.1+ control cells (Fig 4C), primarily due to an expansion of CD27+CD11b NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated that more KLF2-deficient NK cells exhibited a blast morphology compared with KLF2-sufficent cells, consistent with KLF2 limiting early stage NK cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mature_NK_Cells_Require_KLF2_To_Access_Transpresented_IL-15  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation are typically exclusionary events, which raised the possibility that KLF2 was necessary for mature NK cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we performed ex vivo differentiation assays by using NK cells harvested from control versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To aid in our analysis, input populations were depleted of CD11b+ cells to offset the increased frequency of mature NK cells present in wild-type animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 72 h and 96 h in stromal culture supplemented with IL-15, IL-12, and IL-18, KLF2-deficient NK cells differentiated into CD27+CD11b+ (R2) and CD27CD11b+ (R3) cells that expressed the maturity markers, KLRG1 and granzyme B (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this result, we conclude that KLF2 is not necessary for late-stage NK cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that KLF2-deficient NK cells can fully differentiate ex vivo but not in vivo, we hypothesized that NK cells were unable to access a limited survival niche in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transpresented IL-15 is necessary for late-stage NK cell survival, which is rate limiting under steady-state conditions (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we performed immunohistochemistry to document NK cell localization relative to IL-15 in the spleens of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl versus littermate controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a metallophilic macrophage antibody (MOMA-1) to delineate the marginal sinus that forms a ring around the white pulp, we found that NK cells predominately localized in the red pulp of Klf2fl/fl control mice (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, significantly more KLF2-deficient NK cells were present in the T-cellrich area of the white pulp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These KLF2-deficient NKp46+ cells stained negatively for TCR, thus confirming that they were NK cells and not NKT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the spleen, IL-15 is typically presented by myeloid cells and VCAM-1+ stromal cells (36) located in the red pulp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a lack of mature NK cells in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice, KLF2-deficient NK cells were preferentially located in IL-15depleted areas of the white and red pulp (Fig 6B and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that differences in localization were directly attributable to KLF2-regulated NK cell migration and not maturation-associated homing patterns (5), we examined how similarly differentiated KLF2-replete and KLF2-deficient NK cells trafficked in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this instance, KLF2-deficient NK cells were harvested from tamoxifen-treated T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice before alterations in subset frequencies (Fig 6C, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following cotransfer into wild-type animals, we found that KLF2+ NK cells primarily homed to the red pulp and associated with F4/80+ myeloid cells (Fig 6C, ii), a cell type that transpresents IL-15 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a significant number of KLF2-deficient NK cells migrated to the white pulp, as defined by MOMA-1 staining (Fig 6C, iii), and were distal to myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that KLF2 directs NK cell trafficking under noninflammatory conditions, the implication being that this migration pattern supports late-stage NK cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

KLF2_Regulates_Mature_NK_Cell_Homing_Receptor_Expression_and_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature NK cells circulate throughout the vasculature and quickly respond to inflammatory chemokine gradients without prior activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, NK cells need to constitutively express a hybrid array of homing receptors that recognize ligands present under steady-state (e.g., CD62L, CX3CR1, S1P5) and inflammatory conditions (e.g., CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether any of these receptors were modified in response to Klf2 excision, mature NK cell populations harvested from tamoxifen-treated T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were examined by flow cytometry (Fig 7A) or by RT-PCR when antibodies were not available (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with mature NK cells from tamoxifen-treated littermate controls, KLF2-deficient cells expressed significantly less CD62L, Cx3cr1, and Edg8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, CCR7 was up-regulated following Klf2 excision, which suggested that a chemokine receptor typically associated with naïve T-cell trafficking was actively repressed by KLF2 in mature NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have noted that NK cells increase CCR7 expression and decrease CD62L surface levels following NK cell activation (37) or PI3K activity (16), respectively, and because KLF2 is degraded in a PI3K-associated manner following T-cell activation (19, 20), we were curious whether a similar process existed within the NK cell compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, stimulation of NK cells via activating receptors (NK1.1, NKG2D) promoted KLF2 proteolysis (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, NK cells cultured in the presence of a PI3K-inhibitor impaired KLF2 degradation (Fig S4B), the implication being that this signaling pathway regulates KLF2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess how closely Klf2 excision replicated homing receptor regulation following NK cell activation, wild-type NK cells were stimulated with the toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], then examined for differential receptor expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to KLF2-deficient cells, poly(I:C)-treated NK cells altered their surface levels of CCR7 and CD62L (Fig S4C) and (PMA/ionomycin)-activated CD27CD11b+ NK cells expressed less Edg8 mRNA (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, elevated CCR7 expression is consistent with observed NK cell entry into splenic white pulp following poly(I:C) challenge (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly(I:C)-activated NK cells also altered their surface expression of CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3homing receptors that respond to inflammatory cytokines (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Klf2 excision did not appreciably affect the expression of these inflammatory homing receptors (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these studies, we conclude that KLF2 regulates expression of homing receptors that respond to homeostatic ligands; however, this transcription factor does not impact inflammatory chemokine receptors within the NK cell compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With regard to how this alteration in homing receptors impacted the NK cell compartment, we found that mature NK cell numbers decreased over time when Klf2 was excised under noninflammatory conditions (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike poly(I:C) treatment that causes splenic NK cell displacement into the liver (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39; Fig S4F), Klf2 excision did not cause an accumulation of mature NK cells in any observed tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, analysis of NK cells harvested from tamoxifen-treated Klf2fl/fl versus T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl littermates revealed that this reduction was due to increased apoptosis of mature NK cells (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, KLF2-deficient NK cell apoptosis (d7 onwards) occurred after alterations in homing receptors (d5; Fig 7 AC) and aberrant migration (d5; Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we conclude that KLF2 controls NK cell migration via regulation of homeostatic homing receptors, the alteration of which does not support NK cell survival under steady-state conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells is a promising cancer therapy (40, 41); however, to maximize its potential in the clinic, it is important to devise new ways of increasing NK cell numbers and prolonging effector functions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from this study indicate that low levels of KLF2 limit antigen-independent NK cell proliferation in all tissues and removal of this factor expands the proliferative burst associated with CD27+CD11b NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the PI3K-PDK1-mTOR signaling pathway promotes NK cell cycling (9, 17, 18, 42, 43), because we and others have shown that signaling receptors that activate the PI3K pathway suppress KLF2 expression in T cells (19, 20) and B cells (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, Foxo1, which is negatively regulated by PI3K signaling and directly promotes Klf2 transcription in T cells (21, 22), does not appear to link PI3K-mediated activating events with KLF2 expression in NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disconnect between transcription factors is evidenced by an inverse expression pattern (in contrast to KLF2, Foxo1 expression decreases from stage 1stage 3) and increased frequencies of CD27CD11b+ NK cells in Foxo1 gene-targeted animals (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heretofore association between these two molecules raises the question as to what factors directly promote Klf2 transcription in NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addressing this issue may provide a therapeutic means of increasing NK cell numbers by suppressing KLF2 expression in a lineage-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to controlling NK cell cycling, KLF2 is necessary for late-stage NK cell survival under steady-state conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, KLF2 regulates homeostatic homing receptors so that these cells gain access to transpresented IL-15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, activated NK cells degrade KLF2 and alter their homing receptor expression patterns accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both quiescent and activated NK cells rely on IL-15 for survival (4446), which implies that activated NK cells have access to IL-15 that is not available to KLF2-deficient NK cells under noninflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that during an innate immune response that activates NK cells, myeloid cells that are capable of IL-15 transpresentation are likewise activated and recruited to inflammatory sites, thereby maintaining NK cell effector functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of this IL-15dependent support system, NK cell effector activity is quickly terminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an event might occur at the conclusion of a productive NK cell immune response when myeloid cells contract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, inappropriate NK cell activation (e.g., an immune response directed against self via NKG2D) is predicted to starve these cells of IL-15 and maintain tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model may explain why mice and humans are devoid of NK cell-initiated autoimmunity, despite the fact that NK cells recognize self-ligands (e.g., stress molecules exhibited by tumor cells) (47) and do not require additional cells to become activated (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, linking activated NK cell survival to colocalized IL-15 transpresentation may constitute a fundamental mechanism to ensure self-tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, cancers may co-opt this tolerance mechanism to evade NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this model of IL-15 dependence proves to be the case, then recruiting IL-15 transpresenting cells to environments that elicit NK cell activation may prevent NK cell exhaustion and restore antitumor immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

NK cell degranulation and granzyme B expression were measured by flow cytometry following 2 h of priming cells with plate-bound anti-NK1.1 (10 g/mL) or PMA/ionomycin (50 ng/mL + 500 ng/mL) and 4-h incubation of Golgi Plug/Stop (BD Biosciences)-treated cells to accumulate signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK cell cytotoxicity assays were performed by using IL-2primed splenocytes (20 ng/mL, 24 h) that were cocultured with 2 × 104 YAC-1 target cells for 4 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytotoxicity was assessed by using a CytoTox Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation following ex vivo Klf2 excision was examined by coculturing MACS-sorted NK cells (Miltenyi Biotec) harvested from Klf2fl/fl versus T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl littermates (1:1 ratio, 5 × 105/mL) in Complete media supplemented with IL-2 (20 ng/mL) and 4-OHT (400 nM) for 5 d. Klf2 excision was  greater than 95% as determined by RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine ex vivo NK cell differentiation, CD11b-depleted bone marrow from Klf2fl/fl versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice was cocultured on stromal support (CD45.1+ bone marrow) in media supplemented with IL-15 (20 ng/mL), IL-12 (20 ng/mL), and IL-18 (50 ng/mL) for 34 d, then analyzed by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Functional_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NK cell cytotoxicity was measured by coinjecting 4 × 105 RMA and 6 × 105 RMA-S cells [labeled with carboxytetramethylrhodamine (CTMR) and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes), respectively] into mice i.p., performing a peritoneal lavage 48 h later, then analyzing the ratio of target (RMA-S) to control (RMA) cells by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK cell proliferation was assessed following i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of BrdU (1 mg/mL, every 12 h for 4.5 d) according to manufacturers instructions (BrdU Flow Kit; BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Ki-67 staining (eBioscience) was used to detect cell cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before cryosectioning, spleens were embedded and snap frozen in OCT (Sakura) and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-micrometer serial cryosections were fixed in 100% acetone for 10 min, air dried for 10 min, rehydrated in TBS, and blocked in 10% (vol/vol) donkey sera with 50% (vol/vol) avidin solution for 30 min, followed by 10% (vol/vol) donkey sera with 50% (vol/vol) biotin solution for 30 min using the Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) to block endogenous avidin and biotin before staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NKp46/TCR and NKp46/MOMA-1 costaining, sections were incubated with titrated amounts of polyclonal goat anti-NKp46 and biotinylated anti-TCR or biotinylated anti-MOMA1 (Cedarlane) overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOMA-1 and TCR- biotinylated antibodies were visualized by using the VECTASTAIN ABC-AP (STANDARD) and VECTOR Red Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) substrate kit (Vector Labs) supplemented with levamisole (Vector Labs) to block endogenous phosphatase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then incubated with 1.8% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% sodium azide to quench endogenous peroxidases for 1 h, and reblocked by using the Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit to block biotinylated sites of the first antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-NKp46 antibody was visualized by incubating with secondary biotinylated F(ab')2 Frag donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L), then VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Standard), followed by development using the DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were counterstained by using Meyers hematoxylin solution (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were dried overnight and cleared with xylene for 30 min before permanent mounting with Permount (Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For dual staining for IL-15 and NKp46, sections were first stained for NKp46 by using alkaline phosphatase/Vector Red, then serially incubated with biotinylated anti-IL-15 and HRP/DAB as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity was determined by using similar titrations of biotinylated isotype controls for monoclonal antibodies, secondary antibody staining alone for polyclonal antibodies on sections stained in tandem, or IL-15 gene-deficient (KO) sections when appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Homing_Receptor_Regulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wild-type mice were challenged i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with poly(I:C)-LMW (200 g; InvivoGen) and killed 16 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Klf2fl/fl and T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were placed on tamoxifen-infused chow (250 mg/kg; Harlan Teklad) for 5 d. In both cases, surface expression of homing receptors was assessed by flow cytometry in a subset-specific manner or transcription levels of homing receptors present in CD27CD11b+ FACS-sorted NK cells was determined by RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamic_Migration_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MACS-sorted NK cells were harvested from Klf2fl/fl and T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl littermates placed on tamoxifen-infused chow for 5 d. Before cell sorting, Klf2fl/fl and T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl splenocytes were labeled with cell tracker CMRA [10 M] and CMFDA [10 M] (Molecular Probes), respectively, for 40 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal numbers of labeled NK cells (6 × 106) were injected (i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into a wild-type recipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recipient spleen was harvested 24 h after transfer and fixed in PBS containing 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 30% (wt/vol) sucrose before cryoembedding to preserve cell tracker dyes before immunohistochemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight-micrometer cryosections were then avidin/biotin/normal serum-blocked as described above before being incubated with biotinylated antiMOMA-1 and anti-F4/80 antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylated antibodies were visualized with streptavidin BV421 (BD Biosciences), and slides were mounted in fluorescence mounting media (DAKO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent images were overlayed by using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NK_Cell_Stimulation_and_Western_Blots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NK cells were stimulated with plate-bound NKG2D (25 g/mL) or NK1.1 (25 g/mL) antibody for select time points at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plates were supplemented with plate-bound fibronectin (10 g/mL) and low-dose IL-15 (0.5 ng/mL) to improve cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, NK cells were labeled with biotinylated anti-NK1.1 (10 g/mL) or anti-NKG2D (10 g/mL) at 4 °C before cross-linking with streptavidin PE (10 g/mL) at 37 °C for 13 h. To inhibit proteasome, PI3K, or MEK1 activity, NK cells were cultured with MG132 (10 M), LY294002 (10 M), or PD98059 (10 M), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following stimulation, NK cells were washed with PBS and lysed in PBS-RIPA buffer (1.37 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 18 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA) with protease inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C before pelleting debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS/PAGE and probed by using anti-mouse KLF2 (Millipore) and anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densitometry was measured by using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_PCR_Primer_Sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time reactions were performed by the iQ Sybr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and iCycler eQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were expressed as 2^[(CT KLF2-deficient experimental gene  CT KLF2-deficient Gapdh)  (CT control experimental gene  CT control Gapdh)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
