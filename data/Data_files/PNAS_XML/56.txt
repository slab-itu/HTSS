No evidence that polygynous marriage is a harmful cultural practice in northern Tanzania  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polygynous marriage is commonly regarded as a harmful cultural practice, detrimental to women and children at the individual and group level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present counterevidence that polygyny is often positively associated with food security and child health within communities and that, although polygyny and health are negatively associated at the group level, such differences are accounted for by alternative socioecological factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support models of polygyny based on female choice and suggest that, in some contexts, prohibiting polygyny could be costly for women and children by restricting marital options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlights the dangers of naive analyses of aggregated population data and the importance of considering locally realizable alternatives and context dependency when considering the health implications of cultural practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polygyny is cross-culturally common and a topic of considerable academic and policy interest, often deemed a harmful cultural practice serving the interests of men contrary to those of women and children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this view, large-scale studies of national African demographic surveys consistently demonstrate that poor child health outcomes are concentrated in polygynous households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative population-level associations between polygyny and well-being have also been reported, consistent with the hypothesis that modern transitions to socially imposed monogamy are driven by cultural group selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We challenge the consensus view that polygyny is harmful, drawing on multilevel data from 56 ethnically diverse Tanzanian villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first demonstrate the vulnerability of aggregated data to confounding between ecological and individual determinants of health; while across villages polygyny is associated with poor child health and low food security, such relationships are absent or reversed within villages, particularly when children and fathers are coresident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then provide data indicating that the costs of sharing a husband are offset by greater wealth (land and livestock) of polygynous households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with models of polygyny based on female choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that village-level negative associations between polygyny prevalence, food security, and child health are fully accounted for by underlying differences in ecological vulnerability (rainfall) and socioeconomic marginalization (access to education).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We highlight the need for improved, culturally sensitive measurement tools and appropriate scales of analysis in studies of polygyny and other purportedly harmful practices and discuss the relevance of our results to theoretical accounts of marriage and contemporary population policy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Contrasting_Monogamous_and_Polygynous_Households  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first estimate relationships between polygyny, food security and the heights and weights of children under 5 y using linear regression aggregating data across all villages (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is analytically equivalent to existing studies of large-scale demographic surveys, which routinely ignore both ethnic variation and village-level spatial clustering of health (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with such studies, polygynous households have lower food security than monogamous households ( = 1.56, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) = 2.31;-0.81, P less_than 0.001) and, using WHO standardized z-scores, lower child height-for-age (HAZ,  = 0.21, 95%CI = 0.34;0.08, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Child weight-for-height (WHZ) did not significantly differ between polygynous and monogamous households ( = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.16; 0.05, P  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, there is a clear tendency for relatively polygynous villages and ethnic groups (particularly the Maasai) to have poor food security and child health (Fig 1) (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34 for a comphensive analysis of ethnic differences in food security and child health).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for this variance by including a random effect for village demonstrates that neither food security nor child health are significantly associated with polygyny when contrasted within villages (food security:  = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.47; 0.98, P  0.1; HAZ:  = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.20; 0.06, P  0.1; WHZ:  = 0.00, 95% CI = 0.12; 0.11, P  0.1; Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, multilevel analysis reveals a Simpsons paradox (27), i.e., village-level differences obscure underlying relationships between polygyny, food security, and child health within villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polygynous men generally resided with their first wife (SI Text), and in only 10% of male-headed polygynous households did multiple wives coreside (most commonly among the Sukuma, where 17% of polygynously married male household heads lived with multiple wives).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second or later cowives and their children typically lived in separate, but often adjacent, dwellings to their husbands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinguishing between these household types reveals that male-headed polygynous households have significantly higher food security than monogamous households within villages ( = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.01; 1.70, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stratified analysis confirms that a trend toward higher food security for male-headed polygynous households is present in all three ethnic groups with a substantial prevalence of polygyny (Fig 2), although this is only statistically significant in the Sukuma ( = 2.00, 95% CI = 0.68; 3.32, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in both the Sukuma and Rangi, children in male-headed polygynous households also had higher WHZ (Sukuma:  = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.03; 0.39, P less_than 0.05, Rangi:  = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.01; 0.67, P = 0.06).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, female-headed polygynous households had lower food security than monogamous households within the same village ( = 1.16, 95% CI = 2.34; 0.01, P = 0.05), although this pattern did not approach statistical significance in stratified analyses (Fig 2 and Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Polygyny_and_Wealth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wealth was measured by an asset-based household wealth index (SI Text), a generic measure favored by large-scale surveys and used across rural and urban contexts (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measure indicates minimal differences in wealth between monogamous and polygynous households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, livelihood-specific measures of wealth reveal that polygynous households, particularly when male-headed, both cultivate more land ( = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.14; 0.31, P less_than 0.001) and own more livestock ( = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.36; 0.62, P less_than 0.001) than monogamous households (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are apparent in all major ethnic groups in stratified analyses and are robust to statistical adjustment for the number of adults and young dependents in the household (Tables S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, consistent with the polygyny threshold model, higher wealth presents a strong candidate mechanism for superior food security and child nutrition in male-headed polygynous households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contrasting_Monogamous_and_Polygynous_Villages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next consider how village characteristics predict individual measures of food security and child health using multilevel regression including village-level random and fixed effects (SI Text and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independently of individual marital status, each 10% increase in the proportion of polygynous households sampled per village is associated with an estimated 1.52 unit decrease in food security ( = 1.52, 95% CI = 2.09; 0.95, P less_than 0.001), a 0.15 reduction in child HAZ ( = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.25; 0.05, P less_than 0.001), and a 0.07 reduction in child WHZ ( = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.15; 0.01, P less_than 0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once we adjust analyses for village-level proxies for ecological vulnerability (annual rainfall) and socioeconomic marginalization (distance to district capital and the proportion of household heads with nonzero education), these associations dramatically attenuate and become statistically nonsignificant in the case of food security and child HAZ, whereas the proportion of polygynous households in a village becomes positively associated with child WHZ ( = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01; 0.18, P = 0.09; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our analyses do not support the idea that polygyny has negative group-level consequences on well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We challenge the widespread notion that polygyny is harmful to children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with prior studies (48), polygyny is predictive of relatively low food security and poor child health in aggregated data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such associations are driven entirely by the tendency of polygyny to be more common in marginalized and ecologically vulnerable villages and ethnic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within villages, polygynous households, at least those headed by males, often had higher food security and better child outcomes than monogamous households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polygynous households were also wealthier in terms of livelihood-specific forms of wealth (land and livestock), although not in asset ownership, which is the foundation of wealth indices favored by national demographic surveys (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with classic evolutionary and economic models suggesting that sharing a husband can be in a womans strategic interest, at least in contexts where women depend on men for resources, by enabling access to equal or greater wealth than could be achieved by opting for monogamy (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also highlight the inherent weaknesses of highly aggregated samples such as the DHS, the primary data source for population scientists studying family structure and health in sub-Saharan Africa (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That polygyny is associated with better outcomes for specifically male-headed households indicates that cowives resident with their husband are most likely to benefit from polygyny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female-headed polygynous households in contrast may often lose cowife conflicts over shared resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that female-headed polygynous households had lower food security than monogamous households when considering the sample as a whole, although child health did not differ (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, first wives are most often coresident with their husband.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advantages to first wives have been reported elsewhere (13, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rural Ethiopia, Gibson and Mace (13) found first wives were in better physical health and had more surviving offspring than monogamously married women and that relatively poor child health was only associated with polygyny for second or later cowives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result may reflect selection effects, i.e., women of good health/social standing are less likely to enter polygynous marriages as later wives, such that differences in child outcomes, or indeed food security, cannot be seen as consequences of polygyny itself (13, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, first wives may benefit from exclusivity before sharing their husband and subsequent seniority over later wives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to the extent that deficits in child health or food security are unequally portioned among wives, we note that polygyny may, in some instances, be considered harmful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate ethnic variation in the relationship between polygyny and health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from prior small-scale studies suggest such variation, but comparing results across studies is hampered by methodological differences (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we detect an advantage of being raised in male-headed polygynous households for the Sukuma (the largest ethnic group in Tanzania) and the Rangi, but not for the Maasai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our stratified analyses here have relatively low statistical power, at least two factors may account for these differences: low status of Maasai women and the relative poverty of this ethnic group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies emphasize low female status in the Maasai (37), restricting womens control over their marital arrangements (including divorce and the addition of cowives) and/or preventing women from effectively allocating household resources to children (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Maasai also suffered the greatest burden of food insecurity and poor health in our study (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Borgerhoff Mulder (39, 40) found that polygyny was negatively associated with child survival only in the poorest households in Kenyan Kipsigis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strassmann (22) observed negative associations between polygyny and child health in the Dogon of Mali in all but one exceptionally large and wealthy village (p. 10,897).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it might be that polygyny fails to provide better circumstances in conditions of relative resource scarcity where children are most vulnerable to biased intrahousehold resource allocation, accounting for the differences between the Maasai and neighboring ethnic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analyses do not support the assertion that polygyny has group-wide costs on child health (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it seems parsimonious that highly polygynous, predominantly Maasai, villages do poorly not because of polygyny, but because of vulnerability to drought, low service provision, and broader sociopolitical disadvantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly monogamous, predominantly Meru, villages on the other hand occupy the relatively high rainfall, fertile slopes of Mount Meru close to Arusha city, benefiting from improved health care and education infrastructure (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that polygyny has negative group-level consequences on unmeasured aspects of well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we are skeptical of the theoretical foundation of such arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reformulations of sexual selection theory emphasize facultative responses to partner availability, predicting that the more common sex will cater to the preferences of the rarer sex to acquire and retain mates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such when polygyny leads unmarried women to be in relatively short supply we might expect higher not lower levels of paternal investment (30, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this perspective, our adjusted analyses found that child WHZ was marginally higher in the most polygynous villages (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If polygyny does not bestow group-level costs on women and children, as suggested by Henrich et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), how can we account for observed transitions to socially imposed monogamy with economic development?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tanzania, the spread of both Islam and Christianity have clearly influenced marital norms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missionary influence may be partially responsible for the ubiquity of monogamy among the Meru (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, explanations based solely on religion are unsatisfactory because religious prescriptions and marriage patterns most likely coevolve, constrained to some extent by systems of production (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunato and Archetti (44) propose that monogamy evolves via the maximization of individual, not group benefits, and is best understood as an inheritance strategy favored when intergenerational resource transfers are critical to descendant success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monogamy may thus be beneficial to both men and women when returns to parental investment favor offspring quality over quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this account, the Meru were early adopters of relatively intensified agriculture (42), where productivity is limited by land inheritance, as opposed to low intensity agriculture and pastoralism, which may be relatively labor limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Meru also have the highest educational attainment (34), which is associated with transitions to low fertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once individuals opt for smaller family sizes, a pattern best understood as motivated by economic rather than reproductive success (45), the reproductive advantages of polygyny are likely outweighed by novel opportunities to invest more per child, e.g., via formal education.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we make important methodological advancements, our study shares several limitations with prior studies of polygyny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our use of the standard demographic household definition (SI Text) often cleaves polygynous families into distinct survey units, preventing direct contrasts of children of first and later wives sharing the same husband.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-sectional data also limit our ability to infer causality, preventing explicit consideration of the impact of additional wives on previously monogamous women and their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent retrospective study in Bolivia reports that, although women in polygynous marriages had lower fertility than women in monogamous marriages overall, the addition of a second wife did not impact on the fertility of the first wife in intraindividual analyses (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-selection may thus be responsible for reported effects of polygyny in some cross-sectional studies (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also caution that the relatively small number of female-headed polygynous households (at least for the Sukuma and Rangi; Table S1) in our study may have resulted from disagreement between the village register sampling frame and household definition used by enumerators on the ground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If unsampled and sampled households systematically differ this may bias our estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common use of rigid household definitions is coming under increasing criticism for obscuring the measurement of complex demographic phenomena, and we support recent calls (46) for experimentation with alternative survey methodologies that more accurately cater to the reality of African family structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study concerns food security and child health and cannot tell us about the wider potential of polygyny to cause harm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other aspects of physical and mental well-being may be influenced by polygyny (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies counter simple intuition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polygyny is associated with lower HIV prevalence at both national and regional levels across Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reniers and colleagues (48) suggest polygyny increases individual exposure, but selective recruitment of HIV-positive women into polygynous marriages where coital frequency is lower isolates transmission risks from the wider population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study in Tanzania also found no evidence for an association between polygyny and maternal anxiety and depression (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whatever the outcome, we do not anticipate universal relationships between polygyny and well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated variation in the estimated consequences of polygyny both between women (by coresidence with husband) and between ethnic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the vital insight of both economic and anthropological theory is that cultural diversity in marriage practices stems in large part from context-dependency in the pay-offs to alternative behavioral strategies (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anthropologists have long emphasized, polygyny itself is also a diverse institution with considerable cultural variation in associated norms of spousal recruitment and residence (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We particularly advocate that policy makers distinguish low female autonomy from polygyny rather than treat the latter as a definitive indicator of the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where women have control over marital placements, we do not anticipate costs to polygyny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, if there are large differences in male wealth, prohibiting polygyny may be disadvantageous to women by restricting marital options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levirate marriage or widow inheritance, whereby a women marries the close male relative of her deceased spouse as a polygynous bride, is also likely to offer women and their children substantially better prospects than living as a single widow in many contexts (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if female autonomy is low, and/or when polygyny is not associated with differences in male wealth, marital placements may logically be prone to negative impacts of male coercion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also recommend future research prioritizes data analysis at the level of social groups (i.e., villages, neighborhoods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Institutions for marriage and child-raising are rapidly changing across the globe, and their gendered impacts are increasingly taking center stage in discussions of international development (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Policy analysts concerned with these transformations need to consider appropriate comparison groups, selection effects, and broader community confounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only by making meaningful contrasts, which capture alternatives readily available to individuals, and by taking into account the distribution of specific traditions across different communities and ecologies, can we expect to achieve a true understanding of the health implications of cultural practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data (Dataset S1) were collected between 2009 and 2011 as part of the Whole Village Project (WVP), coordinated by Savannas Forever Tanzania, the University of Minnesota (UM), and the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WVP received ethical approval from the UM Institutional Review Board (code 0905S65241) and NIMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 6075 households were randomly selected from 56 villages (Fig S1), leading to a sample of 3,584 households, 2,268 of which contained children under 5 y of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly half (45%) provided anthropometric data on more than one child (two children, 35%; three or more children, 10%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four ethnicities, the Maasai, Sukuma, Rangi, and Meru, make up 65% of households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maasai are traditionally seminomadic pastoralists but have recently diversified into cultivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sukuma, Rangi, and Meru are all characterized as agro-pastoralists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rangi and Meru primarily identify as Muslims and Protestants, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sukuma and Maasai identify with either Christian or indigenous religions (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis is limited to households with a married head of at least 16 y, bringing our working sample to 1,764 households, containing 2,833 children (averaging 32 households and 51 children per village).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale assesses food insecurity during the last month on a 27-point scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reversed this measure so that a higher score indicates greater food security (mean: 16.9; SD: 7.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropometrics were WHO standardized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAZ assesses chronic malnourishment (mean: 1.6; SD: 1.6) and WHZ assesses acute malnourishment (mean: 0.2; SD:1.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Z-scores less than 2.0 indicate stunting and wasting, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatedness data are available for villages 1556 only: 80% of children were biological children of the head, 14% were grandchildren, 6% were other relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wealth index was calculated by principal component analysis applied to the ownership of 37 assets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acres cultivated and livestock units were recorded separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wealth measures were transformed (log x + 1) to approximate normal distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Village mapping was used to compute distance to district capital and estimated annual rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Text provides further information on child, household, and village data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regressions were fit using maximum likelihood estimation and include controls for child age and sex, age of household head, and hunger season (for details, see SI Text and Tables S3S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Harmful_Cultural_Practices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The terms harmful cultural practice and harmful traditional practice are used interchangeably by the international development and human rights community to refer to nonwestern cultural practices deemed detrimental to individual well-being, most often with regard to women and children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept was initially developed by the United Nations (UN) to name and combat ostensibly blatant forms of male domination of women, culminating in a 1995 UN Fact sheet devoted to the issue (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We avoid the more commonly used term harmful traditional practice in our text following concern that traditional falsely implies that modern/western practices are exempt from potential to cause harm and that cultural subordination of women is limited to traditional populations (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no single universally agreed list of harmful cultural practices, but the concept is most frequently used in reference to female genital cutting, gendered violence, child, early, and forced marriage, and polygynous marriage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attention on harmful cultural practices has grown in recent years, in line with an increased focus on gender in all spheres of international development (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further discussion of current and historical negative characterizations of polygynous marriage from both human rights and theological perspectives, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, 54, and 55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methodological_Limitations_of_Prior_Research_on_Polygyny_and_Child_Health  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study overcomes important limitations of prior research, combining methodological strengths of prior small-scale anthropological and large-scale demographic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main limitations of small-scale anthropological studies, particularly from the perspective of public health, is that sample sizes are generally extremely small (often n less_than 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we cant directly contrast results across small-scale studies to compare specific cultural and ecological contexts because of idiosyncratic variation in statistical methodology and study design (e.g., differences in sampling, definition, and use of independent and dependent variables, inclusion of controls for potential confounders).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a large sample more characteristic of large-scale demographic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our initial sample (n = 3,584 households) surpasses the Tanzania DHS for the same regions (31, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using parallel sampling and analysis methods across multiple ethnic groups, our study also enables effective estimation of context dependency in relationships between polygyny, food security, and child health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we caution that, although our study site encompasses a large area of northern Tanzania, our results cannot be taken as nationally representative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, our findings should only be treated as representative of our specific study villages (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably we sampled a high proportion of Maasai households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study site contains 22% Maasai households compared with the 1996 Tanzanian DHS, which included only 2% Maasai households (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Maasai are exceptional for primarily relying on pastoralism as opposed to agriculture, high levels of polygyny relative to other Tanzanian ethnic groups, and for experiencing high levels of socioeconomic marginalization (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to small-scale anthropological studies, the primary concern with large-scale demographic studies is their inherent vulnerability to confounding between ecological and individual determinants of health (i.e., vulnerability to the ecological fallacy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of DHS data have attempted to deal with this problem in various ways we believe are largely unsatisfactory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, several studies have included random effects to adjust for hierarchical clustering at the national level only (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, other studies have incorporated random effects at the subnational regional level (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  National or subnational clusters are likely to only crudely map spatial covariance in marriage and health outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subnational regions are an improvement but still aggregate data across much structured diversity in both health and cultural practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in our case, Maasai and Meru villages are often directly adjacent but offer the most extreme comparisons in terms of both polygyny prevalence and health outcomes (Fig S1) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Wagner and Rieger (5) incorporate random effects at the level of primary sampling units (PSUs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PSUs offer higher resolution, their value is questionable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We question the value of including random effects for PSU for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first reason is that very few households are surveyed per PSU by most DHS [e.g., only 1622 households in Tanzania (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31, p. 10)], and among those sampled, sample size per PSU cluster is further reduced by data restrictions (most obviously in this case many households will not contain children less_than 5 y old).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small cluster size can lead to estimation problems, particularly when analysis rests on the estimation of many parameters that may vary to differing degrees within each cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second reason is that PSUs are usually based on census enumeration areas, which do not necessarily correspond with specific villages or cohesive communities (including, for example, adjacent urban zones within towns and cities), which means they are not ideal for contextual analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason previous studies have avoided the incorporation of PSUs as a random effect (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6, p. 347).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study has the advantage of using clearly defined village units as random effects with relatively high-density sampling per cluster (averaging 32 households and 51 children per village included in our final analyses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, Wagner and Rieger (5), who adjust for PSUs as a random effect in a mixed urban and rural sample of 26 African DHS surveys, estimate that, whereas in the majority of countries there was a negative relationship between polygyny and child anthropometrics, a positive and nonsignificant relationship was estimated for Tanzania (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5, p. 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have noted, our study site is not representative of Tanzania as a whole and therefore direct comparisons of effect estimates should be avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this finding could be seen as consistent with our conclusion that, once low-level spatial clusters are adjusted for, polygyny is no longer predictive of child health for Tanzanian families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, Wagner and Reiger (5) do not report country-specific estimates both with and without adjustment for PSUs, so we cannot infer from this study whether or not adjusting for PSU specifically modifies their effect estimates compared with more aggregated analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are skeptical of the use of PSUs as random effects for the reasons outlined above, but advocate future researchers explore alternative methods for dealing with spatial clustering with DHS data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately the adequacy of using PSUs as clusters will depend on the specific number of cases per cluster, the nature of the sample (e.g., rural vs. urban), and the specific analysis methodology implemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final major advantage of our study is the utilization of additional household-level data generally not incorporated into large-scale demographic studies of polygyny and child health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of the DHS have used a standardized household wealth index to measure wealth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an equivalent measure based on the distribution of asset-based wealth in our population, but also livelihood specific forms of wealth in the form of the acres of land cultivated and amount of livestock owned (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our results demonstrate, these measures reveal wealth differences between households obscured when relying on generic wealth indices alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also incorporate data on ethnicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of Gyimah (8), no DHS study of polygyny and child health has adjusted or stratified estimates by ethnicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ethnicity covaries strongly with both culturally shared marital norms and broader social and ecological determinants of child health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such there is considerable margin for error in the interpretation of large-scale DHS analyses neglecting ethnicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue is particularly salient to Tanzania, where ethnicity data have not been made available for DHS data for almost two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five DHSs have thus far been conducted in Tanzania (1991/2, 1996, 1999, 2004/5, and 2010), and to our knowledge, only the 1991/2 and 1996 DHS provide ethnicity data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling_and_Ethnicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, 56 villages were sampled by the WVP, between mid-2009 and mid-2011, across the northern and central Tanzanian regions of Arusha (19 villages), Manyara (11 villages), Dodoma (7 villages), Singida (5 villages), Shinyanga (8 villages), Mwanza (3 villages), and Mara (3 villages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sampling of villages was based in part on the priorities of development agency partners and the permission of government leaders, although effort was made to randomize village sampling where possible and to ensure a wide geographic spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1 shows the location of each village, color coded by the majority ethnic group (recorded at the household level), in relation to major settlements, main roads, national parks, and game reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lawson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34) provide information on the exact number of households and children sampled by village, district, and region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maasai, Sukuma, Meru, and Rangi were the most common ethnic groups sampled, collectively accounting for 60.4% of households sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other ethnic groups were also sampled at relatively low frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These groups include the Arusha (6.4%), the Wanda (4.7%), the Iraqw (4.3%), the Turu (3.0%), the Mbugwe (2.9%), the Gogo (2.0%), and a large number of ethnic groups each accounting for less_than2% of the sampled households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within each village, between 60 and 75 households were randomly selected for participation from a list provided by village administrators, leading to a total of 3,584 surveyed households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Household head marital status is used to contrast monogamous and polygynous family settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heads were identified as the person responsible for household upkeep and households defined as a group of persons who live together in the same house or compound, share the same house-keeping arrangments, and eat together as one unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed oral consent was obtained from participants, and all individual data were anonymized before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropometric measurements were taken for all resident children under 5 y of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 3,584 sampled households, 2,268 (63%) contributed child anthropometric data, and just under half of those households provided data on more than one child (two children: 35%; three or more children: 10%), leading to a total of 3,586 surveyed children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample for our current analysis is limited to households with a verified currently married head of at least 16 y, bringing our working sample to 1,764 households, containing 2,833 children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
