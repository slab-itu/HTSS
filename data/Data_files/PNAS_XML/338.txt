Minimal basilar membrane motion in low-frequency hearing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To perceive speech, the brain relies on inputs from sensory cells located near the top of the spiral-shaped cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low-frequency region of the inner ear is anatomically difficult to access, and it has not previously been possible to study its mechanical response to sound in intact preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image sound-evoked vibration inside the intact cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that low-frequency sound moves a small portion of the basilar membrane, and that the motion declines in an exponential manner across the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the response of the hearing organ to speech-frequency sounds is different from the one evident in high-frequency cochlear regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Low-frequency hearing is critically important for speech and music perception, but no mechanical measurements have previously been available from inner ears with intact low-frequency parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions of the cochlea may function in ways different from the extensively studied high-frequency regions, where the sensory outer hair cells produce force that greatly increases the sound-evoked vibrations of the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used laser interferometry in vitro and optical coherence tomography in vivo to study the low-frequency part of the guinea pig cochlea, and found that sound stimulation caused motion of a minimal portion of the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside the region of peak movement, an exponential decline in motion amplitude occurred across the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The moving region had different dependence on stimulus frequency than the vibrations measured near the mechanosensitive stereocilia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior differs substantially from the behavior found in the extensively studied high-frequency regions of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial experiments were performed on isolated preparations of the guinea pig temporal bone (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sound stimulation occurred through the intact middle ear ossicles, and the resulting cellular movements of the organ of Corti (Fig 1A) were measured with a laser interferometer integrated with a laser scanning confocal microscope (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies on this in vitro preparation showed that the opening in the bone, which is necessary to gain optical access to the sensory cells, leads to frequency tuning curves that are sharper than those frequency tuning curves likely to be observed in vivo (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect occurs because the opening creates a pressure release pathway, which reduces the effective stimulus level at frequencies below 300 Hz (the opening is expected to influence current-evoked motion relatively less than stapes-evoked motion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove concerns about the influence of the opening as well as other potential artifacts (16), we used optical coherence tomography to measure sound-evoked motion in vivo, without opening the cochlear bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the in vitro experiments, mechanical responses were measured at two different sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main one was on the basilar membrane (Fig 1A, Lower Left), and for comparison and as a control, data were collected from the Hensen cells (Fig 1A, Lower Right) located close to the mechanosensitive stereocilia of the outer hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial relations were ascertained from 3D reconstructions of confocal image stacks (Fig 1B), and the absolute measurement position was confirmed by imaging the interferometers laser spot (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Lateral_Segment_of_the_Basilar_Membrane_Shows_Minimal_Sound-Evoked_Motion__Different_Frequency_Tuning__and_Smaller_Dynamic_Range_than_the_Hensen_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first investigated sound-evoked responses in vitro and found that basilar membrane vibrations were small, even at the stimulus frequency that evoked a maximal response [0.6 ± 0.1 nm, mean ± SEM; 59 dB of sound pressure level (SPL); n = 30].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, at the same SPL, the Hensen cell magnitude at the best frequency was 27 ± 2 nm, a 33-dB difference (Fig 1D; P = 1.8 × 109 by the sign test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of anatomical constraints, all basilar membrane vibration measurements originated from a region between 10 and 40 m from its attachment to the lateral wall of the cochlea [the distance between the attachment point and the organ of Corti is 7075 m (28); see Fig 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the frequency tuning of this lateral segment of the basilar membrane differs from the Hensen cells, we used a 10-tone stimulus with components between 105 and 605 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulus frequency evoking a maximal response at the basilar membrane varied from 140 to 496 Hz, with an average of 253 ± 12 Hz (Fig 1E), whereas the average best frequency at the Hensen cells was 199 ± 9 Hz (range: 140350 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of preparations (n = 22) showed a higher best frequency at the basilar membrane (mean difference of 54 ± 10 Hz, 0.35 octaves; Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight preparations showed no difference; however, the frequency spacing of our stimulus meant that we were unable to detect differences less_than20 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency difference was statistically significant (P = 9.5 × 107 by the sign test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sound-evoked vibration amplitudes depend strongly on the distance from the base of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the above findings could result from a lack of geometric registration between the two measurement sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude this possibility, the distance between the two measured points was determined from 3D reconstructions (e.g., Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longitudinal distance was found to be 20 ± 7 m (range: 290 m), which is too small to explain the observed frequency difference (the vertical distance between the Hensen cells and the basilar membrane varied from 120 to 180 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ensure that these basilar membrane measurements accurately reflected its motion, we had to confirm that the signal-to-noise ratio was adequate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the outer hair cells and Reissners membrane, which have reflectivity close to the reflectivity of the basilar membrane, showed sound-evoked motion similar to the Hensen cells (Fig 1G), as described previously (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large-magnitude difference between the basilar membrane and Reissners membrane is partly related to differences in the location of the measurement (Reissners membrane data were acquired close to its center, whereas basilar membrane measurements came from a region 1040 m medial to its attachment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an additional control, we measured from the bony edge of the cochlea and found bone vibrations during sound stimulation to be an order of magnitude smaller than the basilar membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maintaining the viability of the preparations was important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ascertain the health of each sample, the cochlear microphonic potentials were measured (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alternating extracellular field potentials are generated by mechanically sensitive ion channels responding to sound stimulation, which, in our case, were continuous tones at frequencies between 60 and 510 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All preparations included in this report had cochlear microphonic potential amplitude larger than 100 V at 59 dB SPL, and the best frequency shifted downward as the sound level increased, indicative of a physiologically good preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this range of stimulus levels, little nonlinearity was present, in contrast to cochlear microphonic data acquired from the base of the cochlea in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quality factor, Q10, of the sound-evoked tuning curves was extracted for each location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Q10 is determined by the frequency bandwidth 10 dB below the peak of the tuning curve, and is used as a measure of the sharpness of tuning (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences, but higher Q10s were observed in preparations with a high best frequency, consistent with measurements from auditory nerve fibers (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the base of the cochlea, basilar membrane responses do not grow in proportion to an increase in stimulus level, but exhibit a compressive nonlinearity that yields a large dynamic range (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether such is the case at the apex, vibration magnitudes were characterized at a variety of stimulus levels (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear relation was evident through most of the range, but Hensen cell vibration showed strong saturation at levels higher than 85 dB SPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such saturation was not seen at the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was possible to measure vibration at the Hensen cells at levels down to 20 dB SPL, but basilar membrane movement fell to the noise floor at around 40 dB SPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrical_Stimulation_Does_Not_Move_the_Lateral_Basilar_Membrane_Segment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 60- to 70-mV positive potential is found in scala media in vivo (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endocochlear potential is lost when the temporal bone is isolated from the animal, placing the cochlea in a state where force production by the outer hair cells is reduced to a point where it barely affects sound-evoked responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data shown in Fig 1 were acquired from such passive preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the influence of outer hair cell force production on basilar membrane movement, electrical currents (5 to +5 A) were injected in scala media and the mechanical response was plotted as a function of current level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basilar membrane exhibited no measurable response (Fig 2A, Upper; mean ± SEM in 15 preparations; note that error bars are too small to be clearly resolved against the mean), not even when currents were increased to ±25 A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, other regions of the organ of Corti and experimental setup were also examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No measurable movement when exposed to the current stimulus was shown in Reissners membrane, the bone surrounding the cochlea, or the electrode tip (Fig 2A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the basilar membrane is attached to both the spiral ligament and the modiolus (schematic drawing in Fig 2B), small vibrations are expected close to either attachment point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore measured current-evoked motion closer to the outer edge of the basilar membrane (Fig 2B, position A) than the standard measurement site (position B), and from the region between the outer and inner hair cells (position C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in the three graphs in Fig 2B, current-evoked motion was absent from all three sites, in direct contrast to the behavior of the Hensen cells (Fig 2C), where substantial current-evoked motion was evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative current displaced Hensen cells toward the scala tympani; they moved in the opposite direction during positive current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain that these responses were caused by outer hair cell motility, we applied the commonly used prestin blocker salicylate (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10-min exposure reversibly eliminated current-evoked motion at the Hensen cells (Fig 2D, Lower Left; n = 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basilar membrane, which did not move in response to current, showed no change after salicylate (Fig 2D, Upper Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a second control, we applied FM1-43, a fluorescent dye that blocks mechanically gated ion channels in hair cells (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FM1-43 almost abolished current-evoked Hensen cell motion (Fig 2D, Lower Right; n = 3), although the basilar membrane remained motionless (Fig 2D, Upper Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Small_Region_Under_the_Outer_Hair_Cells_Moves_During_Sound_Stimulation_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the experiments described above, the temporal bone was submerged in tissue culture medium and an opening was created in the bone that surrounds the hearing organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which the opening influences the internal sound-evoked motion of the organ of Corti is not known (35), which makes it imperative to verify the above results in a more intact preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we used optical coherence tomography, an interferometric imaging technique that can be used to measure sound-evoked motion in vivo, without creating an artificial opening in the cochlear bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current frequency-domain system (22) allowed simultaneous measurements of basilar membrane and reticular lamina motion, as exemplified in Fig 3A, which shows a vibration measurement superimposed on a structural scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colors correspond to displacement magnitude, whereas the structural scan is displayed in grayscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution in the vertical direction of the structural image was 10 m, which means that delicate features, such as the borders between different cell types within the organ of Corti, were unresolvable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the separation between the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina was large, and these structures were easily distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From images such as this one, it was evident that the maximal motion of the basilar membrane occurred in a region 3050 m medial to the edge of the organ of Corti (mean of 40 ± 6 µm, n = 4, 90 dB SPL stimulus level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even at the location of maximum vibration, basilar membrane displacements were smaller than the displacements of the reticular lamina (Fig 3B, Left, thick lines; average difference of 3.2 ± 1.1 dB; P = 0.02, repeated-measures analysis of variance; n = 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant phase differences between the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina (Fig 3B, Right, thin lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two tuning curves drawn with blue and red solid lines in Fig 3C exemplify data acquired from a single preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the tuning curves was similar, but in three of six cases, basilar membrane vibrations peaked at frequencies higher than the reticular lamina, consistent with the in vitro data described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also made attempts to acquire data postmortem, but doing so was difficult, because cells lost reflectivity after the death of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a limited sample of successful recordings, a general decrease of displacement was observed (Fig 3C, blue dashed line illustrates the tuning curve acquired from the reticular lamina in vivo, and black dashed line illustrates the postmortem data from the same structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a tendency for peak vibration to shift toward the inner hair cells, which resulted in increased sound-evoked displacement postmortem for some locations along the reticular lamina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude, however, did not exceed the one measured in vivo at the original location of peak vibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibration patterns such as shown in Fig 3A revealed that displacements were slightly larger 50 m down from the reticular lamina, within the body of the organ of Corti, than they were at the reticular lamina (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As seen in Fig 3A, sound-evoked basilar membrane displacement declined quickly on the sides of the peak, particularly at locations closer to the lateral wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize this behavior, Fig 3E shows displacement as a function of distance from the location of peak vibration (the vertical line indicates the average position of the lateral edge of the organ of Corti, and the thin red line shows data from the preparation drawn with solid lines in Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacement decreased exponentially with distance, and the thick red lines are fits of the vibration data to the function:He|y|/,where y is the distance from the peak, H is the peak amplitude, and  is the length scale of the decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the right side of the peak, corresponding to the neural side of the organ of Corti, the length scale was 127 m (the fit is significant, with P = 4.5 × 108 by t test), but it was about fourfold smaller on the abneural side (34 m; P = 0.0012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exponential decline means that the moving portion of the basilar membrane is relatively small in contrast to the behavior of the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in vitro data shown in Fig 1D were acquired 1040 µm from the attachment point of the basilar membrane to the lateral wall of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this region, the average basilar membrane displacement was 33 dB below the one measured at the Hensen cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the in vivo experiments, the corresponding points on the basilar membrane showed displacements 27 ± 8 dB below the one measured at the Hensen cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more pronounced difference in vitro may be an effect of the opening in the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spatial vibration pattern at the reticular lamina (Fig 3F) was accurately described by linear functions, with slope more than threefold larger on the abneural side (6.5 nm/m vs. 2 nm/m; both P less_than 0.005 by t test; R2 = 0.94 and R2 = 0.998, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear change with distance is expected from a structure hinged at one end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hinge point, or center of vibration, can be found through the linear fits by setting displacement to zero and solving for distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the neural side, the hinge point was 250 m from the peak on average, implying that the reticular lamina vibrated around a point located on the medial side of the inner hair cell, within the fluid of the inner sulcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a constant phase is expected from structures on the same side of the pivot point, data on the phase of vibration along the reticular lamina can be used to corroborate this finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase was found to be constant with distance, both at the basilar membrane and at the reticular lamina (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the abneural side of the peak in Fig 3F (negative distance coordinates), displacement fell quickly with distance (slope of 6.5 nm/m; R2 = 0.94, P less_than 0.005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decrease in magnitude for the outermost Hensen cells has previously been reported (figure 4B of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), and our data appear to confirm this finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reissners membrane, which separates scala media from scala vestibuli, showed an exponential relation between displacement and distance from the location of peak vibration (Fig 3H), but the length scale was larger than the one measured at the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we demonstrated that the sound-evoked motion of the basilar membrane is restricted to a region 3050 m medial to the edge of the organ of Corti, decreases quickly with radial distance, and is smaller than it is at the Hensen cells (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motion of the lateral basilar membrane segment is not influenced by quasistatic outer hair cell force generation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work on the low-frequency mechanics of the hearing organ was performed after the creation of an artificial opening in the cochlear bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opening may alter sound-evoked vibrations (16, 27, 37) by producing a change in the acoustic impedance of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the in vitro experiments reported here, the preparation is immersed in fluid, which will tend to abolish reflections of acoustic waves from the region of the opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is a loss in effective SPL at frequencies below 300 Hz (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar effect has been observed in in vivo experiments, where there is an opening in the cochlea but no immersion in fluid (16, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems well established that the opening causes frequency tuning curves to be artificially sharpened, and the present in vivo data are consistent with this possibility, in showing a relatively flat tuning compared with the in vitro preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the opening on the fast acoustic waves present in the cochlea is controversial (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37 vs. ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), as are the possible effects of the opening on the internal motion of the organ of Corti (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opening of the cochlea may also impart substantial trauma, the effect of which is difficult to determine because common methods for assessing the physiological status of the cochlea do not work well at low frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainties about the effects of the opening make it important to perform experiments in more intact preparations, but the techniques for performing such measurements only recently became available (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data show that the best frequency of the basilar membrane often is higher than the one measured at the Hensen cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in the best frequency among different structures have been found at the base of the cochlea (39), where the basilar membrane was tuned to a frequency lower than the reticular lamina, underscoring the difference between high- and low-frequency cochlear regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant new finding reported here is the nearly exponential decay of basilar membrane vibration with radial distance (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some previous studies, most of which were performed after seeding the basilar membrane with reflective beads through small tears in Reissners membrane, found that the basilar membrane and Hensen cells had similar amplitudes of sound-evoked motion (1921, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies, using no artificial reflectors, found basilar membrane movements to be 2560 dB smaller than the Hensen cell magnitude (15, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from a possible effect from mixing endolymph and perilymph, an explanation for these differences may be that the strong reflection from the bead allows vibration measurements from sites close to the organ of Corti, where the present in vivo data show somewhat smaller differences between Hensen cell and basilar membrane vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long wavelength and short coherence length of the light source, however, lead to a clear improvement in accessibility when optical coherence tomography is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of the basilar membrane is expected to shape its response to sound stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the base, a thick layer of fibers form a dense core (Fig 4A) with high bending stiffness (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dense core means that a beam model captures the essential aspects of basilar membrane mechanics, predicting a radial deformation profile with a broad peak, in agreement with measurements from the base of the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward the apex, the basilar membrane is wider, its fibers become thinner, and the core structure is absent, which reduces stiffness (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a radial deformation profile with a sharp peak and exponential decay shows that the apical basilar membrane cannot be described by simple beam models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the present findings are consistent with the ratchet theory of low-frequency hearing (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratchet mechanism implies that outer hair cell force generation minimizes fluid displacement, which could be consistent with the small motion of the lateral segment of the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher best frequency of the basilar membrane would also be consistent with this theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, additional experiments are required to prove this theory conclusively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the present experiments show an unexpected response pattern at the basilar membrane that is relevant for understanding how speech-frequency sound is detected by the hearing organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In_Vitro_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using procedures approved by the Linköping University Ethics Committee (permit N32/13), young guinea pigs (200400 g) were anesthetized and euthanized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal bones were removed and attached to a custom-made holder allowing direct sound stimulation of the tympanic membrane, and the bulla was opened to expose the middle ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preparation was submerged in oxygenated tissue culture medium (minimum essential medium; Invitrogen), reducing the effective sound pressure by 25 dB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An 0.35-mm2 triangular opening was made in the apex 120° from the helicotrema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opening covered 15% of the apex, and it was similar to the one used in a previous study (20) and slightly larger than the one used to obtain in vivo data in a previously published study (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A beveled borosilicate glass electrode was placed in scala media, penetrating the otherwise intact Reissners membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This electrode was used to monitor the sound-evoked cochlear microphonic potential, using a Dagan instruments IX1 amplifier with a head-stage having a magnification of 10×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection was aborted if these potentials, measured throughout the experiment, underwent sudden changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optically isolated constant current stimulator (A395; WPI) was used for injecting currents through the electrode utilized for measuring cochlear microphonic potentials; the amplitude of the current-evoked motions was used as a secondary quality indicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ground electrode was placed in the fluid surrounding the preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scala tympani were continuously perfused with oxygenated medium (0.6 mLh1), beginning within 10 min of decapitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perfusion system was used to deliver drugs to the hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were carried out at room temperature (2124 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interferometry_and_Confocal_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A custom-built displacement-sensitive interferometer (noise floor less_than0.1 nm/Hz at frequencies above 10 Hz) with a lens with a magnification of 25× was used for measuring acoustically and electrically evoked motion of the organ of Corti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system, which is described in detail elsewhere (26), allows measurements without the use of artificial reflectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preparation was oriented with the basilar membrane perpendicular to the optical (transverse) axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation was confirmed by imaging using a Zeiss LSM Pascal confocal microscope integrated with the interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both systems shared the same objective lens, and careful alignment ensured that the difference in focal planes was less than 1 m. Confocal images were used for 3D reconstructions, utilizing Imaris software (Bitplane AG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacement data were averaged 10 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the signal was unstable, the measurement was rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear ramp going from +5 µA to 5 µA (or the inverse) over the course of 500 ms was used for current injection (Fig 2A, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each current ramp was preceded by 50 ms of data acquisition at zero current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sound_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dissection described above leaves the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles intact, so sound stimulation was applied through a loudspeaker positioned in the ear canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loudspeaker was driven by a function generator (model 33120A; Agilent Technologies) and a digital attenuator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibration was measured at sound pressures ranging from 44 to 119 dB SPL (these sound pressures are the measured levels from the loudspeaker; all sound pressure values given in the part of the main text describing in vitro data were corrected for a 25-dB attenuation caused by the immersion of the preparation in tissue culture medium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Acquisition_and_Signal_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data were collected by custom Labview software that controlled a 12-bit board sampling the amplified carrier signal of the interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microphonic potentials were sampled by a 16-bit board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data processing was performed off-line using custom MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo experiments, and the immunolabeling described below, were carried out using procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health & Science University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, young guinea pigs were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (40 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplemental doses were given hourly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the surgical procedures and mechanical measurements, animal temperature was maintained at 38 °C, using a feedback-controlled heating pad wrapped around the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The auditory bulla was exposed using standard surgical techniques (41); however, in contrast to previous studies, no artificial opening was created in the cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a small mirror assembly was mounted on its apex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infrared light beam of the optical coherence tomography system was aimed at the mirror, which reflected the light through the bone onto the cells of the organ of Corti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrangement made it possible to measure sound-evoked vibrations in an undisturbed cochlea in the direction perpendicular to the basilar membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such measurement would otherwise require extensive dissection, which easily causes severe trauma to the delicate sensory cells in the inner ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optical_Coherence_Tomography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibration of the organ of Corti was measured with a phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography system (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this device, the 840-nm light generated by a broad-band superluminescent diode passes through the measurement system to illuminate the cells of the organ of Corti, reaching them through the intact cochlear bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back-reflected light is combined with a reference beam of light to form a spectral interference signal that is detected by a sensitive optical spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique allows the displacement of each reflecting structure to be calculated with a sensitivity of 50:00 picometers, using custom Labview data acquisition software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial resolution of the system is 10 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Albino DunkinHartley guinea pigs were euthanized and perfused intracardially with 0.1 M PBS, followed by 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cochleae were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 710 d and embedded in 4% (vol/vol) agarose, and 120-m sections were cut on a Leica VT1000 vibratome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were visualized on an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal laser microscope system using the transmission detector and a 40× lens with a 1.3 numerical aperture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
