title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Micronucleus formation causes perpetual unilateral chromosome inheritance in mouse embryos  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early mammalian embryos frequently constitute a mixture of euploid and aneuploid cells, termed embryo mosaicism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is considered a major cause of fertility problems, the mechanistic explanation for the mitotic errors that give rise to the aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos remains mysterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here using long-term live imaging of chromosome segregation in mouse embryos we show that individual chromosomes are frequently encapsulated within small nucleus-like structures called micronuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that micronucleus-enclosed chromosomes lack proper kinetochores and are therefore unable to be correctly segregated, causing them to be randomly inherited by just one of the daughter cells during subsequent embryonic cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpected pattern of chromosome inheritance provides a novel explanation for mosaicism in early embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chromosome segregation defects in cancer cells lead to encapsulation of chromosomes in micronuclei (MN), small nucleus-like structures within which dangerous DNA rearrangements termed chromothripsis can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we uncover a strikingly different consequence of MN formation in preimplantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that chromosomes from within MN become damaged and fail to support a functional kinetochore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN are therefore not segregated, but are instead inherited by one of the two daughter cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the same MN can be inherited several times without rejoining the principal nucleus and without altering the kinetics of cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN motion is passive, resulting in an even distribution of MN across the first two cell lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that perpetual unilateral MN inheritance constitutes an unexpected mode of chromosome missegregation, which could contribute to the high frequency of aneuploid cells in mammalian embryos, but simultaneously may serve to insulate the early embryonic genome from chromothripsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Micronucleus_Formation_in_Mouse_Embryos  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The preimplantation mouse embryo develops from a fertilized zygote to a 16- to 32-cell morula and then a 64- to 128-cell blastocyst without intervening cell growth over the course of 4 d, providing a tractable setting in which to examine cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first analyzed MN occurrence using fixed-cell analysis of embryos cultured in vitro under standard conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN were rare in early embryos, but from the 16-cell stage onward, embryos typically possessed 15 MN-containing cells (Fig 1A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos that developed in vivo and were fixed for examination immediately after isolation at morula stage exhibited a similar number of MN as in vitro cultured embryos, revealing that in vitro culture does not affect MN abundance (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN could potentially arise via a variety of mechanisms (5, 1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how MN form in embryos we performed medium-term (20-h duration) live confocal 4D time-lapse imaging of histone 2B:RFP-expressing (H2B:RFP) morulae, analyzing the dynamics of chromosome segregation in a total of 453 cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority (70%) of divisions occurred without obvious defect, the two sets of sister chromatids moving apart synchronously in anaphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen percent of divisions exhibited mildly lagging chromosomes, which did not normally result in MN formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in 10% of cell divisions, one or more severely lagging chromosomes were detected that resulted in MN formation in one of the daughter cells (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling of embryos fixed in midanaphase revealed that lagging chromosomes almost always possessed CREST-labeled kinetochores at their leading edge (27/29 cases; Fig 1C), indicating that anaphase-lagging chromosomes in embryos are usually intact chromatids as opposed to DNA fragments and thus that newly formed MN generally contain single whole chromatids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, MN diameter varied little between cells or developmental stage (1.74 +/ 0.06 m in diameter in morula, 1.63 +/ 0.11 m in blastocysts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies in cancer cells revealed that DNA in MN is subject to high levels of damage during the subsequent S-phase as a result of defective MN nuclear envelope function (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous to this we found that MN in morulae exhibit faint or absent staining for the nuclear envelope structural component nuclear Lamin B1 (Fig 1D) and also for LSD1, a marker of nuclear import (6), suggesting that MN nuclear envelope function is defective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeling with H2AX antibodies revealed very high levels of damage in approximately half of all MN (Fig 1D), consistent with DNA damage occurring in S-phase, as in cancer cells (6, 7, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, lagging whole chromatids are a normal feature of preimplantation development in mouse, giving rise to MN within which DNA is subject to damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micronuclei_Are_Unilaterally_Inherited_at_the_Time_of_Cell_Division  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cancer cells, MN chromosomes are segregated along with chromosomes from the PN in the next mitosis, such that an MN often persists for only one cell cycle (7, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the fate of MN during early development we examined the behavior of MN in live H2B:RFP-expressing morulae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to cancer cells, in mouse embryos we found that the MN was segregated normally along with the main chromosome mass in only 2 of 34 cases (6%) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the other 94% of MN-containing cell divisions, the MN was inherited by only one of the two daughter cells and persisted as an MN in that daughter cell (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases the MN remained visibly separate from the main chromosome mass throughout the whole of M-phase and was continuously observed to travel into one daughter (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw no evidence of MN fragmentation that might lead to the reincorporation of a portion of MN DNA back into the PN, but cannot formally exclude very small DNA fragments below the imaging resolution limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine why the chromosomal content of MN is not segregated normally, H2B:RFP-expressing embryos were observed with live 4D confocal microscopy, and individual embryos were fixed for examination by immunofluorescence when an MN-containing cell entered mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosomes from within MN exhibited a rounded hypercondensed appearance in 50% of cases (Fig 2B), whereas the normal condensed chromatin structure typical of mitosis was evident in the other 50% (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosomes from MN were usually spatially divorced from the spindle with no evidence of spindle microtubule interaction (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, regardless of the morphology of the DNA, chromosomes from MN lacked prominent CREST staining in all cases, indicating a failure to maintain a proper kinetochore, whereas prominent CREST-labeled kinetochores were evident on other chromosomes (Fig 2B and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because lagging chromosomes that form MN possess clear kinetochores (Fig 1C), this indicates that the ability to support a functional kinetochore is lost while the chromatid is enclosed within the MN, concomitant with DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, chromosomes from MN fail to be segregated in the subsequent mitosis and are inherited by only one of the daughter cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micronucleus_Inheritance_Does_Not_Prevent_Preimplantation_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An advantage of the early mouse embryo as a model for analyzing cell divisions is that all cells remain constrained within a 100-Âµm sphere throughout preimplantation development, enabling observation of sequential cell divisions following MN formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore analyzed MN inheritance using datasets comprising complete Z-projections acquired every 225 s using spinning disk microscopy for 90 h, encompassing development from one-cell stage through to blastocyst stage (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides the spatial and temporal resolution to observe the genesis and fate of all MN, without affecting the health of the embryo, as determined by the ability to generate live pups after embryo transfer (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a comprehensive analysis of every cell division within each embryo, recording the incidence of lagging chromosomes and MN, as well as cell cycle durations, cell fate, and lineage relationships during preimplantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the previous experiments, chromosomes from MN were not segregated in the subsequent cell cycle, but were unilaterally inherited, resulting in a single MN in one daughter cell (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these long-term datasets allowed us to continuously track the same MN over the course of several cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of this, we observed that second-generation MN were similarly inherited by one daughter cell, and MN were continually inherited in this manner up to four times within the observed period of preimplantation development (Fig 3A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of cell cycle timings across our datasets revealed that MN had no impact upon the duration of M-phase (Fig 3B), consistent with the lack of coherent kinetochores on MN chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interphase durations were also unaltered, indicative of a failure to activate DNA-damage responses (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cell cycle durations were similar in cells containing first- or subsequent-generation MN (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the 16- to 32-cell mitosis was 51.6 +/ 7.7 min in cells containing first-generation MN and 55.8 +/ 7.9 min in cells containing second-generation MN (P  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, once formed, MN persist throughout preimplantation development, with their DNA contents being inherited at each subsequent mitosis without apparent impact upon the durations of subsequent cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Passive_Inheritance_Results_in_Randomly_Distributed_Micronuclei_in_Embryos  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we performed three series of experiments to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of MN inheritance during cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we analyzed the 3D positioning of MN within live embryos by colabeling chromosomes and the plasmalemma using H2B:RFP and CAAX:GFP, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In interphase, MN oscillated over small distances in three dimensions, but exhibited little or no net displacement over time (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No obvious inheritance bias was detected based on cell morphology, the MN being equally likely to be inherited by the larger or smaller daughter cell or, similarly, the daughter cell with the larger or smaller nucleus (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, as a further way of tracking the movement of MN, H2B:RFP-expressing embryos were coinjected with inert fluorescent beads to provide a passive maker of cytoplasmic dynamics during cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN movement in anaphase closely mirrored that of nearby beads, suggesting that MN move passively as a result of normal cytoplasmic dynamics, rather than by specific cytoskeleton-directed mechanisms (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we analyzed the distribution of MN in 128-cell stage blastocyst-stage embryos and found no difference in the proportion of MN-containing cells in the inner cell mass (ICM; 3.6 +/ 0.8% of cells with MN) and the trophectoderm (TE; 3.2 +/ 0.5%; P  0.1) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these experiments indicate that MN movement in embryos is undirected, resulting in an even distribution of MN between the two major cell lineages at the end of preimplantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiments show that, in mouse embryos, encapsulation within an MN leads to DNA damage and an apparently irreversible loss of the ability to assemble a normal kinetochore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, MN chromosomes repeatedly fail to be segregated and are instead perpetually inherited (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we have not formally counted chromosomes in embryo cells here, we suggest that repeated MN inheritance must result in whole chromosome aneuploidy (depicted in Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the lagging chromosome is initially correctly inherited such that first-generation MN-containing cells possess the correct number of chromosomes (albeit one within an MN), as is frequently the case in cancer cell lines (10, 24), then unilateral inheritance would render MN-free progeny of that cell hypoploid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if the MN first forms in the incorrect cell, then the MN-containing cell and its MN-containing progeny would be hyperploid, whereas the original MN-free cell and its progeny would be hypoploid (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perpetual MN inheritance thus presents means of generating a cascade of aneuploid cells from a single initial lagging chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct observation of the ploidy impacts of MN inheritance will require new methods for counting chromosomes in individual blastomeres in live embryos in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we suggest that this pattern of chromosome dynamics may provide at least a partial explanation for the high level of mitotic chromosome segregation errors and mosaicism detected in human embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whether the apparent absence of kinetochores on DNA from MN in embryos involves specific mechanisms or is a serendipitous by-product of extreme chromosome damage remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to CREST-labeling being absent on chromosomes from within MN, we have also found that MN typically lack foci of the centromeric histone CENP-A, which are readily detectable in the principal nucleus in embryos (25) (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple explanation therefore is that damage to the MN chromosome may lead to loss of centromeric identity, precluding proper kinetochore assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data thus raise the broader question of whether lower levels of DNA damage, perhaps causing more subtle kinetochore assembly defects, may cause de novo segregation defects and thus be a more general driver of segregation errors in some contexts (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that perpetual unilateral MN inheritance is a previously unidentified mode of chromosome segregation error and joins chromothripsis as a direct consequence of MN formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we speculate that MN inheritance may simultaneously serve an important genome protective role in early development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did see MN rejoining the main group of chromosomes on a very small number of occasions (6%; Fig S2) and so do not exclude the possibility that some low level of chromothripsis-like rearrangement could occur in early embryos (27), our data show clearly that in the vast majority of cases, MN chromosomes do not rejoin the PN during mitosis in preimplantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed no evidence in any of our datasets of MN reabsorption into the PN in interphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our data raise the possibility that MN observed in embryonic stem cells (28) reflect segregation errors in preimplantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas MN in somatic cells rejoin the genome and risk cell transformation, MN in embryos generally do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, MN inheritance generates a small cascade of aneuploid cells, which likely undergo apoptosis later in development (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MN inheritance may therefore provide a means of sacrificing a modest number of cells to prevent the incorporation of damaged DNA into the genome, thereby insulating the early embryo from chromothripsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether some somatic tissues retain this strategy remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All experiments were approved by the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (CRCHUM) ComitÃ© Institutionnel de Protection des Animaux (CIPA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were harvested from superovulated BDF1 female mice mated with BDF1 males and cultured in KSOM media in 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA was manufactured using Ambion mMessage Machine according to the manufacturers instructions and microinjected into embryos using a picopump (World Precision Instruments) and micromanipulators (Narishige) mounted on a Leica DMI4000 inverted microscope, as previously described (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids used were CAAX:GFP in pcDNA3.1 (gift from Guillaume Charras, University College London, London) and H2B:RFP in pRN4 (gift from Alex McDougall, Observatoire OcÃ©anologique de Villefranche-sur-Mer, Villefranche Sur Mer, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dragon-green beads were purchased from Bangs Laboratories and injected at a 1:5 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence_and_Live_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Embryos were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; 40 min) and permeabilized by Triton-X (0.25%, 10 min) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies used as follows: CREST (gift from William Earnshaw, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, 1:200), -tubulin (Sigma, 1:1,000), H2AX (Trevigen, 1:800), Oct3/4 (SantaCruz, 1:300), LSD1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:400), and Lamin B1 (Abcam, 1:1000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where CENP-A antibodies were used (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200), embryos were fixed with 2% PFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies were from Life Technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live imaging was performed on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope fitted with a 20x 0.75NA objective and a HyD detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was performed for 20 h at the morula stage, and embryos were included for analysis only following morphologically normal cavitation, which typically occurred in 50% of embryos in any given experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete 4D datasets of embryo development (as in Fig 3) were obtained as previously described (23, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 61 optical sections were obtained at 225-s intervals for 90 h using a CSU10 Yokagawa Nipkow disk system, mounted on an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
