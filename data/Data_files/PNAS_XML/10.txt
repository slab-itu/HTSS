Dietary change among hominins and cercopithecids in Ethiopia during the early Pliocene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dietary change among hominins is a critical aspect of human evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use carbon isotope data from fossil teeth of hominins, monkeys, and other mammals from Ethiopia to document C4 food consumption by both hominins and the baboon, Theropithecus oswaldi, during the early Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expansion of hominin diet and the appearance of the Theropithecus oswaldi lineage as early as 3.76 Ma mark a major ecological change within African primate communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to eat a range of C3 and C4 foods indicates that early Pliocene hominins were likely generalists who could thrive in different and perhaps varying environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The incorporation of C4 resources into hominin diet signifies increased dietary breadth within hominins and divergence from the dietary patterns of other great apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological evidence indicates that hominin diet became increasingly diverse by 4.2 million years ago but may not have included large proportions of C4 foods until 800 thousand years later, given the available isotopic evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use carbon isotope data from early to mid Pliocene hominin and cercopithecid fossils from Woranso-Mille (central Afar, Ethiopia) to constrain the timing of this dietary change and its ecological context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that both hominins and some papionins expanded their diets to include C4 resources as early as 3.76 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among hominins, this dietary expansion postdates the major dentognathic morphological changes that distinguish Australopithecus from Ardipithecus, but it occurs amid a continuum of adaptations to diets of tougher, harder foods and to committed terrestrial bipedality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, carbon isotope data from cercopithecids indicate that C4-dominated diets of the earliest members of the Theropithecus oswaldi lineage preceded the dental specialization for grazing but occurred after they were fully terrestrial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined data indicate that the inclusion of C4 foods in hominin diet occurred as part of broader ecological changes in African primate communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from 152 fossil teeth of hominins, cercopithecids, bovids, giraffids, hippopotamids, suids, rhinoceratids, and proboscidea from three time intervals at Woranso-Mille (3.763.57 Ma, 3.573.47 Ma, and 3.473.2 Ma; see Supporting Information for additional context).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these teeth, 13C values range from 14.0 to +1.1 and represent the full spectrum of 13C values expected for tooth enamel from mammals with diets of exclusively C3 and exclusively C4 resources (Fig 1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumed browsers such as giraffids and colobines yield 13C values at the lower end of this range, whereas 13C values of presumed grazers including alcelaphini, Loxodonta, Anancus, and Notochoerus euilus are at the high end of this range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distributions suggest that the carbon isotope data from the fossil teeth at Woranso-Mille preserve dietary information and are not products of diagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no significant differences in 13C values among any of the mammalian taxa from the different time intervals sampled at Woranso-Mille (P  0.05), such that we consider the fossil 13C data from all of the time intervals together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hominins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling was limited to fragmentary hominin teeth whose genus and species cannot be determined with certainty; the sample may include intermediate forms of the Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensisAu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis lineage, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis, Australopithecus deyiremeda, and a yet unnamed species represented by the BRT-VP-2/73 foot (9, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Woranso-Mille hominin teeth yield a mean 13C of 7.9 ± 2.5 (1) and range from 11.8 to 3.8 (n = 16, median 7.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of hominin teeth from Woranso-Mille are indistinguishable from that of non-Theropithecus papionins, Tragelaphus, sivatheres, and hippopatimds (P  0.1), but distinct from the 13C values of all other taxonomic groups sampled (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 13C values of hominins at Woranso-Mille are significantly higher than 13C values of sympatric colobines and lower than 13C values of sympatric Theropithecus individuals (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range in 13C values among hominins at Woranso-Mille indicates that some individuals had diets dominated by C3 foods, whereas other individuals had a significant component of C4 resources in their diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed variation in 13C values among hominins at Woranso-Mille may reflect dietary differences among hominin species; however, the fragmentary nature of the sampled teeth precludes us from connecting the stable isotope results to specific hominin taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The range in 13C values of the Woranso-Mille hominins overlaps with those from older hominins, such as Ardipithecus ramidus (median 10.3, range 11.2 to 8.5, n = 5) (14) and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensis (median 11.2, 12.0 to 9.5, n = 12) (2) (Fig 2 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of 13C values of the Woranso-Mille hominins are significantly more positive than 13C values of Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensis (P = 0.002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of the Woranso-Mille hominins are indistinct from the majority of younger Pliocene hominins, including Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis (1), Australopithecus africanus (4, 1518), and Kenyanthropus platyops (2), with the exception of two individuals of Australopithecus bahrelghazali that incorporated significantly more C4 resources in their diet (19) and Australopithecus sediba, whose diet was restricted to C3 foods (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Woranso-Mille hominins also have substantially more C4 foods in their diets than the extant primates for which carbon isotope data from tooth enamel are available (Dataset S3), but we note that these data have mostly been generated from animals living in forests and do not represent the full spectrum of environments in Africa today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the 13C values from the Woranso-Mille hominins indicate that C4 foods were a significant component to hominin diets as early as 3.76 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cercopithecids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 13C values of the cercopithecids sampled from Woranso-Mille represent diets that ranged in proportions of C3 and C4 resource use (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of colobines average 11.9 ± 1.3 (n = 9) and represent diets of either pure C3 vegetation or with minor amounts of C4 plants and/or water-stressed C3 vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of T. oswaldi cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  darti sampled from Woranso Mille average 3.4 ± 1.8 (n = 39) and represent diets that are compatible with the inclusion of a large proportion of C4 foods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values from the other papionin samples, referred to as non-Theropithecus papionins henceforth, average 8.8 ± 3.9 and range from 12.0 to 2.6 (n = 9), reflective of diets that included little to no C4 vegetation for some animals and a majority of C4 vegetation for others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, the T. oswaldi cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  darti teeth yield the highest 13C values among all primates sampled from Woranso-Mille.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are distinct from 13C values of the non-Theropithecus papionins, colobines, and hominins and from 13C values of all other nonprimate taxa (P less_than 0.001), except for hippopotamids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of T. oswaldi cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  darti from Woranso-Mille are indistinguishable from the oldest Theropithecus sampled from the Turkana Basin, Theropithecus brumpti (21), but significantly lower than 13C values from T. oswaldi that are younger than 2.0 Ma in Turkana, from Olorgesailie in Kenya, and from Swartkrans, Makapansgat, and Sterkfontein in South Africa (18, 2124) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fossil Theropithecus 13C values are significantly higher than the carbon isotope data available for extant primates in Africa (Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are consistent with studies from several sites in South Africa that show that Theropithecus consumed more C4 vegetation than other cercopithecids and contemporaneous hominins (Fig 2 and Fig S2) (18, 2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 13C data from colobines come from at least two species at Woranso-Mille: Cercopithecoides cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  meaveae and one or more larger colobines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not have enough 13C data from each taxon to detect differences among them, but they are all consistent with diets dominated by C3 vegetation, with 13C values that are indistinct from the non-Theropithecus papionins and Giraffa sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at Woranso-Mille (P  0.1) but significantly lower than 13C values of Theropithecus, hominins, and the nonprimate mammals at Woranso-Mille (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values from colobines at Woranso-Mille are indistinct from 13C values published from fossil colobines at other localities in Ethiopia and South Africa (Fig 2) (14, 22, 25, 26); however, they are significantly higher than carbon isotope data from extant colobines (Dataset S3), which might indicate either a small component of C4 in their diet, a difference in digestive physiology, or that the C3 resources they consumed had higher 13C values than the plants consumed by extant primates in tropical evergreen and rainforests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 13C values of non-Theropithecus papionins at Woranso-Mille overlap with 13C values of hominins, colobines, giraffids, and Tragelaphus but are significantly lower than those of T. oswaldi cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  darti, the non-Tragelaphus bovids, hippopotamids, N. euilus, and Proboscidea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the nine teeth sampled, six yield 13C values less_than 9 (11.4 ± 1.0, n = 6) and overlap with the colobine 13C data; however, three of the teeth (all from the 3.763.57 Ma interval) yield distinctively higher 13C values (3.7 ± 1.0), indicating diets with significant amounts of C4 vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is nothing about the size, morphology, or anatomical position of these teeth that set them apart; as such, we interpret these data to indicate that either (i) some non-Theropithecus papionins overlapped in their dietary behavior with Theropithecus and consumed large amounts of C4 vegetation or (ii) they are early Theropithecus that used C4 resources but with tooth morphology that is not distinct enough to characterize them as Theropithecus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values of the Woranso-Mille non-Theropithecus papionins are not significantly different from 13C of other fossil non-Theropithecus papionins from Ethiopia, Tanzania, and South Africa (14, 18, 2229) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tooth_Enamel_Oxygen_Isotope_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 18O values of teeth samples from Woranso-Mille range from 9.0 to +6.3 (Fig 1) and exhibit fewer taxonomic distinctions than observed for 13C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of taxa have overlapping 18O values, with the exception of the hippopotamid teeth, which are significantly lower than 18O values of all other taxa sampled from the 3.763.57 Ma time interval (P less_than 0.02), except for Proboscidea, N. euilus, and sivatheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not make this comparison for the other time intervals, as we only sampled hippopotamids from the 3.763.57 Ma time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, among the samples from the youngest time interval (3.473.2 Ma), there are no distinctions in 18O among taxa, except for 18O of sivatheres, which are significantly higher than those of Theropithcus and N. euilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are not enough samples from the middle time interval (3.573.47 Ma) to make meaningful comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among taxa that were sampled from multiple time intervals (all of the primates, giraffids, Tragelaphus, and N. euilus), there are no temporal distinctions in the distributions of 18O values, with the exception of Theropithecus and N. euilus, which exhibit an increase in mean 18O values of 3.0 and 3.9, respectively, between the 3.763.57 Ma and 3.473.2 Ma sampling intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total range in 18O values among hominins (8.1) is similar to that for sympatric primates (6.57.8) and other mammals (5.011.0) at Woranso-Mille for which more than five teeth were sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Absolute 18O values of fossil teeth are difficult to compare between fossil localities (30); however, the low 18O values of the hippopotamid teeth relative to most other taxa at Woranso-Mille are consistent with observations from other fossil sites in the Afar, including those with oxygen isotope data from hominins (1, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offset between the giraffid and hippopotamid 18O values in the 3.763.57 Ma aged sediments at Woranso-Mille is 3.3 ± 2.4, which can be compared with the 18O giraffidhippopotamid offset observed among fauna associated with Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ramidus at Aramis (9.0 ± 3.0) (14) and with Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis at Hadar (5.4 ± 4.0) (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen isotope data may indicate a slightly wetter environment in Woranso-Mille at 3.763.57 Ma that at Hadar (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.4 Ma) or Aramis (4.4 Ma), assuming the relationship between aridity and the offset in 18O values of giraffids and hippopotamids in eastern Africa today (30) applies to the Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soil_Carbonates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil carbonates from hominin fossil-bearing sequences at Woranso-Mille yield mean 13C values of 6.1 ± 0.6 (n = 8) at Aralee Issie (3.763.57 Ma) and 9.2 ± 4.0 (n = 6) from Burtele and Nefuraytu (3.473.2 Ma) (Fig S3 and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distribution is similar to 13C values of soil carbonates from Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensis-, K. platyops-, and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis-bearing sequences (Fig S3 and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18O values of soil carbonates at Woranso-Mille (6.5 ± 0.9 at Aralee Issie and 3.7 ± 2.7 at Burtele and Nefuraytu) are within the range of 18O values for soil carbonates from other Pliocene hominin-bearing sequences in eastern Africa (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C4_Resource_Use_Among_Pliocene_Hominins_and_Cercopithecids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The carbon isotope data from Woranso-Mille indicate that hominins included significant amounts of C4 resources in their diets as early as 3.76 Ma (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, 13C values of the Woranso-Mille hominins indicate diets that are distinct from those of preceding taxa, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensis and Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ramidus, but similar to those of the majority of younger hominins, including Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis, K. platyops, and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus, although not to Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bahrelghazali or Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba (1, 2, 4, 1420, 29, 3134).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expansion of hominin diets in the early Pliocene appears to be contemporaneous with the appearance of the first recognizable forms of Theropithecus (10, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two well-known lineages of the genus, T. brumpti, largely restricted to the Turkana Basin, and the much more cosmopolitan T. oswaldi; both first appear ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.83.6 Ma (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values for the earliest T. brumpti show that it incorporated a large component of C4 resources in its diet (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values from Woranso-Mille extend this record of early C4 consumption to the T. oswaldi lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C4-dominated diets of Theropithecus are unique among the cercopithecids; colobines maintain C3-dominated diets through the Pliocene, and non-Theropithecus papionins always maintained a smaller component of C4 in their diet than sympatric populations of Theropithecus (Fig 2, Fig S2, and Dataset S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that 13C values of hominin teeth are consistently higher than 13C values of colobines throughout the Pliocene, indicating that (i) hominin and colobine diets were always distinct, (ii) hominins and colobines had different carbon isotope diettissue fractionation factors, reflecting differences in their physiologies, or (iii) hominins consumed some C4 foods since 4.4 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Environmental_Change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Environmental context is an important part to understanding the evolutionary implications of the dietary expansion among hominins and Theropithecus to include C4 resources; however, it has been difficult to establish definitive links between diet and environment for fossil primates (4, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of significant amounts of C4 resources in primate diets in the early Pliocene occurred amid a gradual trend of increasing C4 vegetation in Africa that began in the late Miocene (3739) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in C4 vegetation is generally viewed as a decrease in woody cover (37), but pollen records indicate that C3 grasses were present throughout the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene (38, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pollen abundances and 13C values of leaf waxes and soil carbonates indicate large proportions of grasses and C4 plants in eastern Africa in the earliest Pliocene (5.04.0 Ma), with decreased amounts of C4 vegetation and grasses by 4.0 Ma, followed by a small rise in C4 vegetation between 3.9 and 3.7 Ma (37, 38, 4042), which is coincident with the expansion of primate diets to include significant amounts of C4 resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the coincidence makes it tempting to link the C4 dietary expansion among hominins to environmental factors, there are reasons to be cautious: (i) the soil carbonate records are sparse from this time interval, and (ii) when 13C values of soil carbonates from hominin-bearing strata are compared directly (Fig S3), there is no clear connection between environmental C4 abundance and C4-dominated diets among hominins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen isotope data from fossil giraffid and hippopotamid teeth may indicate wetter environments at Woranso-Mille than at both earlier and later hominin sites, but this could reflect local variation in water availability that is typical in eastern Africa today and does not necessitate any major climate change coincident with the inclusion of significant amounts of C4 resources in hominin or Theropithecus diets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the collective data that are available, we do not see strong environmental trends that can be linked confidently to the C4 dietary expansion among hominins and Theropithecus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dietary_Breadth_in_Primate_Communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of the expanded breadth in hominin diet and the appearance of the T. oswaldi lineage as early as 3.76 Ma marks a major change in African primate communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of Theropithecus is important to hominin paleoecology because Theropithecus was a large fraction of the identifiable mammalian fossils at Woranso-Mille (10) and was predominant in nearly all eastern African mammalian communities from 3.5 Ma to 1.0 Ma (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased range in 13C values of both hominins and cercopithecids after 3.76 Ma indicates that primate dietary breadth increased with the appearance of Theropithecus, which ultimately became a committed grazer (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of both C3 and C4 foods by hominins likely reflects that they were generalists who could thrive in different environments, eating foods of varying quality and type (1, 4, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of significant amounts of C4 foods among hominins and papionins indicates niche broadening that appears unique among primates in the early Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not aware of significant dietary changes in other African mammalian orders at this time; Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, and Probsocidea started to consume significant amounts of C4 resources several million years earlier, in the late Miocene (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationship_Between_Diet_and_Morphology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The craniodental features characterizing australopiths are usually interpreted as a character complex associated with adaptations for hard-object, tougher, and more abrasive food resources (44, 45), although other interpretations such as those based on dental microstructure may not corroborate the former interpretation (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first appearance of these features is interpreted as an adaptation to eating a broader array of resources than hominins did previously (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the niche expansion indicated by dentognathic morphology at 4.2 Ma is not reflected in carbon isotope data (2, 4, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intake of large amounts of C4 foods as early as 3.76 Ma may represent a subsequent dietary change, wherein hominins further increased their dietary breadth (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing enamel thickness, megadontia, and mandibular robusticity among Pliocene hominins is consistent with the consumption of more C4 food resources, which might have included underground storage organs (i.e., rhizomes, corms) (1, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term relationships between dentognathic morphology and C4 dietary intake is exhibited by correlations between 13C values and both postcanine and mandibular size for australopithecines (4); however, morphological changes are incremental and do not reflect the stepwise increase in C4 resource consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that microwear data from Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  anamensis and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis teeth are similar to one another and are not consistent with morphological changes that are often associated with increased specialization for hard-object feeding; instead, they are consistent with diets of soft and tough foods (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among papionins, adaptations to terrestrial behavior were already apparent by the late Miocene (52), and all evidence suggests that the earliest Theropithecus was fully terrestrial (10, 36, 53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main morphological changes that occurred in Theropithecus 3.81.0 Ma include increasing body size and the dentognathic specialization for grazing (36, 53, 55), but the evidence for C4-dominated diets among the earliest Theropithecus fossils indicates that the grazing behavior precedes most of the dental specializations for eating grass, although we recognize that Theropithecus initial use of C4 grass may have focused on the nonblade part of grass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stable carbon isotope data from Woranso-Mille show that both hominins and Theropithecus included large proportions of C4 foods in their diets as early as 3.76 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased use of C4 foods among both hominins and Theropithecus represents an expansion of dietary niche among primates to include both C3 and C4 resources that became typical in subsequent fossil primate communities for which there are isotopic data (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C4 dietary expansion was relatively late among primates, as other African mammalian orders had been consuming large amounts of C4 foods since the late Miocene (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Theropithecus, the reliance on C4 foods represents the initiation of its dietary specialization and its role as an abundant and widespread grazer within African mammalian communities (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence for C4-dominated diets among the earliest identified specimens of Theropithecus precedes morphological specializations for grazing and provides a clear example of behavioral change preceding morphological adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hominins, the isotopic evidence for dietary expansion postdates the beginning of major morphological dentognathic changes among australopiths (47, 48) and, as such, it represents a subsequent phase of increasing dietary breadth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unequivocal incorporation of C4 resources by hominins and cercopithecids as early as 3.76 Ma demonstrates that primates were expanding the types of food resources and potentially the environments that they were able to exploit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossil teeth were sampled in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Teeth were cleaned with gentle abrasion before sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hominin teeth were sampled along previously broken surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enamel powders were treated with 10% (vol/vol) H2O2 and 0.1 M buffered acetic acid solution for 15 min each, rinsed with deionized water three times after each treatment, and dried at 60 °C overnight before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil carbonates were sampled from distinct pedogenic carbonate zones  50 cm below the contact with the overlying unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After digestion in phosphoric acid, 13C/12C and 18O/16O ratios of enamel and carbonate powders were measured on a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer at Johns Hopkins University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External precision (1) of 13C and 18O values of the working fossil tooth enamel standards over the course of analysis was 0.3 and 0.2 for 13C and 18O, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope data are reported relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistics were performed in Kaleidograph using an unpaired WilcoxonMannWhitney Rank Sum Test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Although individual fossils can be placed in more tightly constrained time intervals, for the purposes of this study, fossils were placed in three stratigraphic groupings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest interval is bound by two radiometrically dated tephra, the Mille tuff (3.76 ± 0.02 Ma) and the Kilaytoli tuff (KT, 3.57 ± 0.014 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The middle interval is bound by the KT at the base and the Burtele Tuff (3.469 ± 0.008 Ma) at its top (7, 9, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The youngest time interval is bound by the Burtele Tuff at its base and extends to 3.2 Ma (constrained by sedimentation rates) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localities in the lower age bin (3.763.57 Ma) include ARI-VP-1, ARI-VP-2, ARI-VP-3, ARI-VP-5, KSD-VP-1, MKM-VP-1, MSD-VP-1, MSD-VP-2, MSD-VP-3, MSD-VP-5, MSD-VP-8, and MSD-VP-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localities included in the middle age bin (3.573.47 Ma) are BRT-VP-3 and KSD-VP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localities included in the upper, younger age bin (3.473.2 Ma) are BKI-VP-2, BRT-VP-1, BRT-VP-2, LAD-VP-1, LAD-VP-2, LDD-VP-1, and NFR-VP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that specimens from KSD-VP-1 are included in either the middle or lower age bin depending on their position relative to a fault that cuts through this locality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fossil teeth and soil carbonates were sampled as described in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid sampling multiple teeth from one individual, we targeted the third molar where possible and did not sample teeth from the same taxonomic group if the fossils were recovered in close proximity to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tooth enamel and soil carbonate powders were reacted with 100% H3PO4 under vacuum at 90 °C using a common acid bath device described by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant, purified CO2 was then transferred to the microvolume of dual inlet system on a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer at Johns Hopkins University for determination of 13C/12C and 18O/16O ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 was measured in reference to a working reference gas calibrated during each run to NBS-19 and calcite and bioapatite working reference materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 yields of enamel samples indicate that they contained 49% carbonate and did not contain large amounts of exogenous carbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An acid fractionation factor of 1.00725 (90 °C) was used for 18O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All isotope data are reported relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are presented in Datasets S1 and S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interpretation_of_13C_Values  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We discuss carbon isotopic values using -notation in per mil () units, where 13C = (Rsample/Rreference  1) × 1,000, and R represents the 13C/12C ratio of sample or reference material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the interpretation of enamel 13C values, we assign nominal preindustrial 13C plant values of 26 and 12 to 10 for C3 and C4 plants in eastern Africa and assume that the isotope enrichment between diet and enamel for primates is ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 (5), such that an animal with a pure C3 diet would have an enamel 13C value of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 and an animal with a pure C4 diet would have an enamel 13C value of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  +2 to +4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use these values only as rough guides to estimating the proportions of C3 and C4 resources consumed by an animal over the course of enamel mineralization, because there is a range in 13C values of vegetation (diet) and there is uncertainty in the carbon isotope enrichment between diet and bioapatite for primates (5, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the approach used by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 to estimate the proportion of C3 and C4 plants in hominin diets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wynn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 take a different approach and assign end-member 13C values of enamel representing animals that had diets composed entirely of either C3 or C4 resources based on median values for giraffes and Alcelaphines, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were not sufficient numbers of fossil teeth representing Alcelaphines at the localities we sampled to take this approach with the Woranso-Mille data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we compare tooth enamel 13C values from fossils to those of extant animals, all of the data from extant animals are corrected to 13C values of CO2 in A.D. 1750 values as done by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, using data from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  70 for pre-1980 13CCO2-atm values and data from Mauna Loa, reported by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  71, for 13CCO2-atm after 1980, assuming that 13C value of atmospheric CO2 was 6.3 in 1750 A.D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are indicated in the text, Fig 2, and Dataset S3 as 13C1750.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, these values provide a maximum correction because tooth enamel formed before the death of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
