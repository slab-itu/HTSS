Pamidronate functionalized nanoconjugates for targeted therapy of focal skeletal malignant osteolysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malignant osteolysis associated with inoperable primary bone tumors and multifocal skeletal metastases remains a challenging clinical problem in cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outgrowth of residual cancer cells within the bone microenvironment despite aggressive multimodality therapies necessitates the discovery and validation of novel strategies for treating osteotropic solid tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report on pamidronate functionalized polylactide nanoparticles for the targeted treatment of focal malignant osteolysis by delivering doxorubicin specifically to the bone tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved efficacy was demonstrated in a preclinical orthotopic mouse model of osteosarcoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, through the inclusion of dogs with naturally developing osteosarcoma, biocompatibility, biodistribution, and anticancer activities at clinically relevant dosages were demonstrated in a large mammalian modeling system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malignant osteolysis associated with inoperable primary bone tumors and multifocal skeletal metastases remains a challenging clinical problem in cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanomedicine that is able to target and deliver therapeutic agents to diseased bone sites could potentially provide an effective treatment option for different types of skeletal cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the development of polylactide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with doxorubicin (Doxo) and coated with bone-seeking pamidronate (Pam) for the targeted treatment of malignant skeletal tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo biodistribution of radiolabeled targeted Pam-NPs demonstrated enhanced bone tumor accumulation and prolonged retention compared with nontargeted NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a murine model of focal malignant osteolysis, Pam-functionalized, Doxo-loaded NPs (Pam-Doxo-NPs) significantly attenuated localized osteosarcoma (OS) progression compared with nontargeted Doxo-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we report on the first evaluation to our knowlege of Pam-Doxo-NPs in dogs with OS, which possess tumors of anatomic size and physiology comparable to those in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeat dosing of Pam-Doxo-NPs in dogs with naturally occurring OS indicated the therapeutic was well tolerated without hematologic, nonhematologic, and cardiac toxicities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By nuclear scintigraphy, the biodistribution of Pam-Doxo-NPs demonstrated malignant bone-targeting capability and exerted measurable anticancer activities as confirmed with percent tumor necrosis histopathology assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesis_and_Characterization_of_Pam-Doxo-NPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Pam-Doxo-NPs were constructed through conanoprecipitation of DoxoPLA polymer conjugates, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-PLA (PEG-PLA) and Pam-conjugated PEG-PLA (PLA-PEG-Pam) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DoxoPLA polymer conjugates were synthesized by using the Doxo-initiated ring-opening polymerization (ROP) strategy as described previously (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allowed for quantitative incorporation of Doxo into PLA polymers and resulted in DoxoPLA conjugates with precisely controlled composition and molecular weights (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a monomer/initiator (LA/Doxo) ratio of 10, Doxo loading was achieved as high as 27.4 wt % with nearly 100% incorporation efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pam was covalently conjugated to PLA-PEG-COOH polymer via stable amide bond as evidenced by 1H NMR (Fig 1A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant DoxoPLA polymer conjugate was mixed with a mixture of PLA-PEG and PLA-PEG-Pam in dimethylformamide (DMF) followed by nanoprecipitation into rapidly stirred water as nonsolvent to prepare Pam-Doxo-NPs with different Pam contents (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of NPs showed similar hydrodynamic sizes (100 nm) and relatively narrow size distributions (polydispersity index 0.10) as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPs with 100 nm size and narrow size distribution were also evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By labeling NPs with radioisotope 64Cu [denoted as 64Cu-NP, Pam-64Cu-NP (10%), and Pam-64Cu-NP (50%), respectively] we evaluated the effects of Pam ligand densities on the pharmacokinetic profiles of NPs by monitoring serial blood radioactivity over the course of 24 h. All of the NPs exhibited similar circulation half-lives (Fig 1D and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Doxo was conjugated to PLA polymer through ester linkages and could be released from NPs subjected to hydrolysis of ester bonds in the physiological condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted release kinetic studies of Pam-Doxo-NPs in PBS buffer at pH 5.0 and 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The release kinetics of Doxo from NPs was controllable in a sustained manner without burst release effect at both pH values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The release rate of Doxo from NPs was also pH-dependent, evidenced by accelerated release kinetics at increased acidities, likely due to faster hydrolysis at lower pH (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Pam-Doxo-NPs could be formulated as a solid form upon lyophilization with human serum albumin as a lyoprotectant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lyophilized Pam-Doxo-NPs, when reconstituted in buffer solution, maintained original size and narrow particle size distribution (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When incubating Pam-Doxo-NPs in 50% (vol %) FBS buffer, Pam-Doxo-NPs (50%) showed a slow time-dependent size increase after 4 d of incubation, whereas Pam-Doxo-NPs (10%) demonstrated more durable maintenance of size without aggregation (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the stability of NPs as a critical determinant for their in vivo biological performance, Pam-Doxo-NPs (10%) were chosen for further live animal exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_HA_Binding_Capability_and_Cytotoxicity_of_Pam-Doxo-NPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the potential bone-binding affinity of Pam-modified NPs, we first performed an in vitro HA adsorption assay using Cy5-labeled NPs (Cy5-NPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HA was considered as an ideal model substrate because it constitutes the major inorganic component of bone and undergoes erosive osteolysis secondary to the growth of invasive osteotropic solid malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, Pam-modified Cy5-NPs (Pam-Cy5-NPs) exhibited rapid and strong binding with HA, with 10.5 mg of Pam-Cy5-NP bound per gram of HA during the first 15 min of incubation and gradually reached equilibrium by 4 h. In contrast, nontargeted Cy5-NPs showed minimal binding capability with HA (1.6 mg of NP bound per gram of HA) during the first 15 min of incubation and exhibited approximately threefold reduced binding capability with HA compared with the Pam-Cy5-NPs over 4 h of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the binding of Pam-Cy5-NPs to HA exhibits adsorptive characteristics similar to those of free aminobisphosphonate, we measured the steady-state binding affinity by titrating the concentrations of NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the binding capacity was proportional to the concentrations of Pam-Cy5-NPs, whereas the Cy5-NPs had a nonspecific adsorption to HA (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the binding of Pam-Cy5-NPs with HA was a specific effect of Pam targeting, we conducted a competitive binding experiment in which we preincubated free Pam with HA for 24 h and then measured the binding capacity of Pam-Cy5-NPs with HA after 2 h of incubation, while in the presence of free Pam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pre- and coincubation of HA with free Pam significantly reduced the binding of Pam-Cy5-NP to HA by 90% (Fig 2C), indicating that Pam was principally responsible for HA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further characterize the binding of NPs to HA, tandem bright field and fluorescence microscopy were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With Cy5 fluorescence intensity confirmed to linearly correlate with NP concentration (Fig S3), Pam-Cy5-NPs consistently adsorbed to exposed surface and edges of the HA crystals, whereas Cy5-NPs only minimally adhered to HA crystals (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the increased binding capacity of Pam-NPs to HA, we reasoned that Pam-NPs carrying chemotherapeutic agents may exert greater cytotoxicity to tumor cells residing within the bone microenvironment by virtue of their preferential deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, we evaluated the effect of Pam-Doxo-NPs against GFP-labeled K7M2 OS cells grown on HA-coated culture plates, in which the numbers of viable K7M2 OS cells were directly proportional to GFP fluorescent intensities (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 7 d of growth, GFP-labeled K7M2 OS cells exhibited the greatest reduction in cell numbers following a 15-min pulse exposure to Pam-Doxo-NPs (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were consistent with the preferential adherence of Pam-Doxo-NPs to HA and consequent prolonged exposure of K7M2 cells to cytotoxic effects of Doxo in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_OS_Targeting_and_Efficacy_of_Pam-Doxo-NPs_in_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the in vivo targeting capability of Pam-NPs for osteotropic solid tumors like OS, we next labeled Pam-NPs and nontargeted NPs with 64Cu (denoted as Pam-64Cu-NP and 64Cu-NP, respectively; Fig S5A), assessed 64Cu labeling stability of NPs in serum as a function of time (Fig S5C), and monitored their biodistribution after i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration into BALB/c mice bearing firefly luciferase transfected K7M3 OS tumors with noninvasive micropositron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (micro-PET/CT) imaging (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, the right hind leg was inoculated with K7M3 cells whereas the normal contralateral left hind leg served as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Established growth of K7M3 cells within the proximal tibial bone was confirmed using a bioluminescence imaging (BLI) taken at 14 d postinoculation of the K7M3 cells (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, merged CT and PET images demonstrated noticeable radioactivity in the tumor-bearing right hind leg of a representative mouse injected with Pam-64Cu-NP (2.8% injected dose per gram of tissue (%I.D.g1) as early as 1 h postinjection (p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3B), whereas in comparison the radioactivity detected in the normal contralateral left hind leg was 50% less (1.6%I.D.g1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased radioactivity detected in the tumor-bearing leg was maintained for as long as 24 h p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2.6%I.D.g1, Fig 3B), suggesting the Pam-64Cu-NPs were preferentially retained in the osteolytic tumor microenvironment, presumably due to the high binding affinity with inorganic bone matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the accumulation of nontargeted 64Cu-NPs was much lower than that of Pam-64Cu-NP (1.7 versus 2.8%I.D.g1 1 h p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and 1.9 versus 2.6%I.D.g1 24 h p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and showed no difference between tumor-bearing right hind legs (1.9%I.D.g1) and normal contralateral left hind legs (1.6%I.D.g1) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional reconstructed imaging and movies also provide evidence for the significantly enhanced accumulation of Pam-64Cu- NPs in the right leg at 5 h p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compared with 64Cu-NPs (Fig 3C and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were further confirmed by ex vivo measurement of radioactivity 24 h p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in surgically resected tumor-bearing right hind legs with a gamma counter (2.6 and 1.9%I.D.g1 for Pam-64Cu-NPs and 64Cu-NPs, respectively) (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of Pam-64Cu-NPs and 64Cu-NPs in the blood and other organs were also assessed by gamma counter and demonstrated comparable soft tissue biodistribution profiles in other organs (Fig S5D), although Pam-64Cu-NPs accumulated to a greater extent within reticuloendothelial organs than nontargeted 64Cu-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the preferential accumulation of Pam-NPs to focal regions of skeletal osteolysis demonstrated by micro-PET/CT images, we reasoned that improved antitumor activity could be achieved with Pam-NPs loaded with Doxo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this therapeutic potential, we evaluated the efficacy of Pam-Doxo-NPs using the K7M3 OS model and a defined treatment protocol (Fig 4A), in which in vivo tumor burden was demonstrated to be well correlated with the bioluminescent signal intensity (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen days following K7M3 inoculation, mice were imaged and equally distributed based upon bioluminescent intensities into four i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  therapeutic groups (n = 6), being saline, Pam functionalized blank vehicles (Pam-NPs), Doxo-NPs, and Pam-Doxo-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following randomization, mice received i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  therapy once weekly for two consecutive weeks and were then monitored for an additional week before they were killed (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, mice treated with Pam-Doxo-NPs achieved the greatest delay in localized tumor growth in comparison with all other treatment groups (Fig 4 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, although Pam-NPs and Doxo-NPs marginally slowed primary tumor growth in comparison with saline-treated mice, only mice receiving Pam-Doxo-NPs had the possibility of achieving macroscopic tumor volume regression, whereas all mice receiving other therapies (saline, Pam-NPs, or Doxo-NPs) uniformly demonstrated tumor progression between days 14 and 28 of study (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median fold increase of bioluminescent signal from day 14 (pretreatment) following two consecutively weekly treatments of i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pam-Doxo-NPs was 1.8-fold, whereas treatment with saline, Pam-NPs, or Doxo-NPs produced markedly higher median fold increases of bioluminescent signal (13.9-, 4.6-, and 4.5-fold, respectively; Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to bioluminescent signal changes, histologic analysis of tumor surface area postmortem also supported increase anticancer activities exerted by Pam-Doxo-NPs above other treatment groups (Fig 4 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mice treated with Pam-Doxo-NPs, the median tumor surface area was 2.4 × 104 µm2 (P less_than 0.05, compared with saline control); however, no difference in tumor surface area was identified among the remaining three treatment groups (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the enhanced efficacy achieved by Pam-Doxo-NPs, the extent and degree of bone destruction resultant from localized OS progression was evaluated by micro-CT. As illustrated in Fig 4E, severe pathologic osteolysis associated with OS progression could be readily identified within the right proximal tibias of tumor-bearing mice receiving saline, Pam-NPs, and, to a lesser extent, Doxo-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, malignant osteolysis was attenuated in mice receiving Pam-Doxo-NPs and resulted in a trend toward increased percentage of bone volume (leg with K7M3 tumor/normal leg × 100%) (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively the observations of reduced bioluminescent signal change and tumor surface area, as well as the trend toward preserved bone volume, provide strong support for increased antitumor efficacy of Pam-Doxo-NPs compared with their nontargeted counterparts in an orthotopic murine model of OS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clinical_Evaluation_of_OS_Tumor_Targeting_and_Efficacy_of_Pam-Doxo-NPs_in_Dogs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the promising results in the preclinical murine models, we sought to further test the translational application of Pam-NPs in a large mammalian model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these purposes, we chose to use dogs that naturally and spontaneously develop appendicular OS to serve as a physiologically relevant model of focal malignant osteolysis similar to what occurs in human cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of a phase I clinical trial in pet dogs diagnosed with OS, we studied the dynamic in vivo biodistribution profile of i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administered Pam-NPs labeled with 99mTc in dogs (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infusion, Pam-NPs labeled with 99mTc were rapidly distributed to all major visceral organs including the heart, kidney, spleen, and liver, with eventual elimination into the urinary bladder (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, localization and accumulation of 99mTc-labeled Pam-NPs was observed within the localized bone tumor microenvironment, indicating that Pam surface modification can quickly target areas of malignant osteolysis in vivo within 12 h after administration (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 99mTc activity preferentially intensified in a time-dependent manner, suggesting the dynamic concentration and accumulation of Pam-NPs within the bone tumor microenvironment (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the detection of 99mTc radioactivity by gamma camera in pet dogs with OS was indeed 99mTc-labeled Pam-NPs and not simply free 99mTc as a consequence of spontaneous dissociation from Pam-NPs in vivo, we assessed the radiochemical purity of 99mTc labeled Pam-NPs immediately before i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infusion and also the 99mTc signal that accumulated in the bladder (urine) 2 h postinfusion (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiochemical purities of 99mTc-labeled Pam-NPs immediately before i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infusion and 2 h postinfusion found within the urine were greater than 95%, providing evidence that the detected 99mTc radioactivity in pet dogs with OS was indeed associated with 99mTc-labeled Pam-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon confirming the osteotropic homing properties of Pam-NPs in dogs with OS, we next sought to explore the tolerability and anticancer activities of Pam-Doxo-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a rapid dose-escalation protocol (Fig 6A), nine pet dogs with OS were treated with a single i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infusion of Pam-Doxo-NPs, with each subsequent pet dog recruited for study progressively receiving a greater dosage of Doxo equivalent (0180 mg/m2 dose equivalent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infusion, pet dogs were monitored for hematologic and biochemical toxicity weekly for 3 wk and then underwent amputation of the diseased limb to allow for histologic assessment of anticancer activity (percent tumor necrosis) within the primary OS lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at the highest Doxo dosage equivalent evaluated (180 mg/m2), Pam-Doxo-NPs were safe and did not cause any hematologic, renal, or persistent hepatic toxicity (Fig 6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two dogs, mild to moderate elevations in liver transaminases were identified 1 wk following Pam-Doxo-NP administration but trended toward normalization upon subsequent reevaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to hematologic and biochemical tolerability of Pam-Doxo-NP, no evidence of cardiotoxicity was identified in any dog as determined by circulating cardiac troponin-I concentrations (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Pam-Doxo-NPs exerted moderate anticancer activity as determined by percent tumor necrosis, which was correlated (r2 = 0.61, P = 0.04) with three factors that dictated the concentrations of Doxo achieved within the bone tumor microenvironment: (i) total dosage of Doxo, (ii) magnitude of 99mTc-labeled Pam-Doxo-NPs accumulation within the tumor site, and (iii) overall bone tumor volume of distribution (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The past several decades have witnessed the explosive development of nanomedicine, and the combination of nanotechnology and medicine has brought great promise for the improved treatment of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with conventional chemotherapy, the use of NPs to administer therapeutic agents to tumor tissues could potentially increase targeted drug delivery to tumor cells and the associated microenvironment while reducing the likelihood of adverse side effects, and thus enhancing therapeutic indices (16, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these potential advantages, the clinical maturation of nanomedicine from bench to bed has proved very difficult, with fewer than five agents being approved for the treatment of cancer patients (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One barrier toward the translation of nanomedicine discoveries into medical breakthroughs is the difficulty in identifying optimal physicochemical properties of NPs that will predictably and consistently prolong the in vivo circulation, facilitate intratumoral accumulation, and release drugs in a controlled manner yet simultaneously possess properties that are robustly biocompatible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By uniquely integrating the controlled ROP into the formulation of NPs as described in the present investigation we demonstrated the feasibility of facile large-scale production (up to gram) of highly biocompatible NPs with well-controlled properties of distinct size, narrow size distributions, high drug loading, and sustained drug release profiles (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the conventional encapsulation method, this strategy allows for nearly 100% drug incorporation efficiency, and thus precisely controlled drug loadings, only by adjusting monomer/initiator (LA/Doxo) ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated the developed NPs could be maintained stably as a solid formulation with absolutely no aggregation after reconstitution, a property that can be beneficial for large-scale translational applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By taking advantage of the EPR effect, NPs can extravasate through the leaky blood vasculature, accumulate in the tumor tissues, and release their payload sustainably (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This passive targeting process is largely dependent on the physicochemical properties of NPs (38), and the addition of active targeting strategies is expected to improve localized drug delivery (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we sought to actively target NPs to regions of malignant bone resorption through the use of Pam, a potent aminobisphosphonate used for the treatment of diverse skeletal pathologies (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone microenvironment serves as a fertile soil for the dissemination of various solid cancers known as skeletal metastases (41, 42) and serves as the developmental origin for primary bone tumors such as OS and Ewings sarcoma (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of osteotropic cancer progression, a large majority of cancer patients afflicted with focal or multifocal skeletal tumors will endure excruciating pain and suffering consequent to uncontrolled malignant bone resorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, there is clinical justification for developing targeted treatment strategies aimed at improving the management of malignant osteolytic syndromes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we successfully demonstrated Pam surface-modified PLA NPs could significantly improve their accumulation and retention within the diseased bone tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some data derived from our study suggested increased reticuloendothelial cell uptake of Pam surface modified PLA NPs, which could be the result of Pam serving as a phosphoantigen, no overt toxicities were associated with this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, by virtue of preferential anatomic targeting to the bone microenvironment, Pam-Doxo-NPs were capable of minimizing systemic off-target toxicities and concurrently enhancing localized antitumor activities in not only a preclinical murine tumor model but also in a clinically relevant, large mammalian tumor model, pet dogs with OS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OS is the most common primary bone tumor diagnosed in pediatric patients and pet dogs, and clinical symptomology includes pain and lameness consequent to localized tumor growth and secondary bone destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical presentation, biologic behavior, and genetics of OS are strongly conserved between humans and pet dogs (26, 28, 29, 44), and canine OS has emerged as a powerful comparative tumor model for guiding and expediting the drug development pathway for pediatric OS patients (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the critical factors that contribute to the future clinical translation of nanomedicine is the experimental models used for evaluating the safety and efficiency of targeted NP treatment strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uniquely, in our investigation we not only have incorporated the use of a traditional preclinical murine tumor model of focal bone cancer but also have extended our studies into pet dogs with OS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This population of pet dogs, which develop cancer spontaneously, as do human beings, can serve as a rich and valuable scientific resource for studying osteotropic NP therapies given the comparable skeletal size, metabolism, and physiology shared between pet dogs and people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The successful safety and anticancer activities reported in the current study in not only murine but also canine model systems are highly significant and provide foundational evidence for the translational impact of the work described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of noteworthy mention was the exceptional biocompatibility of our NPs; the absolute quantities of NPs infused i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into pet dogs was in the gram scale range (up to 2 g), which was over three orders of magnitude greater than those administered to experimental mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remarkable safety profile of our reported NP formulation, coupled with its demonstrated activity, provides powerful impetus for its continued development as a novel adjuvant treatment for improving the management of focal and multifocal malignant osteolysis encountered in human cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Detailed materials and methods are provided SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs with spontaneously occurring appendicular OS were recruited to participate in the present investigational trial conducted at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital to evaluate the biodistribution, safety, and anticancer activity of Pam-Doxo-NP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pet owners were informed of all treatment options available for their pet dogs and required to sign client consent forms before their dogs were treated with Pam-Doxo-NP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Illinois IACUC of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_and_Characterization_of_Pam-Doxo-NPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DoxoPLA conjugates were synthesized with feeding ratio of lactide/Doxo = 10/1 by following similar procedures as published (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLA-PEG-Pam conjugate was synthesized by covalently conjugating Pam to PLA-PEG5k-COOH polymer via stable amide bond (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred-microliter DMF solution of DoxoPLA (10 mg/mL) was mixed with 100-L DMF solution of mixture of PLA-PEG5k (10 mg/mL)/PLA-PEG5k-Pam conjugate (10 mg/mL) at varying ratios and then added dropwise to rapidly stirred nanopure water (4 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Doxo-loaded PLA-PEG-Pam NPs (Pam-Doxo-NPs) with different Pam contents were collected by ultrafiltration [5 min, 3,000 × g, Ultracel membrane with 10,000 nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL); Millipore], washed with water, and then characterized by DLS for particle sizes and size distributions and by HPLC for drug loadings by following the reported procedures (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pam-Doxo-NPs (10%) were chosen for the most in vitro and in vivo studies unless specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_HA_Binding_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the binding kinetics of HA with NPs, 50 µg/mL Pam-Cy5-NPs or Cy5-NPs in 20-mL deionized (DI) water containing HA (0.75 mg/mL) was continuously stirred at 550 rpm at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At different time points, an aliquot of 200 µL was diluted with 1.0 mL DI water then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove the HA and bound NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NP concentration in the supernatant was quantified by measuring the Cy5 fluorescence intensity (15 min, 30 min, and 1, 2, and 4 h) and calculated by standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound NPs were calculated by subtracting unbound NPs from the total NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the dose-dependent binding, the indicated concentrations of NPs were incubated in 1-mL DI water containing HA (0.75 mg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspensions were continuously vortexed at 37 °C for 2 h and the bounded NPs were calculated following the same procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an inhibition study, HA (3 mg/mL) was suspended in PBS with/without free Pam (1 mg/mL) at 37 °C for 24 h. To measure the inhibition effect of free Pam on Pam-Cy5-NPs binding with HA crystals, the Cy5-NPs and Pam-Cy5-NPs solutions (40 µg/mL) were incubated in PBS (2 mL) containing HA (0.75 mg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspensions were stirred at 37 °C for 2 h. An aliquot of 300 µL was diluted with 900 µL PBS and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove HA crystals and bound NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NP concentration in the supernatant was quantified by measuring the Cy5 fluorescence intensity and calculated by standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For direct visualization of NPs binding with HA crystals, 50 µg/mL Pam-Cy5-NPs or Cy5-NPs in 10 mL DI water containing HA (0.75 mg/mL) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with continuous vortexing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were collected and washed with DI water twice, mounted on glass slides, and evaluated using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL fluorescence microscope equipped with a 10× objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Cytotoxicity_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether prolonged retention of NPs on HA matrix could affect cytotoxicity, K7M2 transfected with GFP, provided by Chand Khanna, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, were seeded in BD Biocoat Osteologic 24-well plates at 10,000 cells per 3 mL of complete media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon K7M2 adhesion, cells were exposed to a 15-min pulse of saline (control), Pam-NP, Doxo-NP, or Pam-Doxo-NP with gentle rocking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following treatment exposure, residual media was removed and replaced with fresh complete media, and K7M2 GPF cells were allowed to grow for an additional 7 d before being lysed and resultant supernatant fluorescent intensities determined with a fluorometric plate reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The tumor model was established in 8-wk-old female BALB/c mice by injection of 1 × 106 of firefly luciferase transfected murine OS K7M3 cells, provided by Su Young Kim, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, suspended in 10 µL HBSS into the right proximal tibia using an insulin syringe with ½-inch, 29-gauge, nondetachable needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor progression was evaluated using a BLI system (Stanford Photonics) with a dual microchannel plate intensified CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was intraperitoneally injected with a d-luciferin potassium salt solution (0.15 g/kg body weight) 3 min before imaging and then anesthetized with a constant flow of isoflurane-containing oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gray-scale image of the mouse was first recorded with dimmed light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photon emission was then integrated for 10 s using the imaging software Piper Control (Stanford Photonics) and visualized in pseudocolor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To localize bioluminescent signals that indicated luciferase-engineered K7M3 tumors, gray-scale images of mouse body and bioluminescent signals of primary tumors were merged using Image J (NIH) and Photoshop Elements (Adobe Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micro-PET_CT_Imaging_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Female BALB/c mice were inoculated with K7M3-luciferase murine OS cells and primary tumors were allowed to develop over the course of 21 d. Mice were divided into two groups (n = 4) and were treated with Pam-64Cu-NPs or 64Cu-NPs at a dose of 75 µCi i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were placed on the micro-CT imaging bed and kept anesthetized with a constant isoflurane flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dynamic PET scan was acquired for 1 h (60-min acquisition time, reconstructed as 60 frames at 60 s per frame).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The micro-CT scan (80 keV/500 µA X-rays energy, 360 projections, 360°, 75-µm pixel size) was used for determining the anatomical localization of the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Static micro-PET scans were acquired at two selected time points (5 and 24 h p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  together with micro-CT scans for anatomical coregistration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained micro-PET and micro-CT images were constructed using ordered subset expectation maximization and cone-beam algorithms with existing commercial software (Inveon Acquisition Workspace and Cobra Exxim, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micro-PET images were processed using 3D median filtering and fused with micro-CT images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the radioactivity of 64Cu in the tumors, complex irregular volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn on the micro-CT images and registered with micro-PET images to determine mean counts in each VOI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiotracer activity from each VOI was normalized by injected dose and expressed at percent of the decay-corrected injected activity per cubic centimeter of tissue, which can be approximated as percentage % I.D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  g1 assuming the density of the tissue is around 1g/cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial total injected activity was determined by dose calibrator before injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Female BALB/c mice bearing K7M3-luciferase murine OS cells were allowed to develop primary bone tumors over 21 d and then were divided into two groups (n = 4), minimizing the weight differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two groups of mice were treated with Pam-64Cu-NPs or 64Cu-NPs at a dose of 75 µCi i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed 24 h p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blood and major organs (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, intestine, and bladder) as well as K7M3 tumors containing right leg and normal left leg were collected, weighed, and measured for radioactivity (64Cu) with a gamma counter (Wizard2; PerkinElmer) using an appropriate energy window centered at photo peak of 511 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw counts were corrected for background, decay, and weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrected counts were converted to microcurie per gram of tissue with a previously determined calibration curve by counting the 64Cu standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity in blood and each collected tissue sample was calculated as percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (% I.D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  g1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this calculation, the tissue radioactivity was corrected for the 64Cu decay [T(1/2) = 12.7 h] to the time of gamma-well counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Anticancer_Efficacy_Evaluation_Using_Murine_Orthotropic_OS_Tumor_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Female BALB/c mice inoculated with K7M3-luciferase murine OS cells were divided into four equivalent groups (n = 7) based upon primary tumor burden (BLI) and body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two groups of mice were treated with Pam-Doxo-NPs and Doxo-NPs at a dose of 50 mg/kg (Doxo equivalent) i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for two consecutive treatments 1 wk apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two groups of mice were treated with blank NPs (no Doxo) and saline as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor progression was evaluated using a BLI system (Stanford Photonics) as mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the study, mice were killed by CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure complete collection off the right tibia and fibula, the distal femur and talus were incubated in the dissected samples, as well as the surrounding soft tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were placed in 10% (vol/vol) formalin and scanned with micro-CT (80 keV/500 µA X-rays energy, 360 projections, 360°, 75-µm pixel size) to determine the bone destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h in 10% (vol/vol) formalin, hind limbs were placed in 10% (wt/wt) EDTA for 7 d to decalcify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tissues was processed into paraffin and stained with H&E and then evaluated by an experienced pathologist and tumor surface area was quantified by ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Biodistribution__Biocompatibility__and_Anticancer_Efficacy_Evaluation_Using_Spontaneous_Canine_OS_Tumor_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treatment naïve dogs with confirmed appendicular OS were recruited to participate in a rapid dose-escalation study evaluating the biodistribution, biocompatibility, and anticancer activities of Pam-Doxo-NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For biodistribution studies, Pam-Doxo-NPs were labeled with 99mTc using a previously reported method (47) and subsequently infused i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as a 30-min constant-rate infusion into dogs sedated with intramuscular butorphanol and medetomidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of infusing 99mTc-labeled Pam-Doxo-NPs, sequential images were acquired every second for 180 s, every 5 min for 1 h, and at 2 h postinfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies determining the radiochemical purity of 99mTc-labeled Pam-Doxo-NPs pre- and postinfusion (urine) were performed using a previously described protocol (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon the completion of infusion, the biocompatibilities of Pam-Doxo-NPs in treated pet dogs were characterized weekly for three consecutive weeks through the conductance of serial physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistry profiles, and cardiac troponin concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct anticancer activities of Pam-Doxo-NPs were evaluated in pet dogs by amputating the OS-affected leg with consequent percent tumor necrosis assessment by histopathologic methods (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the bone and associated tumor were sectioned longitudinally either proximal to distal or lateral to medial dependent on the orientation of the mass lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were fixed in formalin for 2448 h followed by decalcification in an EDTA/HCL decalcifying solution (Richard Allen Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following decalcification, transverse sections of the longitudinal section were made to allow for placement into large tissue cassettes and sectioning onto glass slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were processed with an extended protocol, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4 m, and stained with H&E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All slides (microscopic specimens), which cumulatively represent the entire plane in which the gross specimen was sectioned, were scanned in their entirety using an AxioCam HRc Carl Zeiss camera coupled to a Carl Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a mechanical stage and using Carl Zeiss KS 400 analysis software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanned images were viewed in Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems) to allow image analysis of tumor necrosis, and the original glass slides of the corresponding section were simultaneously viewed via light microscopy (Olympus BX41), providing detailed assessment of regions isolated on the digitally scanned images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Adobe Photoshop software and the scanned images, the total tumor area and regions of tumor necrosis were outlined in two different outlining colors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions outlined on the images were analyzed with the Carl Zeiss KS 400 image analysis software to quantitate total tumor area and the area of tumor necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, the overall total tumor area and total area of tumor necrosis for a given tumor were determined by adding the results (values) of each respective section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent necrosis for individual tumors was calculated as total area of necrosis/total tumor area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
