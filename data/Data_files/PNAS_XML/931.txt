Neurobiology of culturally common maternal responses to infant cry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We undertook an interdisciplinary exploration that unites evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and developmental cultural psychology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on extensive and detailed behavioral analyses of 684 new mothers in 11 countries and complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses of brain responses in 43 first-time new US mothers to their own infants cries, 44 experienced Chinese mothers to infant cries and control emotional sounds, and 12 Italian mothers and nonmothers to generic infant cries, we identified specific behavior repertoires and specific corresponding activated brain regions in human caregivers that constitute primary responses to infant distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study set will appeal to scientific and general audiences because it elucidates the foundations of core parenting practices in response to infant vocal distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This report coordinates assessments of five types of behavioral responses in new mothers to their own infants cries with neurobiological responses in new mothers to their own infants cries and in experienced mothers and inexperienced nonmothers to infant cries and other emotional and control sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 684 new primipara mothers in 11 countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, France, Kenya, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United States) preferentially responded to their infants vocalizing distress by picking up and holding and by talking to their infants, as opposed to displaying affection, distracting, or nurturing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses of brain responses to their own infants cries in 43 new primipara US mothers revealed enhanced activity in concordant brain territories linked to the intention to move and to speak, to process auditory stimulation, and to caregive [supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal regions, superior temporal regions, midbrain, and striatum].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, fMRI brain responses to infant cries in 50 Chinese and Italian mothers replicated, extended, and, through parcellation, refined the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains of inexperienced nonmothers activated differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culturally common responses to own infant cry coupled with corresponding fMRI findings to own infant and to generic infant cries identified specific, common, and automatic caregiving reactions in mothers to infant vocal expressions of distress and point to their putative neurobiological bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate behaviors embedded in the nervous systems of human caregivers lie at the intersection of evolutionary biology and developmental cultural psychology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Behavioral and fMRI responses to human infant cries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Five types of maternal contingent responses to infant vocal distress in 11 countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Display affection: Physical behaviors (kissing) or verbal statements (I love you).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distract: Encouraging the infants attention to a property, object, or event in the environment physically or verbally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nurture: Feeding, burping, wiping the infants face or hands, or diapering the infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pick up and hold: Lifting and supporting some or all of the infants weight with the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Talk: Vocalizing directed toward the infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference lines for statistical significance are drawn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for talk, which has an absolute minimum of 1, abscissae mark the absolute minima for transformed ORs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Means and 97.5% CIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) US mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphical representation of brain regions resulting from the contrast own-infant cry vs. control noise in the whole group of new mothers at 3.5 mo postpartum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of the figure refers to the right hemisphere, the bottom to left hemisphere, the left to lateral views, and the right to midsagittal views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Chinese mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphical representation of brain regions resulting from the contrast infant cry vs. control noise in the whole group of mothers at 7 mo postpartum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of the figure refers to the right hemisphere, the bottom to the left hemisphere, the left to lateral views, and the right to midsagittal views.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Chinese mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sagittal brain views of pre-SMA and SMA-proper activation peaks (white squares) in the following contrasts (and coordinates): (a) IC vs. NCS (x = 3, y = 4, z = 64), (b) IB vs. NCS (x = 6, y = 1, z = 61), (c) AC vs. NCS (x = 6, y = 5, z = 58), and (d) IL vs. NCS (x = 6, y = 5, z = 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical anterior commissure (VAC) line (y = 0) is indicated in yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-Cultural_Behavioral_Observation_of_Infants_and_Mothers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers in all countries showed within-country variation in all five response types but also demonstrated regular differences across response types (Fig 1A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, combining countries, mothers were significantly unlikely to respond to infant distress by displaying affection, by distracting, and by nurturing, but mothers were significantly likely to respond to infant distress by picking up and holding and by talking to their infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some countries with smaller sample sizes (n less_than 30) of usable data (at least five infant distress vocalizations) did not reach significance for every behavior (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in every country, average odds ratios (ORs) for mothers affection, distraction, and nurturance in response to their infants vocal distress were below the transformed equivalent of 1, indicating that these responsive behaviors were unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, average ORs for mothers to pick up and hold their infants and to talk to their infants in response to their infants vocal distress were at or above 1 or its transformed equivalent, indicating that these responsive behaviors were likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking across countries at maternal responses to infant vocal distress revealed culturally common parenting practices (i.e., virtually no country differences in ORs) (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers in 11 different countries around the world behaved with noteworthy consistency in promptly responding to their own infants vocal distress by picking up and holding their infants and by talking to their infants as two likely contingent responses, and displaying affection, distraction, and nurturance as three unlikely contingent responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, infant cry is the earliest preverbal form of communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their high biological relevance, infant-related stimuli capture adult attention and trigger physiological responses that prepare for action and speech (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary theories posit that parent responsiveness to infants plays a crucial role in child survival and so enhances reproductive success (24, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evolutionary theorizing also appeals to the species-common genome, the shared biological heritage of some psychological processes presupposes their generality (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore reasoned that, because of their cross-cultural prevalence and significance for species survival, behaviorally common responses to infant cry may be subserved by neurobiological mechanisms embedded in mothers nervous systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fMRI_Experiments_of_Mothers__Brain_Responses_to_Infant_Cry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To uncover potential neurobiological underpinnings of specific maternal responses involving action and speech, we pursued a direct approach through fMRI in two main experiments, one of new primipara mothers brain responses to their own infants cry during the early postpartum period, and a second of more experienced mothers brain responses to infant cries in contrast to other infant and adult emotional and control sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (In a third subsidiary fMRI experiment presented in Supporting Information, we examined experienced mothers and nonmothers responses to generic infant cries.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fMRI allowed us to visualize locations of changes in brain metabolic activity that were correlated to the occurrence of stimuli linked to a young infants vocal distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our behavioral data, we hypothesized that infant cry (vs. other emotional and control sounds) would activate (i) the medial superior frontal gyrus, which includes the supplementary motor area (SMA) (59, 60) [known to be associated with two sets of functions especially relevant here: (a) preparing for movement and the conscious intention to move (61, 62), imagining to grasp (63), and experiencing an urge to move (64) and (b) as the starting mechanism of speech involved in preparing a verbal utterance and initiating vocal tract movement (6569)]; (ii) the bilateral inferior prefrontal cortices (Brocas areas) associated with social speech processing (70); and (iii) the superior temporal gyri (STG) associated with processing complex sounds (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) We also hypothesized involvement of midbrain and striatum, known to play critical roles in maternal caregiving (7274).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test these hypotheses about brain areas that would substantiate and presumably underlie universal observations from the cross-cultural behavioral observations, and to evaluate their generality, we studied mothers (and nonmothers) in three distinct cultures: the United States, China, and Italy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For details about the participants, methods, and results of all fMRI experiments, see Supporting Information.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results with respect to the three main hypotheses are reported here (supplementary results for hypothesis iv are reported in Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some characteristics of children likely affect parents everywhere, perhaps in similar ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the end of the first trimester, fetuses are felt to move in utero (quickening) (90), a significant marker in the life of the child and in the lives and psyches of parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soon after birth, physiognomic features of the infant (a large head dominated by a disproportionately large forehead, widely spaced sizable eyes, a small snub nose, an exaggeratedly round face, and a small chin) (9193) prompt adults to express nurturance and solicitude (9496).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, many adult responses to infants are culturally common, such as the special vocal register of child-directed speech (97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant cries and maternal responses to them appear to function in the same way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distress vocalizations emitted when infants are separated from their mothers, hungry, or physically ill at ease (3, 15, 17, 98100) are similar in many mammals, including humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant cries interrupt cognition (101).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hearing infant cries, mothers (or other caregivers) promptly move to retrieve or establish contact and communication with offspring (2, 3, 5, 15, 17) and to nourish or defend them against predators (102104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, caregivers in different species even display strong emotional and physiological responses to cries of nonoffspring (3, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, deer (Odocoileus hemionus and Odocoileus virginianus) mothers will approach a speaker playing distress vocalizations of infant marmots (Marmota flaviventris), seals (Neophoca cinerea and Arctocephalus tropicalis), domestic cats (Felis catus), bats (Lasionycteris noctovagans), humans (Homo sapiens), and other mammals as though they were going to assist a fawn in distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Does also emit contact calls when near that speaker, as they do when responding to their own fawns (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimpanzees are the primate species closest to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimpanzee infants emit distress vocalizations rarely and only following physical separation from their mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to their infants distress vocalizations, chimpanzee mothers move to restore physical proximity and retrieve their infants (105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mothers in many species respond to their infants calls by orienting, approaching, retrieving, and vocalizing (106, 107).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In The Expression of the Emotions, Darwin highlighted the significance of infant distress signals (57), and, in detailing attachment theory, Bowlby underscored that crying plays an important part in the earliest phases of social interaction between parent and child (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental caregiving blends tuition and intuition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some aspects of parenting are learned, as through culture, but parents also rely on their instincts in caregiving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long evolutionary history of altricial human infant dependency on requisite adult caregiving suggests that some mechanisms associated with adult attentiveness and responsiveness to infants ought to be automatic and deeply ingrained in caregivers nervous systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, parents have specific implicit cognitive (108), autonomic (109, 110), and CNS (111) reactions to human infant faces that differ from their responses to faces of human adults and faces of infrahuman mammal infants and adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expected that some types of maternal responsiveness to infant cry would be common across cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with this expectation, we explored contingencies between their own infants vocal distress and maternal affection, distraction, nurturance, movement/contact, and speech, along with the neurobiological bases of those responses, in a wide variety of societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly 700 motherinfant dyads in nearly a dozen countries were observed in situ and closely analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across these social groups, new mothers preferentially and systematically responded to their infants vocal distress by picking up and holding and by speaking to their infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding fMRI results confirmed that new mothers, hearing their own infants distress, and more experienced mothers, hearing infant cries, generally activate the SMA associated with the intention to move and speak, inferior frontal regions involved in the production of speech, and superior temporal regions linked to processing auditory stimuli (6163, 78, 111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These automatic responses in brain and behavior appear to occur in advance of conscious awareness, as the brain evolved adaptive circuits in the service of reproductive success (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMA is associated with the programming, generation, and control of relevant motor action and speech sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, the neurobiological findings obtained for mothers but not for nonmothers (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results accord with others in the extant literature: Mothers exhibit more pronounced neural responses in brain areas involved in emotional processing in response to infant cry than do nonmothers (75, 112, 113), suggesting that mothers may experience the cry as an emotionally important signal which requires their attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result points to rapid plasticity in the maternal brain (29, 74, 114, 115).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With as little as 3 mo postpartum experience, mothers brains become responsive to particular infant facial and vocal stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The behavioral observations study recruited mothers from different parts of the world, but the three imaging experiments recruited mothers only from the United States, China, and Italy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is there evidence that, following the cry of their child, similar brain structures that promote similar responsive behaviors are activated in mothers in still other countries?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging experiments from Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom reveal involvement of the motor cortex in mothers listening to their own infants crying, as well as looking at pictures of their own infants faces or watching video registrations of their own children (112, 116120).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We do not contend that mothers behavioral responses to infant cry differ from their responses to other infant stimuli, but rather that mothers in different cultures preferentially respond to infant cry in certain ways (picking up and talking to their infants) and not other ways (distracting, showing affection, or nurturing) and that their prominent motor and vocal responses are supported by specific matching brain responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the spirit of systems neuroscience, the convergence of behavioral and neurobiological modalities increases the validity of results and the added value of applying both methodologies, here in investigating parent sensitivity to infant cries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That conjunction is reinforced by related independent findings from the emerging neuroscience of parenting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other methodologies [for example, event-related potentials (ERPs)] that address the timing and stages of neural responsiveness to infant cues complement fMRI data focused on neural architecture (121).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Caregiver responsiveness is vital to infant survival and hence continuation of the species, parentinfant bonding, and the wholesome development of the child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been argued that, whether experience-expectant or experience-dependent, hard-wired responses to newborn distress vocalizations exemplify an adaptive speedaccuracy trade-off (121, 122), in which responding to the infant in distress is preferred to delaying action because hesitation increases the risk of the infant suffering harm (123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another evolved function of the human infant cry is to communicate phenotypic quality (fitness) to caregivers (6) because cries signal infant health status (4, 46, 123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, responsiveness to infant distress, and not nondistress, is critical for infants attachment security with parents, and prosocial behavior has long-lasting impact on childrens well-being (3, 124, 125).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studying offspring solicitation vocalizations and caregiver responsiveness contributes to understanding animal communication systems and caregiver investment and also speaks to the etiology, prediction, and prevention of child neglect and abuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caregiver reactions to infant crying are not always benevolent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cries sometimes trigger caregiver maltreatment (126128).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results encourage further research on caregivers who may be at-risk for problematic responsiveness to infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data reported here reveal a propensity to act and to speak in response to infant vocal distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether the action and speech are positive and growth-promoting or negative and harmful may depend on idiosyncratic characteristics of the caregiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using brain imaging, it may be possible to identify caregivers who are unaware or reluctant to disclose such risks (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, depressed mothers compared with nondepressed mothers (129131), and mothers who abuse drugs compared with mothers with no such dependencies (132), show altered brain involvement (subcortical limbic regions, prefrontal cortex including SMA, and superior temporal cortex) and altered behavior in response to negative emotions expressed by their own infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered cerebral activations in specific brain circuits might compromise parental motivation or the implementation of behaviors attuned to the needs of the child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Screening and diagnosis could be combined with early intervention to sensitize parents and to enhance their understanding of the importance and meaning attached to infant cries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a multimodal therapeutic approach could lead to the introduction of an array of tools for parents to respond appropriately to optimize child care and manage negative feelings tantamount to child maltreatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Healthy human mothers are likely to pick up and hold and to speak to their infants in response to their infants cry, and this specific complex of behavioral responsiveness is known to calm infants (133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A survey of more than 180 societies showed that infants cried less when they were responded to in this way (4), and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated the effectiveness of this same response (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps because of their evolutionary advantage, these reactions toward infants are specific and automatic, widespread culturally, and embedded neurobiologically in mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cross-Cultural_Behavioral_Observation_of_Infants_and_Mothers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All study procedures and consent documents were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and mothers provided written informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first recruited, observed, and recorded 1 h of home-based naturalistic motherinfant interactions in 684 dyads in 11 countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, France, Kenya, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only primipara mothers and firstborn singleton healthy awake full-term 5.5-mo-olds participated, with approximately equal numbers of girls and boys in each country sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Detailed sociodemographic information for all participants appears in Table S1.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we carefully operationalized infant cries (distress vocalizations that indicated protest, complaint, anger, or upset and encompassed whining, fretting, fussing, whimpering, and full-blown distress) and five maternal response types (affection, distraction, nurturance, action, and speech) and coded video records of infants and mothers using mutually exclusive and exhaustive schemes to mark all behavior onsets and offsets to the nearest 0.10 s (for details of behavior durations, coding, and reliability see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we analyzed behavioral contingencies between maternal responses and infant cries in terms of odds ratios (ORs) (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separately for each dyad, time units were tallied in two-by-two tables for each behavioral sequence, and ORs were computed for each table (134, 135).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odds ratios indicate the likelihood of mothers responding to infant distress within a 5-s time window of the onset of a cry, with each response type compared with the likelihood of their initiating the same five behaviors outside of those time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This microanalytic strategy allowed us to examine in quantitative detail leadlag sequences of infant crymother response, taking into consideration the timing of their interactions at the level of in-the-moment lived experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fMRI_Experiment_1__New_Mothers_in_the_United_States  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All study procedures and consent documents were approved by the Yale University School of Medicine Human Investigations Committee, and deidentified data were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants provided informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recruited 43 new primipara healthy European American middle-class mothers and their 3.5-mo-olds (56% male).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic stimuli consisted of each mothers own-infant cry and own-infant noise (matched in pattern, intensity, and frequency range to their own infants cry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each own-infant cry varied according to each infants individual characteristics, the own-infant cry and matched control sounds were necessarily unique to each mother.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers underwent two fMRI scanning sessions at 3 tesla in a Siemens Trio full-body scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They heard 10 blocks of stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block of 30 s was composed of own-infant cry or own-infant control sound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging data analyses were performed with BrainVoyager QX version 2.0 (Brain Innovation; www.BrainVoyager.com) (see Supporting Information for preprocessing details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using general linear models (GLMs), we analyzed whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity and contrasted activity during exposure to own-infant cry to activity during exposure to the own-infant control sound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fMRI_Experiment_2__Experienced_Mothers_in_China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All study procedures and consent documents were approved by the East China Normal University Committee on Human Research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants provided written informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recruited 44 healthy Shanghai Chinese middle-class mothers of 7.6-mo-olds (57% male).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic stimuli consisted of infant cries (ICs), infant laughs (ILs), infant babbles (IBs), adult female cries (ACs), and noise control sounds (NCSs) (derived from and matched to ICs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICs and ILs were retrieved from Oxford Vocal (OxVoc) Sounds (136) and public online databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IBs, which can have characteristic sounds of the native language (137139), were collected from native Chinese infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICs, ILs, and IBs came from children in the first year of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers underwent two fMRI scanning sessions at 3 tesla in a Siemens Trio Tim system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They heard 48 blocks of stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block of 15 s consisted of one of the five sounds: IC or IL or IB or AC or NCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging data analyses were performed with BrainVoyager QX version 2.8 (Brain Innovation; www.BrainVoyager.com) (see Supporting Information for preprocessing details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using GLM, we analyzed whole-brain BOLD activity and created one statistical whole-brain map for each of the following contrasts: IC vs. NCS, IL vs. NCS, IB vs. NCS, and AC vs. NCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Cross-Cultural_Behavioral_Observation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers_and_Infants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, 684 families were recruited using methods common to developmental research with infants, including mass mailings, hospital birth notifications, patient lists of medical groups, newspaper birth announcements, and advertisements in newspapers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants weighed 2,500 to 5,000 g at birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S1 for demographic information by country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Argentine motherinfant dyads (n = 99) were recruited from metropolitan Buenos Aires (67% of the sample) and Córdoba Province (33%), an interior rural community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Belgian dyads (n = 100) were recruited from the Ghent (45%) and Antwerp (55%) metropolitan regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brazilian dyads (n = 58) were recruited from metropolitan Rio de Janeiro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cameroonian dyads (n = 29) were Nso, an indigenous group that lives in northwest Cameroon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  French dyads (n = 49) were recruited from Paris and its immediate banlieux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Israeli dyads (n = 30) were recruited from metropolitan Haifa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Italian dyads (n = 92) were recruited from Padua (55%), a northern city, and from the environs of Ruoti (45%), a southern town.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Japanese dyads (n = 49) were recruited from the greater metropolitan Tokyo area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kenyan dyads (n = 26) were Kamba, a Bantu group that lives in eastern Kenya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  South Korean dyads (n = 52) were recruited from the Seoul metropolitan area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dyads from the United States (n = 100) were all European American, recruited from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, Maryland, and Virginia (77%), and from rural West Virginia (23%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample sizes per cultural group were designed so that the ratio of the smallest to largest would not exceed 1:4 (140).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers and infants were video-recorded at home when the infant was awake and alert and the two were alone together, except for one female researcher who was a native of the same culture as the dyad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were awake for virtually the entire observation (mean = 99.84%, SD = 0.01, range = 92 to 100%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted to remain faithful to a principle of ecological validity by focusing on naturalistic interactions between mothers and infants in their most familiar setting (141, 142).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers were instructed that observations were intended to represent the dyads typical routine and behavior and to disregard the researchers presence insofar as possible; the researcher resisted talking to, making eye contact with, or otherwise reacting to the mother or infant while video-recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filming commenced after a conventional period of acclimation to the camera and the presence of the researcher (143, 144).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the conclusion of the home visit, mothers completed a demographic questionnaire originally written in English and translated into the native language of the mother using standard forward- and back-translation procedures by bilingual and bicultural developmental scientists who were natives of the countries studied (145147).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As human infants reach the third month postpartum, motor cortex associations necessary for voluntary control of crying develop, and pitch and duration of cry stabilize, indicating that cry quality conveys information about intrinsic aspects of infant phenotypes (4, 123, 148).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infant cry and each maternal behavior were coded in separate passes through the records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All responsive behaviors of mothers could cooccur (e.g., mothers could talk to the infant while picking up and holding the infant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant base rates of vocal distress were coded in real time from records using a purpose-designed computer program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cry was counted if it lasted at least 3 s and was separated from another cry by at least 2 s. Cry episodes that were separated by less than 2 s were counted as one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maternal behavior was considered a response when it followed the onset of infant vocal distress within 5 s; derivation of this window was based on a review of extensive published work and features of the current dataset, such as durations, gaps between onsets, and visual plots of mother and infant behaviors (149151).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For rationales for the parameters used as well as reliability data for coding, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  152.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coders were first trained to reliability [kappa ()  0.60] on a standard set of records (153, 154); coder reliability was checked every 10 records to guard against coding drift; and intercoder agreement was calculated using at least 10% of each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With three exceptions, reliability for the six codes separately for the 11 countries ranged from 0.60 to 0.98 (86 to 99% agreement), indicating acceptable levels of intercoder reliability (154, 155).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers displays of affection in Belgium ( = 0.57), France ( = 0.47), and Kenya ( = 0.46) had at least 98% agreement between coders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If fewer than five occurrences of infant distress were observed, the value of the OR was regarded as missing for that dyad because there was not a sufficient sample of the behavior from that dyad to draw conclusions about behavioral contingency (134, 135, 156).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coding produced timed event-sequential data, which were then formatted for sequential analysis using the Sequential Data Interchange Standard (134, 156).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential analysis is applied to elucidate temporal patterns in sequentially recorded events, describes dynamic patterns of interaction in real time, and explains the behavior of each interactant by evaluating contingency between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five sequential variables occurring within a 5-s time window dependent on the onset of infant vocal distress for mother display affection, distract, nurture, pick up and hold, and talk were computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the Generalized Sequential Querier program (GSEQ) version 5.1.09 (www2.gsu.edu/psyrab/gseq/) to conduct simple and sequential statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-sample t tests determined whether pairs of behaviors were significantly contingent within countries, and analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) determined cultural differences in the odds of responding to infant cries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Post hoc power analyses were computed to determine whether the sample size of infants who cried at least five times was adequate to detect medium effects (f = 0.25) with  = 0.05 in single-sample t tests within countries and ANCOVAs across countries (157).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-sample t tests were adequately powered (power  0.80) for all countries except Brazil (power = 0.70), Cameroon (power = 0.67), Israel (power = 0.78), and Kenya (power = 0.55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ANCOVAs with three covariates across 11 countries had adequate power to detect medium (power = 0.95) and large (power = 0.99) effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, when judging country moderation of contingency, we gave more weight to the ANCOVAs across countries than the individual country t tests, especially for Brazil, Cameroon, Israel, and Kenya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preliminary_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before data analysis, univariate and multivariate distributions of the dependent variables and potential covariates (i.e., child age and mother age and education) were examined for normality, homogeneity of variance, outliers, and influential cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORs for mother response to infant vocal distress with affection, distraction, nurturance, and speech were log-transformed (158).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there were some odds of 0 and the log of 0 is undefined, a constant of 0.10 was added before the transformation so that the minimum transformed value was 1 and the value corresponding to an untransformed OR of 1 was log10(1.10) = 0.041393.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the natural log is often used to transform ORs, we used the common log10 because it has the same distribution as the natural log and is easier to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR for mother picks up and holds, given infant vocal distress, was not transformed because no transformation would improve its distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we followed parametric analyses with nonparametric analyses for this variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were conducted on transformed variables, excluding outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outliers were identified by exploring residuals, box plots, and Cooks distance of transformed variables in least squares models by country; one outlier was identified and excluded for display affection, pick up and hold, and talk in response to infant distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary analyses indicated few systematic infant gender differences; therefore, gender was excluded from the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ANCOVAs, controlling for infant age and maternal age and education (if significantly associated with the ORs), were performed to investigate cultural group differences in mothers responses to infant distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main effect of cultural group was nonsignificant in all tests: (i) display affection toward the infant given infant vocal distress, F(10, 374) = 1.48, P = 0.14, 2p = 0.04; (ii) distraction, F(10, 383) = 0.79, P = 0.64, 2p = 0.02; (iii) nurturance, F(10, 366) = 1.23, P = 0.27, 2p = 0.03; (iv) pick up and hold, F(10, 383) = 1.26, P = 0.25, 2p = 0.03 [however, the KruskalWallis test was significant, 2(10) = 19.92, P = 0.030, and pairwise tests indicated that the contingency between infant distress vocalization and pick up and hold the infant was stronger in South Korea than in Belgium, but ORs were above 1.00 in all samples, suggesting that this difference was only one of degree]; and (v) speech, F(10, 380) = 0.37, P = 0.96, 2p = 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of cultural differences in maternal responses to infant distress indicates that these behavioral responses are culturally common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


fMRI_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some methods and procedures were common to all three fMRI experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only women participated because, in the behavioral observation, only mothers were observed and because research indicates a sex dimorphism in brain responses to infant cries (112, 159).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants reported no neurological or psychiatric disorders or birth complications, and all were right-handed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants gave written informed consent for voluntary participation following procedures approved for fMRI experiment 1 by the Yale University School of Medicine Human Investigations Committee, for fMRI experiment 2 by the East China Normal University Committee on Human Research, and for fMRI experiment 3 by the Ethical Committee at the University of Trento for Experiments Involving Humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All auditory stimuli were prepared by removing all nontarget cry sounds, such as background conversations, noises, and baby vegetative sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fMRI experiments 1 and 2, control sounds were derived from white noise matched to own-infant or generic infant cry on sound intensity and frequency range and duration and projected onto the sound envelope of the cry; for fMRI experiment 3 the control sound was white noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting comparison sounds controlled for stimulus volume, intensity pattern, and frequency range without sounding anything like an actual infant cry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To focus on activations in large cortical regions, we used a conservative whole-brain threshold for multiple comparisons [for fMRI experiment 1, q(FDR) P less_than 0.01 and, for fMRI experiment 2 and experiment 3, q(FDR) P less_than 0.05] (160).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the threshold for fMRI experiment 1 activation map at 0.01 to reduce the size of activated clusters and thereby improve the interpretation of results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Caveat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings concerning higher brain activities induced by infant cries can only indicate certain mental states and attitudes in women (intention to move and speak, listening) because they are reverse inferences linked to the results (170).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activations of specific brain areas can occur for a variety of reasons, and, because the fMRI findings are not directly linked to the behavioral findings, the fMRI findings are supportive of the cross-cultural findings and guide future fMRI investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
