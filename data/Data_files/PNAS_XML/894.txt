Mistiming of thought and perception predicts delusionality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nature and origin of delusional belief in illnesses like schizophrenia has been an active topic of research for decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet relatively less work has been devoted to relating this high-level phenomenon to lower-level perceptual mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider whether an illusory reversal in the perception of when a prediction and observation occur in time predicts the presence of delusion-like ideation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find evidence for such a relationship, suggesting that specific perceptual deficits in how people experience the timing of their thoughts might be a contributor to delusionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detecting these perceptual abnormalities early on may therefore prove fruitful for understanding, diagnosing, and treating certain forms of mental illness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The timing of thoughts and perceptions plays an essential role in belief formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as people can experience in-the-moment perceptual illusions, however, they can also be deceived about how events unfold in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we consider how a particular type of temporal distortion, in which the apparent future influences earlier events in conscious awareness, might affect peoples most fundamental beliefs about themselves and the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Making use of a task that has been shown to elicit such reversals in the temporal experience of prediction and observation, we find that people who are more prone to think that they predicted an event that they actually already observed are also more likely to report holding delusion-like beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this relationship appears to be specific to how people experience prediction and is not explained by domain-general deficits in temporal discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may help uncover low-level perceptual mechanisms underlying delusional belief or schizotypy more broadly and may ultimately prove useful as a tool for identifying those at risk for psychotic illness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants completed a prediction task and a temporal discrimination task in counterbalanced order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Procedure for prediction task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fixation, five squares were presented in random locations on the screen, and participants were tasked with predicting which one would light up red before the target was revealed after a variable delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants then indicated whether they had predicted the target (y), had predicted a different square (n), or did not have time to complete a prediction before the target appeared (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Procedure for temporal discrimination task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fixation, five squares were presented in random locations on the screen, and two events followed: the screen blinked, and one of the squares flashed red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The event that occurred first was randomized, and the delay between the two events was varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants indicated whether they thought the red flash (r) or blink (b) occurred first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postdiction in the prediction taskthinking that you made an unbiased prediction that was actually biased by the future event of a square turning redwas assessed by exploring participants rate of claiming to have made an accurate prediction (among trials in which participants thought that they completed their prediction before the square turned red) as a function of the time they were given to make this prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there were five squares to choose from on each trial, honest predictions, which are unbiased by the appearance of the red square, should be correct 20% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, a number of factors could inflate this percentage: participants could have a general response bias to say they predicted the red square when they did not (e.g., because they were lying), or they might respond randomly on some trials because they are inattentive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the model we focus on here hypothesizes that there should be a time-dependent bias in the rate of reported successful prediction, with shorter trials leading to higher reported accuracy, because there is a limited window of time in which unconscious processes like subliminal attention capture can influence a prediction before the outcome of this prediction enters conscious awareness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, on shorter trials, participants predictions should be more likely to be in progress when a square turns red, which could bias this prediction before the participant becomes consciously aware of the color change (leading to an illusory reversal of the timing of the prediction and the predicted event in conscious awareness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On longer trials, in contrast, the prediction is likely to have already been completed and encoded into working memory before the red square is even unconsciously processed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, our key analyses focus on a negative time-dependent relationship between the reported accuracy of prediction and the delay before a square turned red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, because any boost in accuracy observed for these short time delays should quickly diminish and asymptote to chance levels (or chance levels plus or minus some baseline response bias), we modeled delay on a logarithmic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined results from the two different orders in which the participants could have done the prediction task (before or after the control temporal discrimination task) because there was no significant main effect of task order, b = 0.016, z = 0.49, P = 0.624, or interaction of task order and log of delay, b = 0.012, z = 1.71, P = 0.086, on prediction accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from a multilevel logistic model (Methods for details of modeling procedure) with participant treated as a random (intercept-only) variable confirmed the presence of a robust relationship between the probability of reporting an accurate prediction (excluding didnt have time trials, in which no prediction was reported to have made been made) and the log of delay (in milliseconds), b = 0.048, z = 8.50, P less_than 0.001 [model 2 (1) = 72.17, P less_than 0.001; Fig 2A], replicating previous work (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (In all analyses involving the prediction task, 19 participants who claimed in debriefing to have reported successful predictions when they did not actually make these predictions were excluded.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Akaike Information Criterion with finite-sample correction (AICc) for this model (128,134) was substantially lower than that for a null model without a delay term (128,204).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of evidence in favor of the more complex model can be quantified by calculating an evidence ratio based on the two models Akaike weights (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Support for this model was decisive (evidence ratio  106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Critically, we examined whether the strength of this relationship was moderated by participants reported delusionality (PDI total score; see Supporting Information for individual subscale results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Would the bias in accurate prediction observed at short delays be exaggerated in people more prone to delusion-like ideation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this question, we expanded the logistic model reported above to include a term for delusionality and, more essentially, the interaction between delusionality and the log of delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the distribution of PDI scores was right-skewed, we log-transformed these values (adding 1 to the original scores to map 0 scores to 0 on the log scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both independent variables were mean-centered to facilitate interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesized interaction was observed: in addition to being generally more likely to report accurate predictions, b = 0.041, z = 3.18, P = 0.001, participants who scored higher on the PDI exhibited a more negative relationship between delay and reported accuracy of their predictions, b = 0.013, z = 2.94, P = 0.003 [model 2 (3) = 89.98, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Though we preregistered this particular analysis strategy with an intercept-only random effect for participant, the PDI × delay interaction remains significant, b = 0.013, z = 2.23, p = 0.026, in a more complex random-effects model that includes a random slope for delay.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, higher delusionality was associated with a larger postdictive bias in prediction (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the two AICc values for a model with (128,120) and without (128,127) this interaction term justifies the added model complexity (evidence ratio = 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this relationship remained unchanged, b = 0.013, z = 2.94, P = 0.003, in a model that includes controls for participants sex (whether they were male), b = 0.036, z = 1.11, P = 0.265; age, b = 0.0050, z = 3.25, P = 0.001; religiosity, b = 0.014, z = 2.70, P = 0.007; and self-reported confidence in their predictions, b = 0.92, z = 1.22, P = 0.224.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an attempt to explain this association between delusionality and postdiction in the prediction task, we examined whether it related to a general deficit in temporal perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, we considered whether individuals with more delusion-like ideation are simply poorer at discriminating any two events in time, and therefore, when they make their predictions close in time to the appearance of the stimulus that they are predicting, they are more liable to mistakenly think that the stimulus occurred after they finished their prediction even when it did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential contribution of a domain-general timing deficit to the association between delusions and performance on our prediction task in this manner might be expected given evidence that individuals with delusions display cerebellum-mediated deficits in timing (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we assessed whether there was a relationship between performance on our control task, which measured temporal discrimination of two visual events, and (log-scaled) delusionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discrimination performance for each participant was calculated using the signal detection measure d (with values of 0 and 1 converted to 0.01 and 0.99, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, participants endorsing more delusion-like ideation were not worse at temporal discrimination and, in fact, showed slightly improved performance on this task, r(964) = 0.11, P = 0.001 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, when including participants temporal discrimination performance (d) as a covariate in the model reported above, which assesses prediction performance as a function of delay and delusionality in the prediction task, the impact of delusionality on the relationship between delay and accurate prediction observed above was maintained, b = 0.013, z = 2.73, P = 0.006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Because the temporal gap in this task was varied parametrically, a more appropriate analysis strategy would be to model the sensitivity of a psychometric function for each participants data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, because of the limited and noisy data that several subjects contributed, fitting such a model was not possible, so we stick with the simpler measure of d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although general temporal discrimination could not account for the enhanced postdictive bias observed in more delusional participants, it is possible that the speed with which participants specifically made their predictions could.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of this factor is supported by the association between reduced processing speed and the psychosis spectrum, such that processing speed is known to be reduced both in schizophrenia and related disorders (9) as well as in individuals with subclinical psychotic experiences (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, slower predictions should be more prone to postdictive influence for the same reason that having less time to make a prediction enhances this effect: the prediction must still be in progress for the future stimulus to subliminally bias it, and this is more likely to be the case if the prediction is completed later in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the amount of time that it takes people to reach their decision about what they predicted may also correlate with how conservative a threshold they use to decide when they have made up their mind [e.g., as implemented in an accumulator model (11)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, slower predictions may index slower decision speed or demand for greater accumulated evidence before finalizing ones decision (although the latter seems unlikely for reasons explained below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the present study did not measure the absolute amount of time it took participants to make their predictions, but tracked a relative judgment about whether the predictions were completed before or after a square lit up red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, even holding constant the effects of participants baseline choice speed and conservativeness when making their predictions, there could be heterogeneity in the relative speeds at which information about ones prediction vs. information from visual perception reach awareness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for postdiction in the present study (discussed below with regard to corollary discharge models) stipulates that it is this relative timing difference that accounts for peoples mistaken belief that they completed their predictions before they actually did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the perceptual information that a square has changed color may reach awareness later than the information that one has completed a prediction, leading to an erroneous reversal of the perceived timing of the prediction and predicted event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this account of peoples timing judgments, then, people who are more likely to think that they finished their predictions before a square turned red should (all else equal) be more susceptible to postdictive effects on prediction, because they show the greatest mismatch in how they experience the timing of the prediction vs. the square changing color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all of these reasons, participants rates of reporting that they completed their predictions before the color change warrants further examination, with the caveat that the present study only measured a relative judgment about when the prediction was completed vis-à-vis the color change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relative judgments may therefore track a number of different timing- and prediction-related variables, which may vary independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we can test whether these judgments bear any kind of relationship to how much the postdictive effect was observed in different participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a multilevel logistic model (with participant treated as a random variable), we first examined participants probability of reporting that they had time to make a prediction (indicating either that they predicted the red square or that they predicted a different square before a red square lit up) as a function of the log of delay and delusionality (log of PDI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, people were more likely to report making a prediction when the delay was longer, b = 1.93, z = 114.82, P less_than 0.001 [model 2 (3) = 13,519.71, P less_than 0.001] (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, higher delusionality was associated with a lower overall probability of completing a choice, b = 0.30, z = 5.23, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was qualified by a significant delay-by-delusionality interaction, indicating that more delusional participants were less likely to report completing their predictions, particularly at shorter delays, b = 0.057, z = 3.92, P less_than 0.001 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results suggest that more delusion-prone people take longer to reach their decisions (which, as discussed above, could be explained by a number of different factors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this association between delusionality and prediction time may simply be orthogonal to the association with postdiction, or it may be a mediating mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To help address this question, we calculated each participants overall probability of reporting that they made a prediction before a square lit up red (1  the probability of giving a didnt have time response) and entered this as a covariate in the multilevel logistic model reported earlier, which regressed prediction accuracy (probability of yes predictions among responses in which participants claimed to have made a prediction) on the log of delay, the log of the PDI, and their interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including this covariate, b = 0.10, z = 0.93, P = 0.352, did not eliminate the critical observed interaction between delusionality and delay, b = 0.013, z = 2.93, P = 0.003, suggesting that slower prediction speed does not explain why more delusion-prone individuals showed more postdiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in general, participants were far more likely to show postdiction when they reported making more predictions: when regressing prediction accuracy on log of delay and probability of making a prediction, there was a significant negative interaction between probability of making a prediction and log of delay, b = 0.30, z = 6.52, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the people who feel like they can make predictions most quickly are typically more likely to confuse the timing of their prediction and the outcome of that prediction, perhaps because they are less conservative in how they make their predictions or because they have selective delays in perceptual processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But despite the fact that more delusion-prone people reported making fewer predictions, they also showed more of this postdictive confusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that people who more often confuse the timing of their predictions with an observed outcome are more prone to report delusion-like thoughts and experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association is not driven by domain-general deficits in timing-discrimination ability, and it is unlikely to be explained by the increased time taken by delusion-prone people to make their predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we find that, in general, those who report earlier predictions (relative to the timing of the outcome they are predicting) more commonly show a postdictive bias in these predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are a number of potential explanations for this unique relationship, which could be explored in future work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One notable, but ultimately unlikely, possibility follows from evidence that individuals who are more prone to delusions (e.g., those with schizophrenia) may have impaired internal monitoring of errors (12) and may fail to respond to violations of their predictions as strongly as healthy controls (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the current task involves self-monitoring of predictions, it is natural to hypothesize that these abnormalities may help explain why more delusion-prone participants attained unrealistically high accuracy in their reported predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, they may have more often failed to register that their initial prediction did not match the location of the subsequently appearing red square and, in turn, have mistakenly reported being correct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would result in an overall elevation of reportedly correct predictions in the delusion-prone group, as observed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But it is not obvious why such deficits would lead to particularly high reported accuracy on faster trials, especially given that the tasks that typically measure prediction error are administered at considerably longer time scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps prediction signals are particularly weak on these shorter trials, which makes them more susceptible to bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detecting these error signals with techniques that can capture the time course and intensity of these signals (e.g., EEG) is therefore an important consideration for follow-up work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, prediction error and self-monitoring deficits alone seem unlikely to account for the substantial time-dependent differences that we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is also considerable evidence that people prone to delusions jump to conclusions when reasoning (14, 15), at least in the context of binary choice tasks like the one used here (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that this tendency can be explained by supposing that these individuals more readily rely on weak evidence to reach a decision (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, when answering trivia questions schizophrenia patients were more willing than healthy controls to decide that one of the answers was correct despite assigning relatively low subjective probability to their chosen answer (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Supporting Information, we consider whether liberal acceptance of this sort could, on its own, explain the time-dependent bias observed in our prediction task, without the red square covertly influencing participants decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a simple accumulator model, we show that this is unlikely: lowering choosers subjective threshold for reaching a decision does not increase their probability of reporting a successful prediction (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, no matter the decision threshold, choosers are not more likely to report successful predictions when they have less time to make a decision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of course, it is possible that liberal acceptance or prediction error deficits may exacerbate other factors that contribute to the biases we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider two such factors here, which both involve the red square implicitly entering and corrupting the decision process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, confusion regarding the source of information might lead to confusion about whether one correctly predicted which square would change color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the course of a trial in this task, squares are rendered more task-relevant for at least two reasons: one internal (the participants prediction pertains to them) and one external (they change color).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confusing these internal and external sources of information might lead individuals to feel that they predicted the color change correctly when, in fact, they merely observed it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, delusion-prone individuals may have particular difficulty monitoring these confusions due to their increased confidence in errors and decreased confidence in correct responses (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this explanation, individuals with schizophrenia have been shown to struggle with reality monitoringthat is, distinguishing internal thoughts from external perceptions (2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This account does not necessarily explain why delusion-prone individuals primarily showed an enhanced bias to think they predicted the red square on faster trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is plausible that this confusion would be most likely to arise on exactly these trials because the prediction would be more likely to be in progress (not yet completed and encoded into memory) when the target appeared, which may make discriminating the source of information regarding the task-relevance of any given square more difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work could test whether the effects we observe in the current study relate to source memory impairments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An additional line of work has explored how delusions of control, which lead those afflicted to believe that their actions are being controlled by external agents, can be explained by timing deficits in predictive mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to corollary discharge models (2325), the brain stores a copy of its motor commands and compares these instructions to sensory feedback it receives after behavior is initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this predictive model and sensory feedback match, the brain is able to infer that behavior was self-initiated, explaining experiences of self-willing actions and individuals inability to tickle themselves (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this self-monitoring system may be disrupted in those with passivity symptoms, leading to a discrepancy between prediction and sensory feedback even when behavior is self-generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In support of this theory, people can successfully tickle themselves if the sensory feedback they receive from a robotic hand is delayed relative to the initiation of their action and therefore does not perfectly match up with the brains predictions (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, a delay in perceptual information reaching awareness may underlie delusions of control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both behavioral (27) and neurophysiological (6, 8) work suggests that temporal deficiencies of this sort are common in schizophrenia, which may further help explain the enhanced postdictive effect among more delusional individuals in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, an exaggerated bias to think that one has made an accurate prediction on faster trials could be explained by the appearance of the target covertly biasing prediction before the participant becomes aware of the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater perceptual processing delays could make individuals vulnerable to this effect for a longer period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that disturbances in temporal cognition are common even in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (7), it was surprising to find that the more delusion-prone participants in our nonclinical sample performed no worse (and, in fact, slightly better) on our temporal discrimination task than those with fewer delusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the more delusional participants in our sample were simply more motivated or attentive while doing the discrimination task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if our participants did take longer to become aware of sensory stimuli, however, this would not necessarily impair their performance on the temporal discrimination task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this task requires discriminating two visual events, any delay applicable to both of these events would cancel out when the participant needed to make a discrimination judgment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if the processing delay is specific to perceptual information and does not affect how quickly someone becomes aware of their internally generated prediction, this perception-specific delay could introduce a systematic bias for people to think they have made predictions earlier in time than they actually have, relative to what they are perceiving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could, in turn, generate the observed illusion in which somebody thinks they have made a prediction about an event that has already occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the more delusion-prone participants in our sample were generally less likely to think they completed their predictions before the color change may speak against this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for reasons explained above, this measure is confounded with several other timing-related variables, which may covary with this particular deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, more delusion-prone individuals may tend to make slower predictions overall (explaining their fewer reported predictions in the experiment) while also experiencing perception-specific delays in information reaching conscious awareness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work could, therefore, more carefully explore the specificity of the temporal deficits in delusion-prone individuals to test whether this is a plausible mechanism for the effects observed in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings here may relate to the phenomenon of intentional binding (28), whereby the timing of an intentional action (e.g., a button press) and its associated sensory consequences (e.g., a tone) are compressed in conscious awareness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the confusion of prediction and perception we describe, intentional binding is a partly postdictive phenomenon, with the perceived timing of ones action depending on whether a tone is subsequently played.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, intentional binding appears to be disrupted in patients with schizophrenia, partially due to an enhanced postdictive shift in the perceived timing of ones action forward in time when this action is followed by a tone (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the present findings cannot be explained by a similar forward shift in time, as they involve purely mental prediction rather than intentional motor action, the mechanisms underlying the postdictive influences observed in both paradigms may be related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offering a possible synthesis of these illusions is therefore an important consideration for future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current findings may have practical implications, as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work could administer our task to clinical populations (e.g., delusional individuals with schizophrenia) or even explore whether postdictive timing errors emerge before delusions arise (i.e., during the prodromal phase of illness) and correlate with previously reported neurological and cognitive markers of psychosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this work were to yield positive results, it would suggest that the task used here may be useful in identifying those at risk for psychosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential promise of this task in this regard is enhanced by its extreme ease to administer, with the option of being run online in a matter of minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Indeed, for diagnosis purposes, it is perhaps even possible to run only short-delay trials, where the difference in self-reported accuracy on the prediction task is greatest.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is noteworthy given that early detection of psychosis and subsequent intervention improves illness course substantially (30) and given that several potentially effective interventions for at-risk (i.e., prodromal) individuals exist (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, although we focus on the relationship between postdictive timing errors and delusion-like belief because delusions are most clearly theoretically connected to our task, the work is positioned at the intersection between perceptual and cognitive processes and may also relate to perceptual aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although frequently treated as entirely distinct, processes governing abnormalities in perception and belief likely interrelate and may even be explained by a single factor (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tendency toward mistiming in cognitive and perceptual information may therefore represent a mechanism involved in these two components of positive symptomatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the work discussed here uncovers a robust relationship between peoples tendency to overascribe predictive ability to themselves and to exhibit delusion-like ideation and experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although more work is needed to assess the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its clinical utility, the present study provides further demonstration of how low-level features of the mind connect up to peoples most fundamental beliefs about reality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A detailed description of the experiment is provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants gave their informed consent after reading a description of the study, with expected length and payment, in Amazons Mechanical Turk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They could withdraw their consent at any time by exiting the survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data will be made available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment was administered through the Qualtrics platform, and the tasks were written in JavaScript, which was embedded within the Qualtrics study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were recruited in two batches online, using Amazons Mechanical Turk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 366 participants (169 female; 36.0 y old) initially completed the study, and then an additional 700 participants were recruited for a second sample, which was included as part of preregistered replication attempt of our main hypothesis (preregistered on aspredicted.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although efforts were taken to prevent participants from taking the experiment more than once or from acquiring a completion code on Mechanical Turk without completing the study, several such people were identified and eliminated from further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our resulting second sample therefore consisted of 647 unique participants (325 female; 35.4 y old), yielding 1,013 participants in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prediction_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On 140 trials, participants were presented with a fixation cross [a 30-pixel (px) +] for 500 ms, following by five empty squares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were tasked to pick (in your head) a single square that you think will turn red before one of the squares was randomly selected to turn red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit the amount that participants could plan their predictions in advance, the position of these five squares was randomly chosen on each trial from a set of possible locations of a 5 × 5 grid, centered on the position of the previously shown fixation cross.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to force participants to attend outside of the place of fixation, a square was never presented directly where the fixation cross had been presented (meaning there were only 24 possible locations from which the squares could appear).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each square had 50 × 50 px dimensions, and the 5 × 5 grid of possible locations spanned a region that was 330 × 330 px (leaving 20 px spacing between each possible square location).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We experimentally varied the delay between the initial presentation of the empty squares and the moment at which one of these squares was selected to turn red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were seven possible delays: 100, 150, 250, 400, 600, 2,000, and 4,000 ms. (Note, however, that these delays are only approximations, because the experiment was run online, and therefore the exact timing of stimulus presentation was sensitive to the particular frame rate, processing speed, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of each participants computer and monitor.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the seven possible delays was used on 20 trials, presented randomly across the 140-trial sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After a square turned red on a given trial, participants indicated whether they had predicted that square would turn red (y key for yes), whether they had predicted that a different square would turn red (n key for no), or whether they did not have time to make a prediction before one of the squares turned red (d key for did not have time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After giving their response, participants were then prompted to press the enter key whenever they were ready to begin the next trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before the task began, participants were given detailed instructions about how to perform the task (see below for exact wording).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, to avoid encouraging participants to report that they made a prediction before a square turned red even on the extremely fast trials in which this was difficult, the instructions emphasized that, although participants should try to make their predictions as quickly as possible, its completely understandable and expected that you wont always have a chance to complete your guess in time, even if this is the case on most or all trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid excessive preparation of ones prediction before the trial began, participants were also instructed to try to make your guess right when the empty squares appear and no earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants needed to answer three comprehension questions correctly to proceed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those who made a mistake were given one more chance to read the instructions and answer these questions correctly; and if they failed to answer one of the questions correctly a second time, they were booted from the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants who passed comprehension completed seven practice trials before the main task, consisting of a single trial of each of the seven possible delays, presented in random order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporal_Discrimination_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This task again consisted of 140 trials and was visually similar to the prediction task, but asked participants to perceptually judge which of two events occurred first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, a fixation cross appeared for 500 ms, followed by five empty squares presented in randomly selected locations from the same 5 × 5 grid described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these squares always remained on the screen for 500 ms until one of two possible events occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either the screen blinked (went completely blank) for 50 ms, or one of the squares was randomly selected to flicker red for 50 ms. (Note that, unlike in the prediction task, this square only temporarily turned red before becoming empty again to preserve symmetry between the length of this event and the screen blink.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, after an experimentally manipulated delay in which the empty squares remained again on the screen, the opposite event occurred for 50 ms (i.e., if a blink had occurred first, a red flicker occurred, and vice versa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants indicated whether the blink came first (b key) or the red flashed first (r key).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There were seven possible (approximate) delays between these two events: 66.66, 83.33, 100.00, 133.33, 166.67, 500.00, and 1,000.00 ms. Each of the seven possible delays was used on 20 trials, presented randomly across the 140-trial sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, on each trial, either the blink or the red flicker was randomly selected to occur first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there were 14 conditions in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in the prediction task, participants read instructions and completed seven practice trials of each delay condition, presented in random order, before starting the main task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subclinical_Delusion_Questionnaire  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants delusionality (i.e., the amount of delusion-like ideation they experienced) was tested using the 21-item version of the PDI (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multilevel_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All multilevel logistic regressions were fit using the melogit command in STATA 13.1 with default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variables except the categorical participant identification (ID) were modeled as fixed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participant ID was treated as an intercept-only random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More information on STATAs procedure for fitting this class of model is available at www.stata.com/manuals13/memelogit.pdf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Prediction_Task_Instructions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this part of the experiment, you will be rapidly presented with a + sign, followed by a set of 5 empty squares, appearing in various locations on the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a short delay, one of these squares will turn red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the + sign appears on the screen, orient your attention to this plus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, as soon as the empty squares appear, your task is to pick (in your head) a single square that you think will turn red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once one of these squares turns red, you will be asked to report whether or not you had guessed the square that in fact turned red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use the N key to indicate that you guessed a square that did NOT light up red and the Y key to indicate that you successfully guessed the square that DID end up turning red (well remind you of these keys on the main experimental page).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that you will not be able to give your response (and the keyboard will not be responsive) until a square lights up red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Often times, a square will turn red very soon after the empty squares appear, so its important that you try your hardest to make your guess as quickly as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But its completely understandable and expected that you wont always have a chance to complete your guess in time, even if this is the case on most or all trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If you do end up failing to complete a guess before one of the squares turns red, simply indicate this by pressing the D key (well again remind you of this key on the main experimental page in case you forget).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Its important for our research that youre honest about whether you completed your guess before one of the squares turned red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Please do not cheat and claim that you guessed a red square if you only made your guess after you saw a square change color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theres no bonus for guessing correctly (guessing the red squares) or penalty for guessing incorrectly (missing the red squares), so if youre unsure about whether you completed your guess in time, simply press D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Its also important that, whenever possible, you try to make your guess right when the empty squares appear and no earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let the guess come to you spontaneously and automatically, without deliberating or strategizing ahead of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the experiment is designed to be completed at a fast pace without having you carefully think through your guesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prediction_Task_Comprehension_Questions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants needed to complete all three of the following questions to proceed to the prediction task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they made a mistake, they were given the opportunity to read the instructions one more time and try again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they made an error again, they were paid a small amount and not allowed to continue to the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answer choices were presented in randomized order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporal_Discrimination_Task_Instructions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this part of the experiment, you will be rapidly presented with a + sign, followed by a set of 5 empty squares, appearing in various locations on the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, two events will follow: (i) a blink of the screen (where the entire screen disappears for a fraction of a second and then reappears); and (ii) one of the five squares flashing red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two events will happen in one of two orders: either the blink will occur before a square flashes red OR a square will flash red before the blink occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Your task is to identify which occurred first  the red square lighting up or the blink of the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use the R key to indicate that the red square lit up first and the B key to indicate that the blink occurred first (we will remind you of these keys on the main experimental page).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
You may find this task difficult at times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If youre unsure of which of these events occurred first, please give your best guess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, note that you should not assume that the different orders of events will happen with equal likelihood; it may be the case that one kind of order happens much more often than the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preregistered_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our official preregistration is available at https://aspredicted.org/blind.php/?x=wz2c3n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we report the results of our primary analysis in the preregistered sample, after excluding didnt have time responses and the responses of participants who admitted to misreporting their prediction success (as specified in the preregistration report).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting sample had n = 634 participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, we examined in a multilevel logistic regression whether the probability of reporting successful prediction as a function of time delay negatively interacted with participants (log-scaled) PDI total score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesized interaction was observed: in addition to being generally more likely to report accurate predictions, b = 0.049, z = 2.92, P = 0.004, participants who scored higher on the PDI exhibited a more negative relationship between delay and reported accuracy of their predictions, b = 0.012, z = 2.14, P = 0.032 [model 2 (3) = 75.73, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that the P value reported here and elsewhere comes from a two-tailed test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we had a preregistered directional hypothesis, a one-tailed test would also be appropriate, resulting in P = 0.016.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also discuss several secondary/exploratory analyses in the preregistration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such analysis was to restrict the above regression to participants with nonzero scores on the PDI (resulting in an n = 576).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this restriction, the hypothesized interaction no longer reached statistical significance b = 0.015, z = 1.53, P = 0.125; however, it was similar in effect size, suggesting that the lack of significance may have simply been due to insufficient power to detect an effect in this subsample of participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also considered replacing the PDI total score with the answers to just the two yes/no grandiosity items in the PDI (resulting in a grandiosity variable that could take on the values of 0, 1, or 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this variable in place of the PDI total score resulted in an interaction effect that was statistically significant, b = 0.023, z = 2.59, P = 0.010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow-up work could explore whether the postdiction effect selectively impacts grandiose delusions or whether this result is simply explained by the fact that this class of delusions is correlated with other questions in the PDI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, we examined whether we would continue to get the hypothesized interaction when including the (log-scaled) number of errors on the temporal discrimination task as a covariate in the above model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When including this covariate, our hypothesized interaction between delay and PDI total score remained unchanged, b = 0.012, z = 2.15, P = 0.032.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also mention the inclusion of a new exploratory measurethe Brief Core Schema Scalesin our preregistered sample (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These scales comprise four measures: positive-self, positive-other, negative-self, and negative-other, which were log-scaled for interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive-other was negatively correlated with (log-scaled) PDI total score, r = 0.15, P = 0.002; negative-self was positively correlated with PDI scores, r = 0.33, P less_than 0.001; and negative-other was positively correlated with PDI scores, r = 0.40, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant relationship between positive-self and PDI scores, r = 0.05, P = 0.237.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Substituting each of these measures in place of the PDI in our main regression analysis found a significant positive interaction between positive-self and delay, b = 0.021, z = 2.12, P = 0.034; a significant positive interaction between positive-other and delay, b = 0.021, z = 2.61, P = 0.009; a significant negative interaction between negative-other and delay, b = 0.013, z = 2.02, P = 0.043; and no significant interaction between negative-self and delay, b = 0.012, z = 1.52, P = 0.128.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, including each of these measures as covariates in the original model with the PDI and its interaction with time delay did not undermine the previously observed positive main effect of PDI scores, b = 0.042, z = 2.30, P = 0.022, or the negative PDI × time delay interaction, b = 0.012, z = 2.13, P = 0.033.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDI_Subscale_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PDI (4) contains three subscales indexing how much each of the delusion-like beliefs is distressing, preoccupying, and believed to be true (conviction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these questions is answered on a 15 scale, contingent on the participant answering yes to the yes/no question of whether they have the belief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that the responses to these three subscale questions are included in the PDI total score.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Below, we report model results from each of these subscales separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just like the model with log of PDI total score reported in the main text, each of our models was a multilevel logistic model, with participant treated as a random variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the PDI subscales was log-scored and mean-centered, along with the time delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider both main effects and the PDI subscale × time delay interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distress_Subscale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was both a positive main effect of (log) PDI distress, b = 0.050, z = 3.01, P = 0.003, and negative interaction with (log) time delay, b = 0.018, z = 3.14, P = 0.002 [model 2 (3) = 90.20, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preoccupation_Subscale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was both a positive main effect of (log) PDI preoccupation, b = 0.070, z = 4.20, P less_than 0.001, and negative interaction with (log) time delay, b = 0.018, z = 3.08, P = 0.002 [model 2 (3) = 98.12, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conviction_Subscale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was both a positive main effect of (log) PDI conviction, b = 0.050, z = 3.12, P = 0.002, and negative interaction with (log) time delay, b = 0.016, z = 2.81, P = 0.005 [model 2 (3) = 88.94, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, the results from the individual PDI subscales are consistent with those reported in the main text for the PDI total score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Computational_Model_of_Prediction_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model prediction decisions in our task that would not be postdictively influenced by the appearance of the red square, we consider a simple accumulator, in which a decision is made when the choosers confidence in one of the five options crosses some threshold t, where 0.2less_thant1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Choosers begin their decision with equal confidence in each option (0.2, or 1/5, in this case), and then confidence in each option fluctuates from random drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At all times, the choosers confidence in each of the options sums to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each time step, confidence in one of the options that is not already 0 is randomly selected to drop by 0.01, and another option is randomly selected from the remaining options to gain 0.01 confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process continues until confidence in one of the options equals or exceeds t or until some maximum number of time steps is reached (representing the time delay before one of the squares turns red in our task).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the maximum number of time steps is reached before confidence in any option crosses t, a didnt have time response is recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, we randomly select a correct option from the set of five options and compare it to the choosers predicted option (the option whose confidence crossed t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the predicted option and correct option match, the decision is recorded as correct; otherwise, the decision is recorded as incorrect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulated 100,000 decisions for three different decision thresholds (t = 0.3, 0.5, or 0.7) and five different maximum decision times (250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 time steps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we do not assume that the time steps in the model bear any obvious quantitative relationship to the millisecond time delays used in our task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we tried to pick a broad range of times to assess whether the proportion of correct responses varies at all as a function of time, and, just as in our empirical data, we find time delays in which a substantial proportion of simulated predictions are not completed in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig S1A, we find no systematic relationship among probability of correct prediction and decision threshold, maximum decision time, or their interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that for t = 0.7, the 250 maximum decision time data point is missing because there were no completed predictions for these parameter values.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is confirmed by logistic regression: the probability of making a correct prediction in this simulated data set (among completed decisions; n = 767,928) was not significantly affected by decision threshold, b = 0.012, z = 0.22, P = 0.829; maximum decision time, b less_than 0.001, z = 0.58, P = 0.559; or their interaction, b less_than 0.001, z = 0.29, P = 0.768.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same is true if we use the log of maximum decision time (all ps  0.774).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, it seems that liberal acceptance for translating confidence into decisions alone cannot explain a time-dependent pattern in the probability of successfully predicting the red square.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
