Molecular basis for the substrate specificity of quorum signal synthases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These first structures of a homoserine-lactone quorum-signal synthase bound to various substrates and analogs help to provide a molecular rationale for understanding acyl chain specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the structural data, we show how different clades of signal synthases can accommodate their cognate acylCoA ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the elucidation of the reaction mechanism for the signal synthase may provide a rationale for the design of therapeutic small-molecule antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In several Proteobacteria, LuxI-type enzymes catalyze the biosynthesis of acylhomoserine lactones (AHL) signals using S-adenosyll-methionine and either cellular acyl carrier protein (ACP)-coupled fatty acids or CoAaryl/acyl moieties as progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the molecular mechanism of signal biosynthesis, the basis for substrate specificity, or the rationale for donor specificity for any LuxI member.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present several cocrystal structures of BjaI, a CoA-dependent LuxI homolog that represent views of enzyme complexes that exist along the reaction coordinate of signal synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary biophysical, structurefunction, and kinetic analysis define the features that facilitate the unusual acyl conjugation with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identify the determinant that establishes specificity for the acyl donor and identify residues that are critical for acyl/aryl specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight how a prevalent scaffold has evolved to catalyze quorum signal synthesis and provide a framework for the design of small-molecule antagonists of quorum signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kinetic_Characterization_of_Recombinant_BjaI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites from cultured supernatants of B. japonicum demonstrated activation of quorum signaling with isovalerylCoA (23), consistent with gene regulation induced through the formation of an isovalerylhomoserine lactone (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified, recombinant BjaI can catalyze the formation of the AHL signal using isovalerylCoA and S-adenosylmethionine as substrates (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the kinetic parameters for wild-type and site-specific variants of BjaI using isovalerylCoA as a substrate, we used a colorimetric assay developed by Tipton and colleagues (Fig 1C) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme carried out acylation of SAM with catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 2.14 × 104 M1 s1, which is a consequence of the slow turnover number (kcat).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic efficiency is within an order of magnitude to that observed for ACP-dependent AHL synthases, such as RhlI (22) and BmalI (26), with the appropriate ACP-linked substrate, and is consistent with a lack of selection for catalytic efficiency due to the small concentration of produced signal that is required (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic parameters for BjaI and each of the active-site variants can be found in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Substrate_Scope  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chemically synthesized a panel of branched acylCoA substrates and tested each of these as substrates for the production of the corresponding AHL (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BjaI was relatively tolerant for the acyl donor and could accommodate longer substrates, including the C6-branched methylvalerylCoA and the C7-branched methylhexanoylCoA, as well as the shorter C4-branched isobutyrylCoA (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter substrate is shortened by one methylene relative to isovalerylCoA and was not as efficiently used by BjaI as the longer substrates up to methylhexanoylCoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, branched chains that were longer than C8 (i.e., neodecanoylCoA) were not substrates for the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the acyl-binding pocket for BjaI can use a range of branched substrates of length consisting of up to, but not exceeding, C7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further delineate acyl chain length tolerance, we determined the kinetic parameters of BjaI against a panel of eight different acylCoAs (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalytic efficiency was notably compromised as the linear acyl chain length increased or decreased, and no synthase activity could be detected using acyl chains of length C8 or longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, for BjaI substrates, chain length was more critical than the presence of branching, as butyrylCoA was used 3.5 times better than isobutyrylCoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data all indicate the BjaI can catalyze the production of AHL using acylCoA substrates within the range of four to six carbons, albeit with much lower catalytic efficiency than with isovalerylCoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cocrystal_Structures_of_BjaI_Identify_the_Ligand-Binding_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To delineate the binding pockets for both substrates SAM and isovalerylCoA, we determined the crystal structures of BjaI in complex with various combinations of ligands (see SI Appendix, Table S4, for relevant statistics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core structure of BjaI represents a distal subclade of the GNAT superfamily, despite a lack of any notable sequence similarities between the AHL synthases and GNAT enzymes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall topology consists of a central core of seven -strands, flanked by -helices, and defines the protein fold as a phosphopantetheine-binding domain (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structure-based search using the DALI server (33) identifies the closest structural homologs as the ACP-dependent AHL synthases LasI (PDB Code: 1RO5; rmsd of 2.2 Å over 182 aligned C atoms) (28), TofI (PDB Code: 3P2F; rmsd of 2.0 over 167 aligned C atoms) (30), and EsaI (PDB Code: 1KZF; rmsd of 2.3 over 169 aligned C atoms) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While AHL synthases share structural homology of bona fide N-acetyltransferases, the latter enzymes are easily distinguished by their smaller size of roughly 150 residues (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are notable differences in the N-terminal regions between BjaI and the three other AHL synthases that have been characterized, and this may be reflective of differences in substrate binding between these enzymes (SI Appendix, Fig S13) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cocrystal structures of BjaI with SAH or MTA define the binding pocket of SAM as a pocket located between helices 1 and 2 and supported by a loop located between strands 6 and 7 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the SAH- and MTA-bound structures of BjaI with that of SAM + isopentylCoA reveals a common binding orientation with only a small movement near the sulfur atom, which is necessary to accommodate the methyl group in SAM (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adenine ring is stacked in a hydrophobic pocket and is flanked by residues Thr36 and Leu37 on one side and Met78, Val82, and Phe83 on the other side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N6 of the adenine is within hydrogen-bonding distance to Asp46, and the O2 of the ribose is in proximity to Thr36, but the geometry of the interaction is less optimal for hydrogen bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3-amino3-carboxylpropyl moiety is stabilized through numerous contacts with the polypeptide, including interactions between the -amine and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile138, while the -carboxylate is held in place through interactions with the side chain 1 and backbone amide of Arg103 and side chain of Ser102, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BjaI residues Phe83 and Ile183 direct the orientation of the 3-amino3-carboxylpropyl into the core of the enzyme, and the 5-methylthioribose ring is stabilized through a stacking interaction with the side chain of Trp34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these residues are conserved across various AHL synthases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asp46Ala variant has a significant effect on both kcat and Km, resulting in a near 100-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (0.20 × 103 M1s1), while the Met78Ala variant shows a 20-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (1.21 × 103 M1s1), relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structures of BjaI with either isovalerylCoA or the inert isopentylCoA identify the phosphopantetheine and acyl chain-binding pockets, as well as the determinants for phosphoadenosine binding found in the CoA-specific AHL synthases (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prominent feature in BjaI is a -bulge between two invariants residues, Ser102 and Arg103 in strand 4, which forms the base of a pocket enclosed by strands 4, 5, and 7 and helices 4 and 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pocket defines the phosphopantetheine and acyl chain-binding sites, consistent with prior modeling studies on EsaI (29) and structures of TofI bound to a small molecule (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen atom of the thioester is within interaction distance from the backbone amides of Arg103 and Tyr104, which presumably stabilizes the oxyanion that is formed during the attack of the SAM -amine onto the thioester carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Arg103Ala and Tyr104Ala variants displayed over 33-fold slower turnover (kcat) than that of the wild-type BjaI (1.33 × 103 s1 vs. 45.00 × 103 s1) (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous residues interact with the pantothenic acid, including the backbone amide of Asp112 and the side chain of Arg116 with the phosphate and interactions of the two keto oxygen atoms and the backbone amide of Val106 and the side chain of Arg32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CoA-binding tunnel is lined with numerous hydrophobic residues, including Ile27, Phe28, Trp34, Tyr104, Val106, and Trp143.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cocrystal structures with MTA or SAH, without any bound CoA, the phosphopantetheine tunnel is partially blocked by the side chain of Arg32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar grouping of hydrophobic residues lines the putative phosphopantetheine-binding pockets of LasI, EsaI, and TofI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, binding of the acylCoA is largely supported through -stacking interactions between the adenine ring and Trp142 located at the beginning of helix 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residue, in turn, stacks with the following residue, Trp143, resulting in the formation of an indole platform that provides a foundation for binding to the adenine ring of CoA (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Trp142Ala, Trp142Phe, Trp143Ala, and Trp143Phe variants all demonstrated significant negative effect on both kcat and Km, resulting in over 93-, 48-, 36-, and 112-fold drops in the catalytic efficiency, respectively (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two residues, Arg108 and Arg111, located in the loop between strand 4 and helix 4 that is positioned at the opposite periphery from the indole platform, orientate the pantothenic acid into the enzyme active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these four residues are conserved across all of the characterized CoA-dependent AHL synthases, with the exception of Arg108, which is a Pro in all other homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not surprising that these residues are not shared with the ACP-dependent enzymes, which would interact with a protein-linked substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Framework_for_Understanding_Acyl_Chain_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The branched 3-methylbutanoic acid moiety in cocrystal structures with isovalerylCoA or the inert analog isopentylCoA (Fig 3) establishes the location of the acyl chain-binding site in BjaI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The branched acyl chain is ensconced in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by enzyme residues Tyr104, Met139, and Trp143.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of this pocket is closed off by Trp101 and Phe147, providing a rationale for why BjaI cannot use acyl chains that are longer than C7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Trp101Ala, Trp101Phe, Met139Ala, Trp143Ala, Trp143Phe, and Phe147Ala mutations result in 24, 107, 17, 36, 112, and 12-fold decreases of kcat/Km values, respectively, relative to wild-type BjaI (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of the binding pocket [136 Å3 as calculated using the CASTp server (36)] is sufficiently wide to accommodate isovalerate, and preference for the branched chain may be due to favorable van der Waals contacts with the residues in this pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of the BjaI cocrystal structures with those of ligand-free LasI (specific for 3-oxoC12 HSL), EsaI (specific for 3-oxoC6 HSL), and the small-moleculebound structure of TofI (specific for C8 HSL) offers insights into the basis for acyl chain preferences (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A view parallel to the axis of the pantothenic acid and 3-methylbutanoate in the BjaI cocrystal structure shows that many of the residues that line the sides of the acyl chain-binding cavity are either largely conserved or substituted with similar residues in all of the AHL synthase structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include Tyr104 (Phe in LasI, EsaI and TofI), Met139 (Thr in LasI, and TofI, and Val in EsaI), and Trp143 (Met in EsaI and TofI, Val in LasI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the residues at the top of the pocket are highly divergent, resulting in pockets that vary considerably in volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the aforementioned Trp101/Phe147 that encapsulates the pocket in BjaI to restrict binding of acyl chains longer than C8 is substituted in each of the other enzymes that use longer chain substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In LasI, the Leu102/Met152 pair occupies the equivalent position, resulting in an open binding cavity that is long enough to accommodate the cognate 3-oxoC12 chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in EsaI the Ser98/Leu150 replacement also opens the cavity, which is terminated by Trp155 to create the binding pocket that is suitable to accommodate the 3-oxoC6 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the Leu102/Phe153 replacement in TofI similarly enlarges the cavity, which is terminated by Trp178 to form a binding pocket suitable for the C8acyl substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Ala137 in BjaI is an aliphatic residue among all AHL synthases (replaced by either Gly, Val, Ile, or Leu), with the exception of both LasI and EsaI, which contain a Thr at this position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The side chain -hydroxyl of Thr is well positioned to interact with the oxygen of the -keto group in each of the corresponding 3-oxo substrates of LasI and EsaI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BjaI cocrystal structures reveal that Trp34 is located adjacent to the binding sites for SAM and acylCoA, and this residue forms part of the binding platforms for both ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Trp34Ala mutation in BjaI results in a near 25-fold decrease in kcat (1.83 × 103 s1 vs. 4.5 × 102 s1 for the wild type) with only a modest effect on Km (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equivalent Trp is conserved across all CoA- and ACP-dependent AHL synthases where it is located either in helix 2 or loop that follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region of AHL synthases is highly mobile, and the orientation of residues in this region varies considerably among structures of ligand-free AHL synthases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the LasI structure, the equivalent Trp33 protrudes directly into the SAM-binding pocket (28), while in the EsaI structure Trp34 is displaced nearly 30 Å away into a hydrophobic patch located away from the active site (SI Appendix, Fig S16) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the influence of SAM/SAH/MTA binding on BjaI, we probed the sensitivity of the enzyme to treatment with substoichiometric concentrations of the protease trypsin in the presence and absence of MTA (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, binding of SAM results in increased stability of BjaI to protease treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, mobile regions near the binding site become ordered upon SAM binding, which confers the orientation of the region harboring Trp34 to establish the pockets for acylCoA/ACP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme-Bound_IsovalerateSAH_Intermediate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior transient-state kinetic data, as well as substrate scope studies, established that formation of the homoserine lactone product occurs through an acylSAM intermediate (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, initial velocity studies with the ACP-dependent RhlI showed that SAH was a pseudosubstrate that could not undergo acylation, but induced the hydrolysis of the butyrylACP substrate (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in activity was attributed to alterations in binding mode, resulting in a suboptimal orientation of SAH in the enzyme active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as our structural data demonstrate that SAM, SAH, and MTA all bind in essentially identical conformations, we sought to explore whether BjaI was capable of generating an acylSAH intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intermediate lacks a leaving group at the sulfide and, consequently, cannot undergo lactonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a time-course analysis of reaction products using isovalerylCoA and SAH reveals the buildup of an intermediate with a mass consistent with that of isovalerylSAH (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By carrying out crystallization of BjaI with isovalerylCoA and SAH, we were able to determine a 1.8-Åresolution cocrystal structure with clear and obvious electron density corresponding to isovalerylSAH conjugate at the active site (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the structure, the SAH moiety of the adduct is situated nearly identically with the location of the SAM/MTA, but the isovalerate keto group is shifted 2 Å away to form an amide linkage with the -amine of SAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the acyl chain does not shift considerably, consistent with the selectivity of the acyl chain-binding pocket of AHL synthases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isovalerylSAH conjugate is oriented linearly across the two pockets, and, consequently, the carbonyl oxygen shifts still retain interactions with the backbone amides of Arg103 and Tyr104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a superposition of the isovalerylSAH-bound structure with that of SAH alone reveals significant differences in the orientation of the 3-amino3-carboxylpropyl (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the isovalerylSAH complex, the -carboxylate oxygen is now positioned to be nearly in line with the sulfur and adjacent methylene carbon and positioned roughly 4.4 Å away from this methylene carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In structures with just SAH or SAM, the angle between the -amine, -carbon, and -carboxylate carbon of the ligand is nearly 5° smaller than that for the equivalent atoms in the acylSAH complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reorganization induced by SAH/SAM acylation may facilitate subsequent lactonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure-Based_Classification_of_AHL_Synthases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further characterize the diversity of and relationships among AHL synthases, we generated a sequence similarity network using the toolkit provided by the Enzyme Function Initiative (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a default cutoff E value (significance threshold) of 105 and the primary sequence of BjaI as a seed sequence, a total of 934 sequences were culled from UniProt (represented as circles/nodes in Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each edge connection between two different nodes represents a similarity between the two corresponding protein sequences set to a cutoff value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sequence alignment cutoff of at least 45% yielded 18 different groups, which clustered almost entirely based on organismal class (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster 1 consists of three subclusters and contains several of the biochemically characterized CoA-dependent AHL synthases, including BjaI (cluster 1a), RpaI, and BraI (both in cluster 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more stringent network with a sequence alignment cutoff of at least 50% yields the network shown in Fig 5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This network includes all presumed CoA-dependent AHL synthases, which cluster based on predicted substrate preference (SI Appendix, Fig S18S21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that nodes in clusters 1c (SI Appendix, Fig S20) and cluster 2 (SI Appendix, Fig S21) represent bona fide CoA-dependent AHL synthases, we carried out biochemical characterization of representative members from each cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, sequences in each of these clusters lack the canonical indole platform that is necessary for CoA-binding, and sequences on cluster 1c have a Phe/Trp replacement, while the sequences in cluster 2 have a Tyr/Phe replacement (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative AHL synthases MesI (from cluster 1c) and MplI (from cluster 2) were heterologously expressed and purified and tested for the ability to generate homoserine lactone products using a CoA tethered acyl substrate in an end-point assay (SI Appendix, Fig S22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that acylCoA was the preferred substrate over the corresponding acylACP, we generated octanoylACP and determined the kinetic parameters of MesI for octanoylCoA and octanoylACP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the kinetic parameters for octanoylCoA (kcat = 14.4 × 103 s1; Km = 14.44 × 106 M; kcat/Km = 9.97 × 102 M1s1) against those for octanoylACP (kcat = 2.07 × 103 s1; Km = 10.02 × 106 M; kcat/Km = 2.07 × 102 M1s1) suggests that the acylCoA is the preferred substrate for MesI (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in efficiency for the acylCoA substrate relative to the acylACP is roughly comparable in range to that observed for the ACP-dependent AHL synthase RhlI using a CoA-linked substrate (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that a canonical indole platform is not a strict requirement for acylCoA utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sequence alignments of LuxI-type enzyme with different acyl chain specificities had identified several conserved residues located in four blocks, which are presumed to function in recognition of SAM and/or ACP (27, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of each of these residues, which constitute the sequence signatures of AHL synthases, can be reconciled in the context of the structures and associated data presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first block contains the strictly conserved Arg22, Phe28, and Trp34 located in helix 2 and the following loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is highly mobile in the absence of SAM, and binding of this ligand fixes the location of these residues, including Trp34 that defines the base of the acyl chain-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second and third signature blocks consist of residues Asp46, Asp49, Arg69, and Arg103, and these residues are all located in the proximity of the adenine ring of the bound SAM, although only Asp46 and Arg103 are within contact distance of the base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fifth conserved residue in this block, Glu100, is essential for AHL synthesis by LuxI and RhlI and had been postulated to serve as the general base that abstracts a proton from the SAM -amine before nucleophilic attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our structural data argue against this notion based on the 8-Å distance of this residue from SAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Glu140 is located only 4 Å away, suggesting that Glu140 may serve as the general base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the pKa of the -amine may be perturbed in the enzyme active site, negating the requirement for an active-site general base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth signature block is more divergent and consists of several residues that line the periphery of the acyl chain-binding pocket, including Met139 and Trp143.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Thr142 of LasI and Thr140 in EsaI occupy a location that is normally a small aliphatic residue in most other AHL synthases, and mutational analysis of EsaI suggests that the Thr accounts for the altered preference for substrates with oxidation at the -carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BjaI cocrystal structures support the role for a Thr at this position for recognition of 3-oxo substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biosynthetic activity of the ACP-dependent AHL synthases requires a substrate bound to a protein cofactor, and a putative binding site for the ACP has been proposed based on modeling studies (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As most protein interactions with ACPs are mediated through electrostatics, a putative binding site was identified in LasI near a region clustered with several basic residues, including Arg154, Arg161, Lys167, and Arg172, most of which are conserved across other ACP-dependent synthases (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutational analysis confirms a role for several of these residues in catalysis, presumably via engagement of the ACP (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equivalent residues in BjaI are not cationic, but are located directly adjacent to the phosphoadenosine, providing further support of the modeling and mutational studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cocrystal structure of BjaI in complex with isovalerylSAH reveals a reorganization of the 3-amino3-carboxylpropyl likely occurs following acylation, resulting in a near-5° increase in the bond angle at the -carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reorganization is due to the loss of favorable electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged carboxylate and the positively charged amino group of SAM upon formation of the acylSAM, which does not contain a charged amine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, acylation activates the substrate for lactonization by positioning the attacking carboxylate oxygen toward the methylene carbon adjacent to the sulfur to facilitate ring closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lactone formation can occur through an SN2-type direct nucleophilic attack of the carboxyl oxygen onto the methylene or through an E2-type -elimination of MTA, followed by an attack of the carboxyl oxygen on the resultant vinyl moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As postulated by Tipton and colleagues (37), the Baldwin rules for ring closure for an SN2 mechanism would occur through a favored 5-exotet closure, while the E2-type mechanism would invoke an unfavorable 5-endotrig reaction (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BjaI acylSAH cocrystal structure illustrates how acylation of SAM/SAM could precipitate ring formation through the proper positioning of nucleophile, electrophile, and leaving group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of small molecules that can divert quorum signaling has spurred a renewal in quorum-sensing pharmacology (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds that mimic the acyl chain of cognate substrates are poor competitive inhibitors of AHL synthases, as are acylSAM analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies here suggest that formation of a competent acyl chain-binding pocket only fully occurs following the reorganization of Trp34 induced by the binding of SAM, and acylated mimics would likely not bind in a productive fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This point is further reinforced by the observation that the cyclic ketone of J8-C8 (30), which is presumed to mimic the lactone of AHLs, is bound by TofI at a site that is different from the AHL pocket identified in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies suggest that mechanism-based inhibitors of AHL synthases that cannot undergo lactone formation may prove to be a suitable class of small-molecule inhibitors for the pharmaceutical intervention of quorum signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
