Little evidence for enhanced phenotypic evolution in early teleosts relative to their living fossil sister group  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The success of teleost fishes, which represent roughly half of all vertebrate species, has attracted attention since Darwin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous scenarios invoke elevated diversification in teleosts facilitated by supposed key innovations, yet claims of teleost exceptionalism are profoundly biased by the evolutionary snapshot of living fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of 160 million y (PermianEarly Cretaceous) of evolution in neopterygian fishes reveals that anatomical diversification in Mesozoic teleosts as a whole differed little from their living fossil holostean sister group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is some evidence for evolutionary heterogeneity within teleosts, with early evolving lineages showing the greatest capacity for evolutionary innovation in body shape among Mesozoic neopterygians, whereas members of the modern teleost radiation show higher rates of shape evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since Darwin, biologists have been struck by the extraordinary diversity of teleost fishes, particularly in contrast to their closest living fossil holostean relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothesized drivers of teleost success include innovations in jaw mechanics, reproductive biology and, particularly at present, genomic architecture, yet all scenarios presuppose enhanced phenotypic diversification in teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We test this key assumption by quantifying evolutionary rate and capacity for innovation in size and shape for the first 160 million y (PermianEarly Cretaceous) of evolution in neopterygian fishes (the more extensive clade containing teleosts and holosteans).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that early teleosts do not show enhanced phenotypic evolution relative to holosteans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, holostean rates and innovation often match or can even exceed those of stem-, crown-, and total-group teleosts, belying the living fossil reputation of their extant representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we find some evidence for heterogeneity within the teleost lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although stem teleosts excel at discovering new body shapes, early crown-group taxa commonly display higher rates of shape evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the latter reflects low rates of shape evolution in stem teleosts relative to all other neopterygian taxa, rather than an exceptional feature of early crown teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results complement those emerging from studies of both extant teleosts as a whole and their sublineages, which generally fail to detect an association between genome duplication and significant shifts in rates of lineage diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mesozoic_Teleosts_Do_Not_Show_Enhanced_Phenotypic_Diversification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contrary to expectations ingrained in the neontological literature (3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15), early teleosts do not possess significantly higher rates of size or shape evolution than holosteans (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant difference between rates of body size (measured as SL; other measures deliver comparable results) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4) evolution between early members of the holostean and teleost total groups across the majority of sampled topologies under either paleontological or molecular timescales (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of evolution in overall body shape (as indicated by scores on the first three shape axes of our morphospace), we found no consistent signal, whether rates were higher in total-group teleosts or holosteans (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, total-group holosteans possess significantly higher rates of overall shape change than total-group teleosts in a majority of topologies when these were timescaled to match published divergence-time estimates made using the molecular clock (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated Blombergs K for specific clades to summarize how efficiently they explore phenotypic space (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because interpretation of K in isolation can be misleading (33), it is useful to consider K alongside information on evolutionary rate (34) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report K values directly here and in subsequent sections, drawing on our comparisons of evolutionary rate to provide necessary context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 provides more detailed interpretations of K using rate information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concerning size innovation, K distributions for the teleost and holostean total-groups overlap considerably on paleontological timescales (Fig 3A), whereas holostean K values are distinctly higher than teleost values on molecular timescales (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with the suggestion of broadly comparable rates of evolution in the two clades (Fig 3A and Table S1), these results imply that total-group holosteans either match or exceed total-group teleosts in their size innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K distributions for shape in holosteans and teleosts are comparable regardless of timescale (Fig 3A and Table S1), suggesting they were similarly innovative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Broader_Holostean_Radiation_Does_Not_Fulfill_Numerous_Living_Fossil_Expectations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Darwin articulated several concepts of what it means to be a living fossil (2), such as taxa that are remnants of a once preponderant order, or are slowly formed (i.e., showing low rates of lineage diversification or trait evolution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extant holosteans, which are among Darwins archetypal living fossils (2), embody these features clearly: they represent the last survivors of a once diverse radiation and demonstrate low rates of lineage diversification (26, 32, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern genera Amia, Lepisosteus, and Atractosteus show negligible anatomical change since their first appearance in the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene (1, 36), and living gars show low rates of body size evolution (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to this pattern from living species, Mesozoic holosteans show comparable rates of size change to total- (Fig 3A), crown- (Fig S5A), and stem-group teleosts (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns are seen across a majority of topologies regardless of timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rates of shape evolution in holosteans are broadly comparable to those of teleosts, but often exceed those of total-group teleosts on molecular timescales (Fig 3A) and stem teleosts on both timescales (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is no clear difference in size innovation between holosteans and total- (Fig 3A), crown- (Fig S5A), and stem- (Fig S5B) group teleosts on paleontological timescales (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On molecular timescales, holostean-size K values are marginally larger than those of total- (Fig 3A) and crown-group teleosts (Fig S5A), and clearly larger than stem teleosts (Fig S5B), suggesting holosteans are more innovative in these instances (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike evolutionary rates and size innovation, there are some scenarios in which holosteans are marginally poorer shape innovators than teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, on paleontological timescales, holosteans show marginally less shape innovation than crown teleosts (Fig S5A and Table S1) and appear less innovative than stem teleosts (Fig S5B and Table S1) regardless of timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crown_Teleosts_Display_Comparable_Patterns_of_Phenotypic_Evolution_to_other_Mesozoic_Neopterygians  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite possession of duplicate genomes, we find only ambiguous evidence for elevated shape evolution in early crown teleosts relative to rates in other neopterygian lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rates are significantly higher for only a small majority of topologies on paleontological timescales (Fig 3B), and fewer than half on molecular timescales (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for higher rates in crown teleosts is even less compelling for size evolution, where a majority of trees display no significant difference in rate between crown teleosts and other neopterygians regardless of timescale (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Matching our inferences concerning evolutionary rate, we find no clear evidence to support the notion that early crown teleosts are better size or shape innovators than other neopterygian fishes as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding size, crown teleost K values are comparable to those of other neopterygians regardless of timescale (Fig 3B), suggesting they are similarly innovative (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding shape, crown teleost K values are either comparable to (on paleontological timescales) (Fig 3B) or marginally lower than (on molecular timescales) (Fig 3B) those of other neopterygians, suggesting they are similarly or less innovative, respectively (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Capacity_for_Innovation_and_Rates_of_Phenotypic_Change_Vary_Within_the_Teleost_Total_Group  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unremarkable evolutionary patterns across teleosts mask heterogeneities within the teleost total group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, crown-group teleosts show significantly elevated rates of shape evolution relative to stem teleosts in a small majority of topologies under both molecular and paleontological timescales (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, evidence for elevated rates of shape change in crown-group teleosts is by no means unambiguous; we also find no rate difference between crown teleosts and stem teleosts, or significantly higher rates in stem teleosts, in a nontrivial fraction of topologies (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, finding higher shape rates in crown teleosts relative to stem taxa does not demonstrate uniquely enhanced shape diversification in crown teleosts, because holosteans also demonstrate higher shape rates than stem teleosts in a similar fraction of topologies (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to these patterns for shape evolution, we find little evidence for elevated rates of size evolution in crown teleosts relative to members of the stem (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Possible contrasts in rates of shape evolution between crown teleosts and stem teleosts do not align with patterns of evolutionary innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K distributions point to moderately (paleontological timescale) or substantially (molecular timescale) lower capacity for evolutionary innovation in members of the crown compared with those on the stem (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concerning differences in body-size evolution, there is little support for major differences between crown- and stem-group teleosts (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tenuous_Links_Between_Genome_Duplication_and_Enhanced_Evolutionary_Rate_and_Innovation_in_Fishes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The staggering ecological and anatomical diversity of extant teleosts, especially in comparison with living nonteleost actinopterygian lineages, has long been taken as prima facie evidence of enhanced capacity for phenotypic evolution in this enormously successful vertebrate radiation (3, 4, 8, 9, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a more balanced taxon sample incorporating roughly equal numbers of early teleost and holostean species, we find that evidence for this widely held assumption is at best equivocal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Teleosts as a whole cannot be reliably distinguished from holosteans in terms of either rate of phenotypic change or capacity for evolutionary innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most consistent contrasts we find concern patterns of shape change between crown- and stem-group teleosts, but these do not align: stem teleosts potentially show a higher capacity for evolutionary innovation, whereas crown teleosts are characterized by higher rates of phenotypic change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both must be viewed as ambiguous in light of the multiple pairwise comparisons made between partitions of neopterygian phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the obvious caveat that our paleontological sample excludes some of the most divergent modern teleost body plans, these results call into question the search for key innovations fueling the success of modern teleosts in sum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many such features of teleost biology have been proposed (37), but the duplicate genomes that characterize all living members of this group represent the most popular candidate in recent literature (8, 1113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connection between genome duplication and shifts in evolutionary patterns in teleosts has, to date, been addressed in terms of rates of lineage diversification in modern species alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with our own examination of phenotypic evolution, these studies yield ambiguous results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated rates of lineage diversification are not uniformly detected for crown teleosts as a whole, but there is a consistent and strong signal for exceptional shifts in rate associated with the hyperdiverse and phylogenetically nested otophysan and percomorph radiations (26, 32, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of these clades substantially postdates the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication, which molecular-clock dating of paralogue pairs (10) localizes to the middle of the teleost stem lineage rather than near the origin of the crown radiation (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further polyploid events within actinopterygians provide additional natural experiments for examining the consequences of genome duplications for subsequent patterns of evolutionary diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, too, results provide little direct support for increased rates of lineage diversification in polyploid groups relative to close relatives that have not undergone duplication events (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of groups like salmonids, geologically recent ecological shiftsrather than more ancient changes in genomic architectureappear more closely linked with increased rates of lineage diversification (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How rates of phenotypic evolution might relate to these polyploid events has not been explored specifically, although at least two lineages characterized largely (Acipenseridae) or exclusively (Salmonidae) by polyploid species show elevated rates of body-size evolution relative to background actinopterygian rates (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although genome duplication represents a seductive and widely enlisted hypothesis for explaining the taxonomic and especially morphological proliferation of clades, a synoptic view of the consequences of polyploid events on rates of lineage diversification and patterns of phenotypic change remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our results do not strongly suggest any immediate consequences of genome duplication for morphological evolution in early crown-group teleosts, we anticipate that future developments could help to better constrain these patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inferences about rate heterogeneity can vary substantially within our pool of sampled topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more robustly constrained hypothesis of relationships and times of evolutionary divergence among early neopterygians, therefore, represents a first step to more decisive detection of shifts in the nature of morphological evolution across this major radiation, the early history of which has received substantially less systematic attention than more species-poor groups like birds (4042) and mammals (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Divergence estimates for paralogues (10) provide a loose constraint for the timing of the teleost-specific genome duplication (Table S2), but cannot identify which members of the teleost stem lineage were polyploid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is the possibility that a paleogenomic approach using the size of osteocyte lacunae to estimate genome sizes in extinct lineages could more precisely pinpoint the phylogenetic position of the genome duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to permitting more finely defined contrasts than those applied here, estimation of genome size in fossil teleosts would allow direct investigation of rates of genome reduction following duplication (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenotypic_Datasets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenotypic data were collected from photographs of museum specimens of neopterygians ranging in age from Wuchiapingian (late Permian, 260 Ma) to Albian (Early Cretaceous, 100 Ma), supplemented by high-quality images in the primary literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic datasets represent a combined total of 1,170 unique specimen images assigned to 483 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our phenotypic datasets are divided into those describing variation in size and those capturing differences in shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of varying degrees of completeness between fossil specimens, these datasets do not contain identical sets of taxa, although the degree of overlap between any two datasets is high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained SL for 949 specimens assigned to 468 species, and CS (based on our constellation of landmarks for geometric morphometic analyses; see below) for 626 individuals assigned to 382 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size values within species were averaged, and all resultant species sizes were log-transformed before analysis (SL in Dataset S1; CS in Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a 2D geometric morphometric approach using a constellation of 25 landmarks to quantify shape variation (Fig S6) using the software package tpsDig2 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape dataset consisted of 774 specimen images assigned to 398 species (Fig 2A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both fixed landmarks and semilandmarks were used to capture overall body shape and fin position, based on schemes applied previously to living (48) and fossil (31) fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Landmarked specimen data were aligned using orthogonal generalized Procrustes superimposition analysis (GPA), permitting shape values to be averaged within species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaged species data were then aligned with GPA and subject to a relative warp (RW) analysis in tpsRelw v1.54 (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four axes that described 5% of overall variation, the first three (RW1 to 3) captured clear biological features (rather than differences potentially related to preservation) and formed the basis of all shape analyses in Dataset S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RW1 to 3 explained 42.53%, 21.43%, and 13.52% of the variation respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Supporting Information details anatomical correlates of these axes (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tree_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantifying_Phenotypic_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Size rates were quantified using the Bayesian approach of Eastman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (61) implemented over 1,000,000 generations, discarding the first 250,000 generations as burn-in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Randomization tests (implemented via the compare.rates function of the auteur package in R v2.15.3) provided a two-way P value ( = 0.05) to test for differences between neopterygian partitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Adams (62) method permits estimation of evolutionary rate on multivariate data, and was applied to our shape dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation of each supertree topology under a null model of equal rates was used to generate a null distribution of rate ratios for each of our five comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed rate ratio for a given comparison can then be compared with the simulated distribution of rate ratios to derive a two-way P value to test for differences between two sets of taxa ( = 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantifying_Phenotypic_Innovation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blombergs K quantifies whether closely related taxa in a clade of interest are either more (K  1) or less similar (K less_than 1) with respect to a trait value than expected under a Brownian motion model of evolution (K = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a more innovative clade (i.e., one that is efficient at exploring new regions of trait space) should have a larger K value than a less innovative clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the lineages of an innovative clade should spread apart from one another, occupying different regions of trait space so that more closely related taxa appear more similar in trait value than more distantly related taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A less-innovative clade should express lower K values, as multiple lineages overlap and re-explore similar phenotypes, eroding phylogenetic signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in rate of phenotypic change between focal groups can, however, distort this simple relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in a clade that shows high rates of phenotypic change relative to its boundaries in phenotypic space, K can be degraded (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K values are interpreted to reflect innovation in the main text with appropriate caveats given potential differences in rate, with all comparisons further contextualized in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Major_Axes_of_Shape_Variation_and_Their_Anatomical_Correlates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All relative warp axes that individually account for 5% of the variation across the species sampled are displayed in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphospaces derived from the first three axes, containing all 398 Mesozoic neopterygian species in our shape dataset, are presented in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of sampled fossil specimens are also included in Fig S1 to illustrate the anatomical correlates of shape axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of major neopterygian clades in morphospace are indicated by different colors in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major teleost clades are presented in Fig S2A and major holostean clades in Fig S2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RW1 captures 42.53% of the variance, reflecting changes from slender-bodied taxa to deep-bodied taxa (Fig S1 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly positive scores on RW1 are dominated by Pycnodontiformes (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most negative scores on RW1 (highly slender bodies) belong to Aspidorhynchiformes (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RW2, representing 21.43% of variance, captures the position of the dorsal fin relative to the anal fin (Fig S1 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those taxa with highly positive scores have dorsal fins that insert far anterior to the anal fin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly positive scores are dominated by the Macrosemiiformes (a clade of stem gars; Fig S2B), although numerous crown teleosts, stem teleosts, and halecomorphs also share this region (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly negative scores characterize taxa whose dorsal fin inserts more posteriorly than the anal fin, the most extreme example of which is the pachycormid Euthynotus incognitus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other Pachycormiformes, as well as Aspidorhynchiformes, Ichthyodectiformes, pholidophoriforms, and Osteoglossomorpha possess highly negative scores (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RW3 explains 13.52% of variance and captures variation in the length of the dorsal fin base (Fig S1 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly positive scores characterize taxa with small dorsal fin bases relative to the length of the dorsal body surface, and include Ellimichthyiforms (Clupeomorpha); some pholidophoriforms and a few Ginglymodi and Halecomorphi (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most negative scores (less than 0.2) are restricted to Macrosemiiformes (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RW4, representing only 6.10% of the variation, appears to summarize ventral-dorsal flexion, commonly exhibited by some fish after death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although care was taken to remove highly distorted taxa from the dataset, some expressing mild degrees of bending clearly remain, and appear to inform this axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we do not analyze variation in RW4, and instead focus upon RW1 to 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SL_vs_CS_Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CS offers a measure of size independent of shape (63), whereas SL does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we may expect to observe some differences in the analytical results derived from these two types of dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the SL dataset is pruned to match the CS dataset for taxon sampling, it yields near identical results regarding evolutionary rate regardless of timescale choice (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same is also true of innovation, where K distributions in taxonomic comparisons are very similar for both the pruned SL and CS datasets (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger SL dataset produces highly similar rate and innovation results compared with the CS and pruned SL dataset (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only minor differences observed occur exclusively in rate, where the larger SL dataset recovers significantly higher rates in crown and total group teleosts in a higher proportion of trees than the CS and pruned SL datasets, regardless of timescale choice (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these small differences have almost no influence on our interpretations, because there is only a single instance where the increased frequency of high rate results changes the overall conclusion for a comparison: the crown teleost vs. stem teleost comparison on molecular timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the larger SL dataset delivers a majority of trees where crown teleosts possess significantly higher rates than stem teleosts, whereas the CS and pruned SL datasets find this result in a large minority (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, these results suggest that choice of size metric is relatively unimportant for our dataset, and that the overall size and taxonomic samplings of the dataset are more likely to influence subsequent results, despite those factors having a relatively small influence here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, choice of metric may be important for other datasets (e.g., different groups of organisms or datasets of other biological/nonbiological structures), because it is possible to envisage scenarios where the choice of size metric would matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it is possible that two fishes, identical in SL, could differ greatly in CS if their shapes differed greatly, such as between an extremely deep-bodied taxon (e.g., Opah) and a highly shallow-bodied taxon (e.g., needlefish).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy could present downstream effects on analyses if a hypothetical clade A contained deep-bodied taxa that regularly evolved into shallow-bodied taxa of similar SL (and vice versa), whereas clade B consisted solely of similar sized deep-bodied taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, these two clades may show similar rates of evolution using SL but different rates using CS (because clade A would be expected to possess much higher rates of CS change).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our own data, the fact that SL and CS datasets deliver near identical results suggests such transitions are rare enough not to create such issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This theory matches what we expect given the topology of our tree, where organisms that contrast the most in shape, such as highly deep-bodied (e.g., Pycnodontiformes) and shallow-bodied taxa (e.g., Aspidorhychiformes), form distinct, distantly related clades, meaning rates will rarely be calculated upon transitions between these distinct shape clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Importance_of_Timescale_and_Topology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examination of Fig 3 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5 clearly demonstrates the ability for evolutionary timescale and topology to alter specific rate and innovation analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, timescale can dictate whether crown teleosts show higher size rates than stem teleosts in a minority or a majority of trees (Fig 3C), whereas topology can dictate whether holosteans or teleosts are more likely to possess higher rates of shape evolution (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the observation that molecular and paleontological timescales can deliver differing results has considerable implications for paleontology because the vast majority of analyses in the field are, often by necessity, conducted solely upon paleontological timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, where possible (when crown nodes are present in paleontological trees to which various molecular estimates could be applied) it should prove enlightening to incorporate the full range of known timescale uncertainty, especially in cases where large mismatches still persist between clock and rock estimates, such as for arthropods (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64) or land plants (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, paleontological analyses that do not contain crown nodes may benefit from the introduction of additional timescale uncertainty, to discover the temporal limits of their findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analyses also provide insight into the relative importance of timescale versus topology for understanding Mesozoic neopterygian evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although neopterygian timescales have estimated the origin of crown teleosts to range anywhere from the Carboniferous to the Lower Jurassic (54, 66), we demonstrate that even the most dramatic timescale differences under our current methodology have little bearing upon our main findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the pool of sampled topologies typically set the range of outcomes for a given analysis (Fig 3 and Fig S5), while changes to the timescale subtly adjust the proportions of each potential outcome, rather than bringing about conclusive outcomes in favor of one or another hypothesis (Fig 3 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest refinement of the fossil neopterygian phylogentic framework could be more important to Mesozoic-specific questions than additional revisions to the neontological neopterygian timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this does not undermine the importance of timescale (indeed, changes to the topology themselves alter the timescale by altering branch durations), but simply highlights that reductions in uncertainty will be primarily delivered by improvements to paleontological topology and timescale, obtainable via more systematic studies of fishes and the creation of paleontological databases that will permit use of probabilistic timescaling approaches (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimating_the_Position_of_the_Genome_Duplication_upon_the_Teleost_Stem  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hurley et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) performed a molecular clock analysis on the basis of four paralogous genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed them to date not only the major divergences between taxa, but the divergence between the paralogs themselves, providing an estimate for the timing of the genome duplication event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hurley et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) performed clock analyses upon both a halecostome and a holostean topology, and although the holostean topology is preferable in the light of recent analyses (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 54); see also figure 2 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), both topologies still provide an estimate for the origin of the teleost stem lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different paralogue groups (a and b) also provide two independent estimates for the age of the teleost crown (an estimate from a paralogues and a separate estimate derived only from b paralogues); we averaged these to provide a single crown estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a clock estimate between the pairs of paralogues (a vs b) delivered an absolute age estimate for the genome duplication event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these analyses delivered both the total duration of the teleost stem, and an absolute estimate for the genome duplication event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For three analyses (tables 35 in the supplement of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) it was therefore possible to calculate the relative timing of the genome duplication on the teleost stem, providing estimates of 62%, 54%, and 64%, respectively, yielding an average estimate of 60% (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, current estimates suggest that the duplication occurred just over half way up the teleost stem lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
