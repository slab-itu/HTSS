Examining the effects of birth order on personality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The question of whether a persons position among siblings has a lasting impact on that persons life course has fascinated both the scientific community and the general public for 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining large datasets from three national panels, we confirmed the effect that firstborns score higher on objectively measured intelligence and additionally found a similar effect on self-reported intellect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding contradicts lay beliefs and prominent scientific theories alike and indicates that the development of personality is less determined by the role within the family of origin than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study examined the long-standing question of whether a persons position among siblings has a lasting impact on that persons life course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical research on the relation between birth order and intelligence has convincingly documented that performances on psychometric intelligence tests decline slightly from firstborns to later-borns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the search for birth-order effects on personality has not yet resulted in conclusive findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used data from three large national panels from the United States (n = 5,240), Great Britain (n = 4,489), and Germany (n = 10,457) to resolve this open research question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This database allowed us to identify even very small effects of birth order on personality with sufficiently high statistical power and to investigate whether effects emerge across different samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We furthermore used two different analytical strategies by comparing siblings with different birth-order positions (i) within the same family (within-family design) and (ii) between different families (between-family design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analyses, we confirmed the expected birth-order effect on intelligence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a significant decline of a 10th of a SD in self-reported intellect with increasing birth-order position, and this effect persisted after controlling for objectively measured intelligence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most important, however, we consistently found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the high statistical power and the consistent results across samples and analytical designs, we must conclude that birth order does not have a lasting effect on broad personality traits outside of the intellectual domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Number of participants included in the between and within-family analyses by panel, sibship size, and birth-order position  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effects of birth order position and sibship size on personality and intelligence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean scores and 95% confidence intervals are displayed for intelligence (A) and personality (BH), depending on sibship size and birth-order position in the combined between-family sample that included the NCDS, NLSY, and SOEP participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Personality variables were standardized as T-scores with a mean of 50 and SD of 10; intelligence was standardized as an IQ score with a mean of 100 and SD of 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birth-order effects were significant for intelligence, openness to experience, and intellect (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (BH) Personality traits were as follows: extraversion (B), emotional stability (C), agreeableness (D), conscientiousness (E), openness to experience (F), imagination (G), and intellect (H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tests of statistical significance for effects of birth-order on intelligence and personality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effects of birth-order position and sibship size on personality and intelligence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted mean scores from fixed-effects regressions and 95% confidence intervals are displayed for intelligence (A) and personality (BH) depending on sibship size and birth-order position in the combined within-family sample that included the NLSY and SOEP participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birth-order effects were significant for intelligence and intellect (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (BH) Personality traits were as follows: extraversion (B), emotional stability (C), agreeableness (D), conscientiousness (E), openness to experience (F), imagination (G), and intellect (H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Description_of_the_Panels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NCDS (25, 26) originated from the Perinatal Mortality Survey 1958 and tracks the life courses of all individuals born in Great Britain in 1958 in a particular week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study is managed by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NLSY 97 (27) conducted by the US Department of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics consists of a representative sample of US residents born during the years 19801984.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection for this panel study began in 1997 and included all household members between 12 and 16 y of age from randomly selected households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SOEP (28, 29) is a representative panel study of private households and their members in Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It began in 1984 and has since been refreshed several times to ensure representativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study is located at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study did not require ethical approval because we analyzed existing and fully anonymous data; informed consent was obtained from participants by the respective institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_Birth_Order_and_Sibship_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In each sample, a proxy for social birth position was derived from available information about siblings and household composition in youth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We decided to focus on the individuals position among the children within the household instead of biological sibling status because the expected birth-order effects on personality are supposed to stem from social rather than biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, however, social birth-order position equals biological birth-order position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we excluded participants who were only children because they cannot be compared with any siblings and are thus uninformative for the analysis of birth-order effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also decided to exclude twins because they grew up in a very specific sibling configuration that likely obscures the birth-order effects hypothesized by the Family Niche Theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, twins compete for resources and family niches not only with their older and/or younger siblings but also with their other twin of the same age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants from households with a sibship size exceeding four children also were not included in our analyses, because they represented less_than11% across the three samples and therefore did not enable reliable analyses of larger families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 shows the final sample sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
