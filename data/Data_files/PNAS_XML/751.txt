DNA methylation markers for diagnosis and prognosis of common cancers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to identify a specific cancer using minimally invasive biopsy holds great promise for improving diagnosis and prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the utility of DNA methylation profiles for differentiating tumors and normal tissues for four common cancers (lung, breast, colon, and liver) and found that they could differentiate cancerous tissue from normal tissue with 95% accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signature also correctly identified 19 of 20 breast cancer metastases and 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that methylation patterns can predict the prognosis and survival, with good correlation between differential methylation of CpG sites and expression of cancer-associated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to identify a specific cancer using minimally invasive biopsy holds great promise for improving the diagnosis, treatment selection, and prediction of prognosis in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using whole-genome methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and machine learning methods, we evaluated the utility of DNA methylation for differentiating tumor tissue and normal tissue for four common cancers (breast, colon, liver, and lung).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified cancer markers in a training cohort of 1,619 tumor samples and 173 matched adjacent normal tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replicated our findings in a separate TCGA cohort of 791 tumor samples and 93 matched adjacent normal tissue samples, as well as an independent Chinese cohort of 394 tumor samples and 324 matched adjacent normal tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA methylation analysis could predict cancer versus normal tissue with more than 95% accuracy in these three cohorts, demonstrating accuracy comparable to typical diagnostic methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis also correctly identified 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver and 32 of 34 colorectal cancer metastases to the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that methylation patterns can predict prognosis and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated differential methylation of CpG sites predictive of cancer with expression of associated genes known to be important in cancer biology, showing decreased expression with increased methylation, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified gene expression profiles in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization of cancer, with implications for diagnosis and prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characteristics_of_Patients_and_Tissues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical characteristics and molecular profiling, including methylation data for a training cohort of 1,619 tumor samples and 173 matched adjacent normal tissue samples, as well as a validation cohort of 791 tumor and 93 matched normal samples, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A separate validation cohort of 394 tumor samples and 324 matched normal samples was obtained from Chinese patients with cancer treated at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, West China Hospital, and Xijing Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matched adjacent normal tissue samples were collected simultaneously with tumor tissue from the same patient and were verified by histology to have no evidence of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical characteristics of all patients are summarized in SI Appendix, Tables S1S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methylation_Profiling_Identifies_Cancer-Specific_Methylation_Signatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify a cancer type-specific signature, we randomly split the full TCGA dataset into training and test cohorts with a 2:1 ratio in each of the eight types of sample groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first performed the prescreening procedure to remove excessive noise on the training data using the moderated t statistic (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For multinomial classification, we used lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) under a multinomial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multiclass prediction system (16) was constructed to predict the group membership of samples using a panel of markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchal clustering of these samples according to differential methylation of CpG sites in this fashion could distinguish the cancer tissue of origin, as well as differentiate cancer tissue from normal tissue in our TCGA training cohort (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall correct diagnosis rate was 98.4%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then applied these markers to a TCGA validation cohort (Table 2), and found a slightly decreased but statistically similar correct rate of 97.1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed our results in an independent cohort of Chinese cancer patients (Table 3), which also showed a decreased but similar correct rate of 95.0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the methylation analysis of the Chinese cohort was performed using an alternative bisulfite sequencing technique in a different ethnic and geographic background than the TCGA cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results demonstrate the robust nature of these methylation patterns in identifying the presence of malignancy as well as its site of origin (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S4 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methylation_Block_Structure_for_Improved_Allele_Calling_Accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the well-established concept of genetic linkage disequilibrium to study the degree of comethylation among different DNA stands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used paired-end Illumina sequencing reads to identify each individual methylation block (mBlock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a Pearson correlation method to quantify the comethylation of mBlock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compiled all common mBlocks of a region by calculating different mBlock fractions (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then partitioned the genome into blocks of tightly comethylated CpG sites that we termed methylation-correlated blocks (MCBs), using an R2 cutoff of 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We surveyed MCBs in cancer and normal tissues and found that MCBs were highly consistent among different cancer and normal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we found 3,600 MCBs, approximately one-half of which were incomplete/disrupted (SI Appendix, Fig S2) owing to short a span of sequenced reads (100 base pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next determined methylation values within MCBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S3 shows an example of MCBs found on chromosome 1 in both normal tissues (breast, colon, liver, and lung) and corresponding tumor tissues: breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found similar  values across multiple CpG sites within a MCB, and thus calculated a compound methylation value for one entire MCB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used them instead of single CpG sites in downstream bioinformatics pipelines, which significantly enhanced the allele-calling accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methylation_Profiles_Can_Identify_Cancer_Metastases_to_Liver  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because identifying the tissue of origin is crucial in selecting the optimum treatment strategy for patients presenting with metastases, we investigated the utility of DNA methylation analysis for diagnosis of cancer metastases to liver and lung in our Chinese cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the aforementioned primary tumors, we analyzed 30 colorectal cancer metastases to liver and 34 colorectal cancer metastases to lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that unsupervised hierarchical clustering could differentiate these metastases from colon cancer or normal tissue (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methylation signature could correctly diagnose 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to liver and 32 of 34 colorectal cancer metastases to lung (Table 3); one of the three misdiagnoses were identified as normal liver and two of the three misdiagnoses were identified as normal colorectal tissue, suggesting that the error was due to tissue contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the potential for using the DNA methylation signature to improve the diagnosis of metastatic disease in addition to primary cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methylation_Profiles_Predict_Prognosis_and_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the prognostic utility of a methylation signature for each type of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, race, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, were included in the analysis as well, because the prognostic power can be greatly improved by combining this information with informative molecular data (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cancer category, we used two different statistical learning algorithms, lasso and boosting, to reduce the dimensionality of markers and construct a predictive model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the prognostic utility on TCGA training and validation cohorts at a 2:1 ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method performed well in differentiating low-risk and high-risk groups in KaplanMeier analyses and in associated log-rank tests with significant P values, demonstrating significant prognostic utility of the methylation signatures in BRCA and LUAD (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Tables S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Cancer_Methylation_Profile_Correlated_with_Its_Gene_Expression_Pattern_and_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic regulator of gene expression, we sought to investigate how differential methylation of sites in genes in cancer versus normal tissue correlated with gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we were interested in those methylation sites that predicted the presence of malignancy in our aforementioned signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Methods, we used both methylation and RNA sequencing data to select top CpG markers in LIHC for which methylation was significantly correlated with gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we typically observed an inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression and identified several genes known to be important in carcinogenesis, as well as genes with relatively unknown functional relevance in LIHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the genes hypermethylated with decreased expression, we selected one gene for LIHC [fuzzy planar cell polarity protein (Fuz); Fig 4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of FUZ suppressed LIHC cell line growth (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further attempted to validate a list of top genes whose methylation patterns were closely correlated with gene expression in a mouse model of LIHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a good correlation between the gene expression profiles in human and mouse LIHC (SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support a functional role of these methylation markers in promoting carcinogenesis and provide biological validation for their use in methylation studies to characterize cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study demonstrates the potential for using methylation signatures to identify cancer tissue of origin and predict prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we focused on four common cancers here, we expect that DNA methylation analysis can be readily expanded to aid diagnosis of a much larger number of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results may be particularly helpful for identifying cancers in cases with an inadequate tissue yield or quality for histological diagnosis, which requires preservation of the tissue architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DNA methylation analysis requires only a small amount of tissue to obtain adequate DNA, thus potentially allowing the use of lower-quality biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies also may have significant utility in assigning diagnoses from analysis of metastatic lesions, especially when the tumor is of an unknown primary cancer type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through sequencing of bisulfate-converted DNA (bis-DNA), we identified many previously unknown CpG markers differentially methylated in cancer tissues versus normal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lehmann-Werman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) described multiple adjacent CpG sites that share the same tissue-specific methylation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further explored this concept of the mBlock and found that many nearby methylation markers are highly correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information allowed us to identify additional markers and improve the accuracy of sequencing for determining significant methylation differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has substantial potential for improving the accuracy and utility of DNA methylation analysis for the four study cancer types and other cancers, as well as for expanding the number of diagnostic markers available for interrogation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the length of an MCB, which is related to how long a DNA methyl-transferase binds to and exerts its enzymatic effect on modifying adjacent and surrounding CpG sites on a DNA strand, is not clear, because its underlying biochemical basis is not fully defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA methylation analysis has the potential to improve outcomes, given that accurate diagnosis is often crucial to treatment selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our application of methylation signatures to prognosis revealed subsets of patients with positive and negative prognoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding raises the possibility that methylation may help identify relatively indolent or aggressive tumors and may aid decision making regarding the selection of more aggressive or less aggressive treatment and monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are warranted to fully explore the clinical applications of methylation sequencing to guide personalized care for patients with cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
