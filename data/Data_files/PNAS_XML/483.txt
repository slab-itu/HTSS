Context-specific inhibition of translation by ribosomal antibiotics targeting the peptidyl transferase center  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chloramphenicol and linezolid interfere with translation by targeting the ribosomal catalytic center and are viewed as universal inhibitors of peptide bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, contrary to this view, the activity of these antibiotics critically depends on the nature of specific amino acids of the nascent chain carried by the ribosome and by the identity of the residue entering the A site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that the nascent protein modulates the properties of the ribosomal catalytic center and affects binding of its ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the principles of context specificity of ribosomal drugs may help develop better antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first broad-spectrum antibiotic chloramphenicol and one of the newest clinically important antibacterials, linezolid, inhibit protein synthesis by targeting the peptidyl transferase center of the bacterial ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because antibiotic binding should prevent the placement of aminoacyl-tRNA in the catalytic site, it is commonly assumed that these drugs are universal inhibitors of peptidyl transfer and should readily block the formation of every peptide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our in vitro experiments showed that chloramphenicol and linezolid stall ribosomes at specific mRNA locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of bacterial cells with high concentrations of these antibiotics leads to preferential arrest of translation at defined sites, resulting in redistribution of the ribosomes on mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis is most efficient when the nascent peptide in the ribosome carries an alanine residue and, to a lesser extent, serine or threonine in its penultimate position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the inhibitory action of the drugs is counteracted by glycine when it is either at the nascent-chain C terminus or at the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The context-specific action of chloramphenicol illuminates the operation of the mechanism of inducible resistance that relies on programmed drug-induced translation arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our findings expose the functional interplay between the nascent chain and the peptidyl transferase center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Toeprinting_Analysis_Reveals_Site_Specificity_of_CHL_and_LZD_Action  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the mode of action of CHL and LZD in vitro, we used toeprinting analysis, which determines the position of the antibiotic-stalled ribosome on an mRNA (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, as alleged, CHL and LZD act as global inhibitors of the PTC catalytic function, preincubation of the ribosome with these antibiotics should prevent the formation of the very first peptide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consistent with our previous observations (25), even at very high concentrations of CHL or LZD, ribosomes were not arrested at the initiator codon of any of the tested mRNA templates (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, translation progressed through few codons until the ribosome was stalled, with varying efficiency, at specific downstream sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to understand the requirement for the preferential action of CHL and LZD at specific mRNA locations, we aligned the encoded protein sequences leading up to the experimentally identified sites of CHL- or LZD-induced arrest and examined the nature of the P- or A-site amino acids directly participating in peptide bond formation (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, no clear conservation of the donor or acceptor residues was immediately obvious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We realized that, to search for the motifs conducive to the action of CHL and LZD, we needed to operate with a broader array of sites of the preferred action of these drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used ribosome profiling, which allows analyzing the mode of action of protein synthesis inhibitors at the genome-wide level (2629).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identity_of_the_Penultimate_Residue_of_the_Nascent_Peptide_Is_Critical_for_the_Action_of_CHL_and_LZD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ribosome-profiling experiments were carried out with the Escherichia coli strain BWDK, a descendant of the WT E. coli K-12 strain, where the absence of the tolC gene (a key component of the multidrug efflux pump) renders the cells hypersusceptible to antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exponentially growing cells were exposed to a 100-fold excess over the minimal inhibitory concentration of CHL or LZD for 2.5 min, a time period sufficient to reach maximum inhibition of translation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were then prepared, sequenced, and mapped to the genome using established procedures (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with any of the two inhibitors caused a modest redistribution of ribosome density along the genes relative to the untreated control (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it became evident that exposure to the antibiotic does not immediately freeze translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, ribosomes can still polymerize a few peptide bonds before pausing at particular codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with our in vitro toeprinting results, which showed that CHL and LZD stall translation at a number of specific locations within the protein-coding sequences (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified the preferential sites of antibiotic action by computing changes in ribosome occupancy at 60,000 individual codons between the antibiotic-treated and untreated cells and ranking all of the analyzed codons by the magnitude of the change (Fig 2) (see SI Materials and Methods for detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each antibiotic, we then selected the top 1,000 codons, where the strongest drug-induced translation arrest was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within these sites, we searched for a specific sequence signature among amino acids encoded within the nine codons preceding the arrest site (positions 1 to 9), the arrest codon (position 0), which occupies the P site of the stalled ribosome, and the following codon (position +1), corresponding to the A-site codon (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the preferential CHL arrest sites showed significant enrichment in Ala (38.1%) and, to a lesser extent, of Ser (14.8%) or Thr (6.3%) codons, in the 1 position compared with the expected random occurrence of these residues (15.2%, 7.8%, and 5.5%, respectively) (Fig 2A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sites of LZD-induced arrest exhibited an even stronger preference for Ala codons (69.9%) in the same position (Fig 2B and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Ala and Thr can be defined by four codons each and Ser is defined by six codons, no preference for any specific Ala, Ser, or Thr codon at the sites of arrest was apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of codon bias argues that the specificity of antibiotic action is defined by the nature of the encoded amino acids rather than the mRNA sequence or tRNA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of Ala, Ser, or Thr in the penultimate peptide position strongly correlated with the drug-induced translation stalling throughout the entire range of the analyzed locations, and their presence progressively decreased toward the end of the spectrum where codons with the least pronounced ribosome stalling were grouped (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when all of the 60,000 analyzed sites were grouped into 20 bins, according to the nature of the nascent-chain penultimate residue, the sites with Ala, Ser, or Thr in position (1) showed a significant increase of the cumulative ribosome occupancy across all of the analyzed codons (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these data strongly argue that presence of Ala (and, to some degree, Thr or Ser) as the penultimate amino acid in the nascent chain stimulates the inhibitory action of CHL and LZD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine the influence of the sequence context on drug-induced arrest, we selected a well-defined model system appealingly suited for cell-free translation experiments (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the ribosome-profiling data, the drug-induced ribosome stalling at the Leu5 codon of the hns gene represents one of the 10 strongest arrest sites common for both CHL and LZD (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drug-induced ribosome stalling at the hns Leu5 codon was readily reproduced in vitro in the toeprinting assay (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the fraction of the ribosomes arrested at the Leu5 codon with those that bypassed the site of drug-induced translation stalling, we compared the efficiency of translation inhibition for the H-NS mutants containing every possible amino acid substitutions of Ala4 (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the in vitro experiments confirmed that the presence of Ala in the penultimate position of the H-NS N-terminal pentapeptide significantly enhanced the action of CHL and LZD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacing Ala4 with any other amino acid greatly reduced the efficiency of drug-induced ribosome stalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in agreement with the profiling data (Fig S4), Ser and, in the case of LZD, also Thr at position 1 were more conducive to the antibiotic action than any other substitution of Ala4 (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having verified the importance of the penultimate peptide residue in the mechanism of LZD and CHL action, we reexamined the collection of the arrest sites identified by toeprinting in our initial experiments (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the trend observed in vivo, more than 80% of the drug-induced arrests detected in those experiments occurred when the penultimate amino acid of the nascent peptide was Ala, Ser, or Thr (marked by arrowheads in Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, the results of the genome-wide analysis and of the in vitro testing converge on the key stimulatory role of Ala, Ser, or Thr in the penultimate position of the nascent peptide in the mechanism of action of the PTC-targeting antibiotics CHL and LZD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CHL_and_LZD_Poorly_Inhibit_Peptide_Bond_Formation_When_Glycine_Residues_Are_Involved  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The codons with the maximally increased ribosomal occupancy in drug-treated cells represent the sites where antibiotic action is most pronounced (red frames in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the codons whose occupancy significantly decreases in the presence of the drug are those where the antibiotic fails to hinder peptide bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the presence of the inhibitor, the ribosomes proceed with translation, traversing these codons until they encounter the nearest strong arrest location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our finding for the top arrest sites, the analysis of the 1,000 codons characterized by the most dramatic decrease in ribosome occupancy in the drug-treated cells (green frames in Fig 2) did not show a dramatic bias in favor of any particular amino acid in the position (1) of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it revealed a strong prevalence for the presence of glycine residues in either the P site (position 0) or the A site (position +1) of the translating ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the peptidyl transfer reaction involving a Gly residue either as a donor or as an acceptor is poorly inhibited by CHL or LZD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence of Gly codons in either the P or A sites negatively correlated with the efficiency of drug-inflicted stalling throughout the entire range of analyzed sites (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the presence of glycine codons in the P or A sites correlated with the most pronounced decrease of the cumulative ribosomal density at the corresponding codons in antibiotic-treated cells (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings derived from the ribosome-profiling analysis were in keeping with the results of the subsequent in vitro testing with the hns gene: presence of a Gly residue in the P or the A site made the action of CHL or LZD inefficient (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, we concluded that the amino acid sequence context is capable of either stimulating or counteracting the inhibition of peptide bond formation by CHL and LZD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induction_of_CHL_Resistance_Genes_Relies_on_the_Stimulatory_Effect_of_the_Penultimate_Residue_of_the_Nascent_Chain_on_Drug_Action  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our newly gained understanding of the site specificity of CHL action prompted us to reevaluate the mechanism of inducible CHL resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed CHL-dependent programmed translation arrest at the leader ORFs of two resistance genes, catA86 (originated in Gram-positive bacteria) and cmlA (common to Gram-negative species) (33) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toeprinting analysis showed that, in the presence of the antibiotic, translation driven by E. coli ribosomes stalls when the fifth codon of catA86L or the eighth codon of the cmlAL ORF enter the ribosomal P site (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same stalling site was observed when translation of cat86AL was catalyzed by ribosomes isolated from Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with the conclusions of the previous genetic testing, which suggested that the N-terminal pentapeptide MVKTD of Cat86AL or the octapeptide MSTSKNAD of CmlAL are synthesized in the presence of CHL (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, translation arrest at the leader ORFs occurs when the nascent chain carries in the penultimate positions amino acid residues conducive to CHL action: Ala (in the case of CmlAL) or Thr (Cat86AL) (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mechanism of induction of CHL resistance simply exploits the site specificity rules that have emerged from the profiling and toeprinting analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this assertion, in the alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiment carried out with cat86AL and cmlAL, we observed the appearance of new ribosome stalling sites consistently occurring at the codon subsequent to the engineered Ala mutation (asterisks in Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, replacement of Thr4 of the wt Cat86AL with Ala significantly enhanced CHL-mediated stalling at the native site (compare lanes MVKTDK and MVKADK in Fig 4D), corroborating our conclusion that an Ala residue in the penultimate peptide position is the most stimulatory for drug activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Codons 24 of the cmlAL ORF specify Ser and Thr, which are expected to moderately stimulate CHL action (Fig 3 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, however, translation of the ORF in the presence of the antibiotic proceeds fairly efficiently until the eighth codon (large black triangle in Fig 4C), with only a moderate arrest at the codon 5 (small black triangle in Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation is that efficient CHL-induced stalling requires the nascent chain to reach a certain length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, sequential 5-terminal truncations of the cmlAL or cat86AL ORFs diminished the efficiency of drug-induced arrest at the native site when the nascent chain became shorter than 4 (Cat86AL) or 5 (CmlAL) aa long (Fig 4 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the regulatory ORFs of the CHL resistance genes have been evolutionarily selected to respond specifically to the presence of natural CHL, the similarity in the context specificity of action of CHL and LZD suggested that the latter, a synthetic antibiotic, could also act as an inducer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, LZD and even the newest oxazolidinone antibiotic, tedizolid, were able to stimulate ribosome stalling at the fifth codon of cat86AL or the eighth codon of cmlAL, although less efficiently than CHL (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, synthetic oxazolidinones likely would be able to induce the natural CHL resistance genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Kinetics_of_Translation_Inhibition_by_CHL_and_LZD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis in Escherichia coli was followed as previously described (32) by monitoring incorporation of l-[35S]methionine into the trichloracetic acid-precipitable material after exposure of cells to 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CHL (100 µg/mL) or 50-fold MIC of LZD (400 µg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

pLogo_Analysis_of_the_Amino_Acid_Biases_at_the_Strongest_and_Weakest_Arrest_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total number of reads assigned to the three nucleotides of a codon was normalized to the total reads within the gene, generating the relative codon density (RCD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of the changes in the relative codon occupancy, only genes that had a gene score greater than 100 in drug-treated and control samples were used, and for those, only the codons with at least five assigned reads were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene score was calculated according to the following equation:Genescore=Totalgenedensitylengthofthegene103Totalgenomedensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative fold difference values (RFDVs) for individual codons were calculated as the ratio of RCD in the drug-treated sample relative to the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sites located at a distance of less than 10 codons from the beginning of the gene and those followed immediately by the stop codon were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RFDVs (61,250 for CHL vs. control or 56,251 for LZD vs. control) were then arranged in a descending order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the sites, the encoded peptide sequence was extracted; this included the 10-aa C-terminal sequence of the nascent chain ending with the codon specifying the residue at the P site to which the ribosome density was assigned, and the following A-site amino acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pLogo analysis (47) was carried out using this 11-aa sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pLogo foreground was the amino acid sequences of either the 1,000 strongest or weakest arrest sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background was amino acid sequences of all analyzed sites (61,250 for CHL or 56,251 for LZD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computing_the_Changes_of_Occurrence_of_Individual_Amino_Acids_at_Specific_Sites_as_a_Function_of_Efficiency_of_CHL_or_LZD_Action  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 1,000-site sliding window was used to compute the occurrence of each of the 20 aa in positions 1 (the penultimate peptide residue), 0 (P site), or +1 (A site).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence was calculated as the total number of sites within a window with a specific amino acid in the corresponding position relative to the total count of that amino acid in that position in all sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the first 1,000-site window for the CHL sample contains 298 sites with Ala in the position (1) relative to a total of 9,370 sites with Ala in position (1) among all of the analyzed 61,250 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After plotting the obtained values the curves were smoothed by using the best-fit quadratic slope algorithm of Prism 7 (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_the_Cumulative_Differences_in_Relative_Codon_Occupancy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For computing cumulative change in ribosomal occupancy, all of the RFDVs were split into 20 bins according to the chemical nature of the amino acid at the penultimate (1) position in the nascent chain, the P site or the A site, and the average fold difference was computed for every bin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those sites within nine codons of the start site or having a stop codon in the A site were ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar fashion, the average RFDVs for all possible 2-aa combinations (400 bins) found the in the pairs 1 and P, 1 and A, or P and A sites were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Templates_for_in_Vitro_Translation_and_Toeprinting_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All DNA templates for toeprinting were produced using AccuPrime DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The names and sequences of all of the primers are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The osmC, cspA, hns, and mipA templates were generated by PCR amplification of E. coli genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the templates contained T7 RNA polymerase promoter and initiation region of the ermCL gene at their 5-end and the sequence complementary to the toeprinting primer NV1 at the 3-end (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cat86L, cmlAL, the WT, and 1 and P-site position mutant hns templates, as well as the alanine scanning mutagenesis or N-terminal truncations of H-NS, were generated by four-primer PCRs (44), using the pair of template-specific long primers at 10 µM and the pair of short primers (T7 and NV1, or T7 and a short template-specific reverse primer) at 100 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hns templates with mutant A sites were generated by a five-primer PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, each reaction contained 10 µM of one of 19 primers designed to introduce the mutant A-site codon, in combination with 10 µM of hns_trunc_rev primer corresponding to the 3-end of the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first three PCR cycles, 10 µM of primer T7_hns_fwd, corresponding to the 5-end of the template, and 100 µM of primers T7 and NV1 were added, and the PCR continued for 27 more cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have presented evidence that antibiotics CHL and LZD, belonging to two different classes of ribosomal PTC inhibitors, do not actively block formation of every peptide bond, but instead interfere with translation in a context-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of the two C-terminal nascent peptide residues as well as of the A-site acceptor strongly influence the ability of these drugs to inhibit peptidyl transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Ala, and to a lesser extent of Ser and Thr, in the penultimate position of the peptide stimulates the action of the drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Gly in the P or A sites of the PTC strongly counteracts the antibiotics inhibitory effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings reveal the most extreme manifestation of the dependency of CHL or LZD action on the nature of the PTC donor and acceptor substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is very likely that the action of these antibiotics is affected by a more extended context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite a strong preference for the presence of Ala at position (1) in the sites of the strongest arrest, this amino acid can be found in the penultimate peptide position throughout the entire spectrum of 60,000 codons that were analyzed in the CHL and LZD samples (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the positive effect of Ala (1) on CHL-dependent stalling at the fifth codon of the hns gene seems to be alleviated by the Leu5 to Ala mutation (Fig 3D), an effect that was not observed at other examined sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the context in which Ala (1) appears affects the strength of the drug-dependent translation arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the stimulatory effect of Ala (1) upon CHL or LZD action can be completely negated when Gly is present at the peptides C terminus (Fig S7A), whereas C-terminal Asp seems to additionally boost the effect of penultimate Ala, Ser, or Thr on CHL-dependent translation arrest (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more comprehensive analysis of the cumulative changes in codon-specific ribosome occupancy showed that both the stimulatory effect of Ala (1) and the counteracting influence of Gly (0) and Gly (+1) may be modulated by the identity of the other amino acid residues in these three positions (Fig S7 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because CHL has been traditionally viewed as a universal inhibitor of peptide bond formation, it has been used to freeze the ribosomes on mRNA in some profiling experiments (30, 35), an approach challenged by several studies where trends similar to the ones we presented here were noted (29, 31, 36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that exposure of the cells to high concentrations of CHL (or LZD) does not in fact freeze the ribosomes on mRNA, but allows them to redistribute from the sites less favorable for the drug-dependent arrest to the downstream strong-arrest codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect, for example, can be readily observed near the sites of translation initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A peak of ribosome density is prominent at the start codons of many genes in the untreated cells (30) and can be visualized by the metagene analysis (Fig S8, gray plot).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the CHL- or LZD-treated cells, the relative overall start codon occupancy is dramatically decreased, indicative of poor ability of LZD or CHL to inhibit the first peptide bond formation and the resulting redistribution of the ribosomes from the translation initiation site to the downstream codons (Fig S8, blue and orange plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with the results of toeprinting experiments where both antibiotics failed to arrest translation at the start codon (Fig 3 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results strongly argue against the use of CHL in the ribosome-profiling experiments if precise position of the ribosomes on mRNA is being analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding that CHL and LZD act at the defined locations within the gene extends the concept of context-specific action of ribosome-targeting inhibitors (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrolides, which bind to the nascent peptide exit tunnel, arrest translation at a limited number of codons within the ORF also depending on the nature of the nascent peptide and of the incoming amino acid (27, 28, 32, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The context requirements for macrolides, however, are principally different from those for the PTC-targeting antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations where LZD or CHL would arrest translation are defined primarily by individual amino acids, but the sites of macrolide action are delineated by short amino acid sequences (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, PTC inhibitors halt translation at multiple locations along the gene, whereas macrolides arrest ribosome only at a limited number of codons within the ORF, and synthesis of the proteins lacking the problematic sequences may not be inhibited at all (32, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, cells treated with excess of macrolide antibiotics continue to synthesize a limited subset of polypeptides (32), whereas protein translation in cells exposed to CHL or LZD is essentially abolished (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our data suggest that CHL and LZD should be viewed as poor inhibitors of peptide bond formation even within the preferred context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high drugs concentration, translation is only transiently paused at specific codons,, leading to the appearance of a number of arrest bands in toeprinting gels, rather than at a unique stalling site (Fig S1A and Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the inducible macrolide resistance genes, induction of CHL resistance requires programmed ribosome stalling within the leader ORFs (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings revealed the principles of antibiotic-induced site-specific arrest of translation of the regulatory ORFs of two model CHL resistance genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation of the cmlAL ORF is stalled by CHL after Ala, the amino acid most conducive to antibiotic action, appears in the penultimate position of the nascent peptide (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, synthesis of the CmlAL peptide is halted within the sequence ADK, one of the best motifs for CHL-dependent arrest (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrest of translation of the Cat86AL leader peptide occurs within a similar context, except that Ala is replaced with Thr, another amino acid conducive to CHL action (Fig 4C and Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, programmed ribosome stalling responsible for induction of CHL resistance simply exploits the sequence context most favorable for the action of this antibiotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the cmlA and catA86 resistance genes come from evolutionarily distant bacterial species, the sites of CHL-induced ribosome stalling within the leader ORFs of these genes conform to the contexts that we identified when exploring the CHL and LZD action in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we believe that the uncovered trends in the specificity of LZD and CHL action are universal, rather than strain or species specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We still lack the understanding of the mechanistic principles of context specificity of CHL and LZD action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographic reconstructions have uncovered how these drugs bind to the PTC of the vacant bacterial ribosome (1012, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the gained structural and functional implications are likely incomplete or possibly even misleading because our data clearly show that the key aspects of the drug binding and action must critically depend on the properties of the peptidyl nascent chain and the aminoacyl-acceptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of the PTC substrates could be direct, involving immediate interactions between the key amino acid residues and the drug, or indirect, when the properties of the drug-binding pocket are allosterically affected by the ribosomal ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The context-specific action of the PTC inhibitors reflects the functional interplay between the nascent chain and the PTC, which has been demonstrated in a range of ribosomal functions: from programmed translation arrest, to termination and recoding (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies (32) and the findings presented here strongly suggest that many antibiotics that directly or indirectly influence peptide bond formation, translocation of the substrates through the PTC, or egress of the nascent protein chain will be influenced by the sequence context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving our understanding of these principles will pave the way for the knowledge-based discovery of better protein synthesis inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ribosome profiling was carried out using the antibiotic hypersusceptible E. coli strain BWDK, a derivative of the strain BW25113 with inactivated tolC gene [F, DE(araD-araB)567, lacZ4787(del)::rrnB-3, , rph-1, DE(rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514, tolC] (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overnight culture grown in LB medium was diluted 100-fold into three conical baffled 1-L flasks with 100 mL of LB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the culture density reached OD600 of 0.5, CHL or LZD were added to a final concentration of 100 or 800 µg/mL (100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration) and incubation continued for 2.5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control culture did not receive a drug treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested by rapid filtration, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and processed for ribosome profiling as described (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The library for Illumina sequencing was prepared using RNA fragments ranging in size between 28 and 42 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of ribosome profiling was carried out using the GALAXY pipeline (28, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first position of the P-site codon was assigned at 15 nt away from the 3-end of the read (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of analysis of the ribosome-profiling data are presented in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Templates_for_in_Vitro_Translation_and_Toeprinting_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation of DNA templates for toeprinting is described in SI Materials and Methods, and the primers used are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toeprinting reactions were carried out in 5 µL of PURExpress transcriptiontranslation system (New England Biolabs) as previously described (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final concentrations of LZD, CHL, mupirocin, borrelidin, or thiostrepton in the reactions were 50 µM, unless otherwise indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were quantified using ImageJ (45), and relative stalling efficiency was calculated using the following equation:Relativestallingefficiency=AbBd(AbBd)+(CcBd),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Ab is the intensity of the band representing CHL- or LZD-dependent stalling, Cc is the intensity of the band representing ribosome stalling at the downstream catch codon, and Bd is the background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
