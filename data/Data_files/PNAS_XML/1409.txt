Self-organization into ferroelectric and antiferroelectric crystals via the interplay between particle shape and dipolar interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Controlling ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity of a crystalline solid is one of the central issues in material science and technological applications because the dielectric, electromechanical, and thermoelectric properties crucially depend on the type of dipolar order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, still missing is a simple particle-based physical model that shows self-organization into a lattice structure of desired dipolar order in a controlled manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we elucidate the importance of competition between anisotropic steric and dipolar interactions in such self-organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also reveal that the interplay between the two types of anisotropy with different origins is a key to cross-coupling properties of solids such as mechanical switchability of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings will provide a useful guide for designing materials with dipolar order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity are widely seen in various types of condensed matter and are of technological significance not only due to their electrical switchability but also due to intriguing cross-coupling effects such as electro-mechanical and electro-caloric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of the two types of dipolar order has practically been made by changing the ionic radius of a constituent atom or externally applying strain for inorganic crystals and by changing the shape of a molecule for organic crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the basic physical principle behind such controllability involving crystallattice organization is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of a physical picture that a competition of dipolar order with another type of order is essential to understand this phenomenon, here we develop a simple model system composed of spheroid-like particles with a permanent dipole, which may capture an essence of this important structural transition in organic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, we reveal that energetic frustration between the two types of anisotropic interactions, dipolar and steric interactions, is a key to control not only the phase transition but also the coupling between polarization and strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding provides a fundamental physical principle for self-organization to a crystal with desired dipolar order and realization of large electro-mechanical effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phase behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic representation of electro-mechanical coupling in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the dipolar interaction changes its sign depending on the particle arrangement, the ferroelectric/antiferroelectric ordering crucially depends on the aspect ratio of the spheroids and the applied strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Equilibrium (,T)-phase diagram of our model (see Materials and Methods for the calculations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid and dashed lines are the phase boundaries between equilibrium phases and those between metastable states, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase transitions are first order for the antiferroelectricferroelectric/paraelectric transitions (black line) and the crystalliquid phase transition (blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition between the stable ferroelectric and the paraelectric phase for less_than1.4 (solid red line) is second order, whereas the one between their metastable phases for 1.4 (dashed red line) is weakly first order due to the electrostrictive coupling between polarization and strain (SI Appendix, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) A ferroelectric phase observed for =1.0 and T=0.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color denotes the molecular orientation; we can see that almost all of the particles align along the same direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) An antiferroelectric phase observed for =1.6 and T=0.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two kinds of ferroelectric planes (distinguished by color) are stacked alternately, leading to cancellation of macroscopic polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The snapshots in C and D are obtained from the low-T part on cooling from the simulations displayed in Fig 2 A and B, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C and D, color fluctuation reflects orientation fluctuation, which is stronger in the ferroelectric state (C) than in the antiferroelectric one (D) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that time-averaged orientation reduces fluctuation and coincides with that expected for the assigned space groups in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Color legends of the dipole orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phase_Diagram  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show the T phase diagram of our model in Fig 1B, where  represents the degree of shape anisotropy and =0 corresponds to the spherical dipoles (43) (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fix the pressure at a high value so that the crystalline state is stable for a broad temperature range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For  close to zero, there are three stable phases: the equilibrium liquid, paraelectric crystal (plastic crystal characterized by long-range translational order but without orientational order), and ferroelectric crystal (Fig 1C), from high to low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the paraelectricferroelectric phase transition is of second order (SI Appendix, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline structure of the paraelectric phase is either face-centered cubic (Fm3¯m) or hexagonal closed packed (P63/mmc) with almost equal probability; upon transition to the ferroelectric phase, it transforms into a rhombohedral (R3m) or hexagonal (P63mc) structure by dipole alignment accompanying the associated change of (111) interlayer spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing , the paraelectricferroelectric transition temperature decreases since the ferroelectric attractive interaction decreases (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, an antiferroelectric phase with a monoclinic (P2/m) structure (Fig 1D) is formed from the ferroelectric phase via a strongly first-order transition (see SI Appendix, C for the details of the crystalline structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At =1.4, the ferroelectricantiferroelectric phase transition temperature coincides with that of the paraelectricferroelectric phase transition, indicating the presence of a triple point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a strong electrostrictive coupling for larger  changes the nature of the (metastable) paraelectricferroelectric transformation from second order to first order (SI Appendix, B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the short-range interaction is strongly anisotropic (1.7), there is only one phase transition from the liquid to the antiferroelectric crystal, strongly indicating that the antiferroelectric phase is stabilized by the increase of the particle anisotropy (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liquidcrystal phase boundary has a V shape, although the slope for the large- side is quite small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appearance of the minimum in the melting-point curve is a universal feature of systems with competing phase ordering (24, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phase_Transitions_Induced_by_Temperature_Change_and_External_Field  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we show how ferroelectric order and antiferroelectric order respond to the change in temperature (SI Appendix, D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the paraelectricferroelectric transition at small  are shown in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipolar order P, the average of the magnitude of local dipolar order (see SI Appendix, E for the detailed definition), grows steeply around T=0.75/kB upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see almost the same polarization behavior for both cooling and heating paths, indicating the second-order nature of this phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the local nematic order Q, the average of the magnitude of local nematic order (see SI Appendix, E for the detailed definition), also develops upon cooling, since the dipole moment is set along the shape anisotropy (or long) axis of each particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, the paraelectricantiferroelectric transition at large  is accompanied by a large temperature hysteresis, as shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see that the dipolar order P abruptly decreases and almost vanishes upon cooling (Fig 2B, red curve), whereas the nematic order increases discontinuously to have a large value even when the polarization vanishes (Fig 2B, blue curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a clear signature of the emergence of antiferroelectric long-range order below T0.66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The macroscopic polarization should be zero for both paraelectric and antiferroelectric phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since we define P as the average of the magnitude of local polarization, it need not be zero and reflects the degree of local polarization fluctuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the abrupt change in P upon phase transition is correlated with the change in the dielectric constant (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase transition shows a large hysteresis on cycling the temperature, indicating the strong first-order nature of the antiferroelectric phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant for =1.0 and 1.6 (SI Appendix, F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paraelectricferroelectric transition at small  is accompanied by a much larger change in the dielectric constant than the paraelectricantiferroelectric one at large  (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is primarily because smaller anisotropy allows larger orientational fluctuations of dipoles due to less steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, dipole fluctuations are larger in the ferroelectric phase than in the antiferroelectric one even for the same , which is discussed later (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformation of the crystal structure can also be clearly seen in Fig 2D, where we show the change of a special structural order parameter that has a nonzero value only in the antiferroelectric phase (SI Appendix, E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm that this ordered state really has antiferroelectric order, we also examine the dielectric response to an external electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2E, we observe a double hysteresis response (red curve) to the applied electric field, a characteristic of the antiferroelectric phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the dipole moment is set along the long axis of the spheroid particle in our model, the polarization response is automatically accompanied by a large strain response, as shown by the blue curve in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this response is electrostrictive, and not piezoelectric, since the space group of the antiferroelectric phase is centrosymmetric P2/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The large hysteresis loops in Fig 2 B and E imply a large free-energy barrier for the phase transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that there should be a long incubation time for spontaneous nucleation of antiferroelectric domains in the ferroelectric phase (see SI Appendix, H for the dynamical process of nucleation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this is confirmed by the frequency dependence of the polarization response (Fig 2F): With increasing the frequency, the double-hysteretic response characteristic of the antiferroelectric phase disappears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frequency dependence indicates that there is not enough time for the system to transform back to the antiferroelectric state under such a high-frequency modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be confirmed by the fact that the relaxation time (100t0) (SI Appendix, K and Fig S8) is longer than the time period of field switching at the highest frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the interesting possibility of controlling both the strain and the polarization responses to an external electric field by tuning the degree of particle anisotropy ( in our model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the field required to induce a ferroelectric state from an antiferroelectric one crucially depends on .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hysteresis loop becomes smaller for  close to the phase boundary, as shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Origin_of_Slow_Dynamics_of_the_Ferro-to-Antiferro_Transformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now we consider why the response is so slow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to classical nucleation theory, this timescale is determined by the free-energy barrier to overcome and the dynamics of elementary excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free-energy gain comes from the formation of the more stable phase, whereas the penalty comes from the formation of the domain interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, the nucleation should be accompanied by cooperative displacement and reorientation of the particles in the same hexagonal plane over the size of a critical nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because such cooperativity is necessary to avoid charging (represented by P, where P stands for polarization field) at the interface, since it costs large electrostatic energy (SI Appendix, H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that flipping of a dipole in a ferroelectric state inevitably results in charging at both ends at the dipole, but not in perpendicular directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires cooperativity in dipole rotation along the direction of the long axis of spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability to have such cooperative reorientation may steeply decrease with domain size, simply because the number of particles involved increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extra physical constraint arising from the avoidance of charging, which is a universal electrostatic factor governing the kinetics of the polarization ordering, explains why the ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition exhibits a large hysteresis and requires a long incubation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, the dipolar interaction also affects another important factor governing the slow dynamics: It is the distance between adjacent spheroids, which controls steric hindrance to rotational motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural factor is responsible for the asymmetry in the response between ferro-to-antiferro and antiferro-to-ferro transformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see this, we calculate the vibrational entropy difference in these phases, which stems from the difference in the degree of steric hindrance to particle rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 1A, spheroids have more space to fluctuate for the ferroelectric arrangement than for the antiferroelectric one: The nested structure of the latter tends to inhibit rotational fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the average angular amplitude of rotational vibration of the dipoles relative to their average orientations becomes 23 for the ferroelectric state and 16 for the antiferroelectric state, although these fluctuations are isotropic for both states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiparallel dipole arrangement in the antiferroelectric phase causes both electrostatic and steric constraints on the particle motion: The strong electrostatic attraction between adjacent antiparallel spheroids causes a strong constraint on the relative motion of spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the distance between the nearest antiparallel neighbors becomes shorter by approximately 5% upon phase transformation from the ferroelectric to the antiferroelectric state by the attractive interaction (SI Appendix, I and Fig S6), causing a strong geometrical constraint on rotational motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These electrostatic and geometrical constraints result in suppression of the rotational motion in the antiferroelectric phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we can see in Fig 3, the ferroelectric phase has more low-energy (or softer) excitation modes of rotational nature compared with the antiferroelectric phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the distinct gap in the excitation frequency for the antiferroelectric phase indicates not only the absence of low-frequency coherent rotational modes but also the presence of a resonance frequency, the latter of which is reminiscent of the magnon dispersion relation in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials with uniaxial anisotropy (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that in our system the uniaxial anisotropy stems from the steric hindrance to the dipole moment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the resonance frequency can be controlled by varying the shape anisotropy of the spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that we confirm that there is little difference in the translational vibrational modes and configurational entropy between the two phases (SI Appendix, J and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we note that the entropy difference between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases implies an inverse electro-caloric effect (SI Appendix, K and Fig S8), which has been observed in some antiferroelectric inorganic oxides (19, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Control_of_Antiferroelectric_Phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally we show interesting electro-mechanical coupling observed under external stress, indicating the possibility of mechanical manipulation of the antiferroelectric phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger particle anisotropy  means a stronger coupling between anisotropic mechanical stress and particle alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an externally applied anisotropic stress may affect the phase behavior via electro-mechanical coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4, we show examples of such a polarization response to a uniaxial stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the direction of the applied stress and temperature, the initial antiferroelectric state transforms to a paraelectric, a ferroelectric, and another antiferroelectric state with a different orientation (see SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9S11 for the kinetics of these phase transformations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phase transformations lead to a large change in the dielectric permittivity, pointing to an interesting possibility of selective colossal enhancement of the dielectric permittivity by applying a mechanical stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-induced phase transformation can generally be realized by changing the (anisotropic) relative position between adjacent dipoles, as depicted in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests an interesting possibility to induce ferroelectricantiferroelectric phase transformations by applying an anisotropic stress, which has so far not been reported for simple particle systems (e.g., organic substances).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose a simple particle-based physical model of ferroelectricantiferroelectric phase transitions accompanying crystal-structure change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model reveals that the transition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric crystals can be induced by a nontrivial interplay between the two types of anisotropic interactions favoring different symmetries, the dipoledipole interaction and short-range steric interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modification of the latter can enhance the energetic frustration between these two interactions, which induces a structural phase transition accompanying the crystal symmetry transformation when the frustration becomes strong enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a competition between dipolar and steric orderings may indeed explain the emergence of antiferroelectricity observed in an organic solid (11, 30), where the distance between dipole chains is controlled by using different acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferroelectricity (antiferroelectricity) emerges for an acid molecule with large (small) distance between parallel chains, consistent with our picture that the antiparallel configuration should be more stable in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also elucidate physical factors controlling electro-mechanical effects associated with the antiferroelectric phase transition, which, for example, suggest that there is an optimal molecular shape to realize large switching ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such information may be useful for material design of molecular ferroelectrics/antiferroelectrics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here it may be worth noting that our model can experimentally be realized in colloidal systems: Recent experimental developments allow a simultaneous addition of dipolar interactions of electric or magnetic origin and shape anisotropy to colloidal particles (5257), and thus tunable steric and dipolar anisotropy of colloids may make experimental realization of our results possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we mention a general implication of our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the physical mechanism based on competing orderings, i.e., a competition of dipolar ordering with another type of ordering, may generally be relevant for the emergence of antiferroic order in a wide class of materials, including even magnetic and multiferroic materials because of the common dipolar nature of the interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that our study will initiate further investigations along this direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many computational models of spheroidal particles have been developed to study structure and thermodynamic phase behaviors (42, 5860) and jamming transitions (61) of ellipsoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use an interparticle potential proposed in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43 and 62, which can incorporate an orientationstrain coupling in a simple manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential is modified from the Lennard-Jones interaction to include the dependences on both position r and orientation n of particles as follows:vijLJ=4(1+Aij)rij12rij6,[1]Aij=[(nirij)2+(njrij)2]/rij2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]For small , this potential well represents interacting spheroids and produces a ferroelastic phase (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix, A for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also introduce a dipole moment to spheroid i in parallel to ni as i=0ni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the dipolar interaction is described as (43)vijd=ij/rij33(irij)(jrij)/rij5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]For =0, this potential corresponds to the well-known Stockmayer potential, whose phase behavior has been well understood (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equation_of_Motion_and_Numerical_Units  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The numerical integration of particle positions and orientations is obtained by solving the equation of motion for uniaxial molecules (43, 62, 63), mri=U/ri and I(1nini)ni=(1nini)U/ni under an appropriate ensemble (below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, 1 is the unit tensor and the inertia moment I is assumed to be that of corresponding spheroids: I=2(1+p)m/20 with p=(1+2)1/6 being the aspect ratio (43, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the quantities in this article are presented in dimensionless form, where the units of energy, length, and mass are , , and m, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the units of dipole moment and electric field are 3 and /3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrostatic interaction is treated by the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (64) to reduce numerical costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the Ewald parameter is 0.52/, the interaction cutoff in real space is 6.9, the mesh size for fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is 643, and we adopt fourth-order B-spline interpolation to reduce the root-mean-square error in the force and the torque (65) less than 103/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also adopt the conducting boundary condition (63, 66) in numerical simulations, which ignores the depolarization field by assuming that the system is surrounded by metallic walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phase_Diagram  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain the phase diagram (Fig 1B), we calculate the chemical potential of each state, including the metastable condition, where the magnitudes of the dipole moment and the pressure are fixed to be 0=1.63 and P=5/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of each phase is described in SI Appendix, C. Each structure is relaxed under the NoséHoover thermostat and the ParrinelloRahman barostat (67) at very low temperature, and then we raise the temperature to examine phase equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain crystalline states without defects, the numbers of particles are N=4,000 for the FCC-like lattice, N=4,032 for the HCP-like lattice, and N=4,320 for the BCC-like lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a liquid state, we fix the shape of the simulation box to be cubic by applying the Andersen barostat and equilibrate the system with N=4,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method to calculate the chemical potential is as follows (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a crystal, we apply the thermodynamic integration method, where the reference state is an Einstein crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a liquid, on the other hand, we apply Widoms particle insertion method to calculate the chemical potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate the chemical potentials for various (,T) and obtain the phase equilibrium temperatures at  marked in the phase diagram in Fig 1B (red circles for the paraelectricferroelectric equilibrium, blue squares for the liquidparaelectric and liquidantiferroelectric equilibria, and black diamonds for the antiferroelectricferroelectric and antiferroelectricparaelectric equilibria) and connect them by using the ClausiusClapeyron equation (66) in the T plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generalized ClausiusClapeyron equation for our model reads dT/d=(12)/2(h1h2) on the phase boundary between phases 1 and 2, where =(/)=U//N and h is the enthalpy per particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By calculating the statistical average of U/ and the enthalpy, one can obtain the slope of the phase boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the liquidparaelectric phase boundary and liquidantiferroelectric phase boundary meet at (,T) = (1.7, 0.755), where dT/d=0.20/kB for the former and dT/d=0.01/kB for the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the V shape of the phase diagram is also confirmed by the ClausiusClapeyron equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
