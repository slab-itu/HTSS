Stress granule-associated protein G3BP2 regulates breast tumor initiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malignant breast tumors consist of supporting stromal cells and epithelial cancerous cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cancer cell population is fueled by a reservoir of tumor-initiating cells, and these cells can give rise to the bulk of the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some breast cancer cell populations with vast proliferative potential may be intrinsically resistant to standard anticancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intrinsic resistance may partially explain the limitations of these therapies in curing cancer patients and suggest a reason for relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrate that loss of GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 2 (G3BP2) inhibits breast tumor initiation, a finding that may lead to improved cancer treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Breast tumors contain tumorigenic cancer cells, termed tumor-initiating cells (TICs), which are capable of both replenishing themselves and giving rise to populations of nontumorigenic breast cancer cells (non-TICs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for breast tumor initiation remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a chemical screening strategy to identify small molecules that enhance the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on TIC-enriched breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified proteins that interact with the lead compound C108, including the stress granule-associated protein, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 2, G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G3BP2 regulates breast tumor initiation through the stabilization of Squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3 (SART3) mRNA, which leads to increased expression of the pluripotency transcription factors Octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct-4) and Nanog Homeobox (Nanog).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that G3BP2 is important for the process of breast cancer initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these data suggest a possible connection between stress granule formation and tumor initiation in breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Selection_of_Compounds_That_Kill_Breast_Cancer_Cells_with_Tumor-Initiating_Properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify genes potentially involved in the regulation of breast tumor initiation, we developed a chemical approach for dissection of the drug-resistance program (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are indications that TICs frequently exist in a relatively quiescent state and may be able to survive after treatment with anticancer drugs (1113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore treated cells with a library of small-molecule compounds in combination with paclitaxel, a standard chemotherapeutic drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that, because the LM2 cell line, a metastatic derivative of the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, is highly tumorigenic and possesses a large aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive [TIC-enriched (14)] subpopulation, it contains a large fraction of cells with stem cell properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used this line to develop a high-throughput screening assay of a small-molecule library comprised of 60,000 chemically diverse compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We screened this library to identify biologically active small molecules that were able, in combination with the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel, to reduce the viability of cancer cells by at least 90% but were not toxic to nonmalignant cells (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred seventeen compounds met these criteria, and therefore we studied their efficacy at five different concentrations (0.12, 0.37, 1.11, 3.33, and 10 mol/L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected 78 of these 117 small molecules (0.13% of the total library) that showed dose-dependent repression of breast cancer cell growth and compared their molecular structures; nearly all the selected small molecules have a similar structure and belong to the benzohydrazide chemical class, as depicted in Fig S1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected one compound, 2-hydroxy-N-[1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide (compound C108) (Fig 1A), from this class of molecules for further experiments because this compound had the most pronounced effect on the viability of cancer cells (Fig1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that compound C108 can abrogate the TIC state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this notion, we treated BT-474 cells, which are HER2-amplified luminal breast cancer cells that possess a robust ALDEFLUOR-positive population, in vitro with vehicle, paclitaxel, compound C108, or the combination of compound C108 and paclitaxel for 24 h. We then measured the TIC-enriched ALDEFLUOR population using flow cytometry (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that compound C108 alone diminished the ALDEFLUOR-positive population and that this effect was magnified in the presence of paclitaxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address definitively whether compound C108 can target TICs in this cell line, we treated BT-474 cells for 48 h with either vehicle or compound C108 and then implanted viable cells into the mammary fat pad of female nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency (NOD-SCID) mice in a limiting-dilution xenograft assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with compound C108 reduced the proportion of TICs by 10-fold relative to control treatment (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, compound C108 also diminished sphere formation in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line MAXF 401 over a wide range of cell densities (Fig 1E), suggesting that this compounds antibreast tumor-initiating actions may be relevant to patient tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_the_Molecular_Target_for_Selected_Small_Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we sought to identify the molecular target(s) of these compounds and looked for intracellular proteins that could bind to compound C108 (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used highly magnetic carboxyl-coated nanoparticles conjugated to compound C108 to pull down the binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified proteins were separated on agarose gel and stained with Coomassie blue; bands that were visible in the compound C108-conjugated but not in the control samples were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-four proteins were identified in this manner (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, using lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNA, we generated cell lines that had diminished levels of each of these 44 compound-binding proteins (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because TICs may be relatively quiescent (11, 15) and standard chemotherapeutic agents target only dividing cells, we hypothesized that the gene(s) that are important for maintenance of the TIC phenotype also may sensitize cancer cells to these therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable cell lines bearing shRNA constructs for the identified genes were treated with paclitaxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that down-regulation of G3BP2 led to massive LM2 cancer cell death in the presence of this chemotherapeutic agent (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because G3BP2 initially showed relevance in our functional screen, we validated its binding to compound C108 by coimmunoprecipitation with carboxyl-coated nanoparticles with protein lysates from three different cell linesBT-474 and the triple-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231followed by Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this observation, we incubated nanoparticles alone or nanoparticles bound to compound C108 with recombinant G3BP2 protein and again could pull down G3BP2 with a compound C108-conjugate (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that compound C108 binds to G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound C108, alone and in combination with paclitaxel, also exerts a breast cancer cell-killing effect distinct from its putative TIC-inhibitory action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sought to understand if compound C108 impacted viability or stemness in nontransformed mammary cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MCF10A cells, an immortalized but nontransformed breast cell line, we treated cells with either vehicle or compound C108 and found that compound C108 had no effect on viability as measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand if G3BP2 is responsible for the decreased tumor initiation effected by compound C108, we performed rescue experiments in MDA-MB-453 cells in which we assayed mammosphere formation (a readout of tumor stem/progenitor cell activity) in the presence of vehicle, exogenous G3BP2, compound C108, or compound C108 plus G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, compound C108 diminished mammosphere formation, demonstrating a functional diminution of breast cancer cells with significant proliferative potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased G3BP2 levels were able to rescue this phenotype partially, as shown in Fig 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a G3BP2-mediated rescue of the compound C108+ paclitaxel-induced decrease in the ALDEFLUOR-positive phenotype in MDA-MB- 453 cells (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High_G3BP2_Expression_Levels_Are_Correlated_with_Unfavorable_Outcomes_in_Breast_Cancer_Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether G3BP2 expression levels are correlated with clinical outcome, we used KaplanMeier Plotter (16, 17), a freely available online tool for survival analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KaplanMeier Plotter operates upon a database containing 4,142 breast cancer Affymetrix microarray samples and associated survival information, with a median follow-up of 96 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran KaplanMeier Plotter with standard parameters, using all patients in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breast cancer patients with high G3BP2 expression experienced significantly worse recurrence-free survival (log rank P = 1.2e11) (Fig 3A), distant metastasis-free survival (log rank P = 0.00036) (Fig 3B), and overall survival (log rank P = 3e05) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutoff used to divide patients into the high-G3BP2 and low-G3BP2 expression categories was determined automatically by KaplanMeier Plotter (Methods for details), but a simple division by the median also yielded significant results for all three forms of survival (Fig S3), demonstrating the robustness of the association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results corroborate the importance of G3BP2 as a regulator of breast cancer malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the correlation between G3BP2 expression and overall survival is similar within distinct molecular breast cancer subtypes (Fig S3 DI), with the exception of the HER2+ subgroup, for which the database had a comparatively small sample size (n = 89; for comparison, the luminal A-, luminal B-, and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive groups each had a sample size of n  300).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3BP2_Regulates_Marker-Positive__Breast_TIC-Enriched_Populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked if G3BP2 is preferentially expressed in the TIC population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we compared G3BP2 expression levels in TIC-enriched, ALDH+, and TIC-depleted, ALDH cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot showed higher levels of G3BP2 in the BT-474 ALDH+ cell population than in ALDH cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ALDH+ cells also were enriched in isoform 1 of Polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1), suggesting that SG production may be important for the breast TIC state (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend this observation, we treated cells with paclitaxel and performed immunofluorescent staining with G3BP2 and PABPC1 antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the proteins colocalize, as expected given their reported roles in SG formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this finding by stable knockdown of G3BP2 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate that G3BP2 binds to compound C108, is enriched in populations that are also enriched in TICs, and is involved in SG formation in breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first explored the connection between G3BP2 and the breast tumor initiation in MDA-MB-453 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We overexpressed G3BP2 in MDA-MB-453 cells and assessed the ALDH+, breast TIC-enriched population using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of G3BP2 in MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in an increase in ALDH+ cells (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that breast cancer cells with a CD44high/CD24low phenotype have tumorigenic properties and the ability to proliferate extensively (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we sought to validate our ALDEFLUOR findings using the tandem CD44high/CD24low as markers of a TIC-enriched cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To diminish G3BP2 protein levels in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which have a robust CD44high/CD24low subpopulation, we used two different shRNAs that target G3BP2 or a scrambled shRNA as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our ALDEFLUOR data, in both instances the down-regulation of G3BP2 resulted in a substantial increase in CD24 protein on the cell surface, indicating a loss of the TIC phenotype and an enrichment of non-TICs (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this finding, we performed Western blot analysis with three breast cancer cell lines with or without G3BP2-directed shRNA (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm that down-regulation of G3BP2 leads to increased protein levels of CD24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results suggest that modulating G3BP2 expression in breast cancer cells affects the ratio of non-TIC and TIC-enriched populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3BP2_Protein_Regulates_the_Breast_TIC_Phenotype_in_Vitro_and_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether G3BP2 functionally maintains the breast TIC phenotype, we used several marker-independent approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One measure of proliferative potential, a cardinal trait of stem and progenitor cells, is the ability to form spherical colonies that can be serially passaged in nonadherent conditions (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested the involvement of G3BP2 in the formation of breast cancer cell mammospheres using an established protocol (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G3BP2 diminution by shRNA in the breast cancer cell lines BT-474 and MDA-MB-453 was functionally significant, resulting in drastically decreased mammosphere numbers, and the spheres that did form were smaller, indicating reduced proliferative capacity (Fig 5 A and B and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that each mammosphere was derived from a single cell, we repeated these studies by plating a dilution series ranging from one cell per well to 1,000 cells per well (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirmed our previous observations and demonstrated that the frequency of mammosphere formation is similar within a range of low, i.e., clonal, cell densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, G3BP2 knockdown by siRNA also diminished mammosphere formation in the MAXF 401 PDX cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand definitively if G3BP2 is a regulator of the TIC phenotype, we used a xenograft transplantation assay coupled to extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA), the current reference standard for functionally assessing TIC content (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transplanted serial cell dilutions into the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice and monitored the mice for the presence of tumor outgrowths over a period of 3 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pronounced effect of G3BP2 knockdown on tumor cell self-renewal was preserved in vivo, as evidenced by the fact that BT-474 and MDA-MB-453 (Fig S5) cell populations with lower G3BP2 levels required substantially higher cell numbers to form tumors (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, and in agreement with our in vitro studies examining marker-dependent measures of TICs, these findings indicate that G3BP2 is an important regulator of breast tumor initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3BP2_Regulates_Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma_Antigens_Recognized_by_T_cells_3_Expression_Through_the_G3BP2_RNA-Binding_Domain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G3BP2 belongs to class of RNA-binding proteins that may play a role in determining RNA fate from synthesis to decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation experiment to find mRNA species that may bind to G3BP2 and have an effect on the breast TIC program; we then analyzed the mRNA species by gene-expression microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred sixty-one mRNAs (Table S2) were identified as highly expressed (1.6-fold increase in gene expression) compared with control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among those mRNA species that bound to G3BP2 were SART1 and SART3 (Squamous cell carcinoma antigens recognized by T cells 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SART3, in particular, plays an important role in ES cell pluripotency (21, 22); therefore we focused on this potential interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this interaction, we quantified SART3 mRNA levels in stable shG3BP2-knockdown cell lines and found that they were diminished relative to SART3 mRNA levels in cell lines stably transduced with a control shRNA (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend our original finding that SART3 mRNA binds to G3BP2, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) on BT-474 and MDA-MB-453 stable cell lines bearing scrambled shRNA or shRNA-G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total mRNAs interacting with G3BP2 were pulled down, and SART3 mRNA was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control, SART3 mRNA levels were significantly increased (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the RIP results and to test whether the RNA recognition motif (RRM) region of the G3BP2 protein is crucial to SART3 mRNA stabilization, we used a construct in which the G3BP2 RRM sequence is absent (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transfected MCF-7 cells, which have a low endogenous level of G3BP2, with full-length G3BP2, the truncation mutant construct, or empty vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both RT-qPCR and Western blotting showed higher expression of SART3 in the pBaBe-G3BP2 full-length group, in accordance with the proposed interaction between G3BP2 and SART3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SART3 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in cells with the deleted RRM (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that G3BP2 regulates SART3 mRNA stability through its RNA-binding motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G3BP2_Regulates_Oct-4__Nanog__and_SART3_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested whether G3BP2 protein affects SART3 protein expression, as expected, given that it regulates SART3 transcript levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed SART3 levels by Western blot in breast cancer cells bearing shRNA against G3BP2 or scrambled shRNA control and found that the down-regulation of G3BP2 leads to the repression of SART3 expression (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then confirmed this finding using immunohistochemistry with two breast cancer cell lines (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we examined by immunohistochemistry the expression of G3BP2 in 93 clinical samples from different subgroups (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining patterns for G3BP2 and SART3 were significantly correlated, with P less_than 0.00001 for all samples (average R = 0.53; n = 23 samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SART3_Regulates_Oct-4_and_Nanog_Levels_and_Mammosphere_Formation_in_Breast_Cancer_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It was shown previously that the SART3 protein plays an important role in preserving ES cell pluripotency, because it regulates levels of the core ES transcription factors Nanog and Oct-4 (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether SART3 affects the expression of Nanog and Oct-4 in breast cancer cells, we repressed SART3 with shRNA and assessed Nanog and Oct-4 levels by Western blot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that SART3 repression (shRNA-SART3) decreased both Oct-4 and Nanog (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, this loss of ES cell transcription factors is phenocopied in shG3BP2 cell lines (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Nanog and Oct-4 are important for breast tumor initiation, we would expect that modulation of SART3 expression also might modify mammosphere formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed sphere-formation assays with BT-474 and MDA-MB-453 knockdown (shSART3) or control (scr-shRNA) cell lines and observed that shRNA-SART3 cells formed fewer spheres in two breast cancer cell lines than did control cells (P less_than 0.05) (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed rescue experiments in which we overexpressed SART3 in G3BP2-depleted cells and found that exogenous SART3 was able to restore the sphere-forming potential that was lost upon knockdown of G3BP2 (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In total, our data suggest that G3BP2 regulates SART3, Nanog, and Oct-4 expression levels and may be responsible for the maintenance of subpopulations of breast cancer cells with long-term proliferative properties (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data reveal an important role for G3BP2 in breast tumor initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using high-throughput chemical screening, we have identified a small molecule that affects the survival and proliferative potential of breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that our lead compound, C108, targets G3BP2, thereby abrogating breast tumor initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that G3BP2 acts to maintain the breast TIC state, although we have not formally demonstrated that it is unique to TICs or that it is sufficient to convert non-TICs to a TIC state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, G3BP2 indirectly regulates the core pluripotency transcription factors Oct-4 and Nanog by stabilizing SART3 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oct-4 and Nanog themselves are critically involved in the self-renewal of undifferentiated ES cells (23), and there is evidence that these transcriptional factors are expressed in some human cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Oct-4 overexpression is associated with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype (24), and expression of NANOG, or its retrogene NANOGP8, can be used to identify TIC cells in several types of solid tumors, including prostate and colorectal cancer (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, and relevant to the work presented here, activity of the NANOG promoter has been shown to mark a TIC-enriched population in triple-negative breast cancer (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which the transcriptional programs that these factors control in ES cells are enacted in cancer cells is still unclear, but there is substantial evidence to support the notion that when these molecules are present in human cancer, they govern the TIC state, at least in part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, a recent report demonstrated that the expression of G3BP2 may be reduced during tumor progression and that G3BP2 can impede metastasis by binding to and sequestering Twist family bHLH transcriptional factor (TWIST) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent paradox can be resolved by considering that cancer cells that have adopted a mesenchymal-like phenotype to metastasize may revert to an epithelial state that has an increased stemness potential (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, G3BP2 may function alternately as a negative regulator of metastasis and a positive mediator of breast cancer stemness, allowing the outgrowth of low G3BP2-expressing metastatic cells upon re-expression of G3BP2 in a mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET) or in a MET-like process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted no change in vimentin or E-cadherin levels by Western blot upon stable knockdown of G3BP2, although total levels of some epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcription factors were altered (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wei et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), in analyzing 500 breast cancer samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), did not find a significant relationship between G3BP2 expression and overall patient survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is not necessarily in conflict with our results, because our survival analysis takes advantage of a much larger cohort of more than 4,100 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our clinical data strongly suggest that high G3BP2 expression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, a finding that is consistent with its putative role as a regulator of the breast tumor initiation and its known role as a prosurvival SG factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been suggested that TICs are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation; this resistance may encompass distinct molecular mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TICs may exist in a relatively quiescent state to preserve key functional features, and this quiescent state may allow them to withstand metabolic and genomic stress (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that breast tumor initiation may be regulated by a key component of SGs, G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding raises the intriguing possibility that SG formation may be linked to the regulation of breast tumor initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study identifies a protein, G3BP2, that is involved in breast tumor initiation and an archetypal small molecule compound, C108, that mitigates this function of G3BP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining structurally related derivatives of compound C108 with standardized treatment could be beneficial for patients with relapsed, drug-resistant, and/or metastatic breast cancer and might improve the overall survival of these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the potential interplay between SG formation and a breast tumor-initiation program may unveil new targets for anticancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By coupling a fuller understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the breast TIC phenotype to a repertoire of compounds that can target these effectors, it is likely that targeting stemness may soon become a viable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Only selected compounds that target MDA-MB-231 LM2 cells in combination with paclitaxel (0.2 M for 48 h) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 60,000 compounds screened, 256 were selected for the second screening step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate toxic compounds, nonmalignant cells were treated with these small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred seventeen nontoxic compounds were selected for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell viability (MTT) assays of modified MDA-MB-231 cancer cells with five different concentrations (0.12, 0.37, 1.11, 3.33, and 10 mol/L) were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which genes bind to this compound, TurboBeads carboxy nanoparticles (TurboBeads) were conjugated to compound C108 for 20 min per the manufacturers protocol, followed by overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins from metastatic cancer cells were pulled down with nanoparticles conjugated to compound C108 and with nanoparticles alone as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified proteins were separated on an 8% agarose gel, and a few bands that bound to compound C108 but not to the control were cut out from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectrometry analysis revealed 44 proteins that bound to compound C108.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained shRNA-expressing lentivirus for each pull-down protein and infected modified MDA-MB-231 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MTT assays were performed with shRNA stable cell lines treated with nonlethal doses of paclitaxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only shRNA G3BP2 made cells sensitive to treatment with paclitaxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that compound C108 binds to G3BP2, immunoprecipitation with magnetic nanoparticles bound to compound C108 and nanoparticles alone (control) was carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histologic_Analysis_of_Clinical_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adjacent tissue sections were stained for G3BP2 and SART3, respectively, and RGB images were acquired using an Olympus BX40 microscope, 10× objective, and a Canon EOS 40D digital single-lens reflex camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation analysis for G3BP2 and SART3 staining in the adjacent sections then was performed to assess colocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image pairs were subjected to automated contrast enhancement and then were registered using Photoshop (Adobe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any nonoverlapping image areas created in the registration process were eliminated by cropping both images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the images were subjected to correlation analysis using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the LAB color space, the images were segmented to create binary images of the stained regions (thresholds for pass were L: 0154; A: 0255; BN: 123255).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An automated procedure then quantified the number of positive pixels in 100 × 100 pixel (23 × 23 µm) regions of interest placed in a grid pattern over the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding datasets for the two images then were subjected to statistical analysis to determine the correlation coefficient and P value using Prism (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-Binding_Protein_Immunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore) was used per the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BT-474 cells were treated with 0.3 M paclitaxel for 1 h. RIP buffer was used to collect protein, followed by immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with G3BP2 antibodies- A/G magnetic beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A magnetic separator was used to separate the beads from the buffer, and the beads were washed three times with RIP wash buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNAprotein complex was digested with proteinase K for 30 min at 55 °C, and RNA was purified with a phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA was purified with the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) and was analyzed with the Affymetrix microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only mRNA data that showed an in increase of 1.6 or higher after treatment compared with the controls were selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
