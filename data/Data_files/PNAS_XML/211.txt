Hypoxia induces the breast cancer stem cell phenotype by HIF-dependent and ALKBH5-mediated m6A-demethylation of NANOG mRNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pluripotency factors, such as NANOG, play a critical role in the maintenance and specification of cancer stem cells, which are required for primary tumor formation and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report that exposure of breast cancer cells to hypoxia (i.e., reduced O2 availability), which is a critical feature of the tumor microenvironment, induces N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylation and stabilization of NANOG mRNA, thereby promoting the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that inhibiting the expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which demethylates m6A, or the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) HIF-1 and HIF-2, which activate ALKBH5 gene transcription in hypoxic breast cancer cells, is an effective strategy to decrease NANOG expression and target BCSCs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA plays a role in regulating embryonic stem cell pluripotency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological signals that determine the balance between methylation and demethylation have not been described, nor have studies addressed the role of m6A in cancer stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that exposure of breast cancer cells to hypoxia stimulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1- and HIF-2dependent expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which demethylated NANOG mRNA, which encodes a pluripotency factor, at an m6A residue in the 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased NANOG mRNA and protein expression, and the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype, were induced by hypoxia in an HIF- and ALKBH5-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of the NANOG 3-UTR into a luciferase reporter gene led to regulation of luciferase activity by O2, HIFs, and ALKBH5, which was lost upon mutation of the methylated residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALKBH5 overexpression decreased NANOG mRNA methylation, increased NANOG levels, and increased the percentage of BCSCs, phenocopying the effect of hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of ALKBH5 expression in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells significantly reduced their capacity for tumor initiation as a result of reduced numbers of BCSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates enrichment of BCSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HIF-Dependent_ALKBH5_Expression_Promotes_m6A_RNA_Demethylation_in_Hypoxic_Breast_Cancer_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Breast cancers are divided into three groups based on expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first investigated whether ALKBH5 expression is induced by hypoxia in nine human breast cancer cells that are ER+ (ZR75.1), ER+PR+ (MCF-7 and T47D), ER+PR+HER2+ (BT-474), HER2+ (HCC-1954), or triple-negative (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, SUM-149, and SUM-159) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nine breast cancer cell lines were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h, and RNA was isolated for reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALKBH5 mRNA levels were significantly increased under hypoxic conditions by greater than 1.6-fold in SUM-159 and MDA-MB-435 cells and greater than twofold in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether hypoxia-induced ALKBH5 expression was dependent on HIF-1, HIF-2, or both, we analyzed MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 subclones that were stably transfected with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA to inhibit the expression of HIF-1 (sh1), HIF-2 (sh2), or both HIF-1 and HIF-2 [double knockdown (DKD)], as well as a subclone expressing a nontargeting control shRNA (NTC) (21, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the NTC subclone, hypoxia-induced ALKBH5 mRNA expression was abrogated in sh1, sh2, and DKD subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 1B) and MCF-7 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot assays revealed that ALKBH5 protein levels were increased by hypoxia in NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 1D) and MCF-7 (Fig 1E), but not in HIF-knockdown subclones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, hypoxia induces ALKBH5 expression in a subset of ER+ and ER breast cancer cell lines in an HIF-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated whether increased ALKBH5 expression in hypoxic cells leads to changes in levels of m6A RNA modification in total cellular RNA pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that m6A levels in RNA represent the net effect of methylation mediated by the METTL3/METTL14 complex and demethylation mediated by ALKBH5 and FTO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, increased ALKBH5 expression should lead to decreased m6A levels in RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 1F) and MCF-7 (Fig 1G) to 1% O2 for 24 h led to a significant decrease ( greater than 30%) in the percentage of m6A residues among total adenosine residues in RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was no significant change in total m6A levels in RNA when the DKD subclones were exposed to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate that decreased m6A modification of RNA in hypoxic cells was caused by increased ALKBH5 expression, we generated subclones of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 that were stably transfected with a lentiviral vector encoding either of two different shRNAs targeting ALKBH5 (shALK1#1 and shALK#2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the NTC subclone, knockdown of ALKBH5 in MDA-MB-231 (Fig 1H) and MCF-7 (Fig 1I) cells significantly increased m6A levels in total RNA isolated from cells incubated at 20% O2, and ALKBH5 knockdown blocked hypoxia-induced RNA demethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the data in Fig 1 indicate that HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates m6A demethylation in total cellular RNA pools of hypoxic breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hypoxia_Induces_HIF-_and_ALKBH5-Dependent_NANOG_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next analyzed the effect of hypoxia on expression of the core pluripotency factor NANOG in human breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 2A) and MCF-7 (Fig 2B), hypoxia significantly increased NANOG mRNA levels, whereas the hypoxic induction was abrogated in the sh1, sh2, and DKD subclones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxic induction of NANOG protein expression was also abrogated in the HIF knockdown subclones (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ALKBH5 knockdown by either of two different shRNAs also significantly impaired the hypoxic induction of NANOG mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 (Fig 2C) and MCF-7 (Fig 2D) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, immunoblot assays demonstrated that ALKBH5 knockdown led to decreased NANOG protein expression in MDA-MB-231 (Fig 2E) and MCF-7 (Fig 2F) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased levels of NANOG mRNA and protein were also observed in ALKBH5-knockdown subclones at 20% O2, indicating that there is significant ALKBH5 activity under nonhypoxic conditions, which is further increased by hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ALKBH5_Enhances_NANOG_mRNA_Stability_by_Catalyzing_m6A_Demethylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the mechanism by which ALKBH5 regulates NANOG expression, we first explored whether hypoxia-induced ALKBH5 targeted NANOG mRNA for m6A demethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total cellular RNA was immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes m6A, and the immunoprecipitated RNA was subjected to RT-qPCR to amplify the beginning of the NANOG 3-UTR, which contains a match to the m6A consensus sequence, 5-RRACU-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxic exposure led to decreased levels of m6A+ NANOG mRNA in NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3A) and MCF-7 (Fig 3B) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, expression of either of two different shRNAs targeting ALKBH5 led to increased levels of m6A+ NANOG mRNA under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF DKD also increased m6A+ NANOG mRNA levels, although to a lesser degree, and blocked the hypoxia-induced decrease in m6A+ NANOG mRNA levels that was observed in NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3C) and MCF-7 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that, under hypoxic conditions, NANOG mRNA is subject to m6A demethylation that is HIF- and ALKBH5-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypoxia induced decreased m6A modification of NANOG mRNA and increased total NANOG mRNA levels, which is consistent with increased degradation of m6A+ mRNA (29, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure NANOG mRNA stability, flavopiridol was used to inhibit global mRNA transcription as previously described (29), and the ratio of NANOG mRNA in flavopiridol-treated cells relative to vehicle-treated cells (F/V ratio) was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of NTC subclones of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3E) and MCF-7 (Fig 3F) to hypoxia increased the NANOG mRNA F/V ratio, indicating decreased degradation of NANOG mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this effect of hypoxia was lost in ALKBH5 and HIF knockdown subclones, indicating that hypoxia enhances NANOG mRNA stability through HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence analysis revealed three matches to the 5-RRACU-3 (methylated adenosine residue is underscored) m6A consensus sequence within the NANOG 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter plasmids, which contained or lacked the entire NANOG 3-UTR immediately downstream of luciferase coding sequences, were transiently transfected into MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3G) and MCF-7 (Fig 3H) subclones, followed by incubation at 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h and measurement of luciferase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NTC subclones exposed to 20% O2, luciferase activity was reduced four- to fivefold by insertion of the NANOG 3-UTR into the reporter, but hypoxia significantly increased luciferase activity, whereas this effect was lost in the shALK and DKD subclones (Fig 3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, the adenine residue embedded within the consensus sequence located closest to the translation termination codon in the NANOG 3-UTR was mutated (5-AAACU-3 to 5-AAUCU-3 in mRNA), and luciferase assays were performed comparing WT and mutant reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the adenosine residue resulted in constitutively increased luciferase activity in parental MDA-MB-231 (Fig 3I) and MCF-7 (Fig 3J) cells, suggesting that the mutation prevented methylation and thereby increased the stability of the luciferase-NANOG 3-UTR fusion mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the mutated adenosine residue was a target for methylation, which was consistent with the identification of this site by others using m6A immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing in ESCs (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the results presented in Fig 3 indicate that hypoxia-induced and HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression increases NANOG mRNA demethylation, stabilization, and accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ALKBH5_Deficiency_Impairs_Hypoxia-Induced_BCSC_Enrichment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether ALKBH5 plays a role in regulation of the BCSC phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two properties that identify populations of breast cancer cells that are enriched in BCSCs are the ability to generate clusters of daughter cells when cultured on ultra-low adherence plates (mammosphere assay) (39) and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1 activity, which can be quantified by flow cytometry using a fluorogenic substrate (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of MDA-MB-231 (Fig 4A) and MCF-7 (Fig 4B) cells grown as adherent monolayers or as nonadherent mammospheres revealed significantly increased ALKBH5 mRNA expression in mammosphere cultures, which are enriched for BCSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effect of ALKBH5 depletion on the specification/maintenance of BCSCs, we exposed NTC and shALK subclones to 20% or 1% O2 for 72 h, then transferred the cells to ultra-low adherence plates, incubated them at 20% O2 for 1 wk, and counted the number of primary mammospheres that had formed (Fig 4 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then dissociated the primary mammospheres, replated the cells on ultra-low adherence plates, incubated them at 20% O2 for 1 wk, and counted the number of secondary mammospheres (Fig 4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxic exposure of NTC subclones for 72 h dramatically increased primary and secondary mammosphere formation at 1 and 2 wk after the hypoxic exposure was terminated, as previously reported (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ALKBH5 knockdown significantly impaired hypoxia-induced mammosphere formation and, in MCF-7 cells, significantly decreased mammosphere formation even when cells were not exposed to hypoxia (Fig 4 F and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of BCSCs by the ALDH assay gave remarkably similar results: ALKBH5 knockdown significantly impaired the hypoxia-induced enrichment of ALDH+ cells in MDA-MB-231 (Fig 4I) and MCF-7 (Fig 4J) cells and decreased the percentage of ALDH+ cells even when MCF-7 cells were not exposed to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mammosphere and ALDH assays indicate that ALKBH5 expression is necessary for hypoxia-induced BCSC enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overexpression_of_ALKBH5_Is_Sufficient_to_Enhance_NANOG_Expression_and_BCSC_Enrichment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether ALKBH5 induction is sufficient to decrease the methylation of NANOG mRNA and thereby increase the BCSC population, we stably transfected MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with a lentiviral vector encoding human ALKBH5 or empty vector (EV), and exposed the cells to 20% or 1% O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under nonhypoxic conditions, ALKBH5 overexpression led to significantly decreased m6A modification of NANOG mRNA (Fig 5 A and B), increased levels of NANOG mRNA (Fig 5 C and D) and protein (Fig 5 E and F), and increased percentage of ALDH+ cells (Fig 5 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCF-7 cells, ALKBH5 overexpression also potentiated the decrease in m6A+ NANOG mRNA levels (Fig 5B) and increase in ALDH+ cells (Fig 5H) that was observed in response to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that, under nonhypoxic conditions, overexpression of ALKBH5 is sufficient to demethylate NANOG mRNA, increase NANOG expression, and enhance BCSC enrichment, thereby phenocopying the effects of hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Knockdown_of_ALKBH5_Impairs_Tumor_Formation_and_Decreases_BCSCs_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the effect of ALKBH5 deficiency on the tumor-initiating potential of breast cancer cells, we injected a limiting number of cells (1 × 103) from MDA-MB-231 subclones into the mammary fat pad of female nonobese diabetic/SCID/IL2R-null (NSG) immunodeficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten weeks after injection, 100% of the mice (n = 7) that were injected with NTC cells developed palpable tumors, compared with only 43% (n = 6 of 14) of the mice injected with ALKBH5-deficient cells (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further study the effect of ALKBH5 deficiency on the BCSC population in vivo, the tumors that formed after injection of NTC or shALK cells were harvested for analysis of NANOG expression and BCSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NANOG mRNA (Fig 6B) and protein (Fig 6C) levels were significantly decreased in tumors formed by ALKBH5-knockdown subclones compared with the NTC subclone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mammosphere (Fig 6D) and ALDH (Fig 6E) assays revealed a significant decrease in the BCSC population in tumors derived from injection of shALK compared with NTC cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that loss of ALKBH5 expression significantly impairs tumor formation and decreases the BCSC population in breast tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results presented here demonstrate that an essential physiological stimulus, i.e., hypoxia, regulates m6A modification of RNA in human cancer cells and that hypoxia induces the BCSC phenotype in part by increased demethylation of an mRNA encoding a core pluripotency factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we focused on the regulation of NANOG mRNA stability, it is likely that the stability of other mRNAs is increased in breast cancer cells as a result of HIF-dependent and ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is remarkable that exposure of MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to 1% O2, which is comparable to the median pO2 in advanced breast cancers, decreased the m6A content of the total cellular RNA pool by as much as one third within only 24 h (Fig 1 FI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our studies have demonstrated a critical role for ALKBH5 in mediating NANOG expression and BCSC specification and/or maintenance within the hypoxic microenvironment of human breast cancer orthotopic tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALKBH5 expression was induced by hypoxia in ER+ (MCF-7) and ER (MDA-MB-231, SUM-159, and MDA-MB-435) cells, but not in other ER+ (T47D, ZR75.1, and BT-474) and ER (HCC-1954 and SUM-149) cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to determine whether FTO, the other known m6A demethylase, is induced by hypoxia in these latter cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that shRNA-mediated inhibition of NANOG expression in MDA-MB-231 cells results in a profound depletion of BCSCs (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High NANOG mRNA (23) or protein (41) expression in primary human breast cancers is significantly associated with increased patient mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other groups have implicated HIFs in the direct transcriptional activation of NANOG and other genes encoding pluripotency factors, both in human ESCs (42) and human cancer cells (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that expression of ALKBH5 was necessary (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) and sufficient (Fig 5) to mediate a posttranscriptional induction of NANOG expression and BCSC enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with prior studies, these results suggest that HIFs may coordinately regulate NANOG expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in hypoxic breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other HIF-regulated genes may also encode ALKBH5-regulated mRNAs, as dual regulation by HIFs and ALKBH5 provides a means to rapidly accumulate a target mRNA by coordinately increasing its production and decreasing its destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A single multiprotein complex (consisting of METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP) mediates m6A modification of RNA, whereas two different proteins (FTO and ALKBH5) mediate demethylation, and it is not known whether FTO and ALKBH5 have distinct or redundant functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of ALKBH5 expression in hypoxic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells increased the m6A content of the total cellular RNA pool by as much as one third (Fig 1 H and I), indicating that ALKBH5 plays a major role in regulating RNA methylation in human breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it should be noted that, in addition to activating transcription of the RNA demethylase ALKBH5, HIFs also regulate the expression of two other O2-dependent dioxygenases that play key roles in breast cancer metastasis and stem cell maintenance (43, 44): JMJD2C, which mediates demethylation of histones (45), and TET1, which mediates hydroxymethylation of DNA (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting that, in the absence of HIFs, the activity of these dioxygenases should decline under hypoxic conditions as a result of reduced substrate (i.e., O2) availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HIF activity does not merely compensate for reduced O2 levels but significantly increases ALKBH5, JMJD2C, and TET1 activity in hypoxic breast cancer cells, leading to transcriptional and posttranscriptional changes in gene expression that promote the specification and/or maintenance of BCSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to O2, these dioxygenases use -ketoglutarate as a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are warranted to investigate whether competitive antagonists of -ketoglutarate that inhibit ALKBH5 (and possibly other dioxygenases) might be useful as anticancer agents that target BCSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and T47D cells were cultured in DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BT-474, HCC-1954, and ZR75.1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SUM-149 and SUM-159 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (50:50) media supplemented with hydrocortisone and insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All culture media were supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator [20% (vol/vol) O2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hypoxia exposure, cells were placed in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg), which was flushed for 2 min at 2 psi with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RT-qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA synthesis was performed using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed by using the following primers: ALKBH5, 5-CGG CGA AGG CTA CAC TTA CG-3 and 5-CCA CCA GCT TTT GGA TCA CCA-3; NANOG, 5-TTT GTG GGC CTG AAG AAA ACT-3 and 5-AGG GCT GTC CTG AAT AAG CAG-3; and 18S rRNA, 5-CGG CGA CGA CCC ATT CGA AC-3 and 5-GAA TCG AAC CCT GAT TCC CCG TC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, the ratio of NANOG mRNA:18S rRNA was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Measurement_of_Total_m6A_and_m6A+_NANOG_mRNA_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total m6A content was measured in 200-ng aliquots of total RNA extracted from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 subclones using an m6A RNA methylation quantification kit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-9005; Epigentek) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure m6A+ NANOG mRNA levels, m6A immunoprecipitation was performed as described before (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1-µg aliquot of m6A antibody was conjugated to protein A-agarose slurry (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 100-g aliquot of total RNA was incubated with the antibody in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, 750 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Igepal CA-630) supplemented with RNase inhibitor for 3 h at 4 °C, RNA was eluted from the beads by incubation in 300 L of elution buffer (5 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% SDS) with 4.2 L of proteinase K for 1.5 h at 50 °C, and m6A+ RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed by RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for detection for m6A+ NANOG mRNA were as follows: 5-ATG CAA CCT GAA GAC GTG TG-3 and 5-GAG ATT GAC TGG ATG GGC AT-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Luciferase_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The luciferase coding sequence NANOG 3-UTR reporter (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S807466) and luciferase coding sequence-only reporter (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S890005) were purchased from SwitchGear Genomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and transfected with luciferase-NANOG 3-UTR reporter or luciferase-only reporter, and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a commercial kit (SwitchGear Genomics) and is presented as the activity ratio of luciferase-NANOG 3-UTR to luciferase only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenine-to-thymine mutation of the luciferase-NANOG 3-UTR reporter plasmid was performed by using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mammosphere_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured cells were trypsinized, whereas tumor tissue was minced and digested with 1 mg/mL of type 1 collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min to prepare single-cell suspensions, which were seeded in six-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) at a density of 5,000 cells per milliliter in Complete MammoCult Medium (Stem Cell Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 7 d, the cells were photographed under an Olympus TH4-100 microscope, and primary mammospheres (diameter 70 m) were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For secondary mammosphere formation, primary mammospheres were trypsinized, plated at a density of 5,000 cells per milliliter, incubated for 7 d, and counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
