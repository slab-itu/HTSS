Time-resolved 2-million-year-old supernova activity discovered in Earths microfossil record  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Massive stars, which terminate their evolution in a cataclysmic explosion called a type-II supernova, are the nuclear engines of galactic nucleosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the elemental species known to be produced in these stars, the radioisotope 60Fe stands out: This radioisotope has no natural, terrestrial production mechanisms; thus, a detection of 60Fe atoms within terrestrial reservoirs is proof for the direct deposition of supernova material within our solar system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report, in this work, the direct detection of live 60Fe atoms in biologically produced nanocrystals of magnetite, which we selectively extracted from two Pacific Ocean sediment cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the arrival of supernova material on Earth coincides with the lower Pleistocene boundary (2.7 Ma) and that it terminates around 1.7 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Massive stars (M10M), which terminate their evolution as core-collapse supernovae, are theoretically predicted to eject  greater than 105M of the radioisotope 60Fe (half-life 2.61 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such an event occurs sufficiently close to our solar system, traces of the supernova debris could be deposited on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we report a time-resolved 60Fe signal residing, at least partially, in a biogenic reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using accelerator mass spectrometry, this signal was found through the direct detection of live 60Fe atoms contained within secondary iron oxides, among which are magnetofossils, the fossilized chains of magnetite crystals produced by magnetotactic bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetofossils were chemically extracted from two Pacific Ocean sediment drill cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the 60Fe signal onset occurs around 2.6 Ma to 2.8 Ma, near the lower Pleistocene boundary, terminates around 1.7 Ma, and peaks at about 2.2 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our search for a biogenic SN signal, we selected two sediment cores, core 848 and core 851, from the equatorial Pacific (2°59.6S, 110°29W, 3.87 km water depth), recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) during Leg 138 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediment of both cores is a pelagic carbonate (60% to 80% CaCO3, 20% to 30% SiO2) with a total iron content of 1.5 wt% to 3.5 wt% (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cores are characterized by an excellent biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic record and almost constant sedimentation rates of (6.1±0.1) m/Ma and (19.3±0.2) m/Ma for cores 848 and 851, respectively, over the 1.7- to 2.7-Ma age range of interest (42), as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of magnetofossils in these cores was confirmed by electron microscopy and magnetic analysis techniques based on first-order reversal curve (FORC) measurements (29, 34) (see Supporting Information and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average magnetofossil Fe concentration over the 1.7-Ma to 3.4-Ma interval was determined to be 25 g/g to 30 g/g for core 848, and 15 g/g to 20 g/g for core 851.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with a constant sedimentation rate (Fig 1) and sediment composition (43), the lack of significant magnetofossil concentration variations (see Supporting Information and Fig S1), both absolute and relative to other magnetic Fe minerals, indicates that the depositional environment was stable during the period under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional confirmation of stable sedimentation conditions was obtained by measurements of the 10Be/9Be ratio in representative samples of core 851, which show no significant deviation from exponential radioactive decay (see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To maximize the 60Fe/Fe atom ratio, a highly selective version of the CBD protocol (37) was developed (see Supporting Information); it is a very mild chemical leaching technique, able to completely dissolve secondary iron oxides such as magnetofossils, while leaving larger grains, which may not contain 60Fe, essentially intact (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 27% of the total Fe extracted with this technique is contained in magnetofossils (29), which therefore represent a significant contribution to the analyzed Fe pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with this carefully designed extraction protocol, the expected 60Fe concentrations are so low that the only viable measurement technique is ultrasensitive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), which has been carried out at the Gas-filled Analyzing Magnet System (GAMS) setup (44) at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratory (MLL) in Garching, Germany, over several beamtimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MLL features a 14-MV MP Tandem accelerator with an energy stability of E/E104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For AMS measurements of 60Fe, the samples are prepared as Fe2O3 powder mixed 50/50 by volume with Ag powder (120 mesh, lot J07W011; Alfa Aesar), which is subsequently hammered into a 1.5-mm-wide hole, drilled into a silver sample holder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fe was extracted as FeO from a single-cathode, cesium sputter ion source, and was injected into the accelerator after a preacceleration to 178 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tandem terminal voltage for the experiments described here ranged between 11 MV and 12 MV, which favored selection of the charge state 10+ for the radioisotope 60Fe after passing through a 4-m-thick carbon stripper foil at the accelerator terminal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A charge state of 9+ was selected for the stable beam of 54Fe, because it has nearly the same magnetic rigidity as 60Fe10+ at nearly the same terminal voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After acceleration to 110 MeV to 130 MeV (depending on the available terminal voltage), the ions exit the accelerator and pass through a 90 degree dipole magnet for selection of the correct magnetic rigidity, and subsequently pass through two Wien velocity filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the ions are directed toward the dedicated GAMS beamline by way of a switching magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through use of the GAMS magnet, the challenging suppression of the stable isobar 60Ni is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GAMS magnet chamber is filled with 4 mbar to 7 mbar of N2 gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through electron exchange reactions with the N2 gas, each ion species adopts an equilibrium charge state distribution that depends on its atomic number Z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, isobars will be forced on different trajectories if a magnetic field is applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because 60Fe and 60Ni have Z=2, their trajectories on the exit side of the magnet can be spatially separated by 10 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GAMS magnetic field can then be adjusted to make 60Fe enter the particle identification detector, while most 60Ni is blocked using a suitable aperture in front of the detector entrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detector itself is an ionization chamber featuring a Frisch grid and a fivefold split anode and is filled with 30 mbar to 50 mbar of isobutane as an ionization medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual 60Fe ions can thus be identified by their energy deposition (Bragg curve), which is described in more detail in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measurements of the atom ratio 60Fe/Fe, the stable beam of 54Fe9+ is tuned into a Faraday cup in front of the GAMS, where the typical electrical current is 30 nA to 150 nA (sample-dependent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the tandem terminal voltage and the injector magnet are switched to allow 60Fe10+ to pass, and the Faraday cup is retracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 60Fe ions are then individually identified and counted in the ionization chamber, while the 60Ni background count rate is only about 10 Hz to 100 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, a highly selective discrimination of 60Fe against 60Ni and other background sources is achieved, as demonstrated by the extremely low blank levels obtained with different blank materials, such as processing blanks and environmental samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of 60Fe/Fe is calculated from the number of 60Fe events counted by the detector, the measurement time, and the average current of 54Fe9+ in front of the GAMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmission efficiency between the Faraday cup and the ionization chamber is canceled out by relating the measured concentration to the known concentration of a standard sample, which is measured periodically during a beamtime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this work, the standard sample PSI-12, with a concentration F60e/Fe=(1.25±0.06)×1012, was used (see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmission efficiency of the entire system (including ion source yield, stripping yield, ion optical transmissions, and software cuts) during 60Fe measurements is in the range (14)×104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 111 sediment samples (67 from core 848 and 44 from core 851), each with a mass of 35 g, were treated with our CBD protocol, yielding 5 mg AMS samples consisting of Fe2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each AMS sample was measured for an average of 4 h until the sample material was exhausted, yielding one 60Fe event, on average, and a total of 86 events integrated over both cores (42 in core 848 and 47 in core 851).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the 60Fe event selection analysis can be found in Supporting Information and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, several AMS samples have been grouped together to increase counting statistics, and our 60Fe/Fe results are displayed in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the availability of several near-surface (0 Ma to 1 Ma) and very deep (7 Ma to 8 Ma) samples in core 848, the presence of a distinct 60Fe signal could be clearly identified (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are complemented by the observation of a similar signal in core 851 (Fig 2B), which is characterized by a 1.5 times lower 60Fe/Fe ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of the 60Fe signal occurs at (2.7±0.1) Ma and is centered at (2.2±0.1) Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal termination is not as clear, because it remains slightly above the 1 blank level until around 1.5 Ma, according to the data grouping used in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed analysis averaging over both sediment cores and several data groupings yields a more conservative estimate for the termination time of (1.7±0.2) Ma; this results in a (1.0±0.3) Ma long exposure of the Earth to the influx of 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 60Fe flux, concomitant with the data of Fig 2, is shown in Fig S7 (see Supporting Information for its derivation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An overview of the collected AMS data split into three age regions (less_than1.8 Ma, 1.8 Ma to 2.6 Ma,  greater than 2.6 Ma) is shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimate for the significance of the 60Fe signal in the peak region can be obtained by applying the procedure suggested by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45 for the superposition of two Poisson processes (i.e., signal and background).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control region (no expected signal), we selected (i) the processing blank and, for comparison, (ii) the less_than1.8-Ma age interval of each respective sediment core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second choice is rather conservative, because this overestimates the background signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of i, the procedure yields a significance (in multiples of ) of 5.2 and 3.9 for cores 848 and 851, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ii, these values become 7.2 and 2.0 (after subtraction of the blank level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance for core 851 is low in the case of ii, because only little data were collected in the control region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A useful measure for the intensity of the total 60Fe exposure is given by the terrestrial (ter) fluence of 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ter represents the time-integrated, decay-corrected flux of 60Fe into a given terrestrial reservoir over the entire exposure time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To sum up the contributions of all sediment layers in the signal range, the following integral is computed to calculate the average concentration of 60Fe/Fe in the signal range:C¯=(t2t1)1t1t2C(F60e/Fe)dt[1]The average terrestrial 60Fe fluence, ter, is then given byter=C¯rsed(t2t1)YCBDNA/WFe,[2]where  is the dry sediment density, rsed is the sedimentation rate, YCBD is the efficiency-corrected CBD yield of extracted iron per unit mass of dry sediment, NA is Avogadros number, and WFe is the molecular weight of iron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using (t2t1)=(1.0±0.3) Ma as a nominal signal duration results in a terrestrial fluence into our sediments of ter848=(4.7±1.6)×105 atoms per square centimeter (at/cm2) and ter851=(8.8±2.9)×105 at/cm2 for cores 848 and 851, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slightly different values and larger errors compared with Table 1 result from an averaging over different exposure times (t2t1), whereas the fluences in Table 1 were calculated for a fixed (t2t1)=0.8 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the following discussion, we use the error-weighted mean of the fluences determined in both sediment cores, which is tersed=(5.6±1.8)×105 at/cm2 (taking into account an additional 10% uncertainty for the signal duration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare this result with the fluence obtained by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 for the Pacific Ocean FeMn crust, several correction factors must first be applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since those results were published, the half-life of 60Fe has undergone a revision (2, 3); the half-life of 10Be, which was used to convert the crust growth rate to geological time, has also been redetermined (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A correction for the different 60Fe standard samples used (which became available due to advanced cross-calibration measurements) must also be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting, decay-corrected, terrestrial fluence derived from the FeMn crust now becomes tercrust=(2.5±1.3)×106 at/cm2, which is about a factor of 4 to 5 higher than our result and does not take an uptake efficiency for Fe of the FeMn crust into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, another recently reported fluence value deduced from Indian Ocean sediments (48) (terind=(35.4±2.6)×106 at/cm2) is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the value reported in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible explanations for such differences are (i) a nonuniform 60Fe deposition at the respective locations of the geological reservoirs (see, e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) and (ii) a selective chemical Fe uptake from bottom water currents at certain locations leading to fluence values above those related to the depositional flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have extracted magnetofossils and other iron-bearing secondary minerals from two Pacific Ocean sediment cores, 848 and 851 of the ODP Leg 138.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using AMS on samples derived from these mineral phases, we have detected a time-resolved 60Fe signal, and this signal coincides with independently observed ones in a deep ocean FeMn crust (11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In view of our results here, we would also note that the North Atlantic sediment results of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 possibly show a weak 60Fe signal in the same time range as ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, two other studies have found a compatible 60Fe signature in lunar samples (13) and in Indian Ocean marine sediments (48), with high statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results derive from two independent Pacific Ocean sediment cores, each possessing a continuous time record spanning the entire time window of the 60Fe signal and with no detectable changes in sedimentation rate (Fig 1 and Fig S8), no detectable changes of the depositional environment, and a relatively constant concentration of magnetofossils (Fig S1 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) across the time span of the 60Fe signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, our cores 848 and 851 data should be faithful recorders of the temporal profile of the SN material during its arrival on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S7 (see Supporting Information) shows the half-life corrected flux of 60Fe into the sediments and, thus, represents the intrinsic temporal structure of the 60Fe signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our Fe extraction protocol specifically targets authigenic Fe oxides including magnetofossils, rather than the total Fe mineral pool (which is 3% of dry sediment mass), as would aggressive leaching procedures, we potentially avoided a 60Fe dilution by up to approximately two orders of magnitude, because the majority of the total Fe mass is of detrital origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is supported by the fact that only 1% of the total Fe mineral pool is extracted by the CBD procedure (see Supporting Information), which, as seen with magnetic minerals, does not leach lithogenic minerals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a strong dilution would have placed our 60Fe/Fe ratio below the blank level, and thereby beyond detectability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We attribute this 60Fe signal to SN provenance, rather than to micrometeorites, for the following reasons: First, MTB are expected to obtain their iron budget from poorly crystalline hydroxides (see Supporting Information), and not from silicate and magnetite micrometeorite grains of  greater than 20 m diameter (14); second, our CBD protocol was designed to selectively dissolve only fine-grained magnetite less than 200 nm in size, thereby avoiding dissolution of any large-scale micrometeorites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the F60e we have extracted cannot be from such micrometeorites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Local Bubble (50) is a low-density cavity 150 parsecs (pc; 1 pc = 3.09 × 1016 m) in diameter, within the interstellar medium of our galactic arm, in which the solar system presently finds itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been carved out by a succession of 20 SNs over the course of the last 10 Ma, likely having originated from progenitors in the ScorpiusCentaurus OB star association (50, 51), a gravitationally unbound cluster of stars 50 pc in radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses (51, 52) of the relative motion of this star association have shown that, around 2.3 Ma, it was located at a minimum distance of 100 pc from the solar system, making it the most plausible host for any SN responsible for our F60e signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geological time span covered by our F60e signal is intriguing, in that there is an established and overlapping marine extinction event of mollusks (53, 54), marine snails (55), and bivalve fauna (56, 57), in addition to a coeval global cooling period (5658).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question whether this SN could have contributed to this extinction has been previously raised (51), where it is considered that a SN-induced UV-B catastrophe (59), and its concomitant knock-on effects in the marine biosphere via phytoplankton die off, could have been a proximate factor in this extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consensus now indicates that a canonical CCSN would need to be within 10 pc of our solar system for there to be a significant and lasting depletion of the ozone layer strong enough to give rise to sudden extinction events (6062), disfavoring a direct and sudden causal connection, such as a UV-B catastrophe, between a ScorpiusCentaurus CCSN and the Plio-Pleistocene marine extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sedimentary_Fe_Cycle_and_Fe-Reducing_Bacteria__Core_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment cores suitable for an 60Fe search should contain the maximum possible 60Fe/Fe atom ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a homogeneous 60Fe flux over Earths surface, a maximum 60Fe/Fe atom ratio corresponds to a minimum of terrestrial Fe inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because such inputs originate mainly from continents in the forms of river discharge and dust (63), pelagic sediments with a continuous sedimentation record over the time of interest (e.g., 1.7 Ma to 2.7 Ma) represent the preferred source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, selected cores must not have been subjected to major Fe mobilization events, e.g., by reductive diagenesis (35), because such events would redistribute Fe over a much larger depth range, causing (i) 60Fe dilution, possibly below the detection limit, and (ii) incorrect deductions about the event dating and timing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic iron minerals, and, in particular, the most strongly magnetic one, magnetite (Fe3O4), are ideally suited for a systematic characterization of whole core sections to check the above-mentioned requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a distinction can be made between coarse primary magnetite crystals originating from rock erosion, on one hand, and fine secondary magnetite crystals forming in the water column and the topmost sediment layers, on the other hand (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6466).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter crystals grow in aqueous solution, inorganically and/or by bacterial mediation, from easily mobilizable Fe sources (23, 33, 67, 68), which include 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The magnetic properties of magnetite crystals depend on their magnetic domain configuration, which is mainly controlled by the crystal size with the following approximate ranges at room temperature: (i) less_than20 nm unstable (superparamagnetic) single domain (SD), (ii) 20 nm stable SD to 100 nm stable SD, (iii) 0.1 m to 1 m pseudo-SD, and (iv)  greater than 1 m multidomain (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the grain size distribution of secondary magnetite extends almost exclusively over ranges i and ii (7174) the origin of sedimentary magnetite can be verified with magnetic measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such measurements have allowed us to characterize and quantify the secondary and biogenic magnetite of our sediment cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A precise but time-consuming characterization method is described in Magnetofossil Detection and Quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A much faster technique suitable for characterizing the magnetic mineralogy of whole core sections consists in imparting, in the laboratory, a so-called anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), which is very selective toward stable-single domain crystals (75), and normalizing it with a so-called isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), which magnetizes all grain size ranges except those of previously mentioned category i (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  66 and 76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARM is acquired in a slowly decaying alternating magnetic field superimposed to a small constant bias field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used alternating fields with an initial amplitude of 0.1 T and a bias field hDC=0.1 mT, which correspond to typical settings reported in the literature (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, IRM was acquired applying a field of 0.1 T or 1 T using an electromagnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARM and IRM imparted to dried sediment powder pressed into plastic containers have been measured with a 2G Enterprises 755 SRM (superconducting rock magnetometer) at the paleomagnetic laboratory (77) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This magnetometer has a sensitivity of 10 pAm2, which is fully sufficient for measuring the magnetic moment ( greater than 50 nAm2) of the imparted magnetizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because ARM intensity is proportional to hDC, the ARM/IRM ratio is usually expressed through the so-called ARM susceptibility ARM, which is the ARM divided by hDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, ARM/IRM is a grain-size-sensitive parameter with values  3 mA/m characteristic for well-dispersed, inorganic SD magnetite crystals (75) and magnetofossils (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetofossil-bearing sediments are systematically characterized by ARM/IRM  greater than  1 mA/m (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ODP cores 848 and 851 considered in this work fulfill this condition over the whole age range under consideration, 1.7 Ma to 2.7 Ma (34) (see also Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Magnetofossil_Detection_and_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reliable magnetofossil detection requires a combination of at least two techniques: (i) TEM observation of magnetic extracts, which serves as a proof for the presence of magnetite crystals with the proper morphology and chemical purity, and (ii) magnetic characterization of the bulk sediment for a semiquantitative assessment of magnetofossil abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For better quantification of secondary Fe sources and, in particular, magnetofossils, we also relied on selective chemical extraction as explained in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEM_and_TEM_Observations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of the extremely low concentration of magnetofossils in the sediment samples (15 g/g to 35 g/g), their observation with the electron microscope is only possible after proper magnetic extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic extraction apparatus was built according to the design of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79, which is, in turn, similar to other devices used for the same purpose (80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extraction procedure starts with the dispersion of 7 g of sediment in 2 L of distilled and deionized water with an ultrasonic rod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this step, the sediment suspension is constantly circulated by a peristaltic pump through a glass extraction vessel with a watertight opening in which a magnetic finger, covered by a teflon sleeve, is inserted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong magnetic field gradient in the proximity of the fingertip attracts suspended magnetic particles so that they adhere to the Teflon surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h of continuous circulation of the sediment suspension, the magnetic finger is removed, and the collected material (1 mg to 2 mg) is easily harvested once the Teflon sleeve is removed from the magnetic fingertip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iron concentration in the magnetic extract is low (a few percent), due to electrostatic adhesion of magnetite crystals to sediment particles (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  81) and incomplete extraction, but is sufficient for electron microscope observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses, were performed at the Chemistry Department of Technische Universität München for three samples of core 851 in the 2.41-Ma to 2.62-Ma age interval where 60Fe has been found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM images (Fig S2) reveal the presence of large ( greater than 5 m) grains of CaCO3 and SiO2, as well as diatom skeletons, which reflect the typical composition of these pelagic carbonates (82, 83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large magnetic minerals of lithogenic origin (e.g., titanomagnetite) can also be recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM images, on the other hand, show abundant iron oxide crystals whose size and shape match those of equidimensional, prismatic, and tooth-shaped magnetosomes (Fig S3) (22, 73, 84, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EDX mapping of Fe and O matches with these crystals, making them compatible with a magnetite (Fe3O4) composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few fragments of the original chain structure can be recognized; however, the original structures are not likely to be preserved by the magnetic extraction procedure, as seen from the comparison of magnetic signatures of extracts (86) with respect to that of chemically extractable single-domain magnetite as explained in Detailed Magnetic Characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed magnetofossil crystals are extremely well preserved, completely lacking corrosion signs indicative of incipient reductive diagenesis (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detailed_Magnetic_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electron microscopy of magnetic extracts does not enable quantitative assessments of magnetofossil concentration, especially in relation to lithogenic minerals, nor is it possible to obtain information about the structural integrity of chains, due to the necessity of a possibly disruptive magnetic extraction for sample preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our electron microscopy observations have been integrated with the most advanced magnetic characterization techniques based on the measurement of partial magnetic hysteresis, in the form of so-called FORC (88, 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These curves sweep the whole area enclosed by the major hysteresis loop, thereby enabling a systematic investigation of irreversible magnetic processes, which can be represented as a 2D function (90) called a FORC distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of the Preisach theory (91), each value of the FORC distribution f(Hc,Hb) represents the contribution of an elemental rectangular hysteresis loop (hysteron) with coercivity Hc and horizontal bias field Hb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of uniaxial SD particles, hysterons approximate the hysteresis loops of individual crystals (92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hysterons no longer have a physical meaning in the case of other magnetic systems; however, natural particle assemblages have typical FORC signatures that reflect their domain state (93) and, to a certain extent, mineralogical composition (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The advantage of FORC distributions over other magnetic measurements resides in the fact that the signatures of specific magnetic mineral components remain recognizable also in the case of complex mixtures (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly true for SD magnetite particles and magnetosome chains that are well dispersed in a sediment matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, their signature consists of a sharp horizontal ridge at Hb=0 (31, 96), which can be separated from other contributions using appropriate numerical procedures (97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separated central ridge is a pure coercivity distribution from which the total saturation magnetization of SD particles contributing to it can be calculated (31), obtaining a direct estimate of their mass concentration in sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique has become a standard method for magnetofossil detection, revealing magnetofossils widespread occurrence in marine and freshwater sediments (28, 98, 99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed FORC investigation of sediment material from the 1.7-Ma to 3.8-Ma age interval of core 848 has been reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the FORC analysis protocol of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  97 has been applied to the untreated sediment material, and to the same material after selective dissolution of ultrafine magnetite particles with a CBD solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this treatment removes most secondary Fe minerals while leaving large lithogenic crystals intact (38, 39), it provides an independent manner for identifying magnetofossils and other secondary magnetite crystals, thereby excluding possible contributions from SD magnetite particles enclosed in primary silicate minerals, which would not contain 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of FORC analysis results from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29 is provided in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main outcomes of such analysis are summarized in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


60Fe_AMS_Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main goal of the chemical extraction and purification procedure was the production of AMS samples with a 60Fe/Fe ratio being as close as possible to the ratio in the targeted minerals, namely, secondary iron oxides such as magnetofossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires that dilution with stable Fe from other sources be minimized, and that no contaminations with 60Fe from other sources can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following procedure has been shown to accomplish these goals remarkably well, as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, where a more detailed description can be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the preparation of the CBD procedure, 35 g of dry sediment were crushed in an agate mortar and then added to 200 mL of distilled and deionized H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under constant stirring, the temperature was brought to (50±2) °C on a hot plate while adding 3.4 g of sodium bicarbonate and 12.6 g of sodium citrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction is then started by adding 5.0 g of sodium dithionite, a strong reducing agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to the concentrations suggested by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main extraction mechanism relies on Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) by sodium dithionite on mineral surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe(II) is then chelated by sodium citrate, while the pH is kept stable at 7.3 by the sodium bicarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The procedure was fine-tuned to selectively dissolve less_than200 nm Fe3O4 crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ensures that secondary iron oxides are completely dissolved, while primary ones are left essentially intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, an extraction temperature of 50 °C and an extraction time of 1 h were chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the extraction, the remaining undissolved sediment material was separated from the Fe(II) solution using filter paper of 0.1-m pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fe(II) solution [clear yellow in color due to the presence of dissolved Fe(II)] was then evaporated to dryness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To destroy the sodium citrate chelation, the sample was then heated for 1 h at 300 °C, decomposing the citrate, until a black, carbon-rich solid was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe(II) was then oxidized by adding 50 mL of HNO3 (65%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After another heating step for 1 h at 400 °C, all carbon was oxidized, and the sample became a colorless liquid that solidified upon cooling to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe(III) was then extracted using 30 mL of HCl (7.1 M), which was evaporated to dryness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 20 mL of HCl were added, and much of the organic residuals could be removed by centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step was repeated by dissolving in another 20 mL of HCl, evaporating again, adding another 20 mL of HCl, and centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the final HCl solution containing Fe(III), iron hydroxide was precipitated by adding NH3(aq) (25%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitate was washed 3 times with slightly alkaline solution (pH 8 to 9) and then redissolved in 1.5 mL of HCl (10.2 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove unwanted contaminations by other metals that might have coprecipitated, an anion exchange (DOWEX 1 × 8) step followed; this was done similarly to the procedure described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reprecipitating the iron hydroxide and another three washing steps with deionized water, the samples were transferred to quartz crucibles and heated at 600 °C for 3 h, resulting in samples of Fe2O3 with a typical mass of 3 mg to 5 mg, sufficient to fill one AMS sample holder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recovery efficiency of this procedure was determined using commercial magnetite grains (40 nm to 60 nm, lot E08T027; Alfa Aesar) to be (85±5)%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contamination with stable Fe from the chemical reagents of this entire procedure was found to be less than 0.05 mg per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ion_Source  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ion source used for the experiments described here is a homemade (105), single-cathode, Middleton-type (106) cesium sputter ion source with a spherical ionizer (107) optimized for optimum mass resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cs vapor is ionized on the tantalum ionizer and accelerated toward the sample using a 5-kV sputtering voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative ion beam is then extracted by applying an additional voltage of 23 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After preliminary mass separation by a dipole magnet, a beam of 54FeO is selected and directed toward the accelerator entrance with several electrostatic lenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a further preacceleration to 178 keV, this beam is injected into the accelerator, at which point the typical electrical current of 54FeO is 30 nA to 150 nA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ionization_Chamber  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The particle identification detector is an ionization chamber filled with 40 mbar to 60 mbar of isobutane, featuring a fivefold split anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two anodes sections are additionally split diagonally, to provide the horizontal entrance position (henceforth, X-position) and horizontal entrance angle of the incoming particles by comparing the left and right energy loss signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle discrimination is possible using the five Ei anode signals, the Frisch grid signal (proportional to the sum of all Ei signals), and the X-position along with the horizontal and vertical entrance angles of the incident particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrimination between the detector signals, from each anode, arising from the passage of ions of different atomic charge is possible on the basis of differential ionization energy loss (Bragg curve spectroscopy) of the ions passing through the detector gas; this also provides additional discrimination between the isobars 60Fe and 60Ni because they differ in their proton number, but also between different isotopes of the same element and other background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Standard_Sample  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all measurements discussed in this work, 60Fe was measured relative to the standard sample PSI-12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting point for the production of this standard was material extracted from a beam-dump at the Paul Scherrer Institute that was later used for the half-life measurement of 60Fe in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high concentration of 60Fe/Fe was precisely measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This material was diluted, by introducing stable Fe, to a ratio of 60Fe/Fe =(1.25±0.06)×1012 and referred to as PSI-12 for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid cross-talk in the ion source, during each standard run (about every 3 h), only about 200 events of 60Fe are recorded, because the exposure of the ion source to a highly concentrated sample (in this case, four to five orders of magnitude above the blank level) must be minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of cross-talk was examined by first sputtering a sample with a concentration of 60Fe/Fe 109 for 20 min (typical time for a standard measurement) and subsequently measuring a blank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, cross-talk from one sample to the next could be determined to be 106.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

60Fe_Event_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 60Fe events from the standard sample PSI-12 allow for empirically constructing, for each anode and the Frisch grid, their respective distribution/histogram of collected ionization charge from the transit of 60Fe in the ionization chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing these distributions/histograms then allows for the identification of 60Fe from the actual sediment samples, which are of much lower 60Fe concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure is illustrated in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, the distribution of collected ionization charge on each anode (Frisch grid), arising from 60Fe events from the PSI-12 standard sample, is very similar in shape to a normal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they are each characterized by their own centroid i and width i, both of which are determined from a Gaussian fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the 6D space of the energy signals of an event in the ionization chamber, it is useful to introduce a 2 value defined as the sum of squared deviations of a candidate 60Fe events charge signal in a given anode (or Frisch grid) from the known centroid value of actual 60Fe charge signals, i, in that same anode (or Frisch grid), normalized to the known corresponding characteristic width, i, of 60Fe charge signals in that anode; namely,2=i=05(Eii)2i2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, Ei represent the six energy signals from the detector (with E0 corresponding to the Frisch grid signal) for the candidate event of 60Fe under consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum of the 2 distribution for the standard sample is not (as would be expected for a 2 distribution with six degrees of freedom) about 4, but rather around 2.5, as shown in Fig S6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy can be explained by taking into account that the energy signals are not completely independent and that, for some parameters, the tails of the distributions are not in the accepted signal range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the 2 value of a candidate event has high predictive power, i.e., a low 2 favors a real 60Fe event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases of 60Fe measurements, a 1D cut on the 2 (accepting only events with 2less_than15), combined with a 2D cut on the X-position and one of the energy signals (choosing the one with best separationtypically E3) was sufficient for event discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2 distributions obtained from the 60Fe events from both the standard sample and all sediment samples can be seen in Fig S6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both distributions agree extremely well, confirming the authenticity of the observed 60Fe signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion_of_AMS_Uncertainties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All AMS results in this work are presented with 1 confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the measurements relative to a standard sample, all systematic uncertainties related to transmissions and efficiencies cancel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only systematic uncertainty that cannot be avoided is the uncertainty of the concentration of the standard sample itself (4.8%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would, however, only shift all of the AMS 60Fe/Fe data up or down and was thus omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The statistical errors that were included in all AMS results have several origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low count rate of 60Fe events is the main source of uncertainty; this was treated by using the confidence intervals suggested by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  108 for zero background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainty in the ion current reading was estimated to be 15% in each data run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the fluctuation of the atom ratio 60Fe/Fe measured in the standard sample was typically 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 20% uncertainty is added due to the unknown behavior of the ion current during runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an average of four data runs per sample, the quadratic summation yields a statistical uncertainty of 15% for each sample, which is a rather conservative estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each data point (e.g., grouped samples in Fig 2), this number is divided by the square root of the number of samples used to produce the grouped data point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is then added in quadrature to the relative uncertainty of the confidence intervals given by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  108, except in the case of zero events, where the 1 upper limit of 1.29 events is conservatively increased in all cases by 0.15 (corresponding to 15% at one event) to yield 1.44 events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The horizontal error bar associated with each data point in the 60Fe/Fe plots (Fig 2 and Fig S7) represents the timespan interval over which raw sediment material was used in our CBD protocol to obtain a sufficiently large mass of Fe2O3 extract suitable for an AMS sample (at least 3 mg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abscissa of each data point results from an averaging over the ages of the individual samples used in the grouping, where each sample's age is correspondingly weighted by the collected statistics of that sample (i.e., the product of average beam current and measuring time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systematic uncertainty in core dating is not included in these error bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible data grouping is shown in Fig S7, after correction for radioactive decay of 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Temporal_Structure_of_the60Fe_Signal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To extract the temporal structure of the 60Fe input into the sediment samples, the obtained 60Fe/Fe AMS data have to be corrected for the blank level and the radioactive decay of 60Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the established constant sedimentation rates (Fig 1), this ratio is directly proportional to the deposition rate of 60Fe atoms, as shown in Table 1 for representative time intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deposition rates corresponding to the data grouping of Fig 2 are shown in Fig S7 and take into account variations in the CBD-extracted Fe yield of every AMS sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Preparation_and_10Be_Measurements_at_Dresden_Accelerator_Mass_Spectrometry_Facility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further independently establish the constancy of the sedimentation rate, 13 sediment samples of core 851, in the depth (age) range 1.7 Ma to 3.0 Ma, were analyzed for 10Be [t1/2=1.387 Ma (46, 47)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10Be is mainly produced in atmospheric spallation reactions and can be transported to Earths surface by dust, rain, and snow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once 10Be is deposited into geological reservoirs such as ice cores and marine sediments, it can be used for dating over several million years (109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From each depth, 3 g of sediment were subjected to a hydroxylamine-based leaching technique, described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  110.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AMS measurements of 10Be were performed at the Dresden Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, using the procedure described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determined concentrations of 10Be/9Be follow the general trend of the exponential decay, which is expected for an undisturbed core of constant sedimentation rate; this is shown in Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponential fit to the data using the known B10e half-life produces a reduced 2 of 1.25, and no significant deviation from an exponential decay as a function of age is evident, demonstrating again that our cores are characterized by constant sedimentation rates across the time window spanning 1.7 Ma to 3.0 Ma, consistent with the magnetostratigraphic models of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42 and Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
