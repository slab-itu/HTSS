Nutrition mediates the expression of cultivarfarmer conflict in a fungus-growing ant  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early subsistence farming implied significant physiological challenges for Neolithic farmers until they genetically isolated their crops through artificial selection and polyploidization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attine ants faced analogous challenges when they adopted fungus farming 5560 Mya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas evolutionarily derived attine lineages irreversibly domesticated cultivars approximately 25 Mya and ultimately realized industrial-scale farming, basal lineages retained small-scale farming, diversified, and now coexist with advanced fungus-farmers in most New World tropical ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that management of independent sexual reproduction in cultivars constrained farming productivity, echoing early human farming of unspecialized low-productivity crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of cultivar gene exchange with nondomesticated relatives likely reduced hostsymbiont conflict over reproduction, fostering the rise of ecologically dominant ant-agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Attine ants evolved farming 5560 My before humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although evolutionarily derived leafcutter ants achieved industrial-scale farming, extant species from basal attine genera continue to farm loosely domesticated fungal cultivars capable of pursuing independent reproductive interests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used feeding experiments with the basal attine Mycocepurus smithii to test whether reproductive allocation conflicts between farmers and cultivars constrain crop yield, possibly explaining why their mutualism has remained limited in scale and productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stoichiometric and geometric framework approaches showed that carbohydrate-rich substrates maximize growth of both edible hyphae and inedible mushrooms, but that modest protein provisioning can suppress mushroom formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worker foraging was consistent with maximizing long-term cultivar performance: ant farmers could neither increase carbohydrate provisioning without cultivars allocating the excess toward mushroom production, nor increase protein provisioning without compromising somatic cultivar growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm that phylogenetically basal attine farming has been very successful over evolutionary time, but that unresolved hostsymbiont conflict may have precluded these wild-type symbioses from rising to ecological dominance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That status was achieved by the evolutionarily derived leafcutter ants following full domestication of a coevolving cultivar 3035 Mya after the first attine ants committed to farming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Question_1__What_Nutritional_Blends_Maximize_Fungal_Cultivar_Performance_in_Vitro?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We mapped somatic (hyphal) and reproductive (mushroom) growth of fungal Petri dish cultures isolated from a M. smithii colony across a landscape of 36 agar-based diets varying in P:C ratio (1:99:1) and P + C concentration (8 g/L60 g/L) (diets modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) (SI Methods and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fungal somatic growth was maximized by a high-carbohydrate blend (1:3 P:C1:9 P:C) and constrained by protein in excess of 20 g/L (Fig 1A and Tables S2S4), indicating that ant farmers can maximize crop growth rates by harvesting carbohydrate-biased substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likelihood of mushroom production was also highest at P:C ratios from 1:31:9, but became already inhibited by absolute protein amounts  greater than 10 g/L (Fig 1B and Table S2S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the greater protein tolerance of hyphal growth (less_than20 g/L) relative to mushroom production (less_than10 g/L) appears to provide a means by which ant farmers can nutritionally resolve potential allocation conflicts with their crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Question_2__Do_Ant_Farmers_Prioritize_Harvesting_Proteins_and_Carbohydrates_Based_on_Their_Distinct_Effects_on_Somatic_and_Reproductive_Growth_of_Fungal_Cultivars?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how foraging ants navigate the trade-offs suggested by the in vitro cultivar growth results, we performed controlled feeding experiments with entire laboratory colonies to test whether M. smithii foragers collectively blend protein and carbohydrates in amounts and ratios that promote somatic growth while inhibiting mushroom production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experiment offering colonies single P:C ratio diets of 1:6, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, or 6:1 (always at a 20 g/L protein + carbohydrate concentration) (Table S5) established that colonies tightly regulate protein harvest at low levels, while allowing for substantial variation in carbohydrate harvest across diets (Fig 2 and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By strategically prioritizing protein regulation, ant workers effectively starved their cultivars of carbohydrates when offered diets with P:C ratios  1:1, as higher intake rates would imply levels of protein harvesting that reduce yield (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the other end of the scale, the ant workers observed a rather constant upper limit of carbohydrate harvesting despite the potential for obtaining conflict-burdened cultivar growth benefits (Fig 1A) on increasingly carbohydrate-rich 1:3 and 1:6 diets (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Question_3__Do_Naturally_Available_Foraging_Targets_Allow_Farming_Ants_to_Nutritionally_Regulate_Garden_Growth_Under_Field_Conditions?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To link nutritional decisions in laboratory colonies to food particles harvested under field conditions, we performed extensive field observations of M. smithii foragers in a lowland Panamanian rainforest (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of substrate types, M. smithii workers harvested mostly insect frass, wood fragments, and small seeds (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the underlying nutritional decisions, low foraging rates (on average four workers returning to their nests with substrate per hour) resulted in small hourly amounts of substrate harvest (1.3-mg dry mass) (Table S7) with low (less_than2%) average nitrogen content per substrate fragment (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this finding, we inferred that Mycocepurus fungus gardens were provisioned with approximately 0.12-mg crude protein per hour, which translates into an average daily harvest of 1.4 mg2.4 mg depending on circadian foraging patterns (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field provisioning rates thus provide cultivars with protein amounts similar to the mixtures that produced the red and yellow areas in the left-hand parts of the heat maps that we obtained in the laboratory (SI Methods), which is intriguing because these represent regions in the P:C acquisition landscape that are compatible with simultaneous maximization of somatic cultivar growth (Fig 1A) and reproduction via mushrooms (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, foraging Mycocepurus ants also have opportunities to navigate within this P:C acquisition landscape because the typical insect frass piece exhibited 2.5-fold more protein content than small wood fragments (Table S8), and frass pieces also exhibited substantial variation in protein content (0.67%26.98%) (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nutritional variation may provide foraging Mycocepurus ants with a mechanism for enhancing hyphal growth with wood substrates while inhibiting mushroom production via carefully dosed frass provisioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Question_4__Do_Farming_Ants_Deviate_from_Maximal_Foraging_Expectations_for_Somatic_Cultivar_Growth_to_Avoid_Overt_Reproductive_Conflict_with_Their_Cultivars?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To answer this question, we examined how nutritionally variable substrates harvested by ants impacted the performance of the entire farming symbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first established that a higher proportion of protein in synthetic P:C diets gave a proportional increase in nitrogen content of the hyphal material on which the ants fed (24 = 12.45, P = 0.014) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, these higher protein concentrations in diet substrate and fungal food severely reduced performance of Mycocepurus farmers because protein-enriched crops had a higher likelihood of total failure (24 = 14.04, P = 0.007) (Fig 4 B and C, Fig S1, and Table S6), as well as higher worker mortality (Fig 3D and Table S6) and reduced brood mass of ant colonies (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, these results were unlikely to be affected by the type of cultivar because we did not detect a phylogenetic signal in somatic growth rate variation across agar plates from nine randomly selected cultivars reared by M. smithii colonies from the same population (K = 0.419; P = 0.845) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, these results confirm that the Mycocepurus farming system is generally adapted to provisioning fungus gardens with low-protein substrate and that these adaptations have made the symbiosis protein-averse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite this general aversion, workers were inclined to harvest more protein and less carbohydrate than what could have maximized somatic hyphal growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns of restrained nutrient mixing appear consistent with the necessity for farming ants to curtail potential hostsymbiont conflict over independent symbiont reproduction and with a productivity cost for the entire farming symbiosis to maintain stable mutualistic cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focal_Populations_of_M_smithii  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From May 21, 2014 to June 11, 2014, we harvested Mycocepurus smithii colonies within the Soberanía National Park, Panamá (N 9.13528, W 79.72141), locating nests entrances (holes in the ground less_than3 mm diameter) by dispersing oat-polenta bait in the leaf litter and following laden workers back to the nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Back in the laboratory, we established colonies in plastic containers with ad libitum water and ground polenta, and acclimated them to laboratory conditions at 24 °C for 6.5 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vouchers of ants (identified by D. Donoso) are stored at the Universidad de of Loja, Ecuador, and fungus from these colonies used in barcoding analyses are stored in the collection of P.W.K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fungal_Isolation__Growth_Rate__and_No-Choice_Diet_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After acclimating colonies to laboratory conditions, we used sterile forceps to remove 2-cm3 pieces of fungus from colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the fume hood, these isolates were subdivided into 2-mm3 pieces with a sterile dissecting needle and forceps, placed on 150-mm × 15-mm Petri dishes containing PDA medium (potato dextrose agar without antibiotics; Difco), and sealed with parafilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fungal isolates were monitored daily for contamination and infected portions were removed with a sterile surgical scalpel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate libraries of axenic fungi, healthy isolates were reisolated after 3 wk into smaller (60 mm × 15 mm) Petri dishes containing PDA and stored at 24 °C (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a no-choice diet experiment on fungus isolated from a colony of M. smithii (177198) (Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a bacteriological version of the diet, modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32, to prepare nine P:C diets (9:1, 6:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:6, 1:9), with protein + carbohydrates diluted to 8, 20, 40, and 60 g/L (36 total diets) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diets were prepared in 200-mL batches with distilled water and 3.2 g [1.6% (wt:vol)] bacteriological agar (Amresco), and had pH of 6.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbohydrates were provided by equal parts sucrose (Doradita cane sugar) and starch (from potato, Sigma-Aldrich), and protein was provided from equal parts bacto peptone (enzymatic digest of protein; Becton Dickinson), trypticase peptone (pancreatic digest of casein; Becton Dickinson), and bacto tryptone (pancreatic digest of casein; Becton Dickinson).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micronutrients were provided by crushed vitamin (2% of the mass of protein + carbohydrates; Centrum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ingredients were mixed with 200 mL distilled (d) water on a stirring plate for 5 min and then sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We aseptically inoculated 60-mm × 15-mm Petri dishes containing 12 mL of P:C diet with 19.6-mm2 cylindrical plugs of PDA and fungus, sealed these with parafilm (12 plates per diet by dilution combination).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every few days, we checked plates for contamination, removing infected agar from some plates, and discarding plates if overrun with contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 32 d, we photographed surviving plates and estimated fungal expansion rate (final area, square millimeters), using ImageJ (NIH Image; v1.49g) to produce threshold contrast-adjusted grayscale images and analyze particles (with pixel2 = 0.02) (as per ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was not feasible to measure change in fungal mass because fine fungal hyphae could not be accurately separated from the agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 80 d, we photographed all instances of mushroom growth (n = 47) and used percent surviving plates with mushrooms for each diet treatment as the dependent variable in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used least-square regressions with both linear and quadratic terms to evaluate how fungal expansion rates and percentages of surviving fungal plates with mushrooms varied across the 36 experimental diets (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonparametric thin-plate splines that do not constrain the shape of the response surface were determined with the fields package v.2.14.0 in R and used to generate a heat map of fungus growth and mushroom production (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological resolution of response surfaces were set to  = 0.001 as a smoothing parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Extraction_Methods_for_the_Comparative_Fungus_Growth_Rate_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next compared fungal growth rates across M. smithii colonies by first preserving small fungal samples in 95% ethyl alcohol for barcoding analyses, and then growing pure fungal cultures from nine M. smithii colonies on sealed Petri dishes with 12 mL of PDA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 d, we measured fungal growth rate as described in the P:C diet experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA from fungal symbionts was obtained by adding 1 mm2 fungus garden material to a 10% (wt/vol) Chelex Tris solution (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples where boiled at 100 °C for 1 h and stored in the freezer for further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One conserved region was selected to be amplified by PCR: the nuclear LSU, using the universal primers LR0R (5-ACC CGC TGA ACT TAA GC-3) and LR5 (5-TCC TGA GGG AAA CTT CG-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification was performed with PCR with 25 µL VWR Red Taq DNA polymerase Master Mix (VWR International), 2.5 µL forward and reverse primer each, 18 µL ddH2O, and 2 µL DNA, and a program of 5 min denaturing at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30-s denaturing at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 54 °C, and 60-s extension at 72 °C, and finally a 10-min extension at 72 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All PCR products were sequenced at BGI Europe and sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used DNA barcoding data (Table S9) to create a chronogram and test for phylogenetic signal in fungal growth rate across the nine M. smithii colonies using the ape package in R v3.0-8 (phylosig) (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we estimated Blombergs K, which indicates the amount of phylogenetic signal in branch tip data relative to a null expectation of Brownian motion for trait evolution in the chronogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA sequences were aligned with an iterative approach (i.e., simultaneous alignment and tree estimation) using SATé-II v2.2.2 (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alignments were used to estimate the fungal phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the tree estimation, the molecular model of the aligned sequences was determined using jModelTest v0.1.1 (53) and the best model was used for subsequent phylogenetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a maximum-likelihood (ML) and a Bayesian estimation of the phylogeny with Garli v2.0 (54) and MrBayes v3.4 (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bayesian approaches were performed with default settings for all priors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Markov chain-Monte Carlo analysis was run six times independently, each one with two chains of 75 million generations with a sampling rate of 1,500 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence of the runs was determined using Tracer v1.4 (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nodal support was calculated after 200 nonparametric bootstrap searches for both the ML approach and in the posterior probabilities for the Bayesian estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both methodologies gave similar tree topologies and only the ML phylogenies are provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_Substrate_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We cataloged substrates harvested by M. smithii workers in the field from November 2013 to December 2013 (the rainy season) by performing  greater than 20 h of foraging observations at 22 focal colonies in a Panamanian rainforest within Soberanía National Park (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substrate pieces were dried at 60 °C for 24 h, weighed to the nearest 1 µg on a Sartorius CP2P microbalance, and cataloged into five categories: insect frass, wood, flower fragment, small seed, and other (miscellaneous plant pieces and unknown items).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also recorded foraging rates (number of laden workers returning to their nests with substrate in their mandibles), and leaf litter surface temperature (°C) with an infrared thermometer from approximately 1 m above the ground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Elemental_Nitrogen_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From October 2014 to December 2014, we harvested additional substrate from 21 colonies of M. smithii for analysis of elemental nitrogen (%N) (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We homogenized sorted samples of substrates taken from laden returning workers, occasionally pooling tiny frass fragments across colonies to have sufficient mass (approximately 0.5 mg) for elemental analyses (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured %N with a Flash EA1112 analyzer (CE Elantech), in the laboratory of Ben Turner at the Smithsonian Tropical Institute, Panama.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also dried and homogenized samples of fungus garden collected on the first and last days of the P:C diet experiment, or on the day that colonies with failed crops were removed from the experiment, and analyzed 1-mg subsamples for %N using the analytical techniques described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole-Colony_P_C_Diet_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the days before the feeding experiments, we measured the initial mass of the colonies (adult ants + brood + fungus gardens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was not possible to initially count workers, larvae, and pupae because they were embedded inside the garden matrix, and pilot trials indicated that attempts to do so stressed the ants and caused them to discard large fractions of their gardens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus estimated initial worker number as the sum of dead workers found during the 29-d experiment and the final surviving workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was also not possible to standardize the initial size of colonies at the start of the experiment, colony sizes were evenly distributed across diet treatments (F4, 20 = 0.74; P = 0.578).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a modified protocol from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50 to prepare agar-based diets of 20 g/L dilution of protein + carbohydrates and P:C ratios from 1:66:1, spanning the range of P:C selected by ant species in other studies (33, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20-g/L macronutrient concentrations used in these experimental diets were lower than 100 g/L300 g/L concentrations used in similar geometric framework experiments with nonfarming ants (33, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these low nutrient concentrations were appropriate for the present study based on pilot studies and based on experiments from the present study linking performance of isolated fungi with substrate protein + carbohydrate concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these concentrations matched the low overall nutritional concentrations in detrital substrates harvested by M. smithii in the field (Tables S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein in these diets came from whole egg powder, calcium caseinate, and whey protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The digestible carbohydrate was sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crushed multivitamin tablets added to the diets provided micronutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we prepared the 6:1 P:C diet by boiling 150 mL dH2O with 4.50 g agar (Acros Organics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a separate mixture, we combined 150 mL dH2O, 1.80 g whole egg powder (Great American Spice Co.), 2.71 g whey protein (GNC), 2.48 g calcium caseinate (TrueProtein), 0.16 g of crushed multivitamin (Centrum), and 0.59 g sucrose (cane sugar, Doradita).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mixed the agar and nutritive solutions, poured the mixture into Petri dishes, and stored them at 4 °C until the diets were provided to colonies in 1-g (wet mass) cubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We kept the mass of whole egg powder constant for both diets to standardize dietary fat content (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeated this protocol for each diet, modifying ingredient amounts to adjust P:C, while maintaining a 20 g/L protein + carbohydrate dilution (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the start of feeding experiments, colonies ranged in initial wet mass from 0.24 g to 2.15 g (mean: 0.70 g ± 0.37 g) and had from 23 workers to 121 workers (mean: 49.76 ± 25.60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We divided colonies between diet treatments in a stratified random manner, selecting colonies randomly from within classes of colony-farm mass to ensure that initial colony-farm mass did not differ between diet types (F4, 20 = 0.74; P = 0.578).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a no-choice experiment that confined colony-farms to a 1:6, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, or 6:1 P:C diet, with five colonies per diet treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected diets every day during the 22-d feeding experiments, dried them for 24 h at 60 °C, and weighed them to the nearest 0.1 mg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial dry diet mass was estimated with dry:wet ratios from control diets (four per diet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative sum of daily macronutrient harvest per colony was calculated from dietary P:C ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After 29 d, we performed three measurements of colony demography: final worker number, final colony mass (adult ants + brood + fungus garden), and final brood mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because brood mass was only measured when fungus gardens were disassembled following the experiment, final brood mass represented diet effects on brood maintenance, rather than brood production, per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the proportion of colonies with failed crops at the end of the experiment using a GLM with a binomial distribution and a logit link function, including diet protein availability as an ordinal variable, and using a Firth bias adjustment because all crops failed in some treatments (6:1) and all survived in others (1:6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial colony mass was not a significant covariate and was not included in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimating_Carbohydrates_Harvested_to_Fuel_Worker_Maintenance_Metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To interpret the observed intake targets, we determined the fraction of harvested carbohydrates that ant workers would require to fuel their maintenance metabolic demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this we estimated two quantities: (i) the elemental carbon in dietary sucrose harvested by workers over 22 d confined to 1:6 or 6:1 P:C diets, and (ii) the elemental carbon respired by workers in CO2 over 22 d in the feeding experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the mass of carbon harvested by each colony, we measured total sucrose (milligrams) consumed over 22 d in both 1:6 and 6:1 diet treatments, and calculated the fraction of this mass represented by carbon based on the mass composition by element for sucrose (C12H22O11) in milligrams per mole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate the elemental carbon excreted in CO2 by M. smithii colonies over 22 d, we multiplied a published value for individual M. smithii worker metabolic rate at 25 °C (0.232 µL CO2 h1) (39) by the number of workers in each colony on day 1 of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the CO2 emission over 22 d by multiplying this hourly rate by 528 h. We converted these values from microliter to liter and estimated the milligrams of carbon in this volume of CO2 by converting it from liters to moles, assuming that a mole of the gas at standard conditions for temperature (0 °C) and pressure (0.986 atm; standard temperature and pressure) has a volume of 22.4 L. We next converted moles of carbon excreted over 22 d to milligrams of carbon excreted over 22 d based on the mass composition by element of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method likely slightly overestimates colony-level CO2 emission rates because it assumes that metabolic rate is additive (isometric) from workers to the whole colony, even though previous studies suggested a decline in per-ant metabolic rate (i.e., allometry or hyperometry) as workers accumulate in larger groups and colonies (39, 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated the fractional mass of carbon in respired CO2 relative to the total mass of carbon in harvested sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Harvested_by_Ants_in_the_Field_and_Laboratory_and_Protein_Availability_for_Plated_Fungi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated whether and how M. smithii protein foraging strategies would enable colonies to navigate the fungal growth-reproduction trade-off depicted in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we estimated three quantities: (i) rates of protein harvest in the field from estimates of substrate %N, (ii) amounts of protein available to fungal inoculates in Petri dishes, and (iii) rates of protein harvest in laboratory experiments from defined amounts of protein in diet recipes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate field protein harvest rates, we first calculated substrate percent crude protein by multiplying %N in harvested substrate pieces by 6.25, assuming that proteins contain, on average, 16% N (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we analyzed 12 frass samples (mean: 1.67, SD: 1.28% N, corresponding to mean: 10.43, SD: 8.02% crude protein) and three wood fragment samples (mean: 0.67, SD: 0.36% N, corresponding to mean: 4.17, SD: 2.27% crude protein) from 20 colonies (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then multiplied the mean hourly mass of substrate harvested by colonies (1.3 mg) (Table S7) by the overall mean percent crude protein in harvested substrate (9.17%) (Table S8), which yielded 0.12 mg crude protein harvested per colony per hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We finally obtained two estimates of daily crude protein harvest, a lower estimate assuming workers only forage during approximately 12 daylight hours per day (1.4 mg) and an upper estimate assuming workers forage during 20 rain-free hours per day (2.4 mg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next estimated protein availability for fungal inoculates across P:C diets in the Petri dish experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the amount of protein available to fungal inoculates in the P:C diets with extremely low (8 g/L 1:9) and extremely high (60 g/L 9:1) protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calculations were possible because each 6-cm × 1.5-cm (28.26 cm2) Petri dish had 12 mL of diet with defined amounts of protein and carbohydrates added per 100 mL of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, fungal inoculates confined to the 8 g/L, 1:9 P:C diet had 0.096 g protein + carbohydrates per dish (0.8 g protein + carbohydrates per 100 mL), and 3.17 mg protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, Petri dishes contained protein masses ranging from 3.17 mg (1:9 P:C 8g/L) to 482.24 mg (9:1 P:C 60 g/L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this protein was dispersed across the entire dish, such that the fungal hyphae likely accessed only a small fraction of this protein mass on a daily basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated this daily amount by calculating protein availability per square centimeter, which indicated that growing hyphae expanding out from the central inoculate plug likely encountered in between 0.11 mg/cm2 of protein on a daily basis in the 1:9 8 g/L 1:9 P:C ratio treatment and 17.06 mg/cm2 in the 9:1 P:C 60-g/L treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next calculated the daily protein amounts harvested by workers across the P:C diets during 22 d in the controlled laboratory experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the data in Fig 2B, colonies harvested the following amounts of protein per day: 0.70 mg (1:6 P:C), 1.10 mg (1:3 P:C), 1.01 mg (1:1 P:C), 1.25 mg (3:1 P:C), and 1.57 mg (6:1 P:C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that colonies typically regulated daily protein harvest levels at amounts similar to 1.4mg2.4 mg crude protein harvested by workers in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We used a state-of-the-art nutritional geometry approach to understand how foragers of fungus-growing ants adjust garden provisioning to suppress independent reproduction by their cultivars in ways that also compromise symbiotic productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results expand the existing set of geometric framework approaches (3133) by: (i) providing a map of the nutrient requirements of fungal cultivars reared without farming ants (Fig 1); (ii) using this map to track collective foraging and provisioning decisions of ant farmers in laboratory experiments offering specific nutritional blends (Fig 2), and in the field (Fig 3); and (iii) evaluating the negative consequences of improperly biased nutrition for the combined performance of the Mycocepurus farming symbiosis (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results that we obtained yielded relatively clear answers to the four questions we posed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the cultivars of M. smithii thrived when provisioned with carbohydrate-biased substrate and suffered with increasing protein concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, ant foraging preferences largely matched fungal preferences with workers harvesting substantial amounts of carbohydrates when they could do so without simultaneously overharvesting protein from the same source, a strategy that avoided wasteful mushroom production without excessive costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, this behavior appeared to match general adaptations to low-protein availability of saprophytic leaf-litter fungi on the forest floor, as expected because the cultivars of M. smithii remain closely related to free living fungi (16, 20, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, naturally available foraging targets, such as insect frass and dead plant fragments, are sufficiently variable in P:C ratios to allow differential garden provisioning, as we simulated in our garden-provisioning experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, differential provisioning and nutrition of ants and cultivars does appear to allow fine-tuned garden provisioning so that the expression of hostsymbiont conflict over cultivar reproduction can be avoided, because hyphal growth remained sustainable under higher protein levels than mushroom formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it also appeared that Mycocepurus ant farmers face fundamental productivity constraints because the carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor substrates that maximize growth rates of edible hyphae also enabled the production of costly mushrooms when intake rates were high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the first 3035 My of attine evolution, the ants produced a monophyletic radiation of specialized fungus farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their fungal cultivars were not genetically isolated from free-living fungi and could therefore not coevolve to any significant degree with their farmers as happened during the last approximately 25 My, after the ancestor of the higher attine ants came to initiate a new radiation based on a truly domesticated cultivar lineage (16, 2325, 3538).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study illustrates how this early interaction asymmetry between mutualistic partners has likely constrained ecological performance, which may help explain both the low rates of fungus garden metabolism (39) and the typically low rates of crop provisioning (four workers per nest per hour) (Table S7) in lower attine ants relative to evolutionarily derived Atta leafcutter ant colonies, where teeming foraging highways mobilize thousands of workers to carry leaf fragments to their nests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these productivity constraints may well have prevented the lower attines from obtaining an ecological footprint in Neotropical ecosystems comparable to the leafcutter ants, the substantial radiation of farming strategies and species diversity represented by the extant lower attines also suggests that these early farmer lineages gained control over the expression of selfish symbiont traits soon after becoming farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stoichiometric and geometric framework approaches developed for this study highlight a mix of evolutionary adaptations and constraints associated with ant subsistence farming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present study clarifies some of the nutritional mechanisms by which lower attine ants may have tamed their cultivars as long as gene flow with free-living fungal relatives precluded proper domestication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the precise mechanisms by which M. smithii ant workers regulate garden nutrition and suppress mushroom production need further study, both in the laboratory where we have far from exhausted the opportunities offered by the geometric framework approach, and in the field, where further studies could manipulate foraging on frass and dead plant material to explore health consequences for natural M. smithii colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Remarkable_Parallels_with_the_Challenges_of_Human_Subsistence_Farming  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The earliest human subsistence farmers faced severe physiological challenges (40, 41), in part because plant-based agricultural diets provided more carbohydrates and less protein than the lean game that dominated diets of ancestral hunter-gatherers (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern humans appear to retain these outdated nutritional adaptations, regulating the intake of protein more strongly than carbohydrates, and thus overeating sugars, starch, and lipids to reach set targets for protein consumption when navigating todays nutritional landscape that has become even more biased toward carbohydrates (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extant relatives of the earliest small-scale fungus-farming ants in the present study echo this leveraging of protein intake (Fig 2), although the mechanisms likely differ because attine ants appear to have an upper protein tolerance set by fungal symbionts adapted to low protein conditions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. smithii workers also appeared to regulate protein harvest more tightly, and at lower levels, than nonfarming ant species (33, 43, 44), which may present additional physiological challenges because the ants need substantial amounts of protein to fuel colony growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that Mycocepurus ant farmers could neither increase carbohydrate provisioning without cultivars allocating the excess toward mushroom production, nor increase protein provisioning without compromising somatic cultivar growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ants appear to navigate nutritional intake trade-offs in a prudent and possibly fitness-maximizing manner, just as human subsistence farmers have always tried to do.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetically basal forms of attine farming have remained very successful over evolutionary time, despite not reaching ecological dominance, quite possibly because they evolved in an empty niche and could gradually respond to selection for the highest possible productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When higher attine ants eventually emerged, they gradually moved into another, functionally herbivorous niche, so did not compete for the same resource base, which may have contributed to the coexistence of ancestral subsistence farming and industrial-scale farming of attine lineages in many neotropical ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cultural evolution of human agriculture proceeded rapidly and modern industrial-scale farming almost inevitably replaces subsistence farming because the two agricultural practices compete for the same land, water, and fertilizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a geometric framework approach to assess the nutritional requirements for maximizing hyphal growth and mushroom production in pure clonal cultivar inoculates isolated from a large colony of M. smithii (177198) collected from the rainforest at Soberanía National Park, Panama (N 9.11489, W 79.69784), and grown on Petri dishes filled with a standard potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We offered nine different P:C ratios (1:9, 1:6, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 6:1, 9:1) and four concentrations (8, 20, 40, and 60 g/L), yielding 36 replicated culture conditions in which we estimated hyphal growth rates and probabilities of mushroom production (modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) (SI Methods and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed 5-mm-diameter plugs of pure fungal culture in 60 × 15-mm Petri dishes containing 12 mL of 36 sterile synthetic agar-based diets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sealed the dishes with parafilm (diet × dilution: n = 12), checked them every few days for contamination, and removed infected agar from some plates while discarding plates if overrun with contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After 32 d we photographed noncontaminated plates (n = 360) and estimated fungal expansion rate (fungal area after 32 d, mm2) with ImageJ (NIH Image; v1.49g) (as per ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 80 d we photographed all instances of mushroom growth on the same plates (n = 47), and used percent surviving plates with mushrooms for each diet treatment as the dependent variable in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used least-square regressions with both linear and quadratic terms to evaluate how fungal expansion rates and percentages of surviving fungus plates with mushrooms varied across the 36 diet protein and carbohydrate combinations (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonparametric thin-plate splines that do not constrain the shape of the response surface were determined with the fields package v.2.14.0 in R and used to map fungus growth and mushroom production across the 36 diets (32, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured growth rate over 30 d on PDA of pure fungal cultures isolated from nine M. smithii colonies (n = 5 dishes per colony) using the protocols described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for fungal strain growth differences, we isolated DNA from these fungal samples with 10% (wt/vol) Chelex extractions (47) followed by PCR amplification of the conserved nuclear large subunit (LSU) rRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting PCR products were sequenced at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) Europe, producing sequences that were deposited in GenBank (see Table S9 for corresponding accession numbers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used these sequences to construct a chronogram using the function phylosig from the ape package in R v3.08 to test for a phylogenetic signal in fungal growth rates across colonies using Blombergs K (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extended the geometric framework logic described for fungal cultivars to the entire farming symbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first cataloged the substrate harvested by M. smithii workers during approximately 20 h of observations at 22 colonies in Soberanía Park from November 2013 to December 2013 (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then collected additional substrate for analyses of elemental N (%N) from October 2014 to December 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process allowed us to estimate the percent crude protein in harvested substrate (Table S8), assuming that proteins contain, on average, 16% N (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also harvested entire M. smithii colonies from May 2014 to June 2014 and established them in plastic containers with ad libitum water and ground polenta as forage for garden maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a P:C diet laboratory feeding experiment within the geometric framework (32, 34, 50) to analyze the foraging strategies by which workers prioritize protein and carbohydrates when harvesting nutritionally defined agar-based substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diets contained 20 g/L macronutrients and known P:C ratios modified from the literature (50) (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a no-choice experiment confining colonies to a single P:C diet (1:6, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, or 6:1), simulating field conditions with a constant P:C ratio of substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replaced diets every day and estimated cumulative protein and carbohydrate harvest of colonies from dietary P:C ratios and dry:wet mass ratios of control diet pieces (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used general linear mixed models (GLM) to test for diet treatment effects on: cumulative diet harvest (total diet, protein, and carbohydrates), final worker number, final colony mass (adult ants + brood + fungus gardens), and final brood mass (SI Methods, Fig S1, and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included initial colony mass as a covariate and colony ID as a random factor because the largest of the 20 collected colonies was initially divided into five subcolonies and distributed across diet treatments, yielding 25 experimental colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated initial worker number, retrospectively, from dead workers collected during the experiment and final survivors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in colony demography were observed over 29 d, whereas diet harvest was measured over 22 d because crop failure on high-protein diets precluded measurements toward the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the proportion of colonies with failed crops at the end of the experiment using a GLM with a binomial distribution with a logit link function, and diet protein availability as ordinal variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fungal samples were collected from each colony for %N analysis on the first and last days of the experiment, and a KruskalWallis test was used to examine changes in fungal crop %N for each dietary P:C treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nutritional substrate selected by workers could potentially offer a biased estimate of fungal resource provisioning if workers used substantial amounts of carbohydrates (but not proteins) to fuel their own metabolic demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this conjecture by comparing the carbon mass in harvested sucrose with estimates of carbon mass respired as CO2 by workers in the 1:6 and 6:1 P:C diet treatments over 22 d. Mass-balance calculations (detailed in SI Methods), based on metabolic data from a previous study (39), indicated that worker maintenance metabolism required a small fraction of the harvested sucrose carbon mass, from 2.17 ± 1.00% to 5.96 ± 4.25% in the high-carbohydrate 1:6 P:C and low-carbohydrate 6:1 P:C diets, respectively, suggesting that the observed intake targets were not greatly influenced by worker energy demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inference is consistent with farming ants representing a very small part of a colony-farms total biomass and energy consumption (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
