Gel-forming mucins form distinct morphologic structures in airways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mucus propelled by cilia is key for removing particulates from lungs by mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major structural components of airway mucus are two gel-forming mucins, MUC5B and MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mucins exhibit distinct morphologic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5B is secreted by submucosal glands in the form of strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5AC is secreted by goblet cells as threads and thin sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After emerging onto the airway surface, the two mucins associate to form MUC5B strands partially covered with MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distinct morphologic structures likely enable efficient mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cystic fibrosis, strands become entangled, MUC5B often fills submucosal gland ducts, and MUC5AC sheets are larger, are more abundant, and overlie strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disrupted anion secretion in cystic fibrosis alters mucin morphology, which will impair mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gel-forming mucins, the primary macromolecular components of airway mucus, facilitate airway clearance by mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cystic fibrosis (CF) altered mucus properties impair mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Airways primarily secrete two closely related gel-forming mucins, MUC5B and MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their morphologic structures and associations in airways that contain abundant submucosal glands and goblet cells are uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there is limited knowledge about mucins in airways not affected by inflammation, infection, or remodeling or in CF airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined airways freshly excised from newborn non-CF pigs and CF pigs before secondary manifestations develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that porcine submucosal glands produce MUC5B, whereas goblet cells produce predominantly MUC5AC plus some MUC5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that MUC5B emerged from submucosal gland ducts in the form of strands composed of multiple MUC5B filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, MUC5AC emerged from goblet cells as wispy threads and sometimes formed mucin sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, MUC5AC often partially coated the MUC5B strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with non-CF, MUC5B more often filled CF submucosal gland ducts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5AC sheets also accumulated in CF airways overlying MUC5B strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal distinct morphology and interactions for MUC5B and MUC5AC and suggest that the two mucins make distinct contributions to mucociliary transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, they provide a framework for understanding abnormalities in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WGA_Lectin_Preferentially_Labels_MUC5B__and_JAC_Lectin_Preferentially_Labels_MUC5AC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We made the empirical observation that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin preferentially labeled MUC5B, and jacalin (JAC) lectin preferentially labeled MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that mucous cells in the acinus of submucosal glands labeled with anti-MUC5B antibody and colocalized with WGA labeling (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neither anti-MUC5AC antibody nor JAC labeled the submucosal gland cells (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of MUC5B but not MUC5AC in submucosal glands is consistent with previous studies in humans and pigs (1, 4, 5, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cells of the surface epithelium, we found that JAC colocalized with anti-MUC5AC antibody (Fig 1 A and B and Fig S1A) and WGA colocalized with anti-MUC5B antibody (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  En face images showed that 73% of goblet cells labeled only with JAC, about 17% labeled with WGA alone, and about 10% labeled with both WGA and JAC (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite substantial variability at different locations within individual airways, these data suggest that MUC5AC is the predominant mucin produced by goblet cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with earlier studies in porcine and human airways (1, 4, 5, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, WGA labeling did not colocalize with anti-MUC5AC antibody, and JAC labeling did not colocalize with anti-MUC5B antibody (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that WGA and JAC are not specific only to these mucins; these lectins also show some staining of membranes and other structures (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In subsequent studies of secreted mucins on the airway surface, we used WGA and JAC to identify MUC5B and MUC5AC, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in cells, we found that WGA, but not JAC, colocalized with anti-MUC5B antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAC, but not WGA, colocalized with anti-MUC5AC antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not rely on lectin staining alone; for all key studies, some experiments were done with mucin antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strands_of_MUC5B_Mucus_Emerge_from_Submucosal_Glands_and_Associate_with_MUC5AC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that WGA-linked fluorophore labeled mucus emerging from submucosal glands (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGA colocalized with MUC5B immunostaining (Fig S3), as predicted based on production of MUC5B by submucosal glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mucins exit gland ducts not as a homogeneous tube or stream but rather as a strand of multiple MUC5B filaments (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the point of exit, strands varied from 5 to 50 m in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that point, the diameter of strands sometimes increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their shape also sometimes changed, becoming less cylindrical, adopting a ribbon-like appearance, or fanning out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After leaving the duct, strands extended toward the larynx and in a ventral direction, consistent with the direction of cilia beating (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JAC and anti-MUC5AC antibody also labeled mucus strands (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seemed surprising because the submucosal glands produced MUC5B but not MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if mucin strands emerging from the glands labeled with JAC, we examined strands in the ducts at the level of and just below the airway surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging strands labeled with WGA but not JAC, indicating they were composed of MUC5B (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scanning electron microscopy also revealed strands of mucus emerging from submucosal gland ducts extending toward the larynx (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mucus strands were comprised of individual filaments, consistent with the lectin and antibody labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Threads_and_Sheets_of_MUC5AC_Are_Released_from_Goblet_Cells_onto_the_Airway_Surface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The JAC lectin and anti-MUC5AC antibody detected wispy threads that were distinct from the mucus strands (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 A and B and 4A); henceforth, we refer to MUC5AC in this form as threads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MUC5AC threads were 14 m in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Threads often joined MUC5B strands (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sometimes observed small thin sheets of JAC-labeled material (arrow in Fig 4A); these were much more prominent in CF (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the frequent appearance of MUC5B strands attached to submucosal gland ducts, we seldom observed MUC5AC threads emanating from goblet cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of attachment of MUC5AC threads to surface cells suggests that MUC5AC is rapidly released from goblet cells after it is secreted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to MUC5AC, we rarely detected MUC5B threads; Fig 4B shows a rare example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with WGA labeling, JAC and anti-MUC5AC antibody labeled the exterior of strands (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of MUC5AC threads on the surface of MUC5B strands indicates that MUC5AC associates with MUC5B strands after they exit from the duct orifice onto the airway surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mucus strands have a MUC5B core and a partial coating of MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Appearance_of_the_Mucins_Differs_in_CF_and_Non-CF_Airways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies showed that abnormal mucus impaired MCT in newborn CF pigs (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MUC5B and MUC5AC transcripts, Western blotting of mucin protein, goblet cell numbers, and mucus glycosylation did not differ by genotype (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, controlling the solution volume and maintaining pH at 7.35 on the apical surface did not prevent the mucus abnormality or impaired MCT (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those observations focused attention on mucus produced below the surface in submucosal glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, those studies were done with airways submerged in saline, they did not identify the mucin, and they could not reveal morphologic aspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that mucins would exhibit abnormal morphology in ex vivo airways not submerged in saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We administered methacholine in vivo to stimulate mucus secretion and then removed and examined airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like mucins in non-CF airways, in CF airways we observed mucins in strands and threads and MUC5AC partially covering the surface of MUC5B strands (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the morphologic appearance of the mucins differed between the two genotypes in several ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in CF airways, MUC5B strands often remained attached to the ducts from which they emerged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, strands emanating from different submucosal gland ducts often merged and appeared entangled (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is consistent with earlier functional experiments showing that mucus strands from CF ducts sometimes failed to break and then leave submucosal gland duct openings (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That defect produced the appearance of aggregated mucus strands on the surface of submerged CF tracheas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in non-CF airways, MUC5B strands were less tangled (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, in CF, MUC5AC often appeared as thin sheets overlying MUC5B strands (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in non-CF, MUC5AC sheets were rarely observed overlying MUC5B strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, compared with non-CF, CF submucosal glands were more often distended with mucin from the acinus up through the duct to the airway surface (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggested that ducts of CF submucosal glands would be filled with mucus more frequently than non-CF ducts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this prediction, we counted ducts filled with WGA-labeled mucin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with non-CF, a greater fraction of CF ducts were filled with MUC5B (Fig 6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finding more mucus-filled ducts in CF is in seeming contrast with previous studies showing that CF submucosal glands are smaller and secrete less liquid than non-CF (28, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, less liquid secretion together with more mucus filling of the ducts suggests that the mucus has abnormal biophysical properties, a conclusion consistent with earlier studies (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HCO3_CO2-Free_Saline_Plus_Bumetanide_Produced_Mucus_Abnormalities_in_Non-CF_Airways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In non-CF airways, inhibiting Cl secretion with bumetanide and blocking HCO3 secretion with HCO3/CO2-free solution reproduced some features of CF with impaired breakage and release of mucus from submucosal glands (21, 23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies were performed with excised airways submerged in saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that inhibiting anion secretion in non-CF airways would reproduce morphologic features of mucins in excised, nonsubmerged airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that nominally HCO3/CO2-free solution plus bumetanide increased the fraction of submucosal gland ducts filled with mucus (Fig 6 D and E) without changing pH on the airway surface (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mucus in ducts was positive for WGA and anti-MUC5B antibody labeling, but it did not label with JAC or anti-MUC5AC antibody (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies are consistent with earlier work (21, 23, 24) and suggest that loss of anion secretion in submucosal glands alters the properties of mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MUC5B_Forms_Mucus_Strands_and_MUC5AC_Forms_Mucus_Threads_and_Sheets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings indicate that MUC5B and MUC5AC have distinct morphologic and structural appearances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5B emerges from submucosal gland ducts as a strand-like structure composed of MUC5B filaments (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MUC5B filaments probably emanate from individual secretory granules or individual mucus-producing cells within the submucosal glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple filaments passing through the long, thin submucosal gland duct then facilitate formation of the mucin into a strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual filaments are reminiscent of the histopathological appearance of individual mucin filaments produced by the gallbladder and intestine of newborn CF pigs (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to MUC5B, MUC5AC forms thin, wispy threads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CF, and less commonly in non-CF, MUC5AC appears as thin mucin sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although goblet cells also produce MUC5B, we rarely detected it as threads or sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The explanation is uncertain, but perhaps goblet cells secrete less MUC5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Production of MUC5B strands coated with MUC5AC may be facilitated by the airway anatomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When mucus emerges from submucosal gland ducts, it is not released piecemeal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, for a time, it remains anchored at the duct, growing in length as a strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that wispy threads and sheets of MUC5AC move across the surface, collide with elongating MUC5B strands, and associate with them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MUC5B strand with associated MUC5AC then eventually breaks and moves up the airway (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical or physical basis of the association between MUC5AC and MUC5B remains uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is estimated that the volume of mucus in submucosal glands is 50 times that in goblet cells (1), suggesting that the main function of glands is to produce large amounts of mucus driven by neuronal stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that an additional role for mucus production by submucosal glands may be to produce mucus in a specific structural formthat is, strands (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those strands with associated MUC5AC sheets and threads may have properties that are optimal for trapping and sweeping material from the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CF_Alters_the_Appearance_of_Airway_Mucus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously showed that in CF, strands of mucus sometimes fail to break and thus remain attached to submucosal gland ducts (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current results in nonsubmerged airways are consistent with that finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found more MUC5AC sheets in CF than in non-CF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several potential explanations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CF airways might have secreted more MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5AC might more readily form sheets in CF airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC5AC sheets may be produced similarly in CF and non-CF, but their attachment to stationary MUC5B strands may prevent their movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of these or other factors is also possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Loss of CFTR reduces Cl and HCO3 secretion (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These defects decrease the rate of liquid secretion by submucosal glands and reduce the pH of the secreted liquid (30, 31, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that blocking Cl secretion and eliminating HCO3 secretion in non-CF airways reproduced some of the abnormalities of CF airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the abnormalities in CF mucus result from reduced liquid volume, decreased HCO3 concentration, abnormally acidic pH, or some combination of these is uncertain (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduced HCO3 concentration was reported to contribute to intestinal mucin abnormalities in CF mice (3638).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CF pigs, a decreased pH, rather than a decreased HCO3 concentration, increased airway surface liquid viscosity (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies in CF pigs showed that inhibiting both Cl and HCO3 secretion in non-CF airways was required to produce mucus abnormalities that resemble those in CF (21, 23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that both liquid volume and the pH or HCO3 concentration are important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

This_Work_Has_Advantages_and_Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied an animal model with anatomical and physiological similarities to humans (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CF pigs develop lung disease that mimics that in humans with CF (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we studied newborn pigs, the properties of mucus were not altered by airway infection and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied mucus rather than sputum, which introduces confounding variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we examined mucus on the surface of freshly excised airways, we avoided alterations that occur with collecting, processing, and storing mucus (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied freshly excised airways at the airliquid interface without rinsing the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar to those in airways submerged in saline, thus excluding the possibility that decreased airway liquid was responsible for the findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These studies also have some limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied a large airway with submucosal glands, yet small airways lacking glands may also contribute to CF pathogenesis (17, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to mucins, other proteins, sugars, and lipids contribute to mucus and may influence MCT (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fixed the trachea, which could introduce artifacts; however, the results are consistent with earlier functional studies in living airways and in vivo studies (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As CF disease progresses, airway remodeling and the mix of proteolytic enzymes, inflammatory cells, and infection may also alter mucus properties and MCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For both cells and secreted mucins, the data showed preferential binding of WGA to MUC5B and JAC to MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although preferential lectin labeling provided convenient reagents, caution prevents conclusions about the causes of differential labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two mucins might display different glycans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGA binds to sialic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (40), and JAC has been reported to bind galactose and galactosyl (-1,3) N-acetylgalactosamine on O-glycoproteins (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such determinations are based largely on competition with monosaccharides (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of lectins also depends on protein hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and complex glycan structures that could differ between MUC5B and MUC5AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Access of the lectins to the two mucins could also differ, just as access of antibodies to mucins may be limited by their glycans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the abundance of glycans on mucins (7080% of mass) can make labeling with lectins more prominent than for other glycoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

These_Results_Raise_Questions_for_Future_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we highlight three questions:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied non-CF (CFTR+/+, CFTR+/) and CF (CFTR/, CFTRF508/F508) pigs 815 h after birth, as reported previously (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheal segments were obtained between the opening of the right cranial lobe and the larynx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For studies that examined the effect of inhibiting Cl and HCO3 secretion, segments of trachea were removed from non-CF pigs, wrapped in gauze soaked in either HCO3 containing solutions or HCO3-free Hepes solution plus bumetanide, and incubated at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, tracheas were cut ventrally, pinned out, and treated for immunocytochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry_and_Scanning_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunocytochemistry of frozen sections of trachea, treated excised tracheal segments, and vertical sections of excised tracheal segments is described in SI Materials and Methods and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sections and segments were subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning electron microscopy is described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitation_of_Confocal_Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed the percentage of filled submucosal gland ducts using single planes at the membrane level from original confocal images of excised trachea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ducts were counted by blinded readers on images of airways of paired trachea from individual pigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified the number of goblet cells stained by JAC or WGA from confocal images of excised trachea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied non-CF (CFTR+/+, CFTR+/) and CF (CFTR/, CFTRF508/F508) pigs that were produced by mating (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were the same for CFTR/ and CFTRF508/F508 and are combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newborn littermates were obtained from Exemplar Genetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were studied 815 h after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anesthetized the animals with ketamine (I.M., Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Akorn Animal Science) and xylazine (I.M., Bimeda, or Akorn Animal Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sedation was maintained with i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  propofol (Diprivan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We administered acetyl--methacholine chloride (1.28 × 107 mol/kg, i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to stimulate mucus secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty minutes later, animals were euthanized with i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Euthasol (Diprivan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheal segments 0.51 cm long between the opening of the right cranial lobe and the larynx were cut with a surgical blade between cartilage rings and removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used sections of main stem bronchi with similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For studies examining cross-sections of airways, rings (0.5 cm) of trachea were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fixed rings were then quickly frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Sakura) using an ethanol/dry ice bath and kept at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, following 1 h of paraformaldehyde fixation, some rings were immersed overnight in 30% sucrose at 4 °C and then frozen in O.C.T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mucin staining was similar with or without sucrose immersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections (57 m) were cryo-sectioned onto SuperfrostPlus slides (Fisher) and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of immunostaining, slides were warmed to room temperature, rinsed briefly in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free PBS (Sigma), permeabilized with 0.3% TX-100 (Thermo Fisher) in PBS, and then blocked in Super-Block (Thermo Fisher) with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) before labeling with antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following anti-mucin antibodies: rabbit anti-MUC5B (1:1,000; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Muc5AC (clone 45M1) (1:5,000, Abcam or Novus Biologicals), followed by goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 or 568 at 1:1,000 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some studies, anti-catenin antibodies (Zymed) were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lectins were added with the secondary antibodies: WGA-rhodamine (Vector Laboratories) or WGA-AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes) and Jacalin-FITC (Vector Laboratories) at 1:3,500 dilution as well as phalloidin 633 (1:300 dilution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were mounted in Vectashield plus DAPI (Vector Labs), coverslipped, and visualized using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For en face studies of untreated trachea, excised tracheal rings (1 cm) were immediately opened with a longitudinal cut on the ventral aspect and pinned out on six-well plates coated with Silgard 184 (Dow Corning) and covered with 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS) to fix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For studies that examined the effect of inhibiting Cl and HCO3 secretion, tracheas were removed from non-CF pigs; wrapped in gauze soaked in a solution that contained (in m) 118.9 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.6 KH2PO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 dextrose, pH 7.35, with 5% CO2; and placed in a 37 °C humidified chamber with 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An adjacent tracheal ring was wrapped in gauze soaked in 135 NaCl, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.6 KH2PO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 dextrose, 5 Hepes, pH 7.3, and 10 M bumetanide, which inhibits NKCC-mediated entry of Cl across the basolateral membrane, and placed in a 37 °C humidified chamber in the absence of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methacholine (1.28 × 105 mol/L) was added to both solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, gauze was removed, and tracheas were cut on the ventral aspect, pinned out, and fixed as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following overnight fixation in paraformaldehyde, tracheas were permeabilized with 0.3% TX-100 (Thermo Fisher) in PBS overnight and then blocked overnight in Super-Block (Thermo Fisher) with 10% normal goat serum if antibodies were added subsequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheas were then incubated with the lectins, WGA-rhodamine (Vector Laboratories), or WGA-AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes) and Jacalin-FITC (Vector Laboratories) at 1:1,000 dilution, again overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All overnight incubations were at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some excised tracheas were incubated with anti-MUC5B (1:1,000; Santa Cruz) or anti-MUC5AC (1:5,000; Abcam or Novus Biologicals) followed by a subsequent overnight incubation with goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheas were mounted in Vectashield plus DAPI (Vector Labs), coverslipped, and visualized using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For vertical sections of fixed, permeabilized, and lectin-stained excised trachea, tracheas were removed from the slides, briefly rinsed, and rapidly frozen in O.C.T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  using an ethanol-dry ice bath as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical 1020-m cross-sections perpendicular to the line of submucosal gland ducts were cryo-sectioned onto slides, covered with DAPI, and visualized as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confocal images were processed using the Olympus Fluoview program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitation_of_Confocal_Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the percentage of submucosal gland ducts that were filled with mucus, we formatted TIF files from single planes at the membrane level from original confocal images of excised trachea labeled with DAPI and WGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two blinded observers calculated the number of ducts (outlined by DAPI staining) in each image as well as the number of ducts that were filled with WGA staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not quantitate the abundance of mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counts were done at the membrane level of the trachea and do not include secreted mucus lying above the membrane itself or ducts with strands still attached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S6, we present the data from both readers separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the number of goblet cells, a blinded reader examined TIF files of original confocal images and determined staining by JAC and WGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We routinely fixed excised tracheas for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixation prevented the strands and sheets from being washed away and/or altering the mucus pattern from in situ condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixation allowed subsequent antibody staining of the airway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also permeabilized the trachea to allow access of antibodies and lectins to mucins in goblet cells and submucosal gland cells; these provided a positive control for detection of extracellular mucins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that permeabilization might also increase access of lectins and antibodies to sites on mucus strands and sheets (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a control, we lectin-stained some tracheas without fixation or permeabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For en face studies, excised tracheal rings (1 cm) were immediately opened with a longitudinal cut on the ventral aspect and pinned out on six-well plates coated with Silgard 184 (Dow Corning) and covered with WGA (1:1,000) and JAC (1:1,000) in PBS++ (plus 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trachea were rinsed and incubated with Hoescht (10 g/mL) (Sigma) in PBS++ for 15 min, rinsed, and placed on a slide with Vectashield Hardset without DAPI (Vector Labs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal images were processed using Olympus Fluoview program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S7 shows an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scanning_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trachea samples were processed for scanning electron microscopy using a nonaqueous method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were fixed for 2 h in FC-72 perfluorocarbon (3M) containing 2% osmium tetroxide and then dehydrated in three changes of 100% ethanol over 3 h. Samples were then transitioned to hexamethyldisilizane and air-dried overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter coated with 80:20 gold:palladium, and imaged in a Hitachi S-4800 FE-SEM (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitation_of_airway_surface_liquid_pH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adjacent tracheal rings were excised from methacholine-stimulated newborn piglets and wrapped in gauze soaked in either the Hepes buffer or the HCO3/CO2 as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheal segments soaked in Hepes buffer were incubated in 37 °C humidified incubator in the absence of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracheal segments soaked in HCO3 buffer were incubated in a 37 °C humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rings were opened, and the pH of the airway surface liquid was measured using an optode (a pH-sensitive foil, PreSens GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured 12 sites per tracheal ring, using two rings for each of two non-CF pigs, for a total of 34 measurements per pig per condition (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images of airways represent examples from studies performed on paired trachea from five different animals for the filled ducts data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphs show data points from individual pigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was tested with an unpaired Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
