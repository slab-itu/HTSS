Microfluidic perfusion shows intersarcomere dynamics within single skeletal muscle myofibrils  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sarcomere contains a variety of molecules responsible for force generation in striated muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During muscle contraction, many sarcomeres work cooperatively to produce force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms behind the interaction among sarcomeres during muscle activation have puzzled scientists for decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate intersarcomere dynamics, we used microfluidic perfusions to activate a single sarcomere within isolated myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using computational sarcomere tracking, we observed that the contraction of one sarcomere affects other sarcomeres in series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying the interactions between sarcomeres is crucial, because sarcomere nonuniformity has been long associated with several phenomena in muscle contraction that cannot be easily understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sarcomere is the smallest functional unit of myofibrils in striated muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarcomeres are connected in series through a network of elastic and structural proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During myofibril activation, sarcomeres develop forces that are regulated through complex dynamics among their structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that regulate intersarcomere dynamics are unclear, which limits our understanding of fundamental muscle features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such dynamics are associated with the loss in forces caused by mechanical instability encountered in muscle diseases and cardiomyopathy and may underlie potential target treatments for such conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we developed a microfluidic perfusion system to control one sarcomere within a myofibril, while measuring the individual behavior of all sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the force from one sarcomere leads to adjustments of adjacent sarcomeres in a mechanism that is dependent on the sarcomere length and the myofibril stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that the cooperative work of the contractile and the elastic elements within a myofibril rules the intersarcomere dynamics, with important consequences for muscle contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Force_Produced_by_Myofibrils_After_Point_Activation_of_One_Sarcomere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested isolated single sarcomeres and groups of sarcomeres within a rabbit myofibril in three different ranges of initial sarcomere length (SLi), which were chosen so as to induce different initial passive tension: 2.42.65 m (very short; called here slack), 2.652.9 m (short), and 2.9 m (long).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A local flow of activation solution, which surrounded 1 m of the preparation, resulted in the contraction of one sarcomere, whereas the other sarcomeres in series were maintained in a relaxed state (Fig 1A and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striation pattern of the nonactivated sarcomeres remained clear over the repeated activation/relaxation cycles of the target sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isometric forces produced by isolated single sarcomeres (Fig 1B) were between 10 and 60 nN/m2 within the range previously published in the literature (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At all SLi tested, the targeted sarcomere could overcome the overall myofibril passive tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long as there was overlap between the thick and thin filaments (SL up to 3.6 m), all sarcomeres reached a similar final sarcomere length (SLf) on activation (Fig S1B and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force produced by an isolated sarcomere was higher than the force produced by one target sarcomere that was activated within a myofibril (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when we compared preparations with the same number of sarcomeres in series, the force was higher at longer SLi, suggesting a SL dependence for the force development (Fig 1 B and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same SLi group, force transmitted to the precalibrated needles decreased with increasing numbers of sarcomeres in series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were reproduced in our mechanical model, in which the elements that compose a myofibril are modeled as either linear or nonlinear spring elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initiated the model calculations using the same average SLi that we used for the experiments with the myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we activated one sarcomere, the force developed by a myofibril decreased nonlinearly as a function of the number of adjacent inactive sarcomeres and was higher at longer SLi (Fig 1 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the contraction, the forces developed in the model were also similar to the experimental forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our system, the measured force is a function of the displacement and stiffness of the microneedles used during mechanical testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, assuming that the stiffness of sarcomeres within a single myofibril is similar, our data suggest that the measured force is dependent on the magnitude of shortening of the target sarcomere, which is greater at longer SLi (Fig 1D) (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force sensed by the precalibrated needles results from the active and the passive forces components in the myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the characteristics of titin, it is likely that, at the beginning of activation, individual sarcomere shortening results in an increased strain over the titin molecules of the nonactivated sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because passive force develops in a nonlinear manner (13), contractions starting at longer SLi will lead to a greater force development than contractions produced at shorter lengths (for a given change in length).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the higher passive tension may cause the activated sarcomere to cease shortening at slightly longer SLf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our data show a lack of statistical difference (Fig 1C) in the range of SLf below 2.00 Âµm, there is a steep region of the ascending limb of the FSL relation, and thus, even very small differences in SLf (that we may have failed to detect) may strongly affect the force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that 40 sarcomeres in a myofibril can adjust their length after a point activation, a result that was confirmed with our mechanical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nonactivated_Sarcomeres_Adjust_Their_Lengths_After_Target_Activation_of_One_Sarcomere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate (i) how an activated target sarcomere dynamically interacts with adjacent sarcomeres and (ii) how the passive forces in adjacent sarcomeres are adjusted along the myofibril, we measured the SLs (SLs; Z disk to Z disk distances) (Fig S1A) and tracked the A-band displacements of all sarcomeres in response to the activation of a sarcomere in the center of the myofibril (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After activation, the SLfs were not different among nonactivated sarcomeres (Fig 2C); all of these sarcomeres responded by slightly stretching (Fig 2D and Fig S1) (i.e., there is a mechanical linkage among the sarcomeres).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the processes leading to these SL adjustments, we tracked the A bands of the myofibrils (Fig 2B and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute displacement of the A bands was larger in nonactivated sarcomeres located closer to the activation point than in sarcomeres located farther from the activation point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute A-band displacement was dependent on SLi and therefore, the initial passive tension of myofibrils (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the A-band displacements were normalized, this dependence of SLi was not observed (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental results were well-captured in our mechanical model, which shows a decrease in the displacement of A bands when they are located in sarcomeres away from the activated sarcomere (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been shown that the elastic network of intermediate filaments can link all force-bearing structures of the sarcomere (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is mainly governed by titin molecules, which are the proteins responsible for passive force development in myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During our experiments, the local increase in Ca2+ leads the target sarcomere to contract and stretch the adjacent sarcomeres, likely enhancing the strain over titin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain is passively transmitted across the myofibril via the intermediate filament system, affecting several sarcomeres in series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further test the myofibril adjustment to local activation, we repeated the previous experiments using inflexible needles, so that the total length of the myofibrils would not change significantly as a result of activation, removing partially the effects of end compliance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibrils were tested at long SLi (2.93.3 m), very long SLi (3.43.6 m), and long SLi in rigor solution (i.e., in the absence of ATP and Ca2+), a condition that substantially increases the stiffness of the preparation, because it induces a large number of cross-bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of these conditions, myofibrils remained able to contract in response to the point activation, suggesting that sarcomeres in series can adapt their lengths in response to a local increase in Ca2+ concentration without significant changes in total myofibril length (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was some shortening observed at each end of the myofibrils as indicated by A-band displacements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our mathematical model that incorporates the end compliances was able to predict sarcomere contraction and shortening even with probes of very high stiffness and myofibrils in rigor state (Fig S3 C and D), strengthening the interpretation that intersarcomere dynamics are not necessarily dependent on changes in total myofibril length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Half-Sarcomeres_Are_Displaced_During_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the experiments described above, we noticed a small displacement of the target A band in the activated sarcomere, which may have been caused by half-sarcomere nonuniformity during activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, previous studies have suggested that the stabilization of the A band in the center of sarcomeres during muscle contraction is regulated by titin (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we evaluated A-band displacements in sarcomeres by changing the position of the point activation to measure how it affected intersarcomere dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point activation with the microperfusion system placed at the Z disk led to the activation of two adjoining half-sarcomeres, because two A bands were collapsed together at the end of the activation (Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3B shows that activation of two half-sarcomeres led to a relatively large displacement from the zero position of at least one of the A bands compared with one target sarcomere activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this situation, the adjoining sarcomeres displaced less than in conditions where one entire sarcomere was activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change in position of the thick filament has been seen before at the beginning of myofibril contraction and is attributed to half-sarcomere mechanics (17), leading us to investigate how the myofibril responds to point activation of just one half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the asymmetrical behavior results from differential half-sarcomere mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this hypothesis by activating half-sarcomeres using micropipettes with diameters of 0.5 m to reach a small flow area (Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-band tracking showed that one side of the myofibril was displaced more than the other side (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the side that was displaced more was not always the one adjacent to the activated half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, two behaviors were observed: either (i) the A band did not move (and the Z disk was pulled toward the A band) or (ii) the A band was displaced toward the Z disk (Fig 3D), explaining the asymmetry observed when two half-sarcomeres are activated together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we will consider one sarcomere that has one half-sarcomere activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the A band is displaced from its zero position toward the Z disk of this half-sarcomere, it drags the other half-sarcomere (Fig 3D, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the A band does not change its position, it pulls the Z disk and the half-sarcomeres (Fig 3D, orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, both situations happen in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these movements do not result in differential SLf between the two sides of the myofibril.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sarcomeres_and_Myofibrils_May_Produce_Different_Forces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sarcomeres comprising a myofibril have a similar structure and cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if all sarcomeres were able to reach the same SLf, they should hypothetically produce similar active forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we point-activated all sarcomeres within a myofibril (one at a time) and used the average displacement of the Â±1 and Â±2 A bands in relation to the target sarcomere to estimate the individual sarcomere forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although an indirect measurement of the force in this situation, this procedure was based on our observation that the displacement of the A bands surrounding an activated sarcomere is very similar to the displacement of the needles when we activated one sarcomere (mechanically isolated from the myofibril).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, we found forces varying from 8 to 45 nN/m2 when comparing all sarcomeres tested in different myofibrils (merged data in Fig 4A), similar to the forces produced by isolated sarcomeres (dotted line in Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a small range of forces among the different sarcomeres within a single myofibril caused by small variations in SLi (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When myofibrils were analyzed individually, it was possible to observe differences in forces produced by sarcomeres in some myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are likely related to different changes in length caused by nonuniform SLi or SLf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to our data, sarcomeres reach similar SLf when point-activated, but this activation affects other sarcomeres in series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, during full myofibril activation, the dynamic work of sarcomeres in series and the differences in SLi among sarcomeres may influence how a myofibril develops force to reach a steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a state, myofibril internal motion is close to equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, during myofibril activation, every sarcomere shortened to the same SLf, the force would be a function of the number of sarcomeres in series and the SLi of each sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that a greater number of sarcomeres in series allows a greater shortening magnitude and hence, higher forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed full activation of myofibrils with different numbers of sarcomeres in series at an SLi of 2.8 m. We first activated myofibrils with 25 sarcomeres, and after the first activation, we reduced the number of sarcomeres in series in the preparation by one-half by positioning the holding needle close to the center of the myofibril.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that myofibrils with a greater number of sarcomeres produced higher forces, regardless of the average SLf (Fig S4 A and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results may be attributed to cumulative shortening when more sarcomeres are activated (i.e., a greater shortening of the myofibril may be possible when more sarcomeres are activated) (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further test our hypothesis that more sarcomeres in series allow for a greater shortening and to remove the potential confounding effect of myofibril damage during manipulation, we measured the forces produced by the first contraction of 95 myofibrils and compared them with single sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that myofibrils with more sarcomeres in series shortened more than myofibrils with fewer sarcomeres and produced higher forces (Fig 4 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the increase in force in longer myofibrils was not linearly related to the number of sarcomeres in series (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the force was normalized by the number of sarcomeres in the myofibrils, they produced less force per sarcomere than single sarcomeres (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether the final SL reached during the contractions was in the zone where maximal force is produced, we performed separate experiments to derive an FSL relation for the myofibrils used in this study (Movie S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an FSL relation similar to that reported previously in other preparations (18), with a plateau between SLfs of 2.1 and 2.7 m (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these measurements, we evaluated if the SLf of the myofibrils reached optimal filament overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the majority of the myofibrils contracted to the plateau of the FSL relationship or in an area within 70% of the optimum filament overlap (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were some sarcomeres in these myofibrils that reached a length longer than those at the plateau of the FSL, likely because of an increased SL nonuniformity (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, we decided to test the hypothesis that a larger degree of nonuniformity in SLs along the descending limb of the FSL leads to a decrease in the total force produced by the myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induced_Nonuniformity_Deactivation_Reduces_Total_Myofibril_Force  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the years, SL nonuniformity has been observed to happen naturally during muscle contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test how nonuniformity of SLs affects the final force reached by the myofibrils, we used the microperfusion system to induce nonuniformity in activated myofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed five different sets of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we measured the myofibril force when three to five sarcomeres were activated before full myofibril activation (preactivation group) and compared the results with those of regular full activation (control) (Movie S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two segments of the same myofibril were tested for preactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol consisted of three cycles of full myofibril activation followed by two cycles of preactivation and a control contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When preactivated, the myofibril generated a small increase in force before a larger increase caused by full activation (dashed square in Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences in the final forces measured, showing that initial nonuniformities did not affect force development (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in another series of experiments, nonuniformity was induced either after contraction or before activation by using a low-Ca2+ solution to relax one sarcomere in a fully activated myofibril (Movie S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed a sudden reduction in the total myofibril force (Fig 5B) that was reversed after removal of the microperfusion pipette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then repeated this experiment but used a high-Ca2+ solution with 40 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), which led to a similar reduction in force (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction in the total myofibril force was also observed by delaying the activation of a small portion of the myofibril (approximately one sarcomere) during a contraction (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of these situations, the target sarcomere was able to contract, although both sides of the myofibril were inducing sarcomere stretching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that one sarcomere is able to pull several activated sarcomeres and produce a force that is close to its maximum level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we used a high-strength ionic solution that depletes the preparation from thick myosin filaments (19) (Movie S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction of the A band results in a sarcomere with only the intermediate filaments that is able to communicate with other sarcomeres through passive forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, A-band extraction may also lead to more compliant titin because of the loss of the interaction between titin and myosin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared forces developed by the myofibrils before and after the extraction of the A band of one sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a significant reduction in the isometric force compared with experiments in which the A band was intact (Fig 5E), supporting the idea that the number of sarcomeres is an important factor for total force development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extraction of one A band had a smaller effect on the total force in myofibrils with a large number of sarcomeres than in myofibrils with a small number of sarcomeres (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In longer myofibrils, force dropped after the additional extraction of A bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a few experiments in which we applied a small stretch after extraction of the A band from myofibrils to evaluate if force could be recovered back to the original values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the force remained lower than it was before extraction of the A band (Fig S5 and Movie S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our data suggest that, during muscle contraction and force development, events that create nonuniform distribution of SL along myofibrils have an impact on the final force that they produce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we assessed intersarcomere dynamics in isolated myofibrils using microfluidic perfusion, a technique that allows the point activation of one (half-) sarcomere within a myofibril while measuring the response of all other sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We triggered cross-bridge formation and contraction of target sarcomeres by locally increasing the Ca2+ concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that the shortening of an activated sarcomere leads to an internal regulation in the remaining sarcomeres in the myofibril through passive forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that intersarcomere dynamics arise from the cooperative work of the contractile and elastic systems, enabling the action of one sarcomere to be transmitted to the others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that single sarcomeres are able to contract as long as there is myofilament overlap (20), reaching similar SLf independent of the SLi (with small differences when SLi is 3.6 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is not observed during full myofibril activation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1D and 4G), where the SLf is highly nonuniform during activation (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although passive and active forces have been investigated separately (21, 22), we showed that the passive force component is responsible for the interaction of sarcomeres in series, facilitating the transmission of the force of one sarcomere to others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have shown that titin controls important aspects of thick filament structure, playing an important role in muscle activation (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, it will be important to consider how the activation of one sarcomere may be sensed by a thick filament from the neighboring sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been suggested that titin can assist muscle contraction at physiological SLs using the stored elastic energy from unfolded Ig domains (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of the elastic system was shown in our experiments, in which a few sarcomeres were activated before full myofibril activation (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was not a difference in force compared with myofibrils that were not preactivated, showing that the passive force components hold the nonactivated area of the myofibril at the optimum length for contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our microfluidic perfusion system allowed the control of a long known phenomenon of muscle contraction, the nonuniform lengths of sarcomeres during activation (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the proposal of the sliding filament theory (1, 2), nonuniform behavior of sarcomeres and its effects in force production during contraction have puzzled scientists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, in short myofibrils, enabling the relaxation of one sarcomere either during or before contraction leads to a reduction in the total force (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result can be explained by the reduction in the total shortening caused by the relaxed sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same reduction was observed when we extracted the A bands from myofibrils (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this reduction in force was attenuated in myofibrils with more sarcomeres in series (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the lack of one sarcomere was compensated for by an increase in shortening of other sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism may have important implications, because the structure of the muscle cell may be designed to balance the presence of weaker or damaged sarcomeres along the myofiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study uses a microfluidic perfusion to show the importance of intersarcomere dynamics and the cooperative work of the contractile and elastic proteins in the myofibril, opening possibilities for new venues of investigation in muscle biophysics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Solutions_and_Experimental_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Myofibril preparation and imaging (SI Text) were done as described before (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol was approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee and complied with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rigor solution was 50 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relaxing solution was 70 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 14.5 mM creatine phosphate, 7 mM EGTA, and pCa2+ (equal to log[Ca2+]) 9.0, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation solution was 50 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 14.5 mM creatine phosphate, 7.2 mM EGTA, and pCa2+ 4.5, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two precalibrated needles to pierce the myofibrils parallel to the Z disks (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stiffness of all needles (43.40 Â± 0.76 nN/m) was measured using the same atomic force cantilever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were imaged using a Hamamatsu Orca-ER digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movies were recorded at 43.3 frames per 1 s. Myofibrils were pierced and lifted from the coverslip, and the SLi was adjusted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarcomeres within myofibrils were point-perfused by a microperfusion system, in which glass micropipettes filled with the desired solution were controlled by a pressure system and micromanipulators (NT88-V3; Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid diffusion of the microperfusion solution to undesired areas, myofibrils were constantly perfused by a larger perfusion flow that controlled the remaining sarcomeres in the preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micropipettes and needles were pulled using a capillary puller (Kopf Model 720; David Kopf Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micropipette tip diameter was adjusted to 1 m or less (less_than0.5 m for half-sarcomeres) to keep it smaller than the sarcomere A bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experimental procedures were recorded and analyzed using the TrackMate plugin for ImageJ software (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute sarcomere displacement was defined as the difference between the zero position (relaxed state) and the position of the tracked A band during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments comparing the active force development of myofibrils before and after reduction in the number of sarcomeres in series were performed using atomic force microscopy as previously described (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the forces produced by myofibrils are proportional to their cross-sectional areas and because we wanted to compare different conditions irrespective of this variable, all measured forces were normalized and reported in units of stress, assuming a circular geometry for the myofibril (nanonewtons per micrometer2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a two-way ANOVA for repeated measures to compare displacement of A bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nonuniformity experiments, we used one-way ANOVA for repeated measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a StudentNewmanKeuls test when significant changes were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A level of significance of P  0.05 was set for all analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are presented as means Â± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a mechanical model of a half-myofibril to better interpret our experimental data (SI Text, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6S8, Table S1, and Movie S11) using the framework of Campbell (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Modeling_Activation_of_a_Single_Sarcomere_Within_the_Myofibril  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our half-myofibril, there are N inactive half-sarcomeres (or N/2 sarcomeres) adjacent to our activated half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each time interval (t=5ms), we go through the following process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(i) To determine the number of motors that can interact with the thin filament in the activated half-sarcomere, we calculate the overlap of the thick and thin filaments:xoverlap=lthin+lthickxhs,active,[S1]where all lengths are defined in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of myosin heads per unit cross-sectional area in a single half-sarcomere framework is No=1.15Ã1017m2, and the cross-sectional area of the myofibril is A=1012m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the number of motors that can engage with the thin filament is calculated asNmotors=ANo(xoverlapxmax,overlap)xoverlapless_thanxmax,overlapNmotors=ANoxoverlapxmax,overlap,[S2]wherexmax,overlap=lthicklbare=735nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(ii) We next model the cross-bridges as they cycle through the chemomechanical cycle described in Fig S7 and then calculate the resultant forces that change the length of the half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because Nmotors is such a large number, modeling every motor is time-intensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To speed up the simulation, we thus model the cycle for Nmotors/100 cross-bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After calculating the resultant net force, we multiply this value by 100 to determine the total force exerted on the half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We go through each of the Nmotors/100 cross-bridges one at a time using a random number generator to determine whether they will transition to a new state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a motor starting at state i (i = 1, 2, or 3), the random number generator selects a number nrand between 0 and 1, and a decision is made based on the following rules:ifnrandless_thanpforward,themotortransitionstothestatei+1ifpforwardless_thannrandless_thanpforward+pbackward,themotortransitionstothestatei1ifnrandpforward+pbackward,themotorremainsinstatei,[S4]wherepforward=kidtpbackward=kidt,[S5]where all rate constants are given by Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18S20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each motor, we also define a term n describing the extension of the nth elastic cross-bridge linkage away from its equilibrium position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a motor in state 1,  is zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a motor that has just entered state 2 or 3 from state 1,  is also zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a motor that transitions from state 2 to 3,  changes from its current value n to n10nm (indicating a power stroke of magnitude 10nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a motor that transitions from state 3 to 2,  changes from its current value to n+10nm (indicating a reversal of the power stroke).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(iii) We next allow our system to return to mechanical equilibrium by moving the boundaries of each half-sarcomere (defined in Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We solve for the value of yactive that brings the system to equilibrium by finding the value for which all forces cancel out at the interface between the activated and the Nth inactive half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we solve for the value of yactive that satisfies the equilibrium conditionFactive+Finactive+100n=1Nmotor100Fcross-bridge=0,[S6]where the individual terms in this relation are given byFcross-bridge=nkcb(n+yactive),[S7]n=1ifthenthmotorisinstate2or3n=0ifthenthmotorisinstate1[S8]Factive=Aexp((xhs,activeyactive)xoffsetL)[S9]Finactive=Aexp((xhs,inactive+yinactive)xoffsetL),[S10]where we have used the mechanical model described by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S17, and xhs,active and xhs,inactive are the lengths of the active and inactive half-sarcomeres, respectively, and yinactive is the change in the length of an inactive half-sarcomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6S10 leaves us with two unknowns: yactive and yinactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we can relate these two terms using the following argument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the force along the length of the myofibril is the same at every point when the system returns to equilibrium, the interface between the probe and the first inactivate half-sarcomere (Fig S8) moves by a distancey1=Factivekprobe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S11]As a result of this change in the length of the probe, the length of the entire myofibril changes by y1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the length of the region of the myofibril occupied by the N inactive half-sarcomeres has also changed because of the change in length of the active sarcomere (yactive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all inactive half-sarcomeres are at the same length at equilibrium, the change in lengths of the active and inactive sarcomeres are linked through the relationyinactive=yactivey1N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]Combining Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 and S12 yields the relationyinactive=yactiveFactivekprobeN,[S13]where Factive is given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can thus plug Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S10 into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6, yielding an equilibrium condition relation that depends only on the single unknown, yactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then use Matlab to find the value of yactive that satisfies this relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use this value of yactive to adjust the appropriate values in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we make the following changes to our system:xhs,activexhs,activeyactive[S14]xhs,inactivexhs,inactive+yinactive[S15]ii+yactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S16]We repeat steps iiii for each successive time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our simulation does not incorporate a mechanism that explains why the contraction of the active half-sarcomere stops at a half-sarcomere length of 0.75 m (likely because the actin filament enters the bare zone and crosses to the other half-sarcomere), we simply stop the simulation when this value of xhs,active is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Model_of_Myofibril  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We modeled a half-myofibril that consists of numerous adjacent half-sarcomeres linked in series (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every half-sarcomere contains a nonlinear passive component, representing structural molecules with the sarcomere, such as titin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single half-sarcomere at the end of the half-myofibril is activated and thus, also contains cross-bridge linkages, each of which is in parallel with the other cross-bridges and the passive element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the other end of the myofibril is an additional elastic element representing the probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The force generated by stretching the passive element within each half-sarcomere is given by the relationF(xhs)=Aexp(xhsxoffsetL),[S17]where xhs is the length of the half-sarcomere, A is the cross-sectional area of the myofibril,  is the stress at xhs=xoffset, and L defines the curvature of the passive lengthtension relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_of_Cross-Bridges_in_Activated_Sarcomeres  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual cross-bridges within the activated sarcomere pass through a kinetic cycle shown in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motor can be in one of three states: (i) detached from actin in a prestroke state, (ii) attached to actin in a prestroke state, and (iii) attached to actin in a poststroke state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power stroke occurs as the motors transitions from state 2 to state 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both k1 and k1 are force-independent rates, and all other rates exhibit force dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, rates k2 and k3 are described by the relationki=kioexp(FikBT),[S18]where F is the magnitude of the force on the cross-bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive force is defined as a force that is directed in the same direction as the power stroke (i.e., a force that assists the power stroke); 2 and 3 are positive and negative, respectively, to indicate that a positive force accelerates k2 and slows k3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rates of detachment from actin are given byk2=k2oexp(|F|ikBT)[S19]andk3=k3oexp(FikBT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S20]The absolute value in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S19 indicates that the force dependence of this rate is independent of the direction of the applied force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We originally modeled both rates this way but were unable to get the model to emulate the data unless k3 exhibited the asymmetric force dependence described by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The values for all constants used in the model are found in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Myofibril_Preparations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small muscle bundles from rabbit psoas were dissected, rinsed in rigor solution, and tied to wooden sticks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were stored in rigor solution:glycerol (50:50) solution for 15 h at 20 Â°C and then transferred to fresh rigor solution:glycerol (50:50) solution containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) for at least 7 d before experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the day of the experiment, small muscle pieces were cut and defrosted in rigor solution at 4 Â°C for 1 h. These pieces were then homogenized in rigor solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homogenate was transferred to an experimental temperature-controlled bath (10 Â°C), where rigor solution was slowly replaced by relaxing solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibrils were imaged with a phase contrast inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under high magnification (Plan Fluor 100 oil objective plus 1.5Ã built-in microscope magnification used for shorter myofibrils), the contrast between the dark A bands and the light I bands provided a darklight intensity pattern representing the striation pattern produced by the sarcomeres, which enabled the measurement of SL during the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibrils were chosen for mechanical measurement based on their striation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibril contraction was induced using an activation solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
