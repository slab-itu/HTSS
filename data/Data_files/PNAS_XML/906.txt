Waiting can be an optimal conservation strategy, even in a crisis discipline  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Every year, more species are driven to extinction by the combined pressures of habitat destruction, invasive species, and climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ongoing losses have created a crisis culture in conservation, where project funds are spent as soon as they are received.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We challenge this orthodoxy and demonstrate how strategic delays can improve efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Waiting can allow agencies to leverage additional benefits from their funds, through investment, capacity building, or monitoring and research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the right amount of delay, limited conservation resources can protect more species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, they can even do so in less time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, in addition to their current focus on where to target resources, conservation managers should carefully choose when to spend these funds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biodiversity conservation projects confront immediate and escalating threats with limited funding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conservation theory suggests that the best response to the species extinction crisis is to spend money as soon as it becomes available, and this is often an explicit constraint placed on funding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a general dynamic model of a conservation landscape to show that this decision to front-load project spending can be suboptimal if a delay allows managers to use resources more strategically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model demonstrates the existence of temporal efficiencies in conservation management, which parallel the spatial efficiencies identified by systematic conservation planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal timing of decisions balances the rate of biodiversity decline (e.g., the relaxation of extinction debts, or the progress of climate change) against the rate at which spending appreciates in value (e.g., through interest, learning, or capacity building).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We contrast the benefits of acting and waiting in two ecosystems where restoration can mitigate forest bird extinction debts: South Australias Mount Lofty Ranges and Paraguays Atlantic Forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, conservation outcomes cannot be maximized by front-loading spending, and the optimal solution recommends substantial delays before managers undertake conservation actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, these delays allow superior conservation benefits to be achieved, in less time than front-loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses provide an intuitive and mechanistic rationale for strategic delay, which contrasts with the orthodoxy of front-loaded spending for conservation actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate the conservation efficiencies that could be achieved if decision makers choose when to spend their limited resources, as opposed to just where to spend them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamic_Habitat_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We model the impacts of conservation projects in a landscape using a system of deterministic differential equations that link conservation actions through time with a biodiversity conservation goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model captures the essential dynamics of restoration and extinction debts in degraded landscapes, but does not include factors (e.g., stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity) which will have limited influence on the optimal timing but which preclude closed-form solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its structural simplicity therefore emphasizes the contrast between waiting and spending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At any given time, habitat is either not supporting species because it is cleared C(t), or is intact R(t)=1C(t) and can support species [0C(t),R(t)1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Managers are given a single endowment of funds, B(t=0)=B0, which they can spend at any time to convert cleared habitat into intact habitat by restoration, at a cost cR per unit area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unspent funds are invested and accrue interest at proportional rate r. In the analyses that follow, we use inflation-adjusted interest rates, which allow us to use a constant value for cR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Managers define a proportional spending schedule 0u(t)1, with the objective of minimizing the number of extinctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dynamics are described mathematically using two habitat equations and a budget equation:dRdt=u(t)B(t)cR,[1a]dCdt=u(t)B(t)cR,[1b]dBdt=(ru(t))B(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1c]We assume that the speciesarea relationship (SAR) allows equilibrium species richness to be predicted based on the area of intact habitat:S=R(t)z,[2]where  represents regional species richness and z denotes the species accumulation rate in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historic species richness is represented by S= when R = 1 and all of the habitat is intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the amount of current intact habitat is insufficient to support the current number of extant species [i.e., if S(t) greater than S], an extinction debt exists and species will be lost as this debt relaxes at proportional rate :dS(t)dt=[S(t)S]=[S(t)R(t)z].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]The managers objective is to identify the spending schedule that maximizes the number of extant species at some future time T:max0u(t)1S(T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analytic_Solution_for_Optimal_Single_Disbursement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simplest formulation of our problem begins with no intact habitat [R(0)=0], but with a large extinction debt (i.e., all species remain extant: S0=).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A manager delays spending for tS years, and then spends all of the accumulated funds in a single disbursement, allowing the restoration of area R(ts)=B(ts)/cR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal disbursement time maximizes the number of protected species, defined as follows:Sp=max0tsT[min{R(ts)z;S(ts)}],[5]The first term in the set applies when the number of species extant at ts equals or exceeds the number that can be supported by the restored land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second term applies when the extinction debt has relaxed to below the level that can be supported by the restored land (i.e., the managers waited too long).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the increase in the first term and the decrease in the second term are both monotonic, the optimal time to disburse the funds occurs when the functions intersect (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For r  greater than  0, this occurs at time:ts=zln(cRB0)rz+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]This solution shows that, for a single disbursement, some length of delay is always optimal, given two common conservation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the initial budget must be insufficient to immediately eliminate the extinction debt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition is ubiquitous in conservation (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, inflation-adjusted real interest rates must be positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition is almost always true, even for conservative instruments such as Treasury bonds (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal length of the delay is determined by the initial restoration budget, and the rates of change within the system (SI Model of the System Dynamics for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerator shows that expensive restoration costs (relative to the budget: cR/B0) will encourage longer delays, while the denominator indicates that faster extinction debt relaxation () and higher interest rates (r) incentivize front-loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher interest rates make investment more attractive because capacity to act increases more rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher interest rates therefore result in shorter delays because it takes less time to amass the resources required to fund all necessary restoration activities (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimal_Disbursement_Schedule  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The single disbursement solution reveals the essential factors that govern the duration of the optimal delay, but conservation resources are often obtained and expended over a longer period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following two case studies, we identify a disbursement schedule that maximizes bird species richness at the end of the planning horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use each case study to illustrate a different project funding scenario: the Mount Lofty Ranges case study receives a recurrent annual budget from a central funding organization; the Atlantic Forests case study is structured as a sinking fund, where an initial lump sum is raised to fund a single initiative, without an expectation of ongoing funds (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the managers can choose to spend a proportion of their resources every year and accrue interest on the remainder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operationally, we used numerical optimization (Matlab R2016a; MathWorks) to identify the disbursement schedule u(t) that maximizes Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 under the constraints of Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Model of the System Dynamics for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Case_Study_1__Mount_Lofty_Ranges_(Australia)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Mount Lofty Ranges woodlands ecoregion (MLR) in Southern Australia acts as a habitat island for woodland bird species because it experiences substantially higher rainfall (4001,100 mm/y) than surrounding ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, 115 species of birds were found in this 500,000-ha region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive land clearing has reduced the forest cover by 87% (38) (Table S1), and the SAR predicts that this amount of habitat loss will eventually cause 35 bird extinctions (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, only eight extinctions have occurred, with a further eight species considered near extinction (40) (Table S2); this indicates the presence of a sizeable extinction debt (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biogeographic analyses of southern Australian forest bird communities estimate the relevant SAR parameters to be z = 0.17 and  = 13.6 (39), and historical survey data and forest cover records indicate an extinction debt relaxation rate of =2.5×103 y1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoration costs (cR) are estimated at $1,132 (2016 AUD per hectare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that decision makers can secure a constant 5.8% interest rate, based on Australias inflation-adjusted lending interest rate over the past 25 years (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Revegetation has been shown to counteract further bird decline in the MLR (42, 43), and at least $500,000 (2016 AUD) per year is spent protecting and restoring priority areas within the ecoregion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Model of the System Dynamics and Fig S2 for an explanation of these parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 shows that, if this level of annual funding is continually and immediately invested into direct restoration of habitats, the existing extinction debt will be negated in 250 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such front-loading of the disbursement of funds will conserve 102 species by restoring 116,400 ha of habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if managers are allowed to delay spending, this extinction debt could be negated within 78 years, with 147,300 ha of habitat restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal solution invests the annual budget for more than 40 years before undertaking direct conservation actions, with the accumulated funds gradually liquidated over the subsequent three decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the initial phase of delay, more extinctions occur than in the front-loaded schedule (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the optimal spending schedule eventually reduces the number of extinctions by 51% over business as usual and allows the extinction debt to be eliminated within 78 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A delay therefore allows managers to achieve their aims in less than half the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our optimization approach allows the optimal solution to take the form of a single disbursement, but the best decision is to gradually spend the invested funds over a series of years (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small amount of early spending slows down the species loss rate (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), allowing managers more time to invest the remaining resources, and therefore to protect more species (SI Model of the System Dynamics and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sensitivity test with a more conservative interest rate estimate, based on Australian Treasury bond returns, resulted in a longer optimal delay (SI Model of the System Dynamics and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note that our results do not represent a strict recommendation to wait decades before acting, since a delay of this length would be untenable for most conservation organizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the optimal solution emphasizes the potential efficiencies that are foregone by a decision to front-loading spending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Case_Study_2__Atlantic_Forest_(Paraguay)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
South Americas Atlantic Forest is a consensus global conservation priority (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence for a substantial extinction debt in the ecoregion (33), with dramatic clearing in the 1980s leaving little intact habitat (25%) and many threatened species, but causing few immediate extinctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  International and national initiatives (e.g., Pacto Mata Atlantica, The Nature Conservancys One Billion Trees program, World Wildlife Fund, Paraguay Biodiversidad) aim to restore forest before any of the 124 forest-dependent endemic bird species go extinct (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Habitat dynamics for the region are parameterized using =0.03 y1 (44), z = 0.18, and =16 (45), and restoration costs are estimated at $153,000 km2 (46) (2016 USD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All resources made available to the project are placed into a sinking fund in the first year of the project (37), and we assume an initial investment equivalent to Brazils FUNBIO fund of $500 million (2016 USD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While invested, the sinking fund returns a rate of 3.6% per year, based on the US lending interest rate adjusted for inflation over the past 25 years (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Model of the System Dynamics for an explanation of these parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 shows that, if spending is heavily front-loaded (specifically, entirely within the first 5 years), species loss will halt in 143 years, protecting 87 species with 3,340 km2 of additional restored habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, in the optimal delayed schedule, managers accrue interest on their unspent funds for 40 years before they start to disburse them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the accumulated funds are spent over the following nearly 20 years, the restored habitat will protect 96 species, restoring 12,000 km2 of forest habitat in the process, and halting extinction within 58 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, an optimal delay accelerated conservation outcomes and achieved a 23% reduction in expected extinctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger initial budget or higher interest rate will result in a shorter delay (including a small amount of spending in the first year) but front-loading remains suboptimal (SI Model of the System Dynamics and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More conservative interest rate estimates, based on Federal Reserve bond returns, result in a longer optimal delay (SI Model of the System Dynamics and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Model_of_the_System_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analytic_Solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the general conditions for optimality by calculating an analytic solution for the simplest case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the management strategy is to wait before spending the endowment, until a time ts when a single intervention is made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before and after this intervention, no protection is undertaken, and we assume that there are R0 protected areas at the beginning of the scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until the funding is spent, it is either banked or invested, during which time it accumulates compound interest at rate r. Thus, by the time the intervention occurs, the total budget will be as follows:B(ts)=B0erts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]The number of species remaining extant at that point in time S(ts) can be derived from the extinction debt dynamics:dS(t)dt=[S(t)R0z],[S2]dS(t)dt+S(t)=R0z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Thus:S(ts)=R0z+(S0R0z)ets,[S4]where S0 is the number of species that existed at the beginning of the project [i.e., S(0)=S0].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we examine the case where there is initially no area protected; thus:S(t)=S0et.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]If we spend all of the funding at some time ts, then at this point we will restore an amount of habitat R(ts)=B(ts)/cR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This habitat will protect a certain amount of species Sp that is either:Sp(ts)=R(ts)z,[S6]orSp(ts)=S0ets.[S7]Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 holds if the decision maker acts quickly, while there are still more extant species than the newly protected land can support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the steadily growing capacity that results from investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 holds when the decision maker acts slowly, and the amount of land they protect can support more species than remain extant in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This equation reflects the inexorable extinction of species that are not supported by sufficient habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the management objective is to maximize the number of extant species following a T year conservation project:max0tsTSp(T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]The optimal decision is to spend the budget when the species protection functions are equal (Fig 1):[B0ertscR]z=S0ets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]We can scale this equation by expressing the original number of species present in the region as a proportion of (s=S0/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal disbursment time is then as follows:ts=ln(s)+zln(cRB0)zr+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]This formulation describes the critical ecological and habitat dynamics as instantaneous rates (e.g., the loss of species, or the clearing and restoration of habitat), but we acknowledge that in practice they occur as discrete events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the objective of this exercise is to understand the general attributes of optimal approaches to funding conservation, as opposed to suggesting specific conservation action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If specific management recommendations are desired, a more detailed model formulation will be necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Numerical_Optimization_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Operationally, we calculated the optimal disbursement solution using FMINCON, a constrained numerical optimization routine in Matlab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discretize the control function u(t) into a vector of 51 different control variables 0ui1, which we distribute evenly across the project of total duration T. Thus, u1 is the proportion of the funds spend on direct conservation actions between 0tless_thanT/50, u2 is the proportion of the funds spent between T/50tless_than2T/50, and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose a value of T with increasing length, until the all funds have been expended well before the end of the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then allow the numerical optimization routine to choose values for ui that maximize the number of extant species at T. We initialize each ui at a random value between 0 and 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the probability that the algorithm is finding the global optimum, we repeatedly ran the algorithm from multiple initial conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both case studies, the algorithm found the same optimal schedule from each set of initial conditions, suggesting that the optimum was globally attracting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_Test_of_Case_Study_Results_with_Treasury_Bond_Interest_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis used inflation-adjusted lending interest rates to estimate the return on investments, but this may be an optimistic expectation of what conservation organizations could secure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a sensitivity test in which we substituted relevant Treasury bond rates for interest rates in the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are securities issued by national governments which carry a fixed annual rate of interest over the medium to long term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They provide low-risk, predictable returns, but generally at a relatively low rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results emphasize an important additional dimension in systematic conservation planning by demonstrating that there are optimal times to take action, in addition to optimal locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When conservation capacity can increase faster than the irreversible rate of biodiversity decline, a delay of finite duration allows projects to leverage additional advantage from conservation funds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategic delay can thus allow decision makers to protect more specieseven to complete projects more rapidlysuggesting that front-loaded conservation projects may be overlooking a substantial source of efficiency in the temporal dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal amount of delay will balance the rate of biodiversity loss with the rate at which waiting increases managers capacity to act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our specific examples, we use financial interest to represent the benefits of waiting because it is conceptually simple, and extinction debts to represent the incentive to act immediately because they offer a well-understood link between the loss of habitat and the loss of species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, competing rates of biodiversity loss and capacity accumulation are, in some form, present in all conservation problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our central conclusion is that a focus on future capacity, at the expense of immediate action, can deliver superior outcomes over relevant timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many conservation organizations clearly understand this concept and focus on activities that deliver delayed, long-term benefits (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prominent examples include environmental education and awareness initiatives, climate change adaptation projects, and conservation policy think tanks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work demonstrates that delayed action can also deliver efficiencies at the scale of individual projects, which are primarily concerned with direct conservation actions such as restoration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion runs counter to standard conservation practice at a project level: many sources of one-off funding (e.g., grants, offsets) ask projects to deliver and report on outcomes within short time frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, philanthropic rating schemes tend to encourage organizations to spend more of their income immediately, on direct actions (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as spatially constrained conservation planning cannot deliver the best outcomes (50, 51), temporal constraints incur opportunity costs, by restricting managers freedom to act at the most effective point in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous conservation theory has shown how prioritizing actions across time can result in superior outcomes (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5257).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these dynamic optimizations still treat conservation as a race against timethey essentially identify where to front-load spending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we take advantage of variation along the temporal dimension to identify efficient periods of time in which to act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An assessment of the shadow values of alternative actions confirms the existence of periods of high relative efficiency (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our ideas also have close analogues in environmental and resource economics, but with important differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real options analysis has long understood that delaying irreversible actions can be an optimal strategy, because waiting allows decision makers to learn more about the situation, and to respond better to uncertain future events (5860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a parallel justification for waiting, but where the returns to management actions are known with certainty because the system dynamics are deterministic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our conclusions are closely related to Hotellings rule, which states that nonrenewable resources should initially be strategically underexploited to increase future revenue (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Fishers rule illustrates how the timing of logging in production forests should reflect the timber growth rate, price, and economic discount rate (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the conservation problem is the inverse of these resource extraction problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than maximizing the revenue generated by exploiting a limited resource, we seek to minimize the loss of a declining resource, while operating under tight budget constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is that the discount rate works against resource managers and for conservation managers (because it acts to increase their capacity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, because they are pursuing opposite goals, in both cases lower interest rates encourage longer strategic delays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We made a series of simplifying assumptions to clearly highlight the competing rates that drive the optimal delays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ecological and economic models are deterministic, whereas both systems experience variability and shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both the costs (e.g., land prices) and benefits of delay will become more uncertain in more distant futures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sources of uncertainty will change our model recommendations and are a critical reason why our resultsparticularly those that recommend decades of delayshould not be used prescriptively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these factors do not change the central conclusion, that strategic delay can deliver conservation benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecologically, our models assume that restoration rapidly and predictably restores habitat, but functional habitat can lag restoration actions by many decades, and restored habitat may never be fully equivalent (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more complex alternative models that include time lags and uncertainty in restoration do not affect conclusions in comparable models (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of conservation organizations to capitalize on temporal opportunities will be subject to constraints on institutions financial flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits of investment for future spending will be unavailable to agencies that operate under short budget cycles, and penalize surpluses (64), or to funding instruments (e.g., grants) that expect spending to occur within defined time frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that there is an advantage to developing conservation institutions and instruments that are free of these constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a growing number of organizations are establishing long-term conservation trust funds (65, 66) [e.g., The Nature Conservancys Land Preservation Fund (67)] or are using investments to secure perpetual management income (e.g., Tasmanian Land Conservancy Management Endowment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sinking funds, which we modeled in our Atlantic Forest case study (Fig 3), are another vehicle for leveraging interest from conservation resources and for avoiding front-loaded spending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These funds are becoming increasingly common [e.g., EcoFundo in Ecuador, or FUNBIO in Brazil (68)] and are well-suited to one-off funding sources such as large endowments or offsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the importance of the temporal flexibility offered by these financial instruments but emphasize how their disbursement time frames should reflect the ecological dynamics of the target ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
