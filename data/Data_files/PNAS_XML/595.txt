Low Hesperian PCO2 constrained from in situ mineralogical analysis at Gale Crater, Mars  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 3.5-Ga sedimentary rocks surveyed by the Mars Science Laboratory rover in Gale Crater, Mars, contain secondary mineral phases indicating aqueous alteration and release of cations from mafic minerals during sediment deposition in lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, carbonate phases are not detected, and our model calculations indicate atmospheric CO2 levels at the time of sediment deposition 10s to 100s of times lower than those required by climate models to warm early Mars enough to maintain surficial water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results offer a ground-based reference point for the evolution of martian atmospheric CO2 and imply that other mechanisms of warming Hesperian Mars, or processes that allowed for confined hydrological activity under cold conditions, must be sought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbon dioxide is an essential atmospheric component in martian climate models that attempt to reconcile a faint young sun with planetwide evidence of liquid water in the Noachian and Early Hesperian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we use mineral and contextual sedimentary environmental data measured by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover Curiosity to estimate the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) coinciding with a long-lived lake system in Gale Crater at 3.5 Ga. A reactiontransport model that simulates mineralogy observed within the Sheepbed member at Yellowknife Bay (YKB), by coupling mineral equilibria with carbonate precipitation kinetics and rates of sedimentation, indicates atmospheric PCO2 levels in the 10s mbar range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At such low PCO2 levels, existing climate models are unable to warm Hesperian Mars anywhere near the freezing point of water, and other gases are required to raise atmospheric pressure to prevent lake waters from being lost to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, either lacustrine features of Gale formed in a cold environment by a mechanism yet to be determined, or the climate models still lack an essential component that would serve to elevate surface temperatures, at least locally, on Hesperian Mars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also impose restrictions on the potential role of atmospheric CO2 in inferred warmer conditions and valley network formation of the late Noachian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermodynamic stability of secondary minerals (magnetite and Fe saponite) detected in the Sheepbed member, Yellowknife Bay with respect to siderite under varying pH and gaseous CO2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold PCO2 at which siderite is favored over ferrian saponite is dependent on aqueous silica and Al3+ activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold is higher when SiO2(aq) is saturated with respect to amorphous silica (long dashed line) rather than quartz (short dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases Al3+ is set to saturation with respect to albitereasonable given that the Sheepbed contains 20 wt % plagioclase feldspar (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In drawing the stability boundaries for magnetite, redox state is set at the magnetite/hematite boundary, as detailed in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All thermodynamic data come from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory dataset (15) with the exception of Fe saponite (Na0.35Fe3Al0.35Si3.65O10OH2) determined by Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diagram produced using Geochemist Work Bench 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our models are constructed to determine threshold PCO2 levels that would permit the precipitation of detectable amounts of siderite by CheMin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For samples bearing the mixture of phases observed within Sheepbed mudstone (9), CheMin has a detection limit of 1 wt % siderite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAM instrument detects release of CO2 upon sample heating, which can, in part, be derived from decomposition of carbonate minerals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of SAM analyses of YKB sediments provide no clear indication of Fe carbonate, but the expected CO2 signal for carbonates may be masked by other CO2 sources thus permitting the presence of Fe carbonates at abundances below the CheMin detection limit (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Precipitation rates and therefore accumulation of carbonates depend on the saturation state of pore water with respect to a particular carbonate phase (), given bycarbonate=[M2+][CO32][Ksp],[1]where Ksp is the solubility product of the carbonate in question and M2+ represents the concentration of the metal cation in pore water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
 is linked to carbonate precipitation rate (Rcarbprec) by the expression,Rcarbprec=Kcarbprec(carbonate1)n,[2]where Kcarbprec is the rate constant and n is the order of the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our models calculate [CO32] by simulating advection, diffusion, and reaction of DIC species, including precipitation of carbonate, in a one-dimensional porous sedimentary profile subject to active sedimentary accumulation and burial (detailed in SI Text, Model Details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion and advection from the upper model boundary actively replenish DIC (including CO32) lost from pore waters during carbonate precipitation and transport and, thus, are of critical importance in modeling the total carbonate accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper model boundary conditions are set to simulate a well-mixed lake in equilibrium with an assigned PCO2 atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a valid representation given the absence of glaciogenic sedimentary features, such as dropstones, ice wedges, and glacial tills, in Gale lake deposits that would indicate ice cover, and the meter-scale thicknesses of delta deposits that indicate water depths of the same order (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can make broad inferences about lake water chemistry at the time of YKB formation deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salinity appears to have been low based on limited Cl and S concentration in the sedimentary matrix and the lack of detection of evaporative minerals in the mudstone (9, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is compatible with bulk geochemical evidence of limited chemical alteration of sediments during erosion and transport from the source area (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed stability of clay minerals and magnetite in the sediments implies circum-neutral pH pore waters (Fig 1) that were not overwhelmed by hypothesized surficial sources of acidity sometimes invoked for Mars aqueous environments (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DIC speciation and concentrations at the upper model boundary (representing lake water) are calculated over a range of assigned pHs and atmospheric PCO2 levels, with the lowest pH of 5 corresponding to the lower stability field of magnetite (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A variety of approaches to estimate the activity of metal cations required to calculate the saturation states and accumulation rates of carbonates are possible (Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in a full kinetic model, metal cation activities are calculated as a function of competing mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, and in the case of Fe2+, the redox state of pore waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this approach provides the most mathematically complete model of a given system, the assigned kinetic parameters are subject to significant uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the rate laws governing saponite precipitation are unknown and must be guessed through comparison with other clay minerals that differ in terms of chemistry and crystal structure (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, order-of-magnitude differences between kinetic rate laws determined in the laboratory and observed in natural systems are a well-documented challenge for reactiontransport models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternatively, if the goal of the model is to obtain an absolute upper threshold of PCO2 consistent with nondetection of carbonates at Gale Crater, then our preferred hybrid kinetic model formulation becomes suitable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculating an upper PCO2 threshold requires a minimum bound on the activity of metal cations in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sediments at YKB, where evidence of magnetite and saponite precipitation at the time of deposition is documented, a minimum bound can be placed on Fe2+ activity in pore water by assuming that both magnetite and ferrian saponite are at or above saturation levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1 shows that with expected activities of silica and Al3+, ferrian saponite is always supersatured when [Fe2+] is at saturation with respect to magnetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, [Fe2+] is calculated in the model assuming that pore waters are saturated with respect to magnetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that in a full kinetic model [Fe2+] would approach magnetite saturation in a situation where precipitation of magnetite and saponite outcompeted siderite for [Fe2+].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate pore water [Fe2+] based on magnetite saturation requires a redox constraint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redox is assigned to the magnetite/hematite boundary, again minimizing [Fe2+] in the model profile, in keeping with the goal of obtaining an upper PCO2 threshold (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formulating the model in this way is also consistent with detection of small amounts of hematite in YKB sediments (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state is represented by the following chemical reaction:Magnetite+2[H+]=[Fe2+]+[H2O]+Hematite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By calculating the equilibrium constant Kmag/hem for reaction 3 at given temperature and salinity values and assuming H2O activity of 1 a pH-dependent expression for [Fe2+] is obtained.[Fe2+]=Kmag/hem.[H+]2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
[Fe2+] is calculated in the model profile at each time step based on pH using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 allowing the saturation state with respect to siderite to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining calculated siderite with the slowest kinetic rate law governing siderite precipitation available in the literature (Table S1), we determine the upper threshold of atmospheric PCO2 that would result in siderite being undetectable by CheMin in the YKB formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in configuring the model in this way it is assumed that siderite precipitation kinetics limit carbonate production; Fe2+ supplied by the dissolution of olivine does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 shows this assumption is valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical equilibrium outputs of a model run are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A shows upper PCO2 thresholds for siderite detection over a range of assigned water column pH and at various sediment accumulation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water column pH has limited influence on rates of siderite production between values of 5 and 7 in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because siderite precipitation rate is determined by siderite = [Fe2+][CO32-], where at low pH small carbonate anion concentrations are compensated for by higher [Fe2+] required to maintain magnetite saturation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above pH 7, PCO2 thresholds decrease (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maintain high pH within a water column in equilibrium with the range of atmospheric PCO2 values investigated here requires elevated carbonate alkalinity and thus DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High DIC levels make diffusion and carbonate precipitation in the lower parts of modeled sedimentary profiles more efficient, lowering PCO2 thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we aim to determine an upper constraint on PCO2 we focus our discussion on the PCO2 thresholds obtained assuming pH of lake waters between 5 and 7the lowest values compatible with saponite and magnetite precipitation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sedimentary porosity influences the rates of siderite production by controlling the quantity of pore water DIC available for reaction with Fe2+ released from olivine and rates of chemical diffusion within sediments, both of which generally increase with porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Earth, mud deposits typically have initial porosities of between 60 and 80% (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have assigned a porosity value of 60% in our model profiles to obtain upper PCO2 thresholds (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant sedimentary compaction is expected within 1.53 m model interval where carbonates form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calculated PCO2 thresholds are also highly sensitive to sediment accumulation rates, with faster rates permitting higher threshold atmospheric PCO2 levels (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have no direct constraints on the rates of deposition of the YKB formation, but given the similarity of the sedimentary architecture with terrestrial fluviallacustrine deposits (8) we use compilations of thousands of lacustrine accumulation rates observed on Earth to obtain an upper limit for the YKB formation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terrestrial lacustrine sedimentation rates span several orders of magnitude, with a dependence on the time span of accumulation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With accumulation times of 100s to 10,000 y estimated for the 1.5-m-thick Sheepbed member (12), accumulation rates as high as 5 cm/y are possible, with an average rate 0.1 cm/y (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lacustrine deposits with sedimentation rates 1cm/y make up less_than1% of available records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest rates are not sustainable for periods of more than 100 y, thus we use an upper sedimentation rate of 1 cm/y in calculating PCO2 estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that temperature and pore water salinity have a minor influence on PCO2 thresholds (Fig 2B; SI Text, Sensitivity Tests).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 10 °C and a salinity of 10 g/kg, an accumulation rate of 1 cm/y and sedimentary porosity of 60% the upper limit on PCO2 levels where siderite production remains below XRD detection limits in the Sheepbed member is 70 mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This falls to 10 mbar at average sedimentation rates of 0.1 cm/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our PCO2 estimates are orders of magnitude above those based on thermodynamic stability of magnetite with respect to siderite (Fig 1), but remain well below the 1000s mbar CO2 levels required by the most optimistic climate simulations to keep the average temperature of early Mars above 273 K for long periods (33); for example, Ramirez et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34) model clement conditions at 1.3 bars CO2, with 20% H2 as an additional greenhouse gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed above, our models and choice of input parameters are designed to provide an absolute upper limit PCO2 based on observed mineralogy and sedimentology at YKB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are various reasons to believe that [Fe2+] was higher in pore waters and PCO2 may have been lower than the thresholds shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is possible that magnetite and hematite detected in YKB sediments (9) are detrital phases that do not place bounds on pore water [Fe2+] or act as a sink for Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow for more reducing conditions, higher [Fe2+] (Fig S2) and lower PCO2 thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, if the supply of [Fe2+] from olivine outstripped removal by secondary phases (i.e., olivine dissolution kinetics  precipitation of secondary phases), [Fe2+] would also be higher than in our upper threshold PCO2 simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both these cases [Fe2+] would tend toward approaching levels of olivine saturation, thus providing a reduced PCO2 threshold limit for a given sedimentation rate, porosity, salinity, and temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model [Fe2+] for this lower PCO2 threshold based on olivine saturation requires an assumption about [SiO2(aq)] of pore waters to be made, but in natural near-surface pore waters [SiO2(aq)] is typically between saturation with respect to quartz or amorphous silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both these situations can be used to obtain a pH-dependent expression to determine [Fe2+]:Fayalite+4[H+]=2[Fe2+]+Quartz+2[H2O],[5]orFayalite+4[H+]=2[Fe2+]+Amorphoussilica+2[H2O],[6][Fe2+]=Kreaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [H+]4,[7]where Kreaction is the reaction constant of either Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 or 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting PCO2 thresholds are shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With comparable porosity and burial rates PCO2 thresholds are approximately half the values calculated assuming pore water [Fe2+] at magnetite saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reinforces our estimates that the martian atmosphere contained 10s mbar levels at the time of deposition of YKB sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluviallacustrine sediments in Gale Crater represent one of the youngest known instances of habitable surficial aqueous conditions on Mars, on the tail end of a period of rapid atmospheric degradation and loss (6, 12, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our PCO2 estimate serves as a reference point at a critical juncture in martian atmospheric evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining 10s mbar estimates of PCO2 derived from Gale Crater with upper estimates of the amount of CO2 lost through sequestration as carbonate minerals in the martian crust (up to 500 mbar CO2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35) and CO2 lost to space (less_than100 mbar; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) limits atmospheric CO2 during the Noachian and Early Hesperian to 100s mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is well below threshold levels required to keep the average temperature of early Mars above 273 K for long periods in climate models, therefore either lacustrine features of Gale formed in a cold environment (37) or the problem of reconciling Mars' early climate with geological record of an active hydrosphere remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that the overall lack of carbonates found in the geological record of Mars (5, 6, 28, 35) is a direct reflection of the composition of the ancient atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Model_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reactiontransport model was developed in Ran open source statistical computing environment (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ReacTran, a package of functions, routines, and solvers for reactivetransport modeling, was used (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, functions in packages seacarb and marelec are used to calculate initial carbonate speciation in the water column based on specified PCO2 and pH, as well as equilibrium constants and diffusion coefficients of chemical species under the specified physical and chemical conditions (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model finds a numerical solution to a set of three ordinary differential equations describing the temporal change in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, and siderite concentration in a one-dimensional porous sedimentary profile subject to diffusion and advection (transport) associated with sedimentary accumulation, and chemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model equations were formulated using the direct substitution approach (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracking temporal changes in the pH and DIC of the model domain allows calculation of the concentration of any species of inorganic carbon (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exchange with lake water, assumed to behave as an infinite reservoir and represented by the upper boundary condition imposed on the model domain, occurs by diffusion only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in the main text and shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3, simulations are run with a range of lake water chemistries constrained to be in equilibrium with prescribed atmospheric CO2 levels and lake water pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rate of siderite precipitation follows the general scheme described in the main text and depends on the saturation state of pore waters with respect to siderite (), given byFeCO3=[Fe2+][CO32]Ksp,[S1]where Ksp is the solubility product of siderite calculated with the formulation of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44 and adjusted with salinity following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
[CO32-] is calculated at each time step from DIC and pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As justified in the main text, [Fe2+] is set to be saturated with respect to either magnetite or fayalite as represented by reactions S2S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of reaction S2 O2(aq) activity is set to equal the magnetite/hematite boundary.Magnetite+2[H+]=[Fe2+]+[H2O]+Hematite,[S2]Fayalite+4[H+]=2[Fe2+]+Quartz+2[H2O],[S3]orFayalite+4[H+]=2[Fe2+]+Amorphoussilica+2[H2O].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SUPCRT, implemented in the R package CHNOSZ (46), was used to calculate equilibrium constant of these reactions at given temperature and salinity values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [Fe2+] is calculated within the model profile at each time step based on pH and provides a lower limit on [Fe2+].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FeCO3 is linked to carbonate precipitation rates by the expression:Rsidprec=ksidprec(FeCO31)n.[S5]Here, ksidprec is the kinetic constant for siderite precipitation and n is the order of the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the lowest value of ksidprec (0.05 mmol·kg1·y1 at 25 °C) available from the literature (Table S1) because the aim is to obtain an upper bound on atmospheric PCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ksidprec varies with temperature (ksidprecT) according toKsidprecT=Ksidprec25.eEaR(1T1298.15K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]An activation energy (Ea) of 54 kJ/mol was used based on the experimental work of Johnson (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Siderite precipitation shows a first-order dependence on saturation state thus n = 1 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations are initiated with DIC, pH, and siderite content set to zero throughout the model sediment column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the model is run, siderite precipitates and is buried, a process that consumes DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth of the model domain is manually adjusted through trial and error to ensure negligible carbonate is being added at the base of the model profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model profiles are typically 1.5 m deep and split into 45 layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model results are collected after equilibrium is assured, an interval of 250 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical equilibrium outputs of a model run are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Olivine_Dissolution_and_Siderite_Precipitation_Kinetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed in the main text, the model formulation implemented assumes that siderite precipitation kinetics limit carbonate production rather than Fe2+ supplied by the dissolution of olivine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 compares olivine dissolution rates from pH 510 with siderite precipitation rates for a range of siderite saturation states observed in model simulations ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olivine dissolution rate calculations follow the formulation of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51 and a specific surface area of 5 m2/g, measured on olivine powder with similar grain size as the Sheepbed mudstone at YKB (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olivine dissolution always outpaces siderite precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
