title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in cooperative behavior among Damaraland mole rats are consequences of an age-related polyethism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonreproductive group members of naked and Damaraland mole rats are thought to be organized in permanent, distinct castes that differ in behavior and physiology, suggesting that their social organization resembles that of obligatorily eusocial insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study tests predictions about the distribution of cooperative behavior based on the suggestion that individual differences represent a caste system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide no evidence that helpers show fixed, divergent developmental pathways or specialize in particular tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, variation in their behavior appears to represent an age-related polyethism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that the behavioral organization of social mole-rat groups is similar to that of other singular cooperatively breeding vertebrates, and that similarities to obligatorily eusocial insects have been overestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many cooperative breeders, the contributions of helpers to cooperative activities change with age, resulting in age-related polyethisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, some studies of social mole rats (including naked mole rats, Heterocephalus glaber, and Damaraland mole rats, Fukomys damarensis) suggest that individual differences in cooperative behavior are the result of divergent developmental pathways, leading to discrete and permanent functional categories of helpers that resemble the caste systems found in eusocial insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that, in Damaraland mole rats, individual contributions to cooperative behavior increase with age and are higher in fast-growing individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual contributions to different cooperative tasks are intercorrelated and repeatability of cooperative behavior is similar to that found in other cooperatively breeding vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide no evidence that nonreproductive individuals show divergent developmental pathways or specialize in particular tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of representing a caste system, variation in the behavior of nonreproductive individuals in Damaraland mole rats closely resembles that found in other cooperatively breeding mammals and appears to be a consequence of age-related polyethism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Age-Related_and_Size-Related_Changes_in_Cooperative_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cooperative behavior increased with age in both sexes and differed among nonreproductive individuals depending on their residual body mass (interaction: sex × residual body mass × age) (Fig 1A and Table 1, total cooperation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males and females with high residual body mass (i.e., fast-growing individuals) invested more in cooperative behavior than individuals with low residual body mass during the first year of their life, but this relationship reversed in the second year when females with low residual body mass showed higher investment in cooperative behavior than males or females with high residual body mass (interaction: sex × residual body mass × age) (Fig 1A and Table 1, total cooperation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across nonreproductive individuals older than 600 d but with unknown exact age, body mass did not predict investment in cooperative behavior (Fig 1B) [generalized linear mixed model (GLMM): body mass: estimate = 0.07, P = 0.18; sex: estimate = 0.11, P = 0.34, n = 644 observations of n = 75 individuals in 13 groups].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymptotic body mass of known-aged individuals (derived from a Gompertz growth function) was also unrelated to investment in summed cooperative behavior after the age of 300 d (GLMM, asymptotic body mass, estimate = 0.02, P = 0.63, n = 122) and in all age categories, frequency distribution of total cooperation across individuals showed no evidence for bi- or multimodal distribution (Fig 2 AD) (Hartigans dip test for unimodality/multimodality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P = 0.53; P = 0.98; P = 0.81; P = 0.95 for age classes 60238 d old; 239418; 419600; individuals over 600 d of age, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Repeatability of cooperative behavior was low when calculated for all individuals of known age, when restricting the analysis to individuals older than 300 d or when restricting to individuals older than 600 d (original scale repeatability: R = 0.018, R = 0.009, R = 0.017, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After accounting for the effects of age and residual body mass, the repeatability of cooperative behavior was estimated as R = 0.154 including individuals of all ages, and R = 0.166 for individuals older than 300 d. The random factor individual identity explained 2% of the variation in the data and including it improved the fit of the model (log-likelihood ratio test, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main model for total cooperation (Table 1, total cooperation) explained 14.5% of the variation in the data (conditional R2 = 0.145, marginal R2 = 0.10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ontogeny_of_Investment_in_Digging__Nest_Building__Food_Carrying__and_Alloparental_Care  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three main aspects of cooperative behavior (digging, nest building, and carrying food to a communal storage) showed similar development during ontogeny (Fig 3 AC and Table 1, digging, nest building, and food carrying).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast-growing individuals exhibited higher investment in all three behaviors early in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males and fast-growing females reduced digging after reaching an age of 300 d (Fig 3A and Table 1, digging) and nest building activity declined in fast-growing males and females sooner than in slow-growing individuals (Fig 3B and Table 1, nest building).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex differences were small but females tended to invest more in nest building and showed higher investment in digging and total cooperation until reaching 1 y of age (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investment in nest building and food carrying decreased in males and females older than 1 y and females tended to invest more time in nest building (Fig 3 B and C and Table 1, nest building and food carrying).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairwise across individual comparisons of digging, nest building, and food carrying suggested that investment in different aspects of cooperation correlated positively with each aspect (Fig S1) (diggingfood carrying, estimate = 0.39, r2 = 0.22, P less_than 0.001, n = 177; diggingnest building, estimate = 0.2, r2 = 0.14 P less_than 0.001, n = 177; food carryingnest building, estimate = 0.21, r2 = 0.01, P = 0.069, n = 177).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alloparental care is rare in Damaraland mole rats and is mainly displayed when offspring in the group are below 1 mo of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean frequency of alloparental care shown by nonreproductive individuals was not associated with residual body mass or age but females carried pups more frequently than males (Fig 4) (GLMM; growth, P = 0.9; age2, P = 0.11; age, P = 0.34; sex, estimate = 0.76, P = 0.045, n = 226 observations of n = 91 individuals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of alloparental care was unrelated to any other form of cooperative behavior (alloparental caredigging, P = 0.26, n = 86; alloparental carefood carrying, P = 0.61, n = 86; alloparental carenest building, P = 0.49, n = 86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide no indication that behavioral differences in cooperation in Damaraland mole rats are a consequence of divergent developmental strategies as would be expected in the caste system suggested for social mole rats (1214).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investment in cooperation increased with age and was initially higher in fast-growing individuals, indicated by high body mass for a given age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was especially pronounced for digging behavior, the most common and energetically expensive domain of cooperative activities in social mole rat societies (Fig 3A) and may be caused by higher tolerance for the energetic demands of cooperation in fast-growing individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nest building and food carrying also showed differences in development, depending on growth trajectories consistent with the prediction of state-dependent life histories (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in many cooperatively breeding species, age was the most important predictor of an individuals contribution to cooperative tasks (Table 1, total cooperation, digging, and nest building) (3, 8, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contributions to different cooperative activities are positively correlated across individuals, suggesting that specialization in cooperative activities does not occur (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns resemble distribution of cooperation in other social vertebrate groups where factors that alter the energetic costs of cooperative behavior often result in changes of investment in cooperation (3, 10, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the age of 600 d, when practically all individuals had reached asymptotic body mass, small and large nonreproductive individuals did not differ in their contributions to cooperative behavior (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, across individuals known to be younger than 600 d, asymptotic body mass also did not predict investment in cooperation, suggesting that there are no distinct differences in the behavioral phenotype emerging during ontogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral differences during early ontogeny did not translate into the emergence of distinct behavioral castes in any age class of nonreproductive individuals and most of them reduced investment in cooperation when reaching asymptotic body mass (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals maintained plasticity in cooperative behavior, which resulted in low to moderate estimates of repeatability that were comparable to the levels of repeatability found in other cooperatively breeding vertebrates such as meerkats [compare babysitting: R = 0.170.29, provisioning: R = 0.51, raised guarding: R = 0.16 (29, 30), and sociable weavers: R = 0.110.30 (31)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sex differences in investment in cooperative behavior were small, and when present, were biased toward females which, as in other social mole rats, are the more philopatric sex (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 3, and 4) (23, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early in ontogeny, fast-growing females contributed most to cooperative behavior, but this pattern changed later in life with slow-growing females showing more cooperative behavior (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because males disperse before breeding, they are less likely to benefit from mutual, delayed benefits of cooperation (i.e., group augmentation effects) (34), which may explain the differences in cooperative behavior found during the first 600 d of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both a sex bias of cooperative behavior toward the philopatric sex and strategic adjustment of investment in cooperation depending on likely life-history trajectories, is widespread among subordinates in cooperative breeders and primitively eusocial insects, which typically pass through the same stages of development while maintaining behavioral plasticity to adjust to changes in opportunities to breed (5, 8, 30, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in this aspect, too, Damaraland mole rats resemble other cooperatively breeding vertebrate species rather than obligatory eusocial insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results are not consistent with key predictions for the distribution of cooperative behavior based on a caste system among nonreproductive individuals in Damaraland mole rats, when applying Micheners original definition of castes as permanent, functionally different groups of individuals that differ in behavior, physiology, or morphology where the differences are not mere consequences of age (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20, 21, narrow sense caste in the sense of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some definitions of castes include both age-related polyethisms and true castes sensu Michener [e.g., broad sense caste, (22)], but when asking questions related to social complexity, behavioral specialization, and the evolution of cooperative breeding it is useful to treat them as mutually exclusive forms of social organization and apply the original definition of Michener (21) as we do here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous behavioral studies in Damaraland mole rats found patterns that were regarded as consistent with caste formation among nonreproductive individuals in some groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they were not able to determine whether variation in the behavior of individuals was the result of a caste system or a product of age-related changes in cooperative behavior, because the ages of many individuals were unknown (1416, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support the suggestion that the social organization of Damaraland mole rats resembles that of other cooperative breeding vertebrates rather than that of obligatorily eusocial insect societies where true castes with fixed developmental trajectories occur in several lineages, including termites, ants, aphids, and thrips (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study raises the question of whether naked and Damaraland mole rats differ in their behavioral organization or whether the scarcity of longitudinal data of known-aged individuals in studies of naked mole rats has encouraged observers to attribute contrasts in behavior to the formation of castes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sociality has evolved independently in Damaraland and naked mole rats and the similarity of their breeding systems is regarded as a striking example for convergent evolution (3840) so it is possible that differences in behavioral organization might exist between these two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results of some studies do not support the suggestion that castes exist in naked mole rats, although in some colonies, body weight and work load were negatively correlated and smaller individuals performed more maintenance and foraging behavior (12, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others found the opposite pattern (18, 19) and a recent study showed that, contrary to a caste system, naked mole rats maintain behavioral plasticity throughout development (41), which is consistent with the patterns found in Damaraland mole rats in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Animals_and_Husbandry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The animals used in this study were either wild-caught Damaraland mole rats or their offspring, who had been produced and raised under captive conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were captured around the Kuruman River Reserve in the Northern Cape, South Africa between February and September 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mole rats were either maintained in their original group (i.e., the group in which they were captured) or new groups were established by pairing one male and one female that originated from different groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All individuals were dye marked to allow individual recognition and carried a passive implantable transponder for identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper includes data from a total of 37 groups comprising 13 wild-caught groups and 24 laboratory-founded groups, ranging in size from 3 to 26 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All groups were housed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tunnel systems that included compartments for nesting and food storage, toilet areas, and one large box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper halves of the tubes had a transparent pet window, enabling close behavioral observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tunnel systems included one to three vertical pipes in the periphery of the tunnels that lead sand into the tunnel system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on group size, the length of tunnel systems varied between 4 and 16 m (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twice a day the mole rats were fed ad libitum with sweet potatoes and cucumbers and the vertical pipes were refilled with clean sand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once a day the pipes were cleaned and confined toilet areas were rinsed with hot water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasionally apples, squash, and potatoes were offered to enrich the diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection_and_Data_Management  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were collected between October 2013 and November 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All individuals were weighed weekly until they reached the age of 90 d and thereafter every 2 wk using a Sartorius TE4100 electronic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral observations were conducted following a scan and all-occurrence sampling protocol (42) on a handheld Android device operating the software Pocket Observer (Noldus Information Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the scan sampling, we recorded the behavior of each individual based on an ethogram of 17 behaviors for observation sessions with the duration of 12 or 24 h, applying a 4-min sampling interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically one to two observers observed 1020 individuals simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a mean observation frequency of 12.2 scan observation sessions per individual over the study period (range 135).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maintain the possibility of expressing foraging behavior during scan observations (i.e., clearing sand from the tunnel system to maintain access to common food sources), we added sand through the vertical pipes every 2 h. Several observers were involved in carrying out scan observations and usually a single observer would cover a period of 23 h. We excluded individuals that died before reaching the age of 90 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We derived four measures of cooperation (total cooperation, digging, food carrying, and nest building) from scan observation sessions and extracted proportional investment (how often the behavior was displayed out of the total number of scans in this session) for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total cooperation was calculated as the sum of all behaviors that were related broadly to any form of burrow maintenance, foraging, nest building, or alloparental care such as digging in sand, gnawing on tunnel walls, pushing sand into tunnel gaps or dead ends, sweeping sand with the hind legs, moving back to the digging place after having transported sand, and transporting food, nest material, or pups (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 for a detailed ethogram).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether nonreproductive individuals specialize in certain tasks, we also derived separate measures of digging (sum of digging in sand, pushing sand into tunnel gaps or dead ends, and sweeping sand with the hind legs), nest building, and food carrying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alloparental care (i.e., when an individual retrieved a pup to the nest) is a rare form of cooperative behavior in mole rats and can only be displayed when pups are young.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we recorded all occurrences of alloparental care simultaneously to scan observations and used observation sessions for analysis when alloparental care was observed in this session, which resulted in a dataset of 226 observations on 91 individuals originating from 58 observation sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these observations, 198 were 12-h observations and 28 were 24-h observations but the frequency of alloparental care recorded per observation did not differ depending on the duration of the observation (GLMM, duration: P = 0.13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including the observation duration in the final model or reducing the dataset to observations of 12 h did not change the results qualitatively and hence we analyzed a pooled sample of 12- and 24-h scan sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze how total cooperative behavior, digging, nest building, and food carrying relate to age, residual body mass, and sex, we fitted GLMMs assuming binomial error structure (logit link function) with the proportion of intervals scored with the respective behavior during a scan session as the response variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started with fitting the full model, including age, age2, age3, and residual body mass (as index of growth, see Supporting Information for details) as covariates and sex and the duration of the observation as a fixed factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we included four two-way interactions (age × residual body mass, age × sex, sex × residual body mass, and age2 × residual body mass) and the three-way interaction (age × residual body mass × sex) to allow the predicted response to differ between sexes and individuals of different residual body mass at different stages of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All covariates were centered by subtracting the mean from each value and thereafter scaled by dividing the values by the SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we included the identity of the individual, the scan observation session reference (per mole rat group) and an observation level count to prevent overdispersion as random factors in all mixed-modes models presented in this paper (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used a stepwise, backward model simplification procedure (44) until only significant terms remained in the final model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terms that were dropped in the course of model selection are presented in this paper with the estimates, SEs, and the P values with which they were last included in the model selection process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeatability was calculated following procedures outlined in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45 using the R package rptR (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for the effect of age, residual body mass, and sex, we additionally calculated a repeatability estimate using the residuals of a model including these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance of the random effect individual identity was tested using a log likelihood ratio test, and pseudo r2 was calculated following Nakagawa and Schielzeth (47) using the package MuMIn (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models presented were estimated using the software R version 3.2.4 (49) and the package lme4 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alloparental brood care was analyzed by fitting a GLMM assuming Poisson error structure and log link function with the frequency of alloparental brood care as the response variable and adding age, age2, growth, and sex as explanatory variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the dataset was much smaller, we did not attempt to fit an age3 and we did not include any of the two-way interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we used a stepwise, backward model simplification procedure until only significant terms remained in the final model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether asymptotic body mass is associated with investment in total cooperation (i.e., sum of all cooperative behaviors) we used a generic Gompertz growth function of the package nlme (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted a growth curve for each individual and extracted the predicted asymptotic body mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 15 of 151 cases, the prediction was higher than the maximum weight of mole rats in our laboratory population (i.e., 250 g) and these cases were excluded from this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently fitted a GLMM with binomial error structure with total cooperative investment as the response and the asymptotic body mass as a covariate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we included only scan observation sessions on individuals older than 300 d (n = 122), as this is the age at which the first individuals of our population reached asymptotic body mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included the same random error structure as in previous analysis in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the question of whether mole rats specialize in certain tasks, we calculated the mean frequency of the respective cooperative task (digging, nest building, and food carrying) per individual (n = 177) and for a subset of individuals (n = 86) for alloparental care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values were log transformed and pairwise correlations were analyzed using linear models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Residual_Body_Mass  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an index of growth, we used residual body mass from linear models including age and age2 as explanatory variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean residual body mass during the fast-growth period in early ontogeny (between 90 and 300 d) explains 72% of the variation found in mean residual body mass after the age of 450 d when most individuals reached asymptotic body mass and ceased weight gain (linear model, n = 80 individuals, estimate = 1.1 ± 0.07, r2 = 0.72, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that high residual body mass at any point in life is tightly linked to fast-growth trajectories and high asymptotic body mass late in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, individuals that show high residual body mass at a given point in life have shown faster mean weight gain over their life previous to this measurement compared with individuals with low residual body mass, which links residuals body mass tightly to growth trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because males grow faster than females and we were primarily interested in relative variation of growth within males and within females, we used separate models for each sex to derive a relative measure of growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical analysis we used the closest measurement of residual body mass to the behavioral observation and averaged measures with equal distance to the observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
