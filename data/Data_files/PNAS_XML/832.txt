Amorphous calcium carbonate particles form coral skeletons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whether coral skeleton crystals grow by attachment of ions from solution or particles from tissue determines (i) corals growth rate, (ii) how they survive acidifying oceans, and (iii) the isotopes in the crystals used for reconstructing ancient temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that two amorphous precursors exist, one hydrated and one dehydrated amorphous calcium carbonate; that these are formed in the tissue as 400-nm particles; and that they attach to the surface of coral skeletons, remain amorphous for hours, and finally crystallize into aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these particles are formed inside tissue, coral skeleton growth may be less susceptible to ocean acidification than previously assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coral bleaching and postmortem dissolution of the skeleton will occur, but a calcification crisis may not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Do corals form their skeletons by precipitation from solution or by attachment of amorphous precursor particles as observed in other minerals and biominerals?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical model assumes precipitation in contrast with observed vital effects, that is, deviations from elemental and isotopic compositions at thermodynamic equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show direct spectromicroscopy evidence in Stylophora pistillata corals that two amorphous precursors exist, one hydrated and one anhydrous amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC); that these are formed in the tissue as 400-nm particles; and that they attach to the surface of coral skeletons, remain amorphous for hours, and finally, crystallize into aragonite (CaCO3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show in both coral and synthetic aragonite spherulites that crystal growth by attachment of ACC particles is more than 100 times faster than ion-by-ion growth from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast growth provides a distinct physiological advantage to corals in the rigors of the reef, a crowded and fiercely competitive ecosystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corals are affected by warming-induced bleaching and postmortem dissolution, but the finding here that ACC particles are formed inside tissue may make coral skeleton formation less susceptible to ocean acidification than previously assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is how other corals form their skeletons, perhaps this is how a few corals survived past CO2 increases, such as the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum that occurred 56 Mya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14, we present direct evidence of amorphous precursor phases in fresh, forming coral skeletons of Stylophora pistillata in various developmental stages and coral locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 show component maps obtained from PEEM data by fitting each single-pixel spectrum with a linear combination of spectral components, displayed in Fig 1A, and assigning to that pixel a color, which displays quantitatively the proportion of each component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same region, at the interface of tissue and coral skeleton, is also shown in visible light microscopy in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The forming coral skeleton in Fig 1 is as fresh as possible (25 h postmortem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains a remarkable amount of ACC-H2O: more than 20% of the pixels contain at least some ACC-H2O (as shown in Table 1) and are, therefore, red or magenta pixels interspersed with aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of red or magenta pixels is consistent across various skeletal locations: a growing spine in adult coral (Fig 1 B and E), one in a settled and calcifying spat (Fig 3), and a growing septum in a corallite of an adult coral (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very little ACC is observed (2% green pixels in adult and 10% in the spat skeletons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differs from what was observed in sea urchin spicules (32) and nacre (23), where the most abundant amorphous phase observed was anhydrous ACC, not ACC-H2O as observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most interestingly, since in Fig 1B, both the coral tissue and the growing coral skeleton are imaged, we captured three mineral particles surrounded by tissue (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2) with spectra that show mostly ACC-H2O (63%) but also, ACC (20%) and poorly crystalline aragonite (pAra; 12%) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three particles, magnified in Fig 1 C and D, are surprisingly large [0.4 ± 0.2 µm in size (median ± SD)] and could be in the skeleton in structures above or below the image plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the fact that they contain so much more ACC-H2O, ACC, and pAra than is ever found in any skeletal elements (Table 1), however, we deduce that they must be in tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic ACC-H2O crystallizes readily, especially in contact with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the observation of long-lived ACC-H2O implies inhibition of the transition from ACC-H2O to ACC in the tissue and in the growing coral skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because repeat acquisitions show some of the ACC-H2O transformed into ACC as a consequence of radiation damage (Fig S3), we presume that this thermodynamically downhill transition (33) is accelerated by radiation exposure but would happen spontaneously in the undisturbed coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the particles within the tissue regions, we observe greater concentrations of ACC than in the forming coral skeleton, suggesting that this phase is stabilized in the tissue but not in the skeleton, where it is extremely short-lived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater stabilization of ACC in tissue is consistent with preventing crystallization more in the tissue (that is, at the wrong time and place) than in the skeleton, which makes sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Can dissolution of ACC-H2O and reprecipitation as aragonite at the biomineral formation site occur, instead of solid-state transformation from ACC to crystal?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the paucity of ACC observed in all coral skeletons [less_than10% of pixels have any ACC in the coral skeleton (Table 1), and even in those pixels, ACC is never pure but 80% ACC at most], dissolution of ACC-H2O or direct precipitation from solution is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this cannot be the only phenomenon occurring, as that would imply complete absence of ACC, which was never observed in any areas of forming coral skeletons (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of some ACC leads to the conclusion that only or mostly solid-state transformations occur from ACC-H2O to ACC to aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A pAra phase was previously observed in coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spectrum is similar to aragonite around 348 eV (peak 4 in Fig S4) and to ACC around 351.5 eV (peak 2 in Fig S4); hence, it was previously assigned to a protoaragonite or poorly crystalline aragonite mineral (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the normalization used in Fig S4, it is clear that pAra has a much more intense peak 1, and thus, it is a crystalline phase, far more ordered than ACC or ACC-H2O but less ordered than aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is certainly not a mixture of ACC and aragonite (23); thus, it can only be a poorly crystalline aragonite phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disorder may be caused by, for example, incorporation of organic molecules in the crystal (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pAra mineral was previously observed in the CoCs of a 10-y-old Madracis coral (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we confirmed this observation in S. pistillata, finding abundant pAra localized in the CoCs, as shown in Fig 2C, and not anywhere else in the coral skeletons (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the pAra phase was also observed in the tissue particles in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pAra phase, stabilized in the living tissue, is delivered and remains stabilized in the skeleton but only in the CoCs, where it persists for years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with observations of CoC-specific organic molecules by Cuif et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) and Mass et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) and with the observation of Mg in CoCs (25, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the pAra phase in CoCs was never observed in either Stylophora or Madracis (23) to crystallize to aragonite, we conclude that it cannot be an immature aragonite or ACC phase as proposed by Von Euw et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36), nor one of the polyamorphous precursor phases described by Cartwright et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37), or the protoaragonite described by FarhadiKhouzani et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pAra phase in CoCs is stable or stabilized poorly crystalline aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data show that the pAra particles found in the CoCs were already pAra in the tissue (Fig 1); thus, there is no evidence of nucleation events in the CoCs, as was proposed by Von Euw et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The other ACC-H2O and ACC phases do not exhibit any of the spectral features characteristic of aragonite (peaks 2 and 4 in Fig S4); thus, they cannot be considered protoaragonite phases (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are spectroscopically similar to those detected in forming calcite biominerals (31, 32, 39); thus, they could be termed protocalcite phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional evidence that the precursor phases ACC-H2O and ACC observed in forming coral or the CoCs are indeed amorphous is provided by polarization-dependent imaging contrast (PIC) mapping, which displays in different colors the orientation of crystalline c axes in carbonate crystals (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PIC map in Fig 2D, for example, shows that, where pixels are red or green in the component map (Fig 2C), they are black in the PIC map (Fig 2D), confirming lack of crystallinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White arrows in Fig 2 C and D point precisely at the same CoC locations in the two maps, and these appear rich in amorphous phases in the component map and mostly black in the PIC map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black in a PIC map may also indicate orientation: aragonite crystals or nanocrystals with their c axes pointing into the beam appear black (e.g., near the scale bar in Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colocalization of amorphous spectra and black pixels in the PIC map (Fig 2 C and D, respectively) make the interpretation of black in the PIC map unambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amorphous regions in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4 had already crystallized by the time that PIC maps were acquired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Can the large amorphous particles identified in fixed and embedded tissue regions in Fig 1 be detected in living corals?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy data in Fig 5 show that this is indeed possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue calcein-stained particles, outlined in Fig 5D, vary in size between 0.4 and 9.4 µm, with 400 ± 700 nm being both the median and the mode ± SD, in the forming mineral (FM) and in the living tissue (LT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LT has some particles greater than 1 µm, as previously observed (42) and as seen in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 400-nm most frequent particle size in LT is in agreement with that observed in Fig 1 and in some FM regions in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24; therefore, it must be correct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also coincides with the size of type I vesicles Clode and Marshall observed to be the most abundant in calcifying cells near the FM after cryofracturing them (43), but it is considerably larger than the 100 nm expected from SEM observations of coral skeletons (1921, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 6, we show particles identified by their crystal orientations in PIC maps of both a natural coral skeleton and a synthetic aragonite spherulite grown in vitro by particle attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5A shows 400-nm particles, and Fig S5B shows that crystal orientation domains have edges with diameter of curvature 400 nm, consistent with attachment of particles of this size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4, amorphous domains are also on the order of 400 nm in the forming skeleton, again confirming that such large particles originating in LT are not unreasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monochromatic microdiffraction of two S. pistillata mature skeletons finds coherence lengths in different locations of 250 nm in the CoCs and 300 nm in the large crystalline domain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the minima observed; the maxima, averages of all data, and their errors are presented in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coherence length minima are similar to the smallest particle size observed in PIC maps and confocal microscopy in those same regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where a larger coherence length is observed in the large domain areas, uniformly colored in PIC maps, the particles need not necessarily have been larger; it is possible that multiple 400-nm particles became perfectly cooriented as they crystallized in those locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SEM images of coral skeletons, we see particle sizes varying between 100 nm and more than 1 micron (Fig S6 EH), consistent with this interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of these data combined present direct experimental evidence that the coral skeleton indeed forms by attachment of amorphous precursor particles as previously hypothesized but never directly observed; that these are ACC-H2O and anhydrous ACC; and that, after they crystallize to aragonite, the particles may retain distinct orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the biomineral is not formed in equilibrium with a large body of water but under direct biological control inside the tissue and behind tightly sealed membranes, as summarized in the model of Fig 7 and described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_for_CaCO3_Biomineralization_via_Amorphous_Precursor_Particles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A model for calcium carbonate biomineral formation via amorphous precursor particles is presented in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based, in part, on these data and in part, on previous work, and it encompasses all that is currently known about this highly investigated topic to the best of our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine biomineral crystal formation takes place in five steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
i) Seawater is rich in Ca2+ ions but also, Mg2+, Sr2+, bicarbonate, a few carbonate, and many other ions, all of which are omitted from Fig 7 for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seawater is captured by endocytosis, that is, a process in which the cell membrane invaginates, such that the external seawater is incorporated into an intracellular vesicle (on the left in Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with movies presented by Erez and Braun (45), in which calcein-stained Ca in seawater enters the cells in vesicles and is ultimately incorporated into the growing coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional strong evidence by Tambutté et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (46) supports this statement in coral, by Khalifa et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47) supports this statement in foraminifera, and by Vidavsky (9) supports this statement in sea urchin embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biomineral-forming cells are calicoblastic cells in coral, primary mesenchyme cells in sea urchins, endothelial cells in the mantle of shell-forming mollusks, and the only possible cell in single-cell foraminifera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the cells in immediate contact with the deposited mineral (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If seawater was incorporated by other cells at the surface of a larger, more complex organism, such as coral polyp or a whole-sea urchin embryo, and therefore, far away from these cells, then the vesicle may have been transferred from cell to cell across a variety of tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show only one unstructured tissue in Fig 7 for simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color gradient is purely ornamental, not meant to indicate anything.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ii) ACC particles are gradually formed in the vesicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies the addition of CO32 ions and the stabilization of amorphous precursor phases, which would otherwise transform into crystals instantaneously but are found to be stable for up to 32 h in this paper, both in the tissue (Fig 1 C and D) and in the growing biomineral (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 B, C, and E and 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that, in this work, we see mineral particles in the tissue, both in component maps and in confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are surprisingly large [400 nm as observed in both methods, once in the fixed (Fig 1 C and D) and once in the LT (Fig 5 A and D)], but we cannot say that mineral is localized in vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work by Clode and Marshall (43) showed that 400-nm vesicles were the most abundant objects observed inside cells immediately adjacent to the growing skeleton, when the cells were cryofractured and imaged by cryo-SEM (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Venn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42) observe half-micrometer mineral particles in coral LT near the skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, deduce that all of these separate observations refer to the same objects: 400-nm vesicles, delivering ACC to the FM skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) used immunolocalization to show that acidic proteins are indeed present in the coral skeleton, as expected, but also throughout the coral tissue layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reggi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) and Falini et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27) showed that the organic matrix proteins extracted from coral skeletons stabilize ACC in vitro in the absence of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACC stabilization by proteins was also observed in sea urchin spicules (32) and in fish intestines (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins, therefore, may be in the same vesicles as ACC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
iii) The carbonate ions are injected into the vesicle one at a time by an active multicomponent biological pathway that remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zoccola et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (50) showed that, in coral, bicarbonate transporters deliver HCO3 to the calcification site and may, therefore, be one component of this transport into vesicles pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vesicles may be the site where the calcifying fluid studied by Comeau et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51) resides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vidavsky et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52) showed that, in sea urchin embryos, intracellular vesicles contain the mineral that will ultimately form the spicule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, the vesicle, initially containing only seawater, gradually and actively is injected with carbonate ions; thus, ion pairs of CaCO3 form (second, third, and fourth vesicles in Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After enough Ca2+ ions are paired with carbonate ions, an amorphous hydrated form of calcium carbonate aggregates (fifth vesicle at the bottom in Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
iv) The vesicle containing amorphous precursors is ultimately transported toward the cell membrane near the biomineral, and its ACC content is ejected by exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is deposited directly on the growing surface of the biomineral, which is in immediate contact with the cell (or cell processes, as in sea urchin embryos) (9, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, deposited particles are still amorphous and, at least in part, hydrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then attach to one another and fill space (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory of particle attachment is retained in the mature biominerals, which cryofracture in liquid nitrogen with a granular fracture surface in sea urchin spicules (22), mollusk shell nacre (23), and coral skeletons (20) but not in ascidian vaterite spicules that likely grow ion by ion from solution and present a smooth cryofracture figure at the nanoscale (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
v) After a day or so, most or all of the ACC-H2O transformed into ACC and then, into crystalline calcium carbonate (CCC) as shown by the ordered pattern at the bottom of Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ACC-H2O, ACC, and CCC phases are progressively more stable and thus, energetically downhill (23, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pAra phase has not been characterized energetically, as it is impossible to isolate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on peak 1 amplitude at the Ca L-edge (Fig 1A and Fig S4), however, we deduce that this phase is more ordered than ACC and less so than aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not at all clear, however, that this phase will ever transform into aragonite (23); hence, it cannot be a proto- or a precursor phase (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Madracis corals, it does not transform into fully crystalline aragonite in the CoCs, even after a decade (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that this poorly crystalline form of aragonite is disordered by occluded organics (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In coral and other biominerals, there may be concomitant partial dissolution and reprecipitation, as shown in vitro by Gal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21), but in sea urchin spicules, there is only direct solid-state transformation of ACC into calcite as shown by extensive anhydrous ACC regions in direct contact with calcite in sea urchin spicules (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In coral skeletons, the anhydrous ACC phase is much more sporadically observed; thus, we conclude that this phase is short-lived (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now discuss this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In biological systems, such as coral, myriad genetic, biochemical, or metabolic complications exist and could, therefore, be included, but they would not help convey a few key ideas; thus, we omit them from this model of CaCO3 assembly by particle attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One key feature that this model describes is that of the separate origins of metal and carbonate ions, which is key to reconciling and explaining extensive and apparently contradictory results on isotopic compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metal_Ions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fact that, in the model of Fig 7, seawater provides the metal ions Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ satisfactorily explains why the elemental ratios Sr2+/Ca2+ and Mg2+/Ca2+ in corals, both modern and fossil, so faithfully represent the environmental temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beautiful data by Beck et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed this first (11), and many others followed, including Schrag and Linsley (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are deviations from environmental parameters termed vital effects on Sr2+/Ca2+ and Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios (56), which various groups ascribed to photosynthesis by the zooxanthellae (6, 57), pH (42, 58), location in the coral (7, 59), or Rayleigh fractionation (60, 61), but when Sr2+/Ca2+ and Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios work as temperature proxies, they work extremely well; thus, they cannot be ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ ions must come from seawater, and when CaCO3 first assembles in the vesicle, it must be in the presence of at least a few Mg2+ and Sr2+ ions for their T-dependent incorporation into the biomineral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Carbonate_Ions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many authors lament over vital effects (5, 62) on isotopic ratios 18O and 13C in coral, but Adkins et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) showed magnificent data on 18O and 13C, which strongly correlate with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, when these isotopic ratios work, they work extremely well; thus, we propose a possible explanation: C and O are both part of the carbonate CO32 ion, which in our model, is formed in the tissue and by the organism, not from atmospheric CO2, HCO3, or CO32 from seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since both C and O result from biological functions, any parameter affecting C also affects O in the same direction and by the same amount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also in agreement with Spero et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (63), who showed that that C and O isotopes covary with carbonate ion concentration and hence, with each other, providing a simple explanation for 18O and 13C data, which is source-independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the coral of Adkins et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) is simpler, because it is a deep sea coral without photosynthetic symbionts, and photosynthesis has been shown to strongly affect 13C values in coral (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major source of carbonate ions is metabolic CO2 (15, 64, 65), and bicarbonate may exit the cells via a bicarbonate transporter (50), whereas Ca2+ ion transport is dependent of voltage-gated calcium channels (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic summarizing ion transport, physiological, and molecular components of coral biomineralization was presented by Bhattacharya et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67, figure 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metal_and_Carbonate_Ions_Have_Distinct_Origins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key point of our model is that the metal ions and the carbonate ions have completely different origins, are processed independently, and therefore, show inconsistent behavior, previously assumed to be a problem if one wants to use coral skeletons to measure paleoenvironmental temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fossils, one of the few if not the only way to validate temperatures measured by Sr2+/Ca2+ ratios is to compare them with temperatures measured by 18O or the clumped isotope thermometer (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such comparisons may be extremely successful, as in the work by Ghosh et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (68), but they also frequently fail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model that we propose here predicts that the metal and the carbonate origins are different; thus, they should not behave similarly universally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when ACC is formed in intracellular vesicles, as shown here, the metal ratios may also be altered by small organic molecules, as observed in vitro for Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios by Dove and coworkers (69), or by deposition rates as shown in coccolithophorids and foraminifera (70, 71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the vital effects, that is, deviations of elemental and isotopic compositions predicted by thermodynamics and environmental parameters alone, observed in corals (7, 48, 59, 60) may be reinterpreted in the light of the data and model presented here for coral formation via attachment of amorphous particles, in direct contrast with the previously assumed precipitation of coral minerals ion by ion from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_of_Phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One might ask why ACC-H2O is produced rather than more stable phases, such as aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is actually common in natural systems that the least stable phase that is energetically available is the one that forms first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is known as the Ostwald Step Rule or the GayLussacOstwald Step Rule (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high supersaturation produced by the injection of carbonate ions into the vesicle provides the energy needed to produce the less stable phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that the Ostwald Step Rule only considers classical ion-by-ion pathways of nucleation and growth (73) and that much remains to be learned about the processes involved in crystallization by attachment of amorphous particles (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Particle_Attachment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The particle attachment mechanism described here is quite different from the oriented attachment of crystalline particles described by Penn and Banfield (74) in synthetic biomineral systems, Banfield et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (75) in bacterial biomineral systems, and Cölfen and Antonietti (76, 77) in the formation of a variety of mesocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In oriented attachment, nanoparticles are crystalline first, and then, they attach to one another, whereas in coral skeletons, nanoparticles are initially amorphous; then, they attach and fill space, and hours later, they crystallize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What is the advantage to the animal of formation by attachment of amorphous particles as opposed to precipitation from solution?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hypothesis explored here involves aragonite growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corals with fast-growing skeletons outcompete their neighbors in crowded reefs by reaching farther for better illumination, exposure to nutrients, and disposal of waste or for faster regeneration after damage by tropical storms or predators (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, fast growth must be a terrific physiological advantage for the coral polyps and the symbiont zooxanthellae in the rigors of crowded and competitive reef ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How do growth rates by attachment of ions or ACC particles compare?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aragonite growth experiments in the laboratory using realistic seawater pH, temperature, and concentrations show an average linear growth rate of 0.22 µm/d (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. pistillata, the coral used here, elongates its skeleton an average of 40 µm/d (Table 3), thus more than 100 times faster than it would if its aragonite precipitated ion by ion from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Is this astounding growth rate achieved biochemically, or is it an abiotic phenomenon?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To tackle this question, we grew synthetic aragonite spherulites, which form by attachment of nanoparticles in vitro as shown in Fig 6B and Fig S6 in the absence of any organic molecules, and measured their growth rates, as presented in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the growth rate is at least 100 times greater than for ion by ion growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, conclude that it is growth via ACC particle attachment that enables fast aragonite crystal growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical growth modifiers may also play a significant role in coral skeleton growth rate, but in vitro particle-by-particle growth significantly increases growth rate compared with ion-by-ion growth and does so in the absence of any organic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Biological control is still all important in forming, stabilizing, and delivering ACC particles to the growing biomineral!)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral skeletons formed via attachment of amorphous particles retain a nanoparticulate texture even years after formation, as is visible in PIC maps (Fig 6A) and also by SEM of cryofractured coral skeleton (Fig S6) but not in geologic aragonite (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other authors saw 100-nm particles with SEM or AFM in corals (19, 20), as do we in Fig S6 EH along with other 400-nm or larger features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reinforces the well-established notion (22) that morphology alone cannot provide accurate measurement of particle sizes, but combined with PIC mapping and component mapping, it provides a more complete and therefore, stronger case for coral crystallization by particle attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There may also exist concomitant ion-by-ion precipitation, but granular structure in SEM, in crystal orientation PIC maps, and in direct observation of particles in the tissue all concur to show that particle attachment plays a major role in coral skeleton formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even slow-growing corals in the slowest growth conditions of low light (79) still grow faster than ion-by-ion aragonite (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, our hypothesis that growth by attachment of amorphous precursor particles confers the advantage of fast skeleton growth to corals seems to be confirmed by data: aragonite crystal growth via particle attachment in both synthetic spherulites and coral skeletons is more than 100 times faster than ion-by-ion growth from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This must be an advantage in the competitive and crowded reef environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also provides an avenue to fine-tune paleoclimate proxies using synthetic crystals grown by particle attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coral bleaching (80) and postmortem skeleton dissolution (81) are increasingly occurring, but coral skeleton growth rate in S. pistillata will not necessarily be decreased by ocean acidification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional experiments on growth rates at lower pH will shed light on this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If other corals also form their skeletons by particle attachment, a calcification crisis may or may not occur in acidifying oceans, because ACC particles are formed inside coral tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral_Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral fragments from the zooxanthellate coral S. pistillata were obtained from corals growing in an 800-L aquarium system at the Marine and Costal Science Department at Rutgers University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fragments were shipped to Berkeley and acclimated for 2 wk in an aquarium at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty hours before each experiment, a 5-mm coral nubbin was cut and rapidly fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer in 22 g/L Na2CO3 for 1 h. After fixation, the samples were washed twice for 5 min each with 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer in 22 g/L Na2CO3 and then dehydrated in 50, 60, and 70% mixtures of anhydrous ethanol and 1 g/L Na2CO3 followed by 80 and 90% anhydrous ethanol and 0.5 g/L Na2CO3 and finally, 100% anhydrous ethanol twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each dehydration step, the coral samples were left in the solution for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then embedded and polished following previously established protocols (96) and coated with 40-nm Pt masking off the area to be analyzed and then, 1-nm Pt (97) on the whole sample, as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  98.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we optimized the polishing process to preserve any ACC present by dialyzing all polishing and cleaning solutions against Na2CO3, which is 104 times more soluble than ACC; thus, the solution is greatly supersaturated with respect to ACC, and ACC cannot dissolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent dissolution, the saturation needs not be for both Ca and CO3: supersaturating only in CO3 is sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method was first published in the work by Gong et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32), and we have successfully used this method in all following publications on any amorphous precursors, including this one on coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_of_Synthetic_Spherulites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthetic aragonite spherulites were grown using the ammonium carbonate [(NH4)2CO3] diffusion method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (NH4)2CO3 vapor sublimating from the solid in a closed table top desiccator was allowed to diffuse for 24 h into 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 solution in a beaker placed into the same desiccator (99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each beaker contained a glass slide, on the surface of which the spherulites nucleated and grew.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then scraped off the glass slide for SEM analysis (Fig S6 AD) or for embedding in epoxy, polishing, and coating for PIC mapping following previously established protocols (96) and coated with 40-nm Pt around it and then, 1-nm Pt (97) in the area to be analyzed, as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  98.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spherulite diameters were measured with NIH ImageJ, selecting the largest diameter visible in a 2D polished cross-section of each spherulite and dividing it by two to obtain the radius, and thus, the linear growth rate became directly comparable with those in ion-by-ion growth from solution of aragonite (Table 2) and S. pistillata coral (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spherulite growth rate along the radii of 16 spherulites, grown in four different batches, is presented in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PIC mapping analysis in Fig 6B, spherulites were embedded, polished, and coated like the coral samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe particles in spherulites in SEM images and PIC maps, but we did not study these particles with spectromicroscopy; thus, we cannot say that they were ACC before attachment to the growing spherulite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we did not state anywhere here that these were ACC particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PEEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy or PEEM experiments to obtain component maps or PIC maps were done using PEEM-3 on beamline 11.0.1.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (96).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Confocal_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral spats settled on the glass bottom of Petri dishes 9 d before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All observations were made either with an inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with polarization equipment (Nikon ECLIPSE TI-E) for the image in Fig 5C or with an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon A1-Red) for the image in Fig 5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For localization of calcium particles (Fig 5) in the spat LTs or FM, the spats were incubated overnight in 2.6 µM blue calcein (Sigma 5437547-2) dissolved in seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then rinsed for 1 h in sea water before observation with fluorescence confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image in Fig 5A was obtained from a stack of 10 images, acquired focusing at different heights from the bottom of the Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitations at 405, 488, 561, and 638 nm in addition to differential interference contrast (DIC) filter were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue calcein is displayed in blue, GFP (native in S. pistillata and all other corals) is displayed in green, and chlorophyll in red (native in coral symbionts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 5, the top one-half of the FM is part of a basal plate (BP), which eventually will cover the entire Petri dish with mineral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green islands of tissue are clearly visible in this region of forming skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom one-half of the FM is a growing septum (S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the edge of the spat is a layer of stinging cells (SCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The micrograph in Fig 5C was acquired 5 d after the one in Fig 5A; thus, it shows a similar region, not an identical one, as the animal kept growing and became thicker and as the BP was more complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this micrograph, however, mineral crystals are easier to identify, as they appear as bundles of acicular crystals fanning from CoCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this and other similar images acquired the same day as the one in Fig 5A, it was possible to recognize the forming BP, the forming S, and the layer of SCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Particle_Size_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The blue calcein-stained particles in Fig 5 were analyzed as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We opened the blue calcein only component of the confocal micrograph in Fig 5A in ImageJ 1.49v, applied a threshold, then analyzed the 2,726 particles, and thus, obtained their outlines and a listing of particle areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We processed the list in Microsoft Excel, where we calculated the square roots of all areas and then, calculated their means and SDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many particles are not squares, but for simplicity, we assumed that they were squares and reported the side of the square as particle size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did this identically also for the three particles in Fig 1 C and D and calculated the mean, the median, and the mode of all particle sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four hundred nanometers is the most frequently observed (mode) and the median particle size in both LT and FM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be precise, these are 417 ± 711 nm (mode = median ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the resolution of confocal micrographs; thus, this size is to be considered an upper bound of fluorescent particle sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because LT has more particles greater than 1 µm, the average particle size is 1.0 ± 0.9 µm in the LT and 0.7 ± 0.6 µm in the FM, although the median and the mode are identical and 400 nm in both LT and FM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in particle size distribution between LT and FM is statistically significant (P = 1.1 × 107, KolmogorovSmirnov test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in particle size distributions between LT and FM regions in Fig 5 was tested using the KolmogorovSmirnov test (105) in a Microsoft Excel statistical package following the method explained in www.real-statistics.com/non-parametric-tests/two-sample-kolmogorov-smirnov-test/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both data from LT and FM were first binned with a 20-nm bin size from 0 to 104 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a P value of P = 1.1 × 107, the null hypothesis, that the two sets of data come from the same distribution, is rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the size of differently oriented particles in solid skeleton or spherulites, however, this method did not work: there is no rigorous way to threshold the image to highlight the smallest particles; thus, the above method could not be used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify and measure the smallest particles in Fig 6 and Fig S5 C and D, we displayed them in Adobe Photoshop CC 2014, zoomed in to find the smallest particles of any color isolated from the surrounding color, and labeled them by hand with a 100-nm square just above each particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then numbered each particle with a number label right below it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then opened the image in ImageJ 1.49v and acquired a horizontal line profile across each particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then displayed all line profiles in Kaleidagraph 4.5, zoomed in, and carefully measured the FWHM of each particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight particles in the coral skeleton and eight particles in the spherulite were analyzed; then, the mean and SD were calculated in Microsoft Excel, which were 143 ± 52-nm particles in coral skeleton and 72 ± 26 nm in synthetic spherulite (mean ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microdiffraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microdiffraction experiments were done on beamline 12.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source using powder diffraction with monochromatic 8-keV X-rays, illuminating an S. pistillata skeleton with 5 × 5-µm beam size in 60 locations on CoCs and acicular aragonite larger crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence length was measured from the broadening of powder diffraction rings using the Scherrer equation:S=0.9wcos,[S5]where S is the size of a coherent domain,  is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam,  is the Bragg angle of the powder diffraction ring, and w is the FWHM of the ring integrated along the azimuthal direction and corrected with instrumental broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data show coherence lengths of 250700 nm in the CoCs and 3001,700 nm in the large crystalline domain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average coherence lengths in the CoCs and large crystal areas are 350 ± 100 and 800 ± 400 nm, respectively (average ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed methods are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, S. pistillata corals, adults and spats, were fixed, dehydrated, embedded, polished, and coated for PEEM analysis as described previously (23, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For confocal microscopy, they were exposed to blue calcein in seawater, washed, and observed alive, so that blue calcein particles could be imaged in the LT and in the forming biomineral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PEEM experiments, sample preparations were rapid and repeated to capture the transforming amorphous phases; PEEM data acquisition was done exposing the sample to as little radiation damage as possible, which has the effect of crystallizing amorphous phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data processing was done using Ca L-edge component mapping with four spectral components (ACC-H2O, ACC, pAra, and aragonite) after normalizing these spectra to have the same area under the whole spectrum between 345 and 355 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach, quantitative analysis of the concentration of each component can be done, giving equal weight to crystalline and amorphous phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This normalization differs from the ones used previously (23, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note_Added_in_Proof  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two recently published articles are closely related to this work and strongly support it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sun et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (106) demonstrate that S. pistillata corals grow their skeletons spherulitically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Walker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (107) characterize in vitro a solid state transformation from ACC to aragonite similar to the biogenic one observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Growth_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growth_Rate_of_Aragonite_Deposited_Abiotically_Ion_by_Ion_from_Solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We want to estimate how quickly aragonite can grow abiotically directly from solution rather than by attachment of amorphous particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth rates may be estimated from the widely used (85, 89, 90) empirical relationship of growth rate r with saturation S:r=p(S1)n,[S1]where p is the kinetic rate constant and n is the reaction order, which are two parameters measured in conditions of temperature and pH realistic for seawater; S is the saturation defined asS=[Ca+2][CO32]K,[S2]with K as the solubility product of aragonite at 25 °C, which is K = 6.65 × 107 mol2/kg2 from the work by Morse et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several experiments measured abiotic growth rates in seawater conditions of seeded aragonite crystals as a function of saturation and report a relatively small range of values for p and n (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rate constant p in all of the studies in Table 2 is originally normalized to surface area (moles area1 time1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare area-normalized aragonite growth rates with the linear growth rates measured in coral skeletons, we convert all P values to micrometers per day using aragonite molecular weight (100.1 g/mol) and density (2.93 g/cm3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of this unit conversion for p from Gutjahr et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  85, table 3) is given below:p=0.056×1010molcm2s100.1gmol1cm32.93g10,000mcm86,400sd=0.165md.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and the standard seawater concentrations of Ca and carbonate given by Millero et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  92, table 4), which are 0.010282 and 0.000239 mol/kg, respectively, we obtain a saturation with respect to aragonite, S = 3.695.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the obtained value p = 0.165 µm/d and n = 1.05 from Gutjahr et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (85) in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, we obtain a growth rate r = 0.47 µm/d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is an upper-limit growth rate calculated from the largest measured P value in Table 2 and unconstrained by the presence of divalent cations other than Ca or any other inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Table 2 we show the results of similar calculations for this and four more experiments on abiotic ion-by-ion aragonite growth in vitro, and average their results to obtain 0.22 m/d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_Rate_of_Biogenic_Aragonite_in_Stylophora_pistillata_Coral_Skeletons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The linear extension (how quickly branches elongate) measured by various authors in S. pistillata living corals is reported in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other authors report growth rates in units not convertible to linear growth rate with the information available in their papers; thus, these were not included in Table 3 (9395).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_Rate_of_Aragonite_Deposited_Abiotically_by_Attachment_of_ACC_Nanoparticles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We grew aragonite spherulites using a 5MgCl2:1CaCl2 solution and letting ammonium carbonate vapors in a closed desiccator diffuse through the solution for 24 h. The solution did not contain any organic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this method, we obtained elongated aragonite radial crystals in each spherulite grown by attachment of particles, not individual ions from solution, as shown in Fig S6 AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then embedded the spherulites and measured the longest diameter in PIC maps of their cross-sections, with the results reported in Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Growth_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing the growth rates in abiotic aragonite (Table 2) and biogenic aragonite in S. pistillata corals (Table 3), we find a ratio varying between 45 and 1,044 times faster growth for coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the averages, which given the scatter of the data, are more reasonable, we obtain 40/0.22 = 182 times faster for coral vs. abiotic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus conclude that the growth rate is at least 100 times faster in S. pistillata coral grown by attachment of amorphous particles than in aragonite grown abiotically ion by ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing the growth rates in abiotic aragonite grown by particle attachment (Table 4) and by ion attachment (Table 2), we obtain 29/0.22 = 132.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even in the absence of any organic molecules, therefore, aragonite crystals grow at least 100 times faster when they attach one particle at a time rather than one ion at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the vital effects (that is, deviations of elemental and isotopic compositions predicted by thermodynamics and environmental parameters alone) observed in corals (7, 48, 59, 60) may be reinterpreted in the light of the data presented here for coral formation via amorphous precursor particles, in direct contrast with the previously assumed precipitation of coral minerals from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We stress, however, that the high growth rate alone cannot explain the vital effect, as it can be reproduced in the absence of any organic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vital effects must be associated with the formation of ACC nanoparticles in the coral tissue, which must occur under biological control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Phases_and_Their_Transformations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since both ACC-H2O and ACC are abundant in the coral tissue particles, they must both be long-lived in the tissue, presumably stabilized by organic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the forming skeleton, ACC-H2O is abundant, but ACC is rare; thus, the transition to crystalline aragonite must not be inhibited by organics after particles are attached to the growing skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These deductions are summarized in the energy landscapes in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differ from those observed in sea urchin spicules (32) and nacre (23), where ACC-H2O and ACC are short- and long-lived, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A theoretical framework for these energy landscapes was described by De Yoreo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22, figure 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In coral and other biominerals, there may be concomitant partial dissolution and reprecipitation, as shown in vitro by Gal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21), but in sea urchin spicules, there is only direct solid-state transformation of ACC into calcite, as shown by extensive anhydrous ACC regions in direct contact with calcite in sea urchin spicules (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32, figure 2B or figure 3, 48 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In coral, the anhydrous ACC phase is much more sporadically observed; thus, we conclude that this phase is short-lived, as shown in Fig S7B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolution and reprecipitation would imply no ACC ever anywhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a few ACC pixels in every acquisition in coral (Table 1); thus, there must be a solid-state transformation from anhydrous ACC to crystalline aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid, solid-state transformation may be the only mechanism of crystallization, or it may occur along with partial dissolution and reprecipitation as aragonite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present data cannot rule out this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
