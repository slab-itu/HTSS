High thermal conductivity in soft elastomers with elongated liquid metal inclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient thermal transport is critical for applications ranging from electronics and energy to advanced manufacturing and transportation; it is essential in emerging domains like wearable computing and soft robotics, which require thermally conductive materials that are also soft and stretchable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heat transport within soft materials is limited by the dynamics of phonon transport, which results in a trade-off between thermal conductivity and compliance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We overcome this by engineering an elastomer composite embedded with elongated inclusions of liquid metal (LM) that function as thermally conductive pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These composites exhibit an extraordinary combination of low stiffness (less_than100 kPa), high strain limit (600%), and metal-like thermal conductivity (up to 9.8 Wm1K1) that far exceeds any other soft materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soft dielectric materials typically exhibit poor heat transfer properties due to the dynamics of phonon transport, which constrain thermal conductivity (k) to decrease monotonically with decreasing elastic modulus (E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This thermalmechanical trade-off is limiting for wearable computing, soft robotics, and other emerging applications that require materials with both high thermal conductivity and low mechanical stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we overcome this constraint with an electrically insulating composite that exhibits an unprecedented combination of metal-like thermal conductivity, an elastic compliance similar to soft biological tissue (Youngs modulus less_than 100 kPa), and the capability to undergo extreme deformations (600% strain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By incorporating liquid metal (LM) microdroplets into a soft elastomer, we achieve a 25× increase in thermal conductivity (4.7 ± 0.2 Wm1K1) over the base polymer (0.20 ± 0.01 Wm1·K1) under stress-free conditions and a 50× increase (9.8 ± 0.8 Wm1·K1) when strained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exceptional combination of thermal and mechanical properties is enabled by a unique thermalmechanical coupling that exploits the deformability of the LM inclusions to create thermally conductive pathways in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these materials offer possibilities for passive heat exchange in stretchable electronics and bioinspired robotics, which we demonstrate through the rapid heat dissipation of an elastomer-mounted extreme high-power LED lamp and a swimming soft robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Electronic_Contribution_to_Thermal_Conductivity_of_EGaIn  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electronic component of thermal conductivity (ke) can be estimated based on the electrical conductivity () and the Weidemann Franz Law, ke/ = LT, where L = 2.44 × 108 W/(S·K) is the Lorenz Number and T is absolute temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For EGaIn at room temperature,  = 3.4 × 106 S/m (21), so ke = 24.9 Wm1·K1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total thermal conductivity of EGaIn is 26.4 Wm1·K1 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the thermal conductivity of EGaIn is largely dominated by electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The LM embedded elastomer (LMEE) is composed of a Pt-catalyzed silicone elastomer embedded with a randomly distributed, polydisperse suspension of nontoxic (21), liquid-phase eutectic galliumindium (EGaIn) microdroplets (19, 20, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1D and Movie S1, stretched and twisted strips of LMEE exhibit rapid thermal dissipation compared with adjacent strips of unfilled elastomer subject to the same initial heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previous attempts with LM-filled elastomers (12), we have discovered that strain creates thermally conductive pathways through the in situ elongation of the deformable liquid inclusions, which significantly enhances thermal conductivity in the stretching direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For permanent (stress-free) and strain-controlled elongation of the LM inclusions, this enhanced k is nearly 25× to 50× greater than the unfilled elastomer (0.20 ± 0.01 Wm1·K1) and approaches the limit for the parallel rule of mixtures of an EGaInsilicone composition (23) without the aid of percolating networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Referring to Fig 1E, the exceptional combination of high thermal conductivity, low elastic modulus, and high strain limit allows the LMEE composites to occupy an uncharted region of the material properties space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The thermal composite is fabricated by shear mixing EGaIn alloy (75% Ga, 25% In, by weight; Gallium Source) with an uncured silicone elastomer (Ecoflex 00-30; Smooth-On) (Methods for material fabrication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During mixing, the LM droplets form a self-passivating Ga2O3 coating that helps prevent coalescence and eliminates the need to add surfactants or other dispersing agents (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The droplets have a statistically uniform spatial distribution and are polydisperse, with a median diameter of 15 m (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal conductivity is measured using the transient hotwire (THW) method in which an embedded wire simultaneously acts as a resistive heat source and thermometer that measures the change in temperature (T) as a function of time (t), which is related to thermal conductivity through the cylindrical heat diffusion equation (Methods and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental measurements are presented in Fig 2A and show that, as LM volume fraction () increases, thermal conductivity increases (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are in good agreement with theoretical predictions obtained from the Bruggeman effective medium theory (EMT) formulation (25) for a uniform dispersion of spherical EGaIn inclusions [k = 26.4 Wm1·K1 (23)] in a silicone matrix (k = 0.20 Wm1·K1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further configure the THW method to enable directional measurements of thermal conductivity upon deformation by laminating LMEE strips around wires that are parallel (axial) and perpendicular (transverse) to stretch, as shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ellipsoidal heat spreading yields effective anisotropic thermal conductivities in the axial and transverse directions that can be transformed to measure the orthotropic (kx, ky, kz) bulk values (EMT for derivation) (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration enables examination of the thermalmechanical coupling between thermal conductivity and deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, upon stretching the unfilled ( = 0%) homogenous elastomer, the thermal conductivity in the direction of stretch (ky  0.20 Wm1·K1) remains largely unchanged (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when stretching the  = 50% LMEE, the thermal conductivity in the longitudinal direction (ky) dramatically increases and reaches a value of 9.8 ± 0.8 Wm1·K1 at 400% strain (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents an increase of 50× relative to the unfilled material and a value that approaches the thermal conductivity of some metals like bismuth and stainless steel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements, which were taken at room temperature, are in good agreement with tests performed on samples that were either cooled to 0 °C or heated to 60 °C (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the material is robust to cyclical loading, with only a slight increase in thermal conductivity measured after 1,000 cycles of 200% strain (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we can program the material to achieve permanently elongated LM inclusions in a stress-free state by stretching a virgin sample of LMEE to 600% strain and then unloading to zero stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unrecoverable plastic strain of 210% is induced, enabling elongated inclusions in an unloaded (stress-free) state (Methods and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, thermal conductivity of the programmed LMEE sample in the longitudinal direction (ky) is 4.7 ± 0.2 Wm1·K1, which is 25× greater than that of the base elastomer (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that, when unstrained, both the  = 0 and 50% samples exhibit values of k that are typically observed in other polymeric composites (12, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Such an unprecedented enhancement in k arises from the discovery of a unique thermalmechanical coupling in which the deformable LM inclusions elongate into needle-like microstructures along the prestrained or mechanically loaded direction to create enhanced thermally conductive pathways (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further demonstrated in Fig 2F, in which compositions with  = 30% and 50% EGaIn (by volume) are subject to strains ranging from 0 to 400% in increments of 100% (Methods and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown, the thermal conductivity in the y (stretching) direction increases by greater than a factor of 5 beyond 300% strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To theoretically capture this behavior, we create an EMT model based on the Bruggeman formulation to explain the relative increase in directional thermal conductivity as a function of axial strain () (EMT for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 2F, we find good agreement between the experimentally measured values (markers) and our theoretical predictions (curves), which capture the large increase in thermal conductivity in the stretching direction (ky) and the slight decrease in the orthogonal directions (kz, kx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with theory is achieved without data fitting and supports the claim that the observed anisotropic thermalmechanical response is controlled by the directional change in aspect ratio of the LM inclusions (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, for all volume fractions, the composite materials have an elastic modulus less than 90 kPa (Fig S8) and can support uniaxial strains above 600%, properties that are similar to those of the homogeneous elastomer (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modest increase in elastic modulus (less_than20%) for the LMEE composites can be attributed to surface tension at the liquidsolid interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For liquid inclusions in a compliant matrix, Style et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29) have previously shown that surface tension can induce mechanical resistance to droplet deformation and result in an overall stiffening of the composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show that the EGaIn droplets greatly enhance thermal conductivity of soft materials without degrading their mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, these materials display nearly an order of magnitude enhancement in thermal conductivity and strain at break while possessing an order of magnitude lower modulus than commonly available thermal tapes and previously studied LM-filled composites (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 1 A and F, the experimental measurements of thermal conductivity are in good agreement with predictions obtained from EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EMT model is based on a Bruggeman formulation that has been adapted to predict the orthotropic bulk values of the thermal conductivity (kx, ky, kz) as a function of both LM volume fraction and stretch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal directions are parallel to the samples orthogonal surfaces, with the y direction corresponding to the axis along which the sample is stretched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modified_Bruggeman_Formulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explain this experimentally observed thermoelastic coupling, we modify the Bruggeman formulation to account for the stretch-induced deformation of the ellipsoidal LM inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we assume that all particles initially have a spherical shape (initial aspect ratio, p0 = 1) and that the composite is incompressible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During uniaxial stretch in the y direction (y = ), the inclusions will become elongated in the direction of loading and have an aspect ratio of p=p03/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the shape of particles leads to anisotropic thermal conductivity of the effective medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following Sen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35), we use a self-consistent EMT that takes into account the shape of the ellipsoidal particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We start from a coherent potential approximation with depolarization factor L,kckmLkc+(1L)km=kpkmLkm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]This equation does not include particleparticle interactions and is more appropriate for a dilute composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for interparticle interactions with the surrounding medium, we use differential EMT (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scheme, we incrementally introduce an infinitesimal suspension of particles to the dispersion medium (step s) and then use this mixture as the reference matrix for evaluating the influence of the next increment (step s + 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each incremental step, we assume that the dispersion phase and medium share the same anisotropy in thermal conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies the following relationship between thermal conductivity at steps s (ks) and s + 1 (ks+1):ks+1ksLks+1+(1L)ks=(vpVm+Vp)[kpksLkp+(1L)ks].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]The differential equation isdkk=(dVpVm+Vp)[kpkLkp+(1L)k].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Defining  = Vp/(Vm + Vp), it follows that d/dVp = (1  )/(Vm + Vp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the integral from km to kc for thermal conductivity and from 0 to  for ,kmkcLkp+1(1L)k(kpk)kdk=011d[S4](kpkckpkm)(kmkc)L=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]Here, we modify L to predict the effective thermal conductivity as a function of stretch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an incompressible material under uniaxial extension (y = ), the deformations orthogonal to the primary stretching direction are equal, i.e., x=z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the aspect ratio of an incompressible particle as a function of y is p=y3/2.Ly=1ep22ep3[ln(1+ep1ep)2ep][S6]ep=11/3/2[S7]Lx=Lz=(1Ly)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]For spherical particles with p=1, it follows that L=1/3, which recovers the original Bruggeman formula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These predictions are compared with experimental values obtained by mapping the axial and transverse components of thermal conductivities (kaxial, ktrans) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values from the transient hotwire measurements are equal to the geometric mean of the thermal conductivity values orthogonal to wire, specifically, kaxial=kxky and ktransverse=kykz (26, 27, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From symmetry, we assume kx = kz and solve for the directional components of thermal conductivity,kx=kz=kaxial,ky=(ktransverse)2kaxial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]The uncertainty in kaxial and ktrans is propagated when reporting the uncertainty in kx, kz, and ky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Selected_Applications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the LMEE composites are intrinsically soft and deformable, they can be incorporated as thermal interface materials into wearable computing (30) or thermally activated shape-programmable structures (31) and soft robotic systems (32, 33) without altering the natural mechanics of the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such applications, high thermal conductivity is not enough; the material must be sufficiently soft to limit mechanical resistance to deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate this functionality through a thermally activated soft artificial muscle that is actuated with embedded wires of NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) and used for caudal fin locomotion of a silent, soft swimming robot (Fig 3 A and B, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S10, and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with thermally insulating silicone and relatively stiff thermal tapes, sealing the SMA wires in LMEE allows for significant enhancements in actuation frequency, deflection, and duration (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the LMEE is able to actuate for more than 10,000 cycles at a frequency of 5 Hz (33.3 min) with no observed degradation in amplitude (14 ± 1 degrees; Fig S9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the unfilled silicone elastomer becomes saturated with heat and ceases to actuate after 2 s. Although the commercial tape can support cyclical loading, its relatively high mechanical stiffness results in a low steady-state amplitude of 3 degrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When incorporated into the robotic fish, the LMEE-sealed SMA enables forward swimming at 0.15 body lengths per second (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we demonstrate the LMEE's potential as an exceptional material for thermal management in stretchable electronics and wearable computing by comparing infrared temperature maps of an extreme high power (XHP) LED lamp on stretched LMEE and unfilled silicone elastomer membranes (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The poor thermal conductivity of the unfilled silicone elastomer results in excessive heat accumulation that leads to thermal degradation and dramatic mechanical failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the LMEE effectively dissipates heat and allows continuous operation of the LED (Fig 3 FH and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the potential use of LMEEs as heat spreaders for low-profile wearable applications, an XHP LED lamp is mounted to a strip of LMEE that is wrapped around the thigh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This wearable lamp can operate during running, hiking, and cycling to provide exceptional visibility at night without the need for a socket mount (Fig 3 IK and Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It runs at power outputs greater than 1 W and produces substantially more light and heat than standard indicator LEDs, which run on milliwatts of power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XHP LED is representative of a broader range of heat-generating devices (e.g., processors, transformers, power supplies) that could potentially be used in wearable computing and stretchable electronic circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrically insulating solids with high thermal conductivity are typically rigid due to the dynamics of phonon transport within an elastic medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a soft elastomer composite that overcomes this constraint and exhibits the highest-ever combined values of thermal conductivity and stretchability (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high performance is accomplished by exploiting the unique thermalmechanical interactions of LM microdroplets that are suspended within a silicone elastomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composite achieves an exceptional combination of low elastic modulus (less_than100 kPa; i.e., softer than human skin), high strain limit (600%), and high thermal conductivity (k), which ranges from 4.7 Wm1·K1 (stress-free state) to nearly 10 Wm1·K1 (when stretched).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a 25× to 50× increase in thermal conductivity compared with soft rubbers, i.e., similar in magnitude to some metals (e.g., bismuth, manganese, stainless steel) while having a 105 to 106 lower elastic modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to achieve high thermal conductivity with an elastomer without altering its elastic properties is enabled through LM microstructure and the distinctive thermalmechanical coupling in which the deformation of an elastomer matrix creates needle-like LM inclusions in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of LM suspensions in elastomer did not explore such critical factors and hence failed to capture the breakthrough performance presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimentally measured values are also found to be in strong agreement with predictions from a theoretical model that we derived based on Bruggeman EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such agreement is achieved without the aid of data fitting and provides further evidence for the critical role of in situ elongation of LM inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown by Style et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29), altering the size of liquid inclusions in a compliant matrix can result in changes to the elastic modulus of the composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, according to our EMT model, inclusion size has little influence on thermal conductivity (which is instead largely dependent on LM volume loading and inclusion aspect ratio).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in dependency can be used for matching the elastic properties of composites without altering the thermal properties (Influence of LM Droplet Size on Elastic Modulus and Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of high thermal conductivity and elasticity is especially critical for rapid heat dissipation in applications such as wearable computing and soft robotics, which rely on soft and stretchable functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that LMEE composites can be used to manage heat within an SMA-powered swimming robot and stretchable, body-mounted circuits for high-power illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these examples show the potential for LMEEs to dramatically improve thermal management in applications that require electrically insulating materials with both rapid heat conduction and soft elastic functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we anticipate that this class of materials will be enabling for soft robotics, shape-changing programmable matter, stretchable electronics, and soft-matter technologies designed for physical interaction with humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influence_of_LM_Droplet_Size_on_Elastic_Modulus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As suggested by Style et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29), liquid inclusions suspended in a soft elastomer can exhibit an effective modulus of E* = E[24/(10 + 9)], where  = /ER, E is the modulus of homogenous elastomer,  is the interfacial surface energy, and R is the radius of droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we expect that the effective elastic modulus (E*) increases monotonically with decreasing droplet size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be seen in Fig S11, which shows this dependency for an elastic solid of modulus E = 85 kPa and droplets with an interfacial energy  = 0.5 N/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, it follows from our EMT model that thermal conductivity is not expected to have a significant dependency on droplet size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the main parameters in our model regarding particle properties are the aspect ratio of the inclusions and the volume fraction in the composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Composite_Fabrication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LMEE composites are composed of a polydisperse suspension of EGaIn microdroplets dispersed in a Pt-catalyzed silicone elastomer (Ecoflex 00-30; Smooth-On).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fabrication method is the same as that reported in Bartlett et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the two-part silicone prepolymer is prepared by combining part A and part B at a 1:1 ratio by mass and then thoroughly mixing and degassing in a planetary centrifugal mixer (THINKY AR-100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGaIn alloy is prepared by mixing gallium and indium (Gallium Source, LLC) at a 3:1 ratio by mass and then heating and homogenizing at 190 °C overnight on a hot-plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LMEE is then prepared by shear mixing the uncured polymer and EGaIn with a mortar and pestle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components are mixed for 7 min to 10 min until a homogeneous viscous composite is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For volume fractions of LM lower than 30%, the initial mixing is done at higher concentrations and then diluted to maintain similar mixing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

THW_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermal conductivity is determined using the THW method and the following analytical solution to the cylindrical heat diffusion equation: k = q/4 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, q is the volumetric heating of the wire per unit length, which is calculated using known current and resistance values (Fig S1 for reference measurements), and  = d(T)/d[ln(t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shape-Programmable_LMEE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We program the shape of the LM particles by inducing plastic deformation in the films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples are made in a dogbone shape and tested on an Instron 5969 mechanical testing machine with 10 N load cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample is stretched with a strain rate of 0.17 min1, up to a strain of 600%, and unloaded to stress-free state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plastic strain of 210% is induced in the sample, and LM particles are elongated in the direction of stretch (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THW data are presented Fig S7 C and D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mechanical samples are prepared in a dogbone shape, and tests are performed on an Instron 5969 mechanical testing machine using a 10 N load cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three samples are tested with LM volume ratio of 30% and 50%, under a strain rate of 10 mm/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples are cyclically loaded three times at each of the following sequence of strains: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 150%, and 200%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8 A and B presents the stressstrain curves for LMEE for the 30% and 50% samples, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic modulus is calculated as the slope of the loading curve at a nominal strain of 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nominal strain is defined with respect to the absolute stress-free strain of the sample, which increases during cyclical loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, strain is calculated as a percentage defined with respect to the original length of the virgin sample (before initial loading).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10% elastic modulus for the 30% and 50% samples is presented in Fig S8 C and D, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soft_Robotics_Implementation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We perform a series of illustrative artificial muscle implementations with SMA wire that enable the propulsion of a bioinspired, silent, soft swimming robot (Fig 3 A and B and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actuator is composed of two naturally curved loops of SMA wire (0.012 in diameter; Dynalloy) that have an antagonistic arrangement and induce bidirectional bending when serially activated through direct Joule heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The material encapsulating the SMA actuator is thus required to have both high thermal conductivity to facilitate heat transfer to the outer media and a low Youngs modulus to allow significant deflection (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This advantage can be seen in Fig 3C when actuators sealed in either LMEE, unfilled silicon, or commercial thermal tapes are actuated at a frequency of 5 Hz in a water bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LMEE-sealed actuator reaches a steady-state amplitude of 10 degrees, whereas the unfilled silicone elastomer becomes saturated with heat and ceases to actuate, and the commercial tape reaches a much smaller amplitude of 3 degrees because of its high mechanical stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LMEE-sealed actuator is also able to operate at a range of frequencies (Fig 3D), with a maximum of 10 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At frequencies above 5 Hz, the electrical pulse duration becomes shorter than the thermal time constant of the fin, and the amplitude of the periodic temperature oscillation within the SMA wire decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the SMA actuator fabrication and testing are reported in Thermal Actuator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When incorporated into a silicone-based soft robotic fish, the LMEE-sealed SMA enables forward caudal fin locomotion at 0.15 body lengths per second (0.7 Hz activation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body of the soft swimming robot is composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; 1:10 base to curing agent ratio; Sylgard-184; Dow Corning) mixed with a blue pigment (0.3% by weight; Smooth-On); it is an assembly of three parts that are bonded to form two chambers as shown in Fig S10, which are filled with EGaIn and water, respectively, to balance the weight and buoyancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each individual part is produced by casting the dyed PDMS in a 3D-printed mold and then bonded together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The caudal fin of the robot is composed of Ecoflex 00-30 (Smooth-On).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the PDMS, the Ecoflex silicone is prepared using a THINKY AR-100 planetary centrifugal mixer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastomer is poured into molds for the two halves of the fin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After curing, the two layers of the film are bonded together with an additional layer of Ecoflex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buoyancy is adjusted by filling the embedded chambers of the caudal fin with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LED_Demonstration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LMEE and elastomer (Ecoflex 00-30; Smooth-On) samples are mounted on a frame and stretched to 400% strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGaIn traces are applied with a stencil mask and connected to copper leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XHP LED lamps (Cree XLamp XHP50, 5 mm × 5 mm) are placed onto the EGaIn traces on the stretched samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LEDs are connected in parallel with a power supply, and 6 V and 500 mA are supplied at time t = 0 s. IR images are captured with a FLIR A645sc Infrared Camera with a 45° lens at a frame rate of 25 frames per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the wearable electronics demonstration, an XHP LED lamp (Cree XLamp XHP50, 5 mm × 5 mm) is placed on an LMEE layer with 3.5-mm thickness, and is sealed by another layer of LMEE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thin layer of elastomer is used to seal the EGaIn traces to stop the LM from spreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGaIn traces are connected to banana plugs at the terminal end, which are secured in place using silicon adhesive and acrylic clamps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LED is powered by a 9-V battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The actuator used to power the soft robotic fish is composed of a wire of SMA embedded within the LMEE composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wire has a diameter of 0.3 mm and reversibly undergoes a phase transition from a martensite to austenite crystal structure when heated to 70 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the SMA wire (Flexinol; Dynalloy) is trained into a naturally curved shape by fixing it into a 3D-printed holder and applying an electrical current of 2.5A for 3 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trained wires are then straightened and mounted parallel to each other in an antagonistic configuration using a 3D-printed mold (Objet24; Stratasys) (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the uncured LMEE is poured into the mold and around the wires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the material is fully cured, the actuator is demolded and has final dimensions of 20 mm wide, 52 mm long, and 3.2 mm thick (Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparison, studies are also performed with SMA wires embedded in unfilled Ecoflex and a commercial thermal tape (H-48; t-Global).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal tape is an elastomer-based pressure-sensitive adhesive with a thickness of 1.1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The layers of thermal tape are bonded together by applying light pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actuators with the H-48 are produced by sandwiching the prestretched wires between three layers of the thermal tape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actuators with Ecoflex are produced using the same fabrication technique used with the LMEE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The elastomer-sealed actuators are tested in a tank of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal actuator is oriented vertically and mounted to an aluminum block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DC power supply (Electro Industries DIGI360) provides a constant voltage with a power of 19.6 W. The supplied voltage is switched on and off at a defined frequency with a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET; Digi-Key) controlled through an Arduino Uno microprocessor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 Hz are examined where two square wave pulses (duty ratio: 50%) with a phase difference of 180° are sent to the two SMA wires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computer vision software (Tracker) is used to track the trajectory of the actuator tip, and the angle of deflection () is automatically calculated by the software (Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
