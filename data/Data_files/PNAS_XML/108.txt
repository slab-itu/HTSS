Spatial response of coastal marshes to increased atmospheric CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coastal marshes provide numerous ecosystem services, are an important carbon sink, and are exposed to drowning as sea-level rise accelerates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a meta-analysis of the available observational data, we model the coupled marsh vegetation and morphological dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the fertilization effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 significantly increases marsh resilience to drowning and decreases the spatial extent of marsh retreat under high rates of sea-level rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this direct CO2 fertilization effect has so far been neglected in marsh modeling, we find it is central in determining marsh survival under the foreseeable range of climatic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production by plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These accretion processes respond to changes in local and global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate change, has not yet been isolated and quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the available observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60% in the range of forcings explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent, are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vegetation_Responses_to_Changing_Environmental_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use published observations of aboveground and belowground biomass productivity in coastal marshes under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions to derive a range of possible marsh plant biomass responses to changing atmospheric CO2 (3, 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the photosynthetic pathway of C3 plants is CO2-limited for a wider range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations than in C4 plants, CO2 fertilization effects are expected to be more evident in C3 species; elevated CO2 concentrations may also give C3 species a competitive advantage over C4 species, and hence possibly favor an expansion of the former at the expense of the latter (1, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, enclosure field experiments specifically focusing on marsh vegetation (3, 710) find both C3 and C4 marsh species to be responsive to increases in atmospheric CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A meta-analysis of this literature (710) (Table S1), when the responses of C3-only, C4-only, and mixed communities are collectively considered, gives a median 39% increase in aboveground biomass and a median 33% increase in belowground biomass as CO2 is elevated by 400 ppm with respect to current conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the very limited available data documenting C4-only belowground productivity (including rhizomes and roots, both contributing to organic soil production) report increases between 13% and 47% (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the positive belowground response of marsh C4 vegetation, the expected competitive advantage of C3s, and the largely positive response of the latter to increased CO2, we consider all of the available data to parameterize biomass response to elevated CO2 (i.e., not separating C3s and C4s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our parameterization expresses the biomass in the changed scenario as a linear function of CO2 change (CO2), according to the median responses observed in the compiled dataset for both the aboveground [Ba(CO2) = (1 + (0.39/400 ppm)  CO2)  Ba(0), Ba(0) being the current aboveground biomass productivity] and the belowground compartment [Bb(CO2) = (1 + (0.33/400 ppm)  CO2)  Bb(0)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the range of potential vegetation responses to CO2 changes, we also consider the first quartile (13% increase in aboveground biomass and a 20% increase in belowground biomass) and the third quartile (101% increase in aboveground biomass and a 94% increase in belowground biomass) in the compiled dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range in vegetation responses provides an estimate of the uncertainty in our evaluation of marsh responses to elevated CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salinity, flooding, water stress, and eutrophication can all potentially influence the effects of CO2 fertilization on marsh plants (3, 1216).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the available evidence is coherent in pointing to a significant CO2 fertilization effect on organic accretion and plant production even in the presence of other simultaneous environmental changes (2, 3, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we are here interested in isolating the effects of different forcings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, to avoid the introduction of confounding factors, we do not use in our parameterization data that include the interactions between the above environmental conditions and CO2 fertilization [e.g., Rasse et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) and Cherry et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the geomorphic response of marshes to elevated CO2 in the wider context of the main environmental changes expected over the next century, we compare it to the responses induced by changes in RRSLR, SSC, and nitrogen availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effects of the first two forcings are relatively well constrained, the effects of nitrogen are the subject of some controversy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, an analysis of the extensive literature on elevated nitrogen levels in coastal marshes reveals large uncertainties in plant responses (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fertilization experiments usually find that increased nitrogen promotes aboveground biomass productivity (3, 6), but a wide scatter characterizes the observations, even within the same study (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogens effect on belowground biomass productivity is even less clear, such that even the sign of the change in productivity remains undetermined (4, 5) and may be dependent on the levels of nitrogen addition (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such scatter can be attributed to the fact that existing studies used different methods (e.g., the forms of nitrogen adopted for fertilization, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and were conducted in different regions and under different environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species composition, baseline ambient nitrogen loading (19, 20), salinity, flooding frequency, and the concentration of other nutrients also vary widely across the existing literature, and can significantly affect the outcome of nitrogen addition experiments (4, 2131).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, to isolate the potential impacts of increased nitrogen concentrations, we use the minimum (55.2 g Nm2y1) and maximum (892.8 g Nm2y1) nitrogen addition levels and the corresponding biomass responses from one study that explored a wide range of nitrogen addition levels at a single site (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum addition level corresponds to a 15% increase in both the aboveground and belowground biomass, whereas the maximum addition experiment caused a 134% increase in aboveground biomass and a 24% decrease in belowground biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these two cases to parameterize biomass response to nitrogen addition, we explore two end-member response scenarios with our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding changes in aboveground and belowground productivity are representative of the range of responses observed in the dataset compiled (Fig S1), yet avoid confounding factors from cross-study methodological heterogeneity, and preserve the observed belowground to aboveground biomass (root to shoot) ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a spatially explicit 1D model of marsh ecomorphodynamic processes to evaluate the CO2, nitrogen, and suspended sediment concentration impacts on marsh morphology (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model describes the evolution of a marsh transect perpendicular to a tidal channel, which delivers inorganic sediment, by focusing on accretionsubmersion processes rather than on marsh lateral erosion or expansion (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the marsh surface elevation, z, at a position x along the marsh transect are dictated by the sum of the rate of inorganic soil deposition, Qs(x), the rate of sediment trapping by marsh plants, Qt(x), the rate of organic soil production by vegetation, Qo(x), and the RRSLR,zt(x,t)=Qs(x,t)+Qt(Ba(x),t)+Qo(Bb(x),t)R[1]where Ba(x) and Bb(x) are aboveground and belowground biomass (linear functions of CO2), and R is the RRSLR (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface erosion is set to zero in our experiments, as it is negligible in vegetated marshes (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Settling of suspended sediment, which is transported from the channel across the marsh over a tidal cycle with period T through advectiondispersion, determines inorganic soil deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sedimentation rate is calculated as Qs(z,Ba(x))=ws/(Tb)TC(z,Ba(x),t)dt, where ws is the settling velocity (here 2 × 104 m/s), b is the bulk density (1,325 kg/m3), and C is the instantaneous SSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of belowground biomass Bb(x), modulated by a factor  (2.5 × 103 m3/kg) that accounts for compaction and decomposition processes, governs the rate of organic soil production by Qo(x)=Bb(x)fi(z).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitness function fi(z) (0  fi(z) 1) describes how biomass productivity and the competitive abilities of species i vary as a function of elevation z (32, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that, although decomposition is accounted for in a simplified manner through a refractory fraction coefficient (embedded in ), the value of this parameter is defined on the basis of observations (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition by sediment trapping is calculated as a power-law function of aboveground plant biomass Ba(x) (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume here that three marsh species (representative of low-, middle-, and high-marsh vegetation) compete for space, each adapted to a particular elevation range relative to mean sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marani et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) have shown that the biogeomorphic evolution of a marsh under these assumptions leads to geomorphic and ecological patterns along the marsh transect that are consistent with observed ones (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increases aboveground and belowground biomass productivity, which, in turn, increases marsh accretion rates and resilience to RRSLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased belowground productivity enhances soil organic production, whereas increased aboveground productivity boosts suspended sediment trapping by standing biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a marsh adjacent to a tidal creek with SSC = 20 mg/L and a tidal amplitude of 0.5 m, the threshold beyond which partial marsh drowning is initiated increases from an RRSLR of 6.5 mm/y in current conditions to 7.5 mm/y for both the first quartile and median response to elevated atmospheric CO2 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third quartile of plant responses, which nearly doubles vegetation biomass, extends the threshold for partial drowning to 10.5 mm/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of these drowning thresholds will vary in marshes across the globe, depending on local environmental factors (e.g., SSC, tidal amplitude), but the significant increase in marsh resilience resulting from CO2 fertilization observed here has broad global implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even before the onset of marsh submergence, the marsh transects from the current and elevated CO2 (median response) scenarios under the same RRSLR exhibit different morphologies (e.g., see RRSLR = 6.5 mm/y, Fig 1B); the average elevation of the marsh is lower for the current CO2 concentration than in the elevated CO2 case, and the plant species distribution is shifted toward low-lying and more flooding-tolerant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two transect morphologies are most different beyond the threshold RRSLR for drowning in the current CO2 scenario but before partial drowning of the elevated CO2 case (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RRSLR beyond the elevated CO2 drowning threshold (i.e., both marshes are becoming shorter due to the progressive submergence of their interior zones), the marsh morphologies under the current and elevated CO2 concentrations converge toward similar profiles (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the lowered marsh elevation increases the duration of submergence, thus increasing the amount of inorganic sediment deposition (which only occurs during flooding periods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, at high RRSLR, the profile is mostly maintained by inorganic sedimentation, which is almost independent of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (except indirectly, through the effect of enhanced sediment trapping by increased standing plant biomass).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the observed weak dependence of marsh resilience on atmospheric CO2 concentration at high RRSLR, and the similarity of the submerging marsh profiles for both CO2 scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the possible effects of the end-of-century concurrent atmospheric CO2 concentration and RRSLR values projected in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) adopted in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that we are here assuming the local subsidence rate and mean sea-level changes to be negligible, and take RRSLR to be equal to global eustatic SLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the environmental conditions examined here, our analyses show that, without the CO2 fertilization effect, about 40% of the marsh will be lost under the mean RCP6 in 2100 (end-of-century RRSLR = 7.5 mm/y), whereas the marsh loss becomes 66% under the mean RCP8.5 (end-of-century RRSLR = 12 mm/y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No marsh loss occurs under the remaining RCPs (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First quartile, median, and third quartile plant biomass responses to increased atmospheric CO2 show no marsh loss under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP6 scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median and first quartile biomass responses in the RCP8.5 scenario result in 65% and 63% marsh loss, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third quartile CO2 fertilization effect completely negates marsh loss in all RCP scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absolute values of marsh loss in the RCP scenarios will vary depending on other forcings that differ across tidal environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in marshes with high sediment supply and inorganic sedimentation rates, the effects of CO2 fertilization on marsh elevation and extent may be reduced (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results show that the CO2 fertilization effect plays a central role in determining marsh resilience globally and that it can significantly offset marsh drowning induced by an accelerated RRSLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous models of marsh dynamics under environmental change have neglected this effect (or heuristically assumed it is implicitly represented in temperature responses), and, although additional observational work is urgently needed to further improve our understanding and modeling representations, this mechanism is established as an important marsh response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Suspended sediments play a fundamental role in marsh survival (43), and marsh responses to changing SSC serve to evaluate the relative importance of and the interplay with the CO2 fertilization impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doubling the available SSC (C0) from 20 mg/L to 40 mg/L increases inorganic sedimentation rates and therefore the threshold RRSLR for partial drowning in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase is about 1 mm/y (Fig 2), which is of the same order as the increase in the threshold RRSLR caused by a doubling of CO2 concentration (for the median fertilization response).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the sediment-poor case (C0 = 20 mg/L), just beyond the threshold RRSLR for drowning, marsh loss is between 39% and 61% (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marsh loss occurs more gradually in the higher-SSC scenarios, where marsh extent is only reduced by 18% just beyond the initiation of partial drowning (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damming, the construction of levees, and other anthropogenic manipulations of upstream catchments have largely decreased sediment delivery to coastal environments (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm that this trend, likely to continue at the global scale, will significantly diminish marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In model experiments with nitrogen addition, elevated levels of nitrogen showed competing effects on marsh resilience (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum nitrogen addition (55.2 g Nm2y1) slightly increased the drowning initiation threshold RRSLR by 1 mm/y in both SSC cases, and the maximum addition scenario (892.8 g Nm2y1) slightly decreased the drowning threshold (also by 1 mm/y for both SSC scenarios).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the impacts of increased nitrogen concentrations on marsh stability could be significant, but that they remain uncertain, due to the wide range of observed plant responses to nitrogen fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results emphasize that marsh responses to environmental change are spatially variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many empirical studies and field experiments (4, 12) have focused on measuring the effects of elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition in single plots or chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, numerous modeling studies have used a point model framework to explore marsh dynamics (35, 4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches made it possible to identify marsh response mechanisms and feedbacks but do not capture actual marsh responses as they unfold in time and space (32, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, point models cannot reproduce the observed marsh drowning dynamics, moving from the inner part of a marsh toward the creeks that feed it (51, 52), or the persistence of the marsh portion adjacent to the tidal creek (maintained by inorganic sedimentation) even at very high RRSLR, after a majority of the marsh has drowned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 fertilization effect increases the lateral extent of marshes (as well as their average elevation), resulting in marshes that are more resilient to increasing RRSLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, more-expansive marshes provide a greater area for sequestering more carbon (45, 53) than those that are retreating and drowning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the fertilization effect may also contribute to a stabilizing feedback within the climate system, where increasing biomass production and organic deposition consequently sequester greater amounts of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marsh resilience evidenced by our results suggests that this feedback will be robust with respect to foreseeable values of the RRSLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although higher levels of atmospheric CO2 are inevitable (41), sediment delivery to the coast continues to decline globally (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated CO2 may possibly partially balance the negative effects of land use change and damming, but reduced sediment supply is likely to remain the most serious threat to marsh survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
