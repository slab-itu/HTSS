Cracking the social code of speech prosody using reverse correlation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In speech, social evaluations of a speakers dominance or trustworthiness are conveyed by distinguishing, but little-understood, pitch variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work describes how to combine state-of-the-art vocal pitch transformations with the psychophysical technique of reverse correlation and uses this methodology to uncover the prosodic prototypes that govern such social judgments in speech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is of great significance, because the exact shape of these prototypes, and how they vary with sex, age, and culture, is virtually unknown, and because prototypes derived with the method can then be reapplied to arbitrary spoken utterances, thus providing a principled way to modulate personality impressions in speech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human listeners excel at forming high-level social representations about each other, even from the briefest of utterances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, pitch is widely recognized as the auditory dimension that conveys most of the information about a speakers traits, emotional states, and attitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While past research has primarily looked at the influence of mean pitch, almost nothing is known about how intonation patterns, i.e., finely tuned pitch trajectories around the mean, may determine social judgments in speech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce an experimental paradigm that combines state-of-the-art voice transformation algorithms with psychophysical reverse correlation and show that two of the most important dimensions of social judgments, a speakers perceived dominance and trustworthiness, are driven by robust and distinguishing pitch trajectories in short utterances like the word Hello, which remained remarkably stable whether male or female listeners judged male or female speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal a unique communicative adaptation that enables listeners to infer social traits regardless of speakers physical characteristics, such as sex and mean pitch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By characterizing how any given individuals mental representations may differ from this generic code, the method introduced here opens avenues to explore dysprosody and social-cognitive deficits in disorders like autism spectrum and schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, once derived experimentally, these prototypes can be applied to novel utterances, thus providing a principled way to modulate personality impressions in arbitrary speech signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Accessing mental representations of interrogative prosody by using reverse correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the paradigm used in this study, we examined prosodic prototypes related to the evaluation of interrogative vs. declarative utterances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Left) Utterances of the same word vraiment (really) were digitally manipulated to have random pitch contours c(n)..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were presented pairs of manipulated words and judged which was most interrogative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Right) Prosodic mental representations, or prototypes, were computed as the mean pitch contour of the voices perceived as interrogative (really?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), minus those judged declarative (really.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, the prototypes associated with interrogative judgments showed a clear pitch increase at the end of the second syllable, which was observable both in averaged and in individual prototypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  amp., amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Derivation_of_Dominance_and_Trustworthiness_Prototypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first analyzed how participants judgments varied with the mean pitch of the manipulated utterances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies, perceived dominance was negatively related to mean pitch (19, 20) and trustworthiness positively related to mean pitch (6, 8), although more weakly so than dominance (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond mean pitch, we then analyzed dynamic pitch contours with reverse correlation and found that dominance judgments were driven by pitch prototypes with a gradual pitch decrease on both syllables, while pitch prototypes for trustworthiness showed a rapid pitch increase on the second syllable only (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two patterns were decidedly dynamic in time: Statistical analyses showed significant effects of segment position in both tasks (P less_than 0.001), and the slopes of linear best fits for segments 25 were significantly negative for dominance and positive for trustworthiness (all P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, we found that male and female listeners judged dominance, and trustworthiness, in a similar fashion (illustrated in Fig 2 C and E), with no effect of listeners gender nor interactions with stimuli gender for either task (all P  greater than  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a small difference between the prototypes obtained for the male vs. the female voice for dominance, but this difference was only visible on a single time segment (fourth), likely explained by intrasyllabic loudness contour differences between the two voices (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, while we observed interindividual differences regarding the exact shape of these patterns, especially for trustworthiness (Fig S3), the robustness of the internal prototypes for each listener was evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, strikingly similar prototypes were obtained for male and female voices, even though these were measured for a given listener on different days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Application_to_Novel_Utterances  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a second experiment, we tested the generality of these prototypes across words and speakers by applying them, their opposite patterns, or their mean values to new recordings of bonjour, as well as to a variety of other two-syllable words recorded by new speakers (Materials and Methods and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two new groups of participants (n = 21 and n = 19) rated the perceived dominance and trustworthiness of these new transformed voices, randomly mixed in terms of content and speaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted for dominance, applying the original prototype to novel utterances significantly increased their perceived dominance, whereas applying the opposite pattern significantly decreased it (all P less_than 0.001; Fig 3), both for hello and novel words [although more weakly so: Condition × WordType interaction; F(5, 85) = 8.6, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.34,  = 0.81].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though dominant prototypes flattened to their mean pitch value also led to a strong increase of perceived dominance, this increase was significantly smaller than for original prototypes, showing that the prototypes did not reduce to a simple mean pitch effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, applying the trustworthiness prototype and its opposite pattern significantly degraded and improved perceived dominance, respectively, but these effects were significantly smaller than those induced by the appropriate dominance prototypes (P less_than 0.01), showing that the two prototypes did not simply oppose one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For trustworthiness, applying the original prototype or the opposite pattern also increased and decreased trustworthiness as predicted, but only significantly for the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were observable on new recordings of the words hello, but not on other two-syllable words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In every other tested conditions (mean values and dominance filters), perceived trustworthiness decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analyses revealed, first, that, contrary to dominance, the relation between mean pitch and trustworthiness was nonlinear (Fig S4C), with reduced rather than increased ratings for large mean pitch levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, reverse-correlation analysis on data from the second experiment (Supporting Information), suggested that the shape of the trustworthiness prototypes were sensibly different across words (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, in both tasks, no effects or interactions between listener and stimulus gender were found (all P  greater than  0.05), confirming our finding that male and female listeners use similar strategies to process social dominance and trustworthiness in male and female voices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study demonstrates that social judgments of dominance and trustworthiness from spoken utterances are driven by robust mental prototypes of pitch contours, using a code that is identical across sender and observer gender, and that prosodic mental representations such as these can be uncovered with a technique combining state-of-the-art pitch manipulations and psychophysical reverse correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mental representations found here for dominant prosody, which combine lower mean pitch with a decreasing dynamical pattern, are consistent with previous research showing that peoples judgments of dominance can be affected by average pitch and pitch variability (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, trustworthy prosodic prototypes, which combine a moderate increase of mean pitch with an upward dynamical pattern, are consistent with findings that high pitch, as well as, e.g., slow articulation rate and smiling voice, increase trusting behaviors toward the speaker (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21; but see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond mean pitch, the temporal dynamics of the patterns found here were also consistent with previous associations found between general pitch variations and personality or attitudinal impressions, e.g., falling pitch in assertive utterances (22) or rising pitch in affiliatory infant-directed speech (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the present results show that mental representations for a speakers dominance or trustworthiness can and should be described in much finer temporal terms than a general rising or falling pitch variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our participants were in striking agreement on shapes sampled at less_than100 ms (Fig S3) and the fine details of these shapes, while they generalized to a variety of utterances and (in the case of dominance) even to other two-syllable words, varied depending on the morphology of the words (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, participants gave significantly better evaluations of, e.g., dominance for falling-pitch profiles that were prototype-specific, rather than obtained by inverting the profile of the other construct (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fact that both male and female participants relied on the same dynamic pitch prototypes to perceive dominance and trustworthiness in speech is in striking contrast to previous findings of gender effects on vocal dominance judgments (6, 8), and, more generally, the sexual dimorphic features of the human voice (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our paradigm, in which pitch variations are generated algorithmically based on otherwise flat-pitch utterances, is able to control for incident variations of male and female prosody that may have obfuscated this processing similarity in previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding, which provides behavioral evidence of a unique code for intonation, is consistent with a recent study suggesting that intonation processing is rooted at early processing stages in the auditory cortex (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gender symmetry, and more generally independence from a speakers physical characteristics, seems a very desirable property of a code governing social trait attribution: For instance, judgments of voice attractiveness, which increases via averaging, are also highly similar across gender (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By focusing on temporal variations in addition to static pitch level, the prosodic code uncovered here appears to be a particularly robust strategy, enabling listeners to discriminate, e.g., dominant from submissive males, even at a similarly low pitch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While our study shows that both dimensions have distinct prosodic prototypes that are robust within and across participants, the amount to which prototypes inferred on a given word explained the responses on other words differed, with better explanatory power for dominance than trustworthiness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is possible that the trustworthiness prototype, because it appears to be more finely dynamic and tuned to the temporal morphology of the original two-syllable word, is more discriminating of any acousticphonetic deviations from this pattern than the smoother dominance kernel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it is also possible that the position of a given exemplar with regard to the prototype is exploited more conservatively in the case of trustworthiness than dominance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the analysis of response probabilities as a function of the mean pitch change in experiment 2 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) (Fig S4C) shows a more strongly nonlinear relationship in the case of trustworthinesssuggesting that there is such a thing as being too trustworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is consistent with a recent series of neuroimaging results showing nonlinear amygdala responses to both highly trustworthy and highly untrustworthy faces relative to neutral (27, 28), as well as, behaviorally, more negative face evaluations the more they deviate from a learned central tendency for trustworthiness, but less so for dominance (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the simple and repetitive nature of the judgment tasks, it appears important to consider whether some degree of participant learning or demand may be involved in the present results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, one should note that, in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the same intonation pattern was never presented twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, we presented several thousands of different, random intonation patterns across the experiment, in such a way that the experimenters did not a priori favor one shape over another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, prototypes inferred from Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 were repeated, but also interleaved with random variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is unlikely that participants were able to discover, then respond differentially to one particular pitch pattern as the experiment unfolded (see also Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this does not exclude the possibility that participants have set themselves an arbitrary response criteria from the onset of the experiment, this criteria can in no way be guided by conditions decided in advance by the experimenter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, because dominance and trustworthiness tasks were conducted on an independent group of participants, the opposite (although nonsymmetric) patterns found for the two constructs cannot be attributed to transfer effects from one task to the other (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question remains, however, whether the prototypes evoked in explicit tasks such as the ones described here are consciously accessible to the participants and whether they are similar to those prototypes used in computations in which the corresponding traits are involved, but not directly assessed (see, e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings, and the associated technique, bring the power of reverse-correlation methods to the vast domain of speech prosody and thus open avenues of research in communicative behavior and social cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, while these results were derived by using single-word utterances, they initiate a research program to explore how they would scale up to multiword utterances and, more generally, how expressive intonation interacts with aspects of a sentence such as its length, syntax, and semantics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of infant utterances at the end of the single-word period (32) suggest that prosodic profiles are stretched, rather than repeated, over successive words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such production patterns are reflected in listeners mental representations can be tested with our technique by using multiword utterances manipulated with single-word filters that are either repeated or scaled to the duration of the excerpts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another related question concerns how social intonation codes interact with the position of focus words or with conjoint syntactic intonation, both of which are also conveyed with pitch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, English speakers required to maintain focus on certain words may eliminate emotional f0 distinctions at these locations (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions can be studied with our technique by using reverse correlation on baseline sentences which, contrary to the flat-pitch stimuli used here, already feature prosodic variations or focus markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, although arguably most important, suprasegmental pitch variations are not the only constitutive elements of expressive prosody, which also affects an utterances amplitude envelope, speech rate, rhythm, and voice quality (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying not only random pitch changes on each temporal segment, but also loudness, rate, and timbre changes (35), our paradigm can be extended to reveal listeners mental representations of social prosody along these other auditory characteristics and, more generally, probe contour processing in the human auditory system for other dimensions than pitch, such as loudness and timbre (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, while judgements of dominance and trustworthiness may be of prime importance in the context of encounters with strangers, in intragroup interactions with familiar others, e.g., in parentinfant dyads, it may be more important to evaluate states, such as the others emotions (e.g., being happy, angry, or sad) or attitudes (e.g., being critical, impressed, or ironic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method can be applied to all of these categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By measuring how any given individuals or populations mental representations may differ from the generic code, data-driven paradigms have been especially important in studying individual or cultural differences in face (13, 16) or lexical processing (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By providing a similar paradigm to map mental representations in the vast domain of speech prosody, the present technique opens avenues to explore, e.g., dysprosody and social-cognitive deficits in autism spectrum disorder (38), schizophrenia (39), or congenital amusia (40), as well as cultural differences in social and affective prosody (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, once derived experimentally with our paradigm, pitch prototypes can be reapplied to novel recordings as social makeup so as to modulate how they are socially processed, while preserving their nonprosodic characteristics such as speaker identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process provides a principled and effective way to manipulate personality impressions from arbitrary spoken utterances and could form the foundation of future audio algorithms for social signal processing and humancomputer interaction (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ethics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments presented in this paper were approved by the Institut Européen dAdministration des Affaires (INSEAD) IRB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants gave their informed written consent before the experiment, were compensated for participating, and were debriefed and informed about the true purpose of the research immediately after the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recordings_and_Experimental_Apparatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Original stimuli were recorded by a group of native French speakers (see words and speaker characteristics in Table S1), using a DPA 4066 omnidirectional microphone and a RME Fireface 800 soundcard (44.1 kHz) in a double-walled IAC sound-insulated booth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were mono sound files generated at sampling rate 44.1 kHz in 16-bit resolution by Matlab and were normalized in loudness in the range 75- to 80-dB sound pressure level by using the ITU-R BS.1770 normalization procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were presented diotically through headphones (Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO; 80 ohms), and sound levels were measured by using a Brüel & Kjær 2238 Mediator sound-level meter placed at a distance of 4 cm from the right earphone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Voice-Processing_Algorithm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed an open-source toolbox (CLEESE; available at cream.ircam.fr) to generate the stimuli used in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toolbox, based on the phase-vocoder sound-processing algorithm (43), operates by generating a set of breakpoints (e.g., at every 100 ms in the file) and applying a different audio transformation to every segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used the toolbox to set random fundamental frequency values at each of the breakpoints, and linearly interpolate these values within each segment, (see details below for each experiment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond pitch, the toolbox is also able to generate random modifications of spectral envelopes, speed, loudness, and equalization; these additional features were not used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stimulus used for this experiment was the word really (vraiment in French), recorded by one male speaker (duration, 426 ms; mean f0, 105 Hz), which can be experienced either as declarative or interrogative depending on its pitch contour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pitch contour of the utterance was flattened, then divided into six segments of 71 ms; we manipulated the pitch over the seven time points on Gaussian distributions of SD = 70 cents, clipped at ± 2.2 SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairs of these randomly manipulated voices were presented to five observers who were asked, on each trial, to judge which of the two versions appeared most interrogative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each observer was presented with 700 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prosodic prototypes were computed as described in Fig 1 (see also Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
