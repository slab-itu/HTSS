Self-regulating genomic island encoding tandem regulators confers chromatic acclimation to marine Synechococcus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The regulation of photosynthesis in marine phytoplankton, which account for approximately half the Earths primary productivity, is fundamentally important but not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Picocyanobacteria such as Synechococcus, which are responsible for 1020% of global marine productivity, live in environments where light availability often limits photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA4 is a process commonly used by Synechococcus to optimize photon capture under such conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterize CA4 regulation by demonstrating that two proteins, FciA and FciB (for type four chromatic acclimation island), operate diametrically to control CA4 in response to changes in the ratio of blue to green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genes encoding these proteins, and the genes they both regulate, are contained within a widespread genomic island that is likely sufficient for horizontal transfer and expansion of this phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolutionary success of marine Synechococcus, the second-most abundant phototrophic group in the marine environment, is partly attributable to this groups ability to use the entire visible spectrum of light for photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group possesses a remarkable diversity of light-harvesting pigments, and most of the groups members are orange and pink because of their use of phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin chromophores, which are attached to antennae proteins called phycoerythrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many strains can alter phycoerythrin chromophore ratios to optimize photon capture in changing bluegreen environments using type IV chromatic acclimation (CA4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CA4 is common in most marine Synechococcus lineages, the regulation of this process remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a widely distributed genomic island encoding tandem master regulators named FciA (for type four chromatic acclimation island) and FciB plays a central role in controlling CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FciA and FciB have diametric effects on CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interruption of fciA causes a constitutive green light phenotype, and interruption of fciB causes a constitutive blue light phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins regulate all of the molecular responses occurring during CA4, and the proteins activity is apparently regulated posttranscriptionally, although their cellular ratio appears to be critical for establishing the set point for the bluegreen switch in ecologically relevant light environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, FciA and FciB coregulate only three genes within the Synechococcus genome, all located within the same genomic island as fciA and fciB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, along with the widespread distribution of strains possessing this island, suggest that horizontal transfer of a small, self-regulating DNA region has conferred CA4 capability to marine Synechococcus throughout many oceanic areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

FciA_and_FciB_Are_Master_Regulators_of_CA4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of a small genomic island in all CA4-capable strains of Synechococcus and the dispersed nature of CA4 throughout the Synechococcus radiation suggests that horizontal gene transfer has played a large role in the expansion of CA4 throughout this group (2, 7, 16, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by the 44% GC content of the DNA that comprises the CA4 genomic island in 9916, which is markedly different from the 61% GC content of the regions bordering the island (Fig 1A) and the 60% GC content of the entire genome (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The island is also flanked by one complete copy and one fragment of the psbA gene, which is a proposed hotspot for DNA-recombination events (16, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that two proteins encoded within the CA4 genomic island, FciA and FciB, are CA4 regulators because both are putative AraC-class transcription factors and every sequenced CA4 strain contains fciA and fciB within its CA4 genomic island (16, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 9916, the coding regions of fciA and fciB overlap by a single base pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes are apparently cotranscribed (Fig S1 A and B), and their transcript levels are similar in blue and green light (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insertion mutants of fciA and fciB were created (Fig S2) and tested for their ability to carry out CA4, which turns WT 9916 cells pink in green light and orange in blue light because of shifts in the PUB:PEB ratio within the phycobilisomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fciA mutant cells always appear pink, and fciB mutant cells always appear orange (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of each mutant to carry out CA4 was examined by measuring the 495 nm:545 nm fluorescence excitation ratio with emission set at 580 nm (hereafter Ex495:545 ratio), which serves as a proxy for their in vivo PUB:PEB ratio (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells grown in green light were switched to blue light, then returned to green light, over a 28-d period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas control cells harboring a CA4-neutral insertion underwent normal acclimation to blue light and reacclimation to green light over 56 d, the Ex495:545 ratios for the fciA and fciB mutant cells remained unchanged during the 28-d experiment (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the phenotypes of the two mutants were completely opposite, with fciA mutant cells locked in the green light state and fciB mutant cells locked in the blue light state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the two genomic island-encoded genes fciA and fciB are both necessary for cells to carry out CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The possibility that these phenotypes were attributable to polar effects was tested by introducing WT versions of either fciA, fciB, or both genes in tandem into each mutant using an autonomously replicating plasmid and measuring Ex495:545 ratios for transformants that were fully acclimated to either blue or green light (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no polar effect of the fciA interruption on fciB because the mutant phenotype was complemented when fciA alone was reintroduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fciB did not complement the fciA mutant, fciA and fciB together did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the fciB mutation was complemented by fciA and fciB together but was not complemented by either fciB or fciA alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although introducing fciA had no effect on the fciB mutant, the introduction of fciB decreased the Ex495:545 ratio of the fciB mutant to a value similar to that of the fciA mutant, in both light colors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for this phenotype is that fciB is being expressed above WT levels from the plasmid, thus altering the CA4 response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility by transforming WT cells with the plasmids used for complementation and measuring fciA and fciB RNA levels after growth in blue and green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fciA and fciB were expressed approximately 5- to 10-fold higher in these transformants than in WT cells containing an empty vector (Fig S1 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of fciA increased the Ex495:545 ratio in green light, similar to the fciB mutant phenotype, whereas fciB overexpression decreased the Ex495:545 ratio in blue light, similar to the fciA mutant phenotype (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpressing fciA and fciB together did not affect the Ex495:545 ratio, suggesting that the FciA:FciB ratio is critical for normal CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, overexpression of either fciA or fciB individually, but not together, is sufficient to disrupt CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parameters of the CA4 response that are regulated by FciA and FciB were initially examined by purifying phycobilisomes from WT, fciA mutant, and fciB mutant cells fully acclimated to blue or green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual components were separated by HPLC, each phycoerythrin subunit was individually isolated, and UVvisible (UV-VIS) absorption spectroscopy used to determine chromophore composition (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During CA4 in 9916, differential chromophorylation occurs at three positions: MpeA-C83, MpeA-C140, and CpeA-C139.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three bind PUB in blue light and PEB in green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two positions in these  subunits are not affected by CA4: MpeA-C75 binds PUB and CpeA-C82 binds PEB in both blue and green light (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CA4-mediated chromophorylation changes of MpeA and CpeA strongly affect the overall absorbance characteristics of these two proteins (Fig 2 A and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromophore composition of the phycoerythrin  subunits MpeB (-PEII) and CpeB (-PEI) is unchanged by CA4 (Fig S3) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purification and spectral analyses of phycobiliprotein subunits from fciA and fciB mutant cells grown in blue or green light revealed that both lacked any CA4-mediated chromophorylation changes within either MpeA or CpeA (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 B, C, E, and F) or MpeB or CpeB (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorbance characteristics of MpeA and CpeA from fciA mutant cells grown in blue or green light matched WT cells grown in green light, whereas MpeA and CpeA from fciB mutant cells grown in blue or green light matched WT cells grown in blue light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific chromophorylation patterns within MpeA and CpeA in these mutants after growth in blue and green light were analyzed by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy coupled to mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirmed that during growth in blue and green light, fciA mutant cells had PEB at positions CpeA-C139, MpeA-C83, and MpeA-C140, whereas fciB mutant cells had PUB at these residues (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate that FciA and FciB are master regulators of CA4 that control all differential chromophorylation that occurs during CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FciA_and_FciB_Inversely_Regulate_Expression_of_Several_Genomic_Island_Genes_During_CA4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the absence of CA4-mediated chromophorylation changes in fciA and fciB mutants, we hypothesized that FciA and FciB control CA4-regulated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify regulatory targets of FciA and FciB, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of control, fciA mutant, and fciB mutant cells grown in blue or green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, data from control cells grown in either blue or green light revealed that only five genes in the 9916 genome had a statistically significant difference in RNA abundance during CA4 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All five genes were more highly expressed in blue light than in green light, and the three genes most strongly regulated by CA4, mpeZ (35-fold), fciC (10-fold), and unk10 (40-fold), are located within the same genomic island as fciA and fciB (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the constitutive green light phenotype of the fciA mutant and the fact that all five genes were normally more highly expressed in blue light, we predicted that FciA activates gene expression in blue light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide transcript levels from control and fciA mutant cells grown in blue light were compared to identify genes deactivated in the fciA mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in Table S1 show that FciA is only responsible for the blue light activation of the three most highly CA4-regulated genes, mpeZ, fciC, and unk10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constitutive blue light phenotype of the fciB mutant suggested that FciB is a repressor of gene expression in green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, global RNA levels from control and fciB mutant cells grown in green light were compared to identify genes derepressed in the fciB mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FciB was responsible for the green light-mediated repression of nine genes, with the three most strongly repressed genes, mpeZ, fciC, and unk10, also differentially regulated during CA4 and activated by FciA (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantified expression levels of mpeZ, fciC, and unk10 in control, fciA, and fciB mutant cells clearly indicate that FciA activates and FciB represses expression of mpeZ, fciC, and unk10 (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent expression data obtained from RNA blot analyses confirmed the RNA-Seq results (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results demonstrate that mpeZ, fciC, and unk10 are the only genes regulated by both FciA and FciB (Fig 3D), indicating that the CA4 regulon consists exclusively of genes located within the CA4 genomic island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relative_Expression_of_fciA_and_fciB_Determines_the_BlueGreen_Light_Midpoint_for_CA4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diametric control of CA4 by FciA and FciB suggests that their functions are integrated and, thus, responsive to the ratio of blue to green light in their environment rather than the overall amount of either.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the Ex495:545 ratios to examine the capacity of 9916 to acclimate to a series of bluegreen light ratios that closely mimic its natural environment (Fig 4) (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells continued to behave as if they were in a pure light color when slight amounts of the other color was also provided, such as at a ratio of 9 mol green photons m2 s1:1 mol blue photons m2 s1 (9G:1B) or at a 1G:9B ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 9916 CA4 response reached the halfway point between the green light- and blue light-acclimated states as determined by the Ex495:545 ratios (CA4 midpoint value; Ex495:545  1.1) between ratios of 5G:5B and 4G:6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this response, we hypothesized that cells were either responding to the ratio of blue to green light or the absolute amount of irradiance of one light color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that although both 7G:3B and 3G:7B only slightly triggered CA4 (Fig 4), providing as little as 3G:0B or 0G:3B was sufficient to elicit a full CA4 response (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that 9916 is capable of regulating CA4 by assessing the ratio, rather than the absolute amounts, of blue and green light in its environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, the relative expression of fciA and fciB affects the CA4 midpoint value in 9916 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of fciA sensitized the cells to blue light, so that any light color ratio equal to or below 7G:3B was sensed as pure blue light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, fciB overexpression sensitized cells to green light such that the cells sensed any light color ratio equal to or above 3G:7B as pure green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were attributable to changes in the in vivo fciA:fciB expression ratio, because the CA4 midpoint value of cells overexpressing both fciA and fciB was more similar to that of the control cells than cells overexpressing either fciA or fciB alone (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that the effects of FciA and FciB are integrated to establish the CA4 midpoint value for 9916 and raise the possibility that the CA4 response could be influenced by changes in the relative activity or abundance of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our RNA-Seq results suggest that for 9916, the CA4 response is unlikely attributable to abundance changes, because neither fciA nor fciB expression changes during CA4 (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CA4 is a prevalent process within the marine Synechococcus radiation, because 14 of the 40 genomes of isolates sequenced thus far in this group were shown to contain a complete CA4 genomic island containing a fciAB operon (16), and strains showing this trait have been isolated from many different sites in the ocean in the vicinity of continents (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By improving the efficiency of photon capture by Synechococcus phycobilisomes, CA4 is likely to significantly influence global primary productivity in the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that horizontal acquisition of the CA4 genomic island, which always contains fciA and fciB (16), is sufficient to impart the ability to perform CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the widespread nature of Synechococcus and CA4, this evolutionary mechanism is likely critical for niche adaptation to mixed waters and/or transition areas between coastal and offshore waters, as illustrated by the large proportion of CA4-capable cells in the permanently mixed waters of the English Channel (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have identified FciA and FciB as two central regulators of CA4 and shown the diametric influence of each of these proteins on genomic island gene expression, differential phycobilisome chromophorylation, and bluegreen responsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data are consistent with FciA functioning as an activator in blue light and FciB serving as a repressor in green light of the expression of three genes, all of which are located within the CA4 genomic island (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that, in mesotrophic and coastal waters, where blue light is more attenuated than green light and PEB is more effective than PUB for light harvesting (23), FciB represses CA4 gene expression, whereas FciA activates CA4 gene expression in open ocean oligotrophic waters, where blue light is transmitted better than green light and PUB is more effective for light harvesting than PEB (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, FciA and FciB tune gene expression levels in response to the ambient blue to green ratio (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decrease in this ratio causes repression of gene expression by FciB to overcome activation by FciA, leading to low expression of mpeZ, fciC, and unk10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, an increase in this ratio causes activation of gene expression by FciA to overcome repression by FciB, leading to high expression of mpeZ, fciC, and unk10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of mpeZ expression increases the proportion of the blue light-absorbing PUB content within phycobilisomes, which increases growth and the efficiency of photon capture (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FciC and Unk10 are ORFs whose functions have not yet been determined, and their contribution to CA4 is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 9916, the regulation of the CA4 response by FciA and FciB resulted in increased gene expression of three genes in blue light (Table S1, Fig 3, and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the ancestor of 9916 was a green light specialist, with relatively high PEB content, before horizontal acquisition of a CA4 genomic island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After acquisition, the CA4 genomic island conferred cells with the ability to increase the amount of PUB in blue light, in part because of the FciA- and FciB-controlled increase in MpeZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis raises the issue of whether strains of Synechococcus that are blue light specialists, with relatively high PUB content, can become CA4 capable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent discovery of two types of CA4 genomic islands, which led to the identification of CA4-A and CA4-B strains (16), provides a possible mechanism for CA4 acquisition by blue light specialists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that whereas CA4-A strains such as 9916 were originally green light specialists and developed CA4 capability by acquiring the CA4-A genomic island, which contains blue light-expressed mpeZ, CA4-B strains such as Synechococcus RS9915 were originally blue light specialists and gained CA4 capability by acquiring the CA4-B genomic island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fciA and fciB are both present in the CA4-B genomic island, but mpeZ is replaced by mpeW, which, unlike mpeZ, is more highly expressed in green light (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of two forms of CA4 also makes it unlikely that CA4 was originally present in all marine Synechococcus and has been lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CA4 regulation in marine Synechococcus is significantly different from the regulation of other types of cyanobacterial chromatic acclimation, which use cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptors that act as histidine kinases to control two component system pathways (11, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyanobacteriochrome-encoding genes appear to be absent from the 9916 genome, and because the CA4 genomic island does not encode any proteins belonging to any known class of photoreceptors or containing any known chromophore-binding domains, how light color regulates CA4 is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only known CA4 regulators, FciA and FciB, belong to the AraC family of transcriptional regulators, a large class of proteins that activate or repress transcription to control a variety of cellular responses, typically by binding small molecules that alter their DNA-binding activity (21, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fciA and fciB transcript levels are similar in blue and green light (Fig S1 C and D), and we expect that FciA and FciB levels behave correspondingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, then there must be some form of posttranslation regulation of these proteins by light color during CA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is not clear how light color regulates FciA and FciB activity, it appears that the ratio of FciA to FciB alters the CA4 set point (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that variation in this ratio in different CA4-capable Synechococcus isolates may provide a mechanism for creating CA4 phenotypic variation in distinct niches of the worlds oceans by generating a range of responses to any single bluegreen light ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The restricted nature of the gene regulation by FciA and FciB (Fig 3D) appears to be quite different from other AraC-class family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent RNA-Seq studies of araC mutants in Escherichia coli and Salmonella demonstrate that AraC has a much broader regulon than previously known (27), and other AraC family members also control large regulons in a diverse set of bacteria (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small and highly specific FciA/FciB regulon is also different from the widespread responses in gene expression that have been observed for other forms of chromatic acclimation (13, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited number of genes that are regulated by FciA and FciB is likely to facilitate the horizontal transfer of this phenotype by minimizing the interactions with gene products produced in the strain receiving the CA4 island, consistent with the burden hypothesis (19, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encoding self-regulatory capacity within the island further improves its transferability, because it is generally difficult to confer regulation on systems that have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that little additional fitness is achieved by expanding CA4 regulation to genes outside of this genomic island and/or there may have been insufficient time since the acquisition of CA4 by 9916 to evolve additional regulatory control of genes in other regions of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery that the CA4 regulators FciA and FciB and the three genes they control are encoded within a Synechococcus CA4 genomic island provides an important addition to our understanding of how light color is used effectively for photosynthesis in marine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light use efficiency is also a major problem in the development of solar-powered microbial energy and chemical production (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of a compact genomic island that appears to be readily transferrable and possibly contain both the structural and regulatory elements required to improve light capture may be a valuable tool for expanding the versatility of light use by genetically engineered cyanobacterial strains for in vivo biotechnological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strains_and_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growth conditions were similar to those previously described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT cells were genetically unaltered 9916 cells (34), whereas control cells were WT except for the insertion of a mini-Tn5 transposon from pRL27 (35) within the 5 half of the RS9916_32112 (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EAU74248) ORF in the 9916 genome, which encodes an uncharacterized protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This insertion does not affect CA4 and provides comparable kanamycin resistance to the interruption mutant lines used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semicontinuous cultures were grown in polycarbonate culture flasks at 22 °C in PCR-S11 media in constant light at an irradiance of 10 mol photons m2 s1 from fluorescent light bulbs unless noted (Chroma 75 T12; General Electric).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filters (LE716 Mikkel Blue and LE738 Jas Green; LEE Filters) were used to generate blue and green light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When necessary, 50 g L1 kanamycin and/or 10 g L1 spectinomycin was added to cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Biotek Synergy-MX spectrofluorometer was used to generate fluorescence excitation spectra, and the Ex495:545 ratios were calculated as previously described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fciA_and_fciB_Complementation_Overexpression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To introduce autonomously replicating plasmids into cells for expression, conjugations between E. coli MC1061 and 9916 were performed as described in the SI Materials and Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual colonies were picked from plates and were tested by PCR amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All transformed cells were maintained with 10 g L1 spectinomycin when grown in liquid culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A list of strains and plasmids used is provided in Table S2 and a list of PCR amplification primers used is provided in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA blot analyses were performed as previously described (9, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 100 mL of cells were acclimated to blue or green light for at least 7 d, RNA was purified, and at least 5 g of RNA was added per lane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiolabeled DNA probes were used to probe the blots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were normalized as previously described (9, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RNA-Seq, libraries were prepared using an Epicentre (Illumina) ScriptSeq complete bacteria kit, and 50-bp, single-read sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq2000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fastq reads were trimmed for low quality and adapter sequences using Trimmomatic (version 0.33; default parameters except LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:50) and stripped of any poly-Gs in sequencing reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were reference-mapped using Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 (37), and counts for genes and intergenic regions were tabulated using custom Perl scripts and analyzed for differential expression using DESeq (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HPLC_Separation_of_Phycobiliproteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phycobilisomes were purified as described (9, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPLC was used to separate each phycobiliprotein and liquid chromatographytandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed on fractions collected from a C4 column and digested with trypsin as described previously (9, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

UV-VIS_Absorption_SpectroscopyMS_MS_of_Purified_Phycobiliproteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HPLC-separated and trypsin-digested phycobiliproteins from WT, fciA, or fciB mutant cells grown in blue or green light were analyzed by UV-VIS and MS/MS as described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A list of relevant peptide sequences and their characteristics from the fciA and fciB mutants is provided in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmid_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The plasmids and primers used are listed in Tables S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pASfciA and pASfciB were made by PCR amplification of 800-nt internal regions of fciA and fciB and cloning into the BamHI site of pMUT100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pJS2 and pJS3 were made by PCR amplification of the promoter and ribosome-binding site of fciA and either fciA or fciA and fciB, which were cloned into the BamHI and EagI sites of pJS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pJS4 was generated by PCR amplification and fusion of the promoter and ribosome-binding site of fciA to the fciB gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translational fusion was then cloned into the BamHI and EagI sites of pJS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fciA_and_fciB_Disruption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene disruptions were generated as previously described (9, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, E. coli MC1061, a conjugative strain containing pRK24 and PRL528, was transformed with plasmids designed for disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugations were performed with the conjugative strain and 9916 cells, which were then plated in 0.3% agar plates containing 50 g L1 kanamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual colonies were picked from plates and tested for the proper insertion by PCR amplification of the regions and DNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All transformed cells were maintained with 50 g L1 kanamycin when grown in liquid culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
