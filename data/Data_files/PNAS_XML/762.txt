Aridity and hominin environments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxygen isotopes in modern and fossil mammals can provide information on climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we provide a new record of aridity experienced by early hominins in Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that past climates were similar to the climate in eastern Africa today, and that early hominins experienced highly variable climates over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, our findings suggest that the long-term expansion of grasses and grazing herbivores since the Pliocene, a major ecological transformation thought to drive aspects of hominin evolution, was not coincident with aridification in northern Kenya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding raises the possibility that some aspects of hominin environmental variability might have been uncoupled from aridity, and may instead be related to other factors, such as rainfall seasonality or ecological interactions among plants and mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aridification is often considered a major driver of long-term ecological change and hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene; however, this hypothesis remains inadequately tested owing to difficulties in reconstructing terrestrial paleoclimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a revised aridity index for quantifying water deficit (WD) in terrestrial environments using tooth enamel 18O values, and use this approach to address paleoaridity over the past 4.4 million years in eastern Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find no long-term trend in WD, consistent with other terrestrial climate indicators in the Omo-Turkana Basin, and no relationship between paleoaridity and herbivore paleodiet structure among fossil collections meeting the criteria for WD estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we suggest that changes in the abundance of C4 grass and grazing herbivores in eastern Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene may have been decoupled from aridity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in modern African ecosystems, other factors, such as rainfall seasonality or ecological interactions among plants and mammals, may be important for understanding the evolution of C4 grass- and grazer-dominated biomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Terrestrial_Aridity_Proxy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across modern localities, WD increases nonlinearly with decreasing mean annual precipitation (logarithmic regression, R2 = 0.7546, P less_than 0.0001) and increasing mean annual temperature (quadratic polynomial regression, R2 = 0.6829, P less_than 0.0001) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  enamel-mw values for Hippopotamidae, Elephantidae, and Rhinocerotidae do not vary with WD, and these taxa are classified as EI (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  enamel-mw values for Giraffidae, Hippotragini, and Tragelaphini increase with WD, and these taxa are classified as ES (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slopes of WD-ES-mw regressions vary significantly from one another (P less_than 0.05, F test), except for Giraffidae and Hippotragini (P  0.05, F test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite preliminary observations to the contrary (36), the addition of more locations in this dataset reveals that Antilopini, Bovini, and Neotragini should be excluded from the ES category (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other sampled bovids, suids, and equids (Fig 2C) have no significant relationship with WD (P  0.05), except Cephalophini (P less_than 0.05), which are not considered further owing to enamel-mw values that are more variable and/or span a restricted WD range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data are needed to address the variability in enamel-mw values across bovid genera, although many bovid fossils are identifiable only to tribe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a body water model to identify possible physiological and behavioral mechanisms driving the relationship between enamel-mw and WD among EI and ES taxa (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A static oxygen budget, in which body water is influenced solely by changes in the isotopic composition of oxygen influxes rather than by changes in the balance of influxes, is inconsistent with the enamel-mw values of either ES or EI taxa (SI Appendix, Fig S2 C and D); therefore, 18O enrichment of leaf water in arid environments is insufficient to explain the relationship between enamel-mw values and WD among ES taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, sensitivity to evaporation is likely related to differences in drinking behavior and associated changes in the balance of oxygen influxes as the environment varies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted enamel-mw values suggest that EI taxa reflect meteoric water as aridity increases owing to a balance between increasing drinking water and decreasing food water (SI Appendix, Fig S2C), and ES taxa track increasing aridity owing to a balance between decreasing drinking water and increasing intake of food water and O2, both of which are sensitive to evaporation (SI Appendix, Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aridity index reflects the relationship between WD and the enrichment between ES and EI taxa (ES-EI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant WD-ES-EI regressions (P less_than 0.05) that can be used to estimate paleoaridity include Giraffid-Hippopotamidae, Tragelaphini-Hippopotamidae, Hippotragini-Hippopotamidae, Tragelaphini-Elephantidae, and Tragelaphini-Rhinocerotidae (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEs of these regression models are relatively low (±193 to ±478.1 mm/y) and coefficients of determination are high (R2 = 0.810.92), and thus these models have sufficient predictive power to estimate paleoaridity in the fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slopes are different among WD-ES-EI regressions (P less_than 0.05, F test); therefore, a pooled or common slope, as suggested previously (36), is not appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the mean of WD values calculated with WD-ES-EI regressions for all available ES-EI pairs from each fossil collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainty in WD estimates (800 mm/y) corresponds to 20% of the WD range in modern eastern African environments, sufficient to detect long-term trends in Turkana (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other WD-ES-EI regressions are not significant (P  0.05) and should not be used to estimate paleoaridity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Paleoaridity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our oxygen isotope analyses of fossil tooth enamel for paleoaridity estimation were restricted to fossil collections with well-defined stratigraphic and sedimentological context and the preservation of appropriate ES and EI taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among all fossil collections used to evaluate paleoaridity, we find highly variable conditions, including both mesic (WD less_than 0) and arid (WD  0) climates that fall within a WD range (5501,700 mm/y) encompassing 61% of the modern range (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean WD estimated by fossil tooth enamel is 471 mm/y, similar to the present-day mean WD in eastern and central Africa (251 mm/y; P  0.05) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S4 and Tables S1 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among fossil collections from the Omo-Turkana Basin, we detect no long-term trend in WD between 4.2 and 0.01 Ma (P  0.05) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The paleoaridity record (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Tables S2 and S3) begins in the Pliocene with a highly uncertain estimate of arid conditions associated with Ardipithecus ramidus fossils from the Lower Aramis Member, Sangatole Formation (4.4 Ma) (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Omo-Turkana Basin, we find arid conditions at Kanapoi (4.16 Ma) and a highly uncertain estimate of mesic conditions at Allia Bay (4.0 Ma), both associated with Australopithecus anamensis (48), and pedogenic carbonate 13C values indicative of vegetation ranging from woodland/bushland/shrubland to wooded grassland (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mid- to late-Pliocene (3.52.8 Ma) fossil collections in Turkana indicate variable conditions that include arid (Kangatukuseo KU1) and arid to mesic (Lomekwi LO4/5) climates, associated with pedogenic carbonate 13C values indicating woody cover, including woodland/bushland/shrubland (Fig 4) (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time interval in Turkana includes fossils of the hominin genera Kenyanthropus and Paranthropus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early Pleistocene (2.51.5 Ma) is represented in the Turkana Basin by fossil assemblages in the upper Burgi Member of the Koobi Fora Formation as well as the Kaito Member of the Nachukui Formation, which indicate arid (FwJj20 and Kalochoro KL3/6, Naiyena Engol NY2/3), nearly balanced (Kokiselei KS2 and Kangatukuseo KU2/3), and mesic (Kokiselei KS1) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pedogenic carbonate 13C values indicate that relatively open vegetation, including wooded grasslands, became more prevalent during this time interval in Turkana (49), which includes an abundant fossil record of Homo and Paranthropus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesic conditions prevailed at Kanjera South KS-2 in southwestern Kenya, associated with an open grassland ecosystem (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeological occurrences at Kanjera South, as well as in the Nachukui and Koobi Fora Formations in the Turkana Basin, demonstrate that Oldowan tool-making hominins inhabited mesic and arid environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The late Middle Pleistocene to Holocene (0.20.01 Ma) is represented in the Turkana Basin by fossil assemblages in the Kibish Formation, which indicate arid conditions in Member 4 and arid to mesic conditions in Member 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossils identified as Homo sapiens (Omo I and Omo II) are from Member 1, and other human specimens are derived from either Member 3 or Member 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WD estimates in Members 1 and 4 are substantially lower than those in Turkana today (modern WD = 2,386 mm/y; SI Appendix, Table S1), consistent with deposition during relatively humid periods associated with high lake levels and sapropel formation intervals (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationships_Between_Climate_and_Ecology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the significance of aridity in shaping hominin environments in eastern Africa, we further consider the relationship between climate and ecology in modern African ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetation in Africa is shaped by complex interactions between multiple abiotic (e.g., rainfall amount and seasonality, fire, atmospheric pCO2) and biotic (e.g., herbivory) factors, and the relative importance of these factors is contingent on the ecological history of each area (5254).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although woody cover is constrained by aridity (55), vegetation does not respond in a direct or continuous manner to changes in annual rainfall, and each biome (e.g., forest, savanna, grassland) is distributed over a wide rainfall range (1,0003,000 mm/y) (52, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that among modern eastern and central African ecosystems, the proportion of C4 grazers increases with WD (R2 = 0.262, P = 0.00536), and the proportion of C3 browsers decreases with WD (R2 = 0.1884, P = 0.021) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations are weak, however, and during the Pliocene-Pleistocene forests were rare in the Turkana Basin (25, 27, 49, 58) and elsewhere in eastern Africa (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After excluding forests, we find no relationship between WD and the proportional abundance of each diet guild (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the abundances of C4 plants and C4 grazing herbivores are often used as an indicators of aridity (21, 30), variation in C4 biomass among nonforest biomes can be decoupled from aridity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paleoaridity records from 18O of tooth enamel provide a means to investigate links between climate and ecology in hominin environments, but also are highly discontinuous owing to the incompleteness of the terrestrial fossil record, compounded in this case by the scarcity of fossil assemblages meeting the criteria for applying the aridity index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We address this problem in three ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we examine the fidelity of long-term environmental records derived from the fossil collections used for paleoaridity analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term increase in the proportion of C4 grazers among Artiodactyla-Perissodactyla-Proboscidea over the Pliocene-Pleistocene in the Omo-Turkana Basin is similar (P  0.05, F test) when calculated using tooth enamel 13C values from paleoaridity fossil collections (R2 = 0.3868, P = 0.02324) or from a larger fossil tooth enamel 13C dataset divided into long time bins (100 ka) (R2 = 0.7391, P = 0.0006911) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible to recover first-order environmental trends using fossils from these discontinuous depositional intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we compare our WD record with previously published geological and faunal-based reconstructions of terrestrial paleoclimate in Turkana with varying time representation and analytical biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no trends in paleoclimate based on paleosol calcic depth, mammal hypsodonty and lophedness (k-nearest-neighbor model), or bovid tribe abundance (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimated precipitation decreases over time based on mammal community structure (R2 = 0.2295, P = 0.03258) and mammal hypsodonty and lophedness (linear regression model) (R2 = 0.0583, P = 0.004477), but these trends are weak and based on proxies influenced by evolutionary and dietary changes, respectively, that might not be related to aridity (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, evidence for marked long-term aridification in the Turkana Basin is weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, we examine the relationship between WD and ecology in the fossil record irrespective of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no relationships (P  0.05) between WD and the proportion of C4 grazers, C3-C4 mixed feeders, or C3 browsers (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the lack of suitable fossil collections for the application of our tooth enamel aridity proxy, we do not address climate before 4 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Late Miocene appears to have been more humid in Turkana and elsewhere (34), although aridification before 4 Ma predates the long-term increase in C4 vegetation and C4 grazing mammalian herbivore that continued throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene (25, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the coarse time resolution associated with the tooth enamel 18O WD calculations, we suggest that the Pliocene-Pleistocene expansion in C4 plants and C4 grazing herbivores appears to not be coincident with significant long-term aridification in the Omo-Turkana Basin (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of a smaller long-term increase in aridity, undetected owing to uncertainty in WD estimates, cannot be discounted, but would not necessarily have been a major environmental driver, given that ecological feedback in African biomes inhibits vegetation responses to climate change (5254).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cause of the major long-term expansion of C4 biomass within Turkana and elsewhere remains unclear, but may be related to climatic and ecological dynamics that are unrelated to annual WD and need not be equivalent across basins or regions (1, 23, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results do not preclude the possibility of climate-driven change in hominin environments generally, but highlight the need to address possible variability in the determinants of environmental change in different areas, because basins do not necessarily respond in a straightforward way to continental- and regional-scale aridification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, previous paleosol and leaf wax biomarker paleovegetation studies demonstrate that the timing and magnitude of the expansion of C4 plants is not uniform across eastern and northeastern Africa (23, 27, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, climatic and ecological dynamics appear to vary across basins, and regional-scale climate proxies must be contextualized by terrestrial, basin-scale environmental records most relevant to hominin evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our aridity record is consistent with the notion that climate instability may be an important driver of hominin evolution (2, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arid conditions were prevalent during two large lake intervals 4.0 and 2.0 Ma (Fig 4), consistent with climate variability including periods of increased aridity occurring within generally humid periods characterized by widespread lake formation (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orbital-scale environmental change has been demonstrated using leaf wax biomarkers from Early Pleistocene lake sediments at Olduvai Gorge, suggesting a direct link between rainfall and changes in the balance of woody and grassy vegetation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This case, and other episodes of climate-driven vegetation change (29, 60), are entirely consistent with ecological dynamics in cases where woody cover is not constrained by other factors, or when drastic changes in precipitation, particularly during periods of heightened climatic variability, exceed thresholds for stable biome states otherwise maintained by herbivory, fire, or other factors (44, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aridity_and_Human_Evolution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our paleoaridity record demonstrates that hominins were able to accommodate variable environments throughout the Pliocene-Pleistocene in eastern Africa, and is consistent with the notion that biological and behavioral changes in hominins, including upright posture, hair loss, sweating, and long-distance scavenging or running, may be related to thermophysiological challenges associated with surviving periodically arid conditions and high heat loads (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundance of C3 woody vegetation during the Pliocene (Fig 4) is consistent with the notion that early bipedal hominins could have relied on areas with shade-providing plants that may have reduced water and heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeological occurrences in Turkana during the early Pleistocene (2.41.4 Ma) are preferentially associated with lower 13C values of paleosol carbonate compared with those from nonarchaeological deposits, indicating that hominins concentrated their activities in more wooded areas (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, archaeological occurrences at Kanjera South in southwestern Kenya (2.0 Ma) demonstrate hominins repeatedly using an open grassland (50) when aridity was low (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, early hominin land use patterns were likely structured by the interplay between aridity and vegetation, such that the exploitation of increasingly open C4-dominated ecosystems may have been limited during periods of high aridity owing to constraints on the availability of water and shade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings demonstrate how mammal tooth enamel 18O values can be used to quantify paleoaridity directly associated with the hominin fossil and archaeological record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WD values estimated from fossil tooth enamel 18O values suggest that early hominins experienced highly variable climatic conditions within the range of present-day environments in the region, and could accommodate arid conditions as early as 4.2 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern hyperarid climate in Turkana is not a useful analog for paleoaridity in the basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of evidence for marked, long-term aridification, along with the absence of any relationship between aridity and herbivore diet structure, suggest that other abiotic or biotic determinants may have driven long-term ecological restructuring in the Omo-Turkana Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex interplay of ecology and behavior suggests that disentangling the influence of climate on the evolution of humans and other mammals remains a significant challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future interbasinal and intrabasinal studies are needed to investigate relationships among changing basinal geometry, biogeography, climate, depositional setting, ecology, and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
