Role of the receptor Mas in macrophage-mediated inflammation in vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The alternative reninangiotensin system pathway, the angiotensin (Ang)-(17)/Mas axis, may counterbalance Ang II-mediated proinflammatory effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of the Ang-(17)/Mas axis in immune cell function and inflammatory diseases in vivo, we used two different chronic inflammatory animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Mas affects macrophage function and phenotype independently of the underlying phagocyte stimulus and aggravates the clinical course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as well as atherosclerosis in mice by tipping the in vivo balance from M(IL-4+IL-13)- to M(LPS+IFN)-like macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, modulation of the Ang-(17)/Mas axis counteracts the proinflammatory role of Ang II by regulating the delicate equilibrium between M(LPS+IFN)- and M(IL-4+IL-13)-like macrophages, thereby representing a promising pharmacological target for chronic inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, an alternative reninangiotensin system pathway has been described, which involves binding of angiotensin-(17) to its receptor Mas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mas axis may counterbalance angiotensin-IImediated proinflammatory effects, likely by affecting macrophage function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the role of Mas in murine models of autoimmune neuroinflammation and atherosclerosis, which both involve macrophage-driven pathomechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mas signaling affected macrophage polarization, migration, and macrophage-mediated T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mas deficiency exacerbated the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and increased macrophage infiltration as well as proinflammatory gene expression in the spleen and spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Mas deficiency promoted atherosclerosis by affecting macrophage infiltration and migration and led to increased oxidative stress as well as impaired endothelial function in ApoE-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we identified the Mas axis as an important factor in macrophage function during inflammation of the central nervous and vascular system in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulating the Mas axis may constitute an interesting therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis and/or atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mas_Is_Expressed_on_Different_Macrophage_Subtypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein and mRNA expression analysis showed that Mas is expressed on macrophages (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the nomenclature by Murray et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), Mas was detected not only on unstimulated mature macrophages but also on M(LPS+IFN) and M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with macrophages, mas expression did not significantly differ in the spleen, testis, and aorta (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in the heart, kidney, and hindbrain, the most relevant brain region for neuroinflammation, was the expression of mas significantly higher than in macrophages (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mas expression in cultured hippocampal neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia was lower compared with macrophages (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression of mas in the brain was rather inhomogeneous and restricted to specialized cell subsets and specific areas (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas-Affected_Macrophage_Gene_Expression__Migration__and_T-Cell_Activation_Capacity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from Mas knockout (MasKO) and wild type (WT) mice were polarized in vitro into M(LPS+IFN) or M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages derived from Mas-deficient mice showed significantly higher expression levels of M(LPS+IFN) markers, like ccl2 and tnfa, compared with macrophages derived from WT mice (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the expression of the M(IL-4+IL-13) marker genes ym1, fizz, mrc1, and mgl2 was strongly down-regulated in Mas-deficient macrophages compared with WT controls (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, pharmacological activation of Mas via its selective agonist AVE 0991 caused a significant reduction in the expression of M(LPS+IFN) profile genes but an increased M(IL-4+IL-13) marker gene expression (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treatment with AVE 0991 reduced M(LPS+IFN) surface marker expression (CD80, CD86, and MHCII) but elevated the expression of CD206 on M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages (Fig S2B), indicating a shift toward M(IL-4+IL-13)polarized macrophages after pharmacological Mas activation in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 2C, transmigration of macrophages isolated from MasKO mice was significantly increased compared with macrophages from WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a following step, we investigated whether Mas on macrophages influences their capacity to activate naive T cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with WT macrophages, significantly more T cells proliferated when cocultured with Mas-deficient M(LPS+IFN) or M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages (Fig 2D), suggesting that the absence of the receptor Mas on macrophages rather than the phenotype of the macrophages influences T-cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, treatment of M(IL-4+IL-13) but not M(LPS+IFN) macrophages with AVE 0991 before coculture with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-labeled naive T cells significantly reduced the number of proliferating T cells (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mice treated with AVE 0991, starting 3 d before immunization, showed a significantly reduced disease incidence and a slightly ameliorated clinical EAE course (Fig S2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas_Deficiency_Did_Not_Directly_Affect_T-Cell_Differentiation_and_Proliferation_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In T-cell monoculture, no differences in Th1 and Th17 differentiation were detected between the Mas deficient and the WT group (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AVE 0991 (1 µM and 10 µM) also did not alter the differentiation from naive T cells to Th1 or Th17 cells (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Mas deficiency did not influence T-cell proliferation rates (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas_Deficiency_Exacerbated_the_Course_of_EAE_and_Increased_Macrophage_Infiltration__as_Well_as_Th1_Frequencies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with naive mice, mas expression was decreased in the spleen during the acute phase of EAE [day 10 post immunization (p.i.)]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  but significantly increased in the spinal cord (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the expression pattern of mas in the spinal cord returned to baseline levels during the early chronic phase of the disease (day 28 p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In active myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-EAE, Mas deficiency significantly aggravated the disease course (Fig 3C) (n = 7; **P less_than 0.01 on day 22 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; one of two representative experiments is shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both groups showed a comparable disease incidence and no mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a modified open field test, naive MasKO mice showed no alterations in locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior compared with WT mice, suggesting similar baseline conditions for the analysis of EAE symptoms (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunohistopathological analysis of the spinal cord (at day 22 p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  revealed increased CD3+ T-cell and Mac-3+ macrophage/microglia infiltration in MasKO mice compared with WT controls (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Mas deficiency resulted in increased demyelination and loss of axons in inflamed lesions as well as augmented neuronal loss in the spinal cord compared with WT controls, which explains the more severe clinical course of MOG-EAE in Mas-deficient mice (Fig S5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ex vivo phenotyping of the spleen and spinal cord of Mas-deficient mice during EAE showed increased CD11b+ antigen-presenting cell frequencies in the CNS but not in the spleen (n = 78) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, CD11b+ cells in the spinal cord of MasKO mice displayed significantly reduced levels of the M(IL-4+IL-13) markers CD14 and CD206 but no significant difference in the expression of the M(LPS+IFN) markers CD80 and CD86 (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found enhanced Th1 frequencies in the spleen as well as the spinal cord of MasKO mice compared with the WT group whereas the number of Th17 and Treg cells remained unchanged (n = 4) (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, recall assays on day 10 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  revealed an enhanced secretion of the proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines CCL2 and IL-6 by Mas-deficient splenocytes compared with WT cells (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas_Knockout_Enhanced_Proinflammatory_Gene_Expression_in_the_Spinal_Cord_and_Spleen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proinflammatory macrophage genes il6, il1b, tnfa, inos, and ccl2 were significantly higher expressed in the spinal cord of MOG-EAEdiseased MasKO mice compared with WT controls (Fig 4A), whereas in the spleen only the expression of il6, il1b, and ccl2 was enhanced (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the expression of some M(IL-4+IL-13)-like marker genes was decreased (e.g., fizz, slamf1) whereas the expression of others was increased in the spinal cord (Fig 4B) as well as in the spleen (Fig 4D) of Mas-deficient animals compared with WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas_Deficiency_Leads_to_Increased_Oxidative_Stress_and_Impaired_Endothelial_Function_in_ApoEKO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In ApoEKO mice, Mas deficiency led to increased endothelial dysfunction, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the underlying mechanism for impaired vascular function in Mas-deficient ApoEKO mice, we measured reactive oxidative stress in ApoEKO and ApoEKO/MasKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urinary 8-isoprostane and aortic nitrotyrosine expression levels were increased in ApoEKO/MasKO mice (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mas_Deficiency_Exaggerated_Atherosclerosis_by_Affecting_Macrophage_Infiltration__Migration__and_Cytokine_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 6 A and B, Mas deficiency leads to a significant exaggeration of atherosclerosis in the aortic arch region of ApoEKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mas deficiency led to enhanced macrophage infiltration within the atherosclerotic plaques of the aortic root (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the propensity to migrate was significantly increased in macrophages from ApoEKO/MasKO mice compared with ApoEKO mice, suggesting an important role of Mas in macrophage function in ApoEKO mice (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mas deficiency was associated with proinflammatory macrophage cytokine expression, such as il-6, inos, ccl2 and il12p40, in atherosclerotic aortas of ApoEKO mice (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokine levels in the plasma (Fig S6A) were not significantly affected by Mas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Mas deficiency did not influence the frequency of CD11c+, CD11b+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells measured in the spleen of ApoEKO mice (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we investigate potential effects of the Ang-(17)/Mas axis on macrophage function using MOG-EAE mice as a model of multiple sclerosis and hypercholesterinemic ApoEKO mice as a model of atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both animal models are characterized by macrophage-mediated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we show that Mas deficiency affects macrophage phenotypes and function, thereby aggravating the disease course in both settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At first glance, an autoimmune disease model like MOG-EAE and a cardiovascular disease model like atherosclerosis may not have much in common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data strikingly show that disruption of the alternative reninangiotensin system pathway at the receptor level similarly affects macrophage function and phenotype independently of the underlying phagocyte stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specifically, deletion of the receptor Mas enhances the migratory capacity and induces a proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages in MOG-EAE as well as ApoEKO mice, leading to an increased immune cell infiltration in the spinal cord or in atherosclerotic plaques, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, several studies have shown that deletion of ACE2, one of the key enzymes in Ang II degradation and a member of the alternative RAS pathway with its ACE2/Ang-(17)/Mas axis, results in increased vascular inflammation leading to a progression of atherosclerosis (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as ACE2 deficiency also leads to an accumulation of the proinflammatory metabolite Ang II, the role of the alternative pathway in the regulation of these effects was unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we definitely show that the Ang-(17)/Mas axis influences the inflammatory capacity of immune cells in two different, yet distinct, chronic inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, we specify the immune cell subset with a prevailing role of Mas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Mas is expressed on different cell types, Mas deficiency particularly affects CD11b+ macrophages in vitro and in vivo by interfering with cytokine expression and activation capacities of different macrophage subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well in line with our in vitro data, previous studies on the Ang-(17)/Mas axis in peritoneal macrophages also implied a role of Mas in cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, enhanced T-cell proliferation in in vitro coculture experiments with Mas-deficient macrophages may be explained by a lack of inhibitory Ang-(17) signaling, which is known to suppress T-cell proliferation (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect may be governed by a role of endogenous Mas in inhibiting M(LPS+IFN)-like polarization and proinflammatory cytokine expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work by Souza et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) showed that Mas-signaling pathways rather exert anti-inflammatory effects: Treatment with Ang-(17) led to decreased il6 and tnfa mRNA levels in peritoneal macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we extend these observations to in vivo models of macrophage dysfunction and show consistent data: Mas deficiency may drive proinflammatory M(LPS+IFN)-like responses and play a role in diminishing anti-inflammatory M(IL-4+IL-13)-like polarization in our animal models, in which the progression of the diseases is significantly characterized by macrophage-mediated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In EAE, Mas deficiency enhances the frequency of macrophages in the spinal cord, the presence of which in the CNS is crucial for the local activation of infiltrating T cells and, thus, the initiation and progression of the disease (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced Th1 frequencies found in the spinal cord of diseased Mas-deficient mice may be a downstream consequence of the increased CD11b+ cell infiltration because these macrophages actually produce higher levels of chemoattractants, allowing T cells to cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In models of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, an influence of the Ang-(17)/Mas axis on migration of CD11b+ monocytes has already been shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, chemokines and their receptors, such as CCL2 and CCR5, may play a crucial role (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the increase of antigen-presenting cell migration into atherosclerotic plaques as well as the enhanced plaque size, which we observed in our ApoEKO mouse model, may be mediated by an effect of Mas on chemokine expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well in line with this observation, Mas deficiency enhances the expression of the chemokine CCL2 in vitro and in vivo with NF-B as a key regulator (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our data support the concept of the Ang-(17)/Mas axis as anti-inflammatory pathway in different macrophage-mediated disease models in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signaling via Mas modulates the delicate balance between M(LPS+IFN)-like and M(IL-4+IL-13)-like macrophages, pushing it toward the M(IL-4+IL-13)-like phenotype, which is an important regulator controlling inflammation and autoimmunity (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the receptor Mas may be an interesting therapeutic target to treat autoimmune diseases via regulating inflammatory processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific activation of Mas, e.g., via agonists like AVE 0991, may impair macrophage migration through the BBB or in the vessel wall, thus limiting inflammation in the CNS or the vascular system (28, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT, MasKO (36), ApoEKO ,and ApoEKO/MasKO mice were backcrossed on a C57BL/6 background at least 10 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were obtained from an in-house breed at the local animal care facility of the University of Erlangen, the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine Berlin, or the University of Düsseldorf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed in accordance with the German laws for animal protection and were approved by both ethics committees of the University of Erlangen and University of Düsseldorf (AZ 542532.156/12 and AZ 8402.04.2012.A250).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

EAE mice were perfused with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and the spinal cord and spleen were removed and embedded in paraffin before sectioning in 5-m slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luxol Fast Blue staining was performed for evaluation of demyelination, Bielschowksy silver impregnation for axonal integrity/damage, and Nissl staining for motor neuron quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HE staining was used to analyze the extent of infiltrated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-m thick paraffin sections (CD3 1:500, Bio-Rad; Mac-3 1:500, BD Pharmingen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of axonal preservation, cellular infiltrates, and degree of demyelination was performed in a blinded fashion on nine independent spinal cord sections per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular infiltrate was quantified per square millimeter of white matter by overlaying a stereological grid onto sections and demyelinated areas semiautomatically by CellD Software (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nine visual fields of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord were used for quantification of axonal preservation counted on a 100-mm diameter grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_Splenic_and_Neuronal_Lymphocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spleen and spinal cord of mice were removed and disrupted with a 5-mL glass homogenizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was then filtered through a 100-m cell strainer followed by erythrocyte lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with cold DPBS, cells were labeled with fixable Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor450 (eBioscience) according to the manufacturers protocol to monitor proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, cells were applied to surface marker staining and flow cytometric analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FACS_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ex vivo-obtained CNS leukocytes and splenic lymphocytes as well as in vitro-generated cells were analyzed by staining for extra- and intracellular markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead cells were excluded by the fixable viability dyes eFluor780 or eFluor450 (0.2 L/test, eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific Fc-mediated interactions were blocked by addition of 0.5 L CD16/32 (93, eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For surface staining, cells were treated with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 30 min in PBS: CD3-BV421 (17A2, Biolegend), CD4-BV510 (RM4-5, Biolegend), CD8-PE (53-6.7, Biolegend), CD11b-PE/Cy7 (M1/70, Biolegend), CD11c-FITC (HL3, BD Biosciences), CD14-FITC (rmC5-3, BD Biosciences), CD25-APC (PC61.5, eBioscience), CD80-APC (16-10A1, Biolegend), CD86-PerCP/Cy5.5 (GL-1, Biolegend), CD206-PE (C068C2, Biolegend), and MHCII-BV510 (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated for 4 h with ionomycin (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) and PMA (50 ng/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of monensin (2 M, eBioscience), fixed with 1% PFA and made permeable by saponin buffer treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular cytokines were stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 3045 min: Foxp3-PE (FJK-16s, eBioscience), IFN-APC (XMG1.2, eBioscience), and IL-17A-PE (eBio17B7, eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probes were measured with a flow cytometer (FACSCantoII, BD Biosiences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR in cultured cells and tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA yield was quantified by absorbance measurements at 260 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA (5001,000 ng) was used per reaction to reversely transcribe RNA into cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR reactions were performed at a 5-µL scale with a qTower real-time PCR System (Analytik Jena).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative quantification was performed by the CT method, normalizing target gene expression on actb/-Actin or gapdh as housekeeping genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following TaqMan real-time PCR assays from Thermo Fisher Scientific were used: actb (-Actin) Mm00607939_s1, arg1 Mm00475988_m1, ccl2 Mm00441242_m1, chi3l3 (ym1) Mm00657889_mH, il1b Mm00434228_m1, il6 Mm99999064_m1, mas1 Mm00434823_s1, mgl2 Mm00460844_m1, mrc1 Mm00485148_m1, nos2 (inos) MM00440502_m1, retnla (fizz-1) Mm00445109_m1, slamf1 Mm00443316_m1, tnfa Mm00443258_m1, 18s Mm03926990_g1, il1r1 Mm00434237_m1, il12p40 Mm00434174_m1, il6 Mm00446190_m1, and gapdh 99999915_g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured cells were harvested in 1× Ripa lysis buffer [15 mM NaCl, 3.85 mM SDS, 5 mM Tris, 13.4 mM sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini and phosphatase inhibitor mixture PhosStop (Roche Diagnostics)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aortas were homogenized in 1% Triton lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration was determined with BC Assay Protein Quantitation Kit (Interchim).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mas protein was detected by using rabbit antiAng-(17) Mas receptor antibody (1:250, #AAR-013, Alomone Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse anti-Actin (1:1,000) was obtained from Abcam (ab8226).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488- conjugated and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000, Invitrogen) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For blotting of aortic nitrotyrosine, primary polyclonal rabbit anti-Nitrotyrosine (1:1,000, ab94883, Abcam) and rabbit anti-Actin (1:6,000, A5316, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound primary antibody was detected with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidize (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000, Dako).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody labeling was visualized by the addition of a chemiluminescence reagent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection was performed with a Fusion Capt Advance FX7 (PEQLAB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The control peptide antigen is the antigen used for the immunization of the rabbits to obtain the antigen-specific anti-Mas antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control antigen was used as a negative control to verify the specificity of the bands detected with the antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody was incubated, in parallel, with and without the antigen for 1 h and then applied to the membranes for parallel experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disappearance of the requested band verifies the specificity of the antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Atherosclerosis_and_Macrophage_Infiltration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, the aortic arch (from the aortic root to 3 mm distal of the left subclavian artery) was dissected from mice and incubated in 4% (wt/vol) PFA overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removal of the adventitia, the tissue was stained with red oil O histopathology staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the aorta was pinned carefully and photographed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photos were captured by a camera (camera body from Canon; camera lens from Carl Zeiss) under a microscope (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fiji ImageJ software (Fiji Version 2.0.0) was used to measure the atherosclerotic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify macrophage infiltration into atherosclerotic plaques, three 5-µm-thick paraffin-embedded sections of the aortic root at an interval of 30 µm were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophage accumulation was assessed with a rat anti-mouse antibody against F4/80 (Serotec; MCA497RT, clone C1:A3-1; 1:1,000) and a biotinylated secondary anti-rat antibody (Dianova; 112065-003; 1:1,000) that was HRP-conjugated (Dianova; 016030-084; 1:1,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pictures were taken at a 100-fold magnification, and quantification was performed using analysis software (ImageJ 1.37v software, NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
