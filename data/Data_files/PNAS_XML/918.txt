Spatial organization of a model 15-member human gut microbiota established in gnotobiotic mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial structure is postulated to have a powerful influence on establishing and sustaining the signaling and metabolic exchanges that define relationships among members of the gut microbiota and host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, information about gut community spatial structure is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous imaging of components of a 15-member model human gut bacterial community over a range of spatial scales in gnotobiotic mice revealed that the colon is better conceptualized as an incompletely mixed bioreactor, rather than having sharply stratified luminal and mucosal compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying host and microbial factors that constrain the ability of community members to establish sizeable single or oligotaxon agglomerations should yield new insights about how micro-scale mixing defines community function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knowledge of the spatial organization of the gut microbiota is important for understanding the physical and molecular interactions among its members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using (i) a model, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and (ii) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed at micrometer scales, with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing the experimental approaches described should allow direct tests of whether and how specified host and microbial factors influence the nature and functional contributions of microscale mixing to the dynamic operations of the microbiota in health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strategy_for_Imaging_the_Distribution_of_Microbes_in_the_Gnotobiotic_Colon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental design and workflow of our strategy are shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of 15 human gut-derived bacterial species (Table S1), and gut segments were fixed and embedded in a glycol methacrylate (GMA) resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GMA remained in place not only during sectioning but also during subsequent in situ hybridization and imaging steps, preserving the 3D structure of the gut contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportional representation of members of this community, whose genome sequences had been defined, was initially estimated by shotgun sequencing of DNA prepared from fecal samples (Table S2 for the results of Community Profiling by Sequencing; COPRO-Seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To construct a probe set that would provide information on the distribution of all 15 taxa simultaneously, we initially employed a combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging strategy where each taxon was labeled with a unique binary combination chosen from among six fluorophores (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that because of the high microbial density in the colon, adjacent bacterial cells frequently overlapped one another in the same pixel of the image, despite confocal optical sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overlap resulted in ambiguous combinations of binary signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we reverted to a strategy of labeling each microbe with a single fluorophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the distribution of each taxon, we hybridized some sections with mixtures of oligonucleotides targeting six or seven taxa individually (e.g., probe sets 1 and 2 in Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the distribution of the entire community, we used a mixture (probe set 3) comprising three sets of oligonucleotides: (i) six probes, each labeled with a different fluorophore, targeting six species (Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides caccae, Parabacteroides distasonis, Ruminococcus torques, Clostridium scindens, and Collinsella aerofaciens); (ii) four probes, all labeled with Alexa 488, targeting four moderately abundant members of Bacteroides (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis); and (iii) five probes, all labeled with Alexa 532, targeting five low abundance Firmicutes (Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium spiroforme, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus obeum, and Dorea longicatena) (Methods and Fig S1 for details of probe design and for validation of their taxon specificities).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we labeled all bacteria with the universal bacterial probe Eub338 conjugated to Alexa 514 and used DAPI to label host and bacterial DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some experiments, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which binds to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic acid, or an antibody to mouse colonic mucin (MCM) was included to localize mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we made use of endogenous autofluorescence to image food particles and host tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When gut samples are imaged at a resolution sufficient to distinguish individual microbial cells, the field of view is necessarily limited (100 × 100 m) and the depth of field is shallow (1 m), so that 10,000 cubic micrometers of material are visualized in a single image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of microbes in the small intestine has been reported to be 104 to 107 cells per mL of luminal contents, whereas in the colon and feces it is orders of magnitude greater (as much as 10111012 cells per g; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55 and 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This translates to 1,000 microbes per field of view in the colon and feces, but this number decreases 10,000- to 1 million-fold in the jejunum and ileum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FISH probe that reacted with all 15 members of the community (Eub338) confirmed that the distal small intestine of these gnotobiotic mice was sparsely colonized (Fig S2A), whereas the colon was densely colonized (Fig S2B; compare with the absence of microbes in the ileum and colon of germ-free controls in Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its significantly higher microbial density, we chose to focus our multiscale multiplex imaging analysis on the proximal colon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterizing_the_Distribution_of_Bacteria_in_the_Gut_Is_a_Multiscale_Problem  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantitatively evaluate the overall distribution of bacteria in the proximal colon, we tile-scanned five nearly complete cross-sections and a total of 372 microscopic fields from this region in two mice and represented the data as heat maps of bacterial cell abundance (Fig 1 for a summary of the approach).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by the universal Eub338 probe, bacteria were not distributed homogeneously across cross-sections; rather, they were concentrated at the border between the lumen and mucosa, as well as in patches in the interior of the lumen (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions of highest density contained 50 cells per 100 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantially lower densities occurred in the remainder of the lumen, consisting primarily of regions in and surrounding large autofluorescent particles that we interpret as remnants of food (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heat maps of the individual bacterial taxa showed a broadly similar pattern of distribution at the scale of tens to hundreds of micrometers (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity was evaluated quantitatively by line-scan analysis of transects running from the edge of the mucosa into the lumen (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these scans, the transects extended far enough into the lumen to determine the width of the high density microbial zone near the mucosa but not so far as to intersect patches of high luminal concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected for 245 transects, and abundances were expressed as the fraction of bacterial cells present in discrete segments of the transect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When averaged across the 245 transects, the abundance pattern for each taxon was similar, peaking close to the mucosa and then falling off sharply to a low level at distances greater than 75 m into the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We focused our analysis on four microhabitats: (i) densely colonized regions adjacent to the colonic mucosa, (ii) dense patches of microbes within the lumen of the colon, (iii) sparsely colonized areas within the lumen, and (iv) sparsely colonized crypts of Lieberkühn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the abundant taxa were detectable in each of these microhabitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some images, large autofluorescent particles of food pressed close to the mucosa so that the microbe-rich region was only 1020 µm thick (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other images show a wider, densely colonized region at the edge of the mucosa (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lumen contained densely colonized regions bordered by irregularly shaped autofluorescent food particles of variable size and brightness (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diverse microbial community was thinly arrayed on some of these particles and colonized the edges of cavities within them (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter observation is consistent with the notion that food particles can serve as platforms for attachment of bacterial taxa (including potential syntrophic partners).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crypts were colonized by a sparse, taxonomically mixed community (Fig 3D), suggesting that they were colonized from the lumen and did not serve as microhabitats for any select groups within the 15-member model human gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall composition of the microbial community differed only modestly from microhabitat to microhabitat within a cross-section when measured at a mesoscale (i.e., on the order of 100 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify these differences, we compared, from a single cross-section, 11 fields of view (each 152 × 152 µm) containing primarily the dense community and 12 fields containing almost exclusively the sparser, food particle-associated community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six Bacteroides species collectively dominated in all microhabitats; for example, B. cellulosilyticus made up 43 ± 4% (mean ± SD) of the cells in the densely colonized fields and 46 ± 4% in the sparsely colonized fields (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. aerofaciens was most abundant in the densely colonized areas, where it made up 11 ± 1% of bacteria cells versus 6 ± 2% within the sparsely colonized areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two members of Clostridia targeted with specific probes, C. scindens comprised 8 ± 24% of the community in both microhabitats, while R. torques made up 3 ± 1% in dense fields and 2 ± 1% in sparsely colonized regions of the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, modest differences in overall microbial community composition in mucus-rich and food-rich regions were detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summing FISH results across all of the sections yielded relative abundances that in many cases were comparable to results obtained from COPRO-Seq analysis of fecal DNA (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Communities observed at 10-µm scales consisted of a mixture of diverse species, with the relative proportions of species varying from region to region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autofluorescent particles we observed ranged in size from distinctively shaped objects several hundreds of micrometers long (Fig 2) down to small blobs only a few micrometers in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the larger objects were generally only thinly colonized, smaller particles were present in densely colonized patches, with the exception of some patches near the mucosa (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Analysis_of_Spatial_Organization_at_Micrometer_Scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether the spatial arrangement of microbes at micrometer scales differed relative to the visible landmarks of the epithelial border and large food particles, we carried out an analysis of spatial arrangement using the method of linear dipoles as implemented in DAIME (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear dipole analysis calculates a pair cross-correlation function for two categories of objects by estimating the probability, normalized to their density in the image, that the ends of a line segment of a given length will touch both of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Linear dipole analysis demonstrated a tendency of microbes to be in low abundance near crypts and invaginations in the mucosal epithelium (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is not surprising because these regions are generally occupied by a dense mucus layer resistant to bacterial penetration (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bordering this largely microbe-free zone there was dense colonization of microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For purposes of analysis, we marked this border of dense colonization with a hand-drawn line and calculated the spatial cross-correlation between the microbes and this line (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed a concentration of microbes within 30 µm of this line (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, and counterintuitively, microbes were underrepresented within 510 micrometers of large food particles (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this underrepresentation was due in part to a failure to detect the edges of food particles accurately, as food particles were detected by virtue of their endogenous fluorescence rather than by specific staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the images also give no visual evidence of any clustering of microbes close to these autofluorescent particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micrometer-Scale_Analysis_Reveals_Differences_in_the_Organization_of_Specific_Taxa_with_Respect_to_the_Mucosa_and_One_Another  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Turning from the distribution of bacteria overall to the distribution of individual taxa within the community, we detected an underrepresentation of R. torques in the dense community at the border between the mucosa and the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteroides were abundantly represented throughout this microbe-dense region, but R. torques exhibited marked scarcity in the region closest to the mucosa (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the distribution of taxa relative to the edge of the mucosa, we marked the limit of dense microbial colonization with a 1-m-thick line (Fig 5) and used linear dipole analysis to calculate the cross-correlation between each taxon and the line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of the line, rather than the mucosa itself, was necessary because of crypts and invaginations in the mucosa that resulted in variable distances between the epithelial border and microbial community, whereas the edge of microbial colonization itself was relatively smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results confirmed the visual observation that R. torques is frequently, although not universally, underrepresented in the microbial community positioned in the 5- to 10-m region closest to host cells (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in the distribution of individual taxa relative to one another were also evident at micrometer scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were divided into grid squares of 19 × 19 µm, and bacterial cells within each grid square were tallied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scatter plots comparing the abundance of pairs of taxa within these grid squares showed a linear regression with a positive slope (Fig S3), likely reflecting the presence of a mixed microbial community in regions of both high and low microbial abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the primary driver of correlations in abundances among taxa is simply the overall abundance of bacterial cells in any given 19 × 19 µm grid square.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, analyzing only densely populated grid squares (defined as those containing at least half the maximum number of bacterial cells) revealed differences in taxon distribution (Fig 6 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, abundance of the most prominent taxon, B. cellulosilyticus, was positively correlated with that of B. vulgatus but negatively correlated with R. torques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the possible explanations for these observed distributional differences are cooperative (attractive) versus competitive (repulsive) interactions between taxa, or an indirect effect of binding or proliferation of taxa in distinct microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate factors underlying differences in taxon density and distribution, we imaged the distribution of bacteria, mucus, and food in additional cross-sections using the Eub338 bacterial probe in conjunction with WGA and a mouse colonic mucin antibody (anti-MCM) to localize mucus (Fig 7 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, bacteria were detected in high abundance in regions of the lumen as well as close to the mucosa (Fig 7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGA and anti-MCM showed similar staining patterns to one another (Fig S5), and a qualitative inspection of the images revealed dense concentrations of mucus in regions corresponding to areas of high bacterial density, as well as in goblet cells (Fig 7 B and C and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large autofluorescent particles, by contrast, generally occupied regions in which bacteria were not abundant, although small autofluorescent particles were mixed with mucus and bacteria even in regions of highest bacterial density (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the notion that dense concentrations of mucus support high bacterial density, both in the loose mucus layer at the mucosal border and in the interior of the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the spatial arrangement of members of a defined artificial 15-member human gut microbiota in the proximal colon of gnotobiotic mice at macroscale, mesoscale, and micrometer scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a macrolevel scale of hundreds of micrometers, bacterial cell density was heterogeneous throughout the colon but was highest in regions rich in mucus, both in a layer near the epithelium and in patches in the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compositional patchiness was observed at a mesoscale (tens of micrometers), while at micrometer scales, each microhabitat was generally occupied by a complex community of microbes intermingled with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extensive mixing at micrometer scales, the absence of large microcolonies associated with the mucosa or food particles, and the broad similarity of luminal and mucosa-adjacent communities lead us to view the lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon not as stratified compartments but as components of a partially mixed bioreactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By bioreactor, we mean an environment constructed to harbor microbes and harness their metabolism of available nutrients, where the degree of spatial homogenization of community members is a manifestation of a complex dynamic involving many factors including flux of mucus and epithelial cells into the lumen, the affinities of community members for these host constituents and food particles, cooperative/competitive (attractive/repulsive) interactions between microorganisms, and peristaltic flow of bulk material through the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One might have expected a priori that differences between taxa in their binding affinities for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, would lead to localized clonal expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting communities would have spatial structure in the form of microcolonies and a distinctive community composition within the mucus layer compared with luminal contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the spatial distribution of both substrates and microbes suggests a dynamic model for the proximal colon in which mixing and dispersal by host factors tend to homogenize the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such mixing could also explain why large clusters with strongly distinctive taxonomic composition were not observed between the mucus layer and the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The turnover time for mucus is 6 h for mucus in goblet cells and as little as a single hour for the inner mucus layer in the distal colon (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replication time of two common gut symbionts, B. thetaiotaomicron and Escherichia coli, has been estimated at 3 h in the mucus layer and 38 h in colonic contents (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these and other gut bacterial taxa may carry out only a few rounds of cell division within the mucus layer before being shed along with mucus into the lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion to the epithelium could support persistence of microbes for a longer time, but epithelial cells are continuously discarded; with the exception of Paneth cells, the other three mouse gut epithelial lineages turn over every 35 d (6064).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbes in the lumen also have limited opportunity for replication before being expelled, as the contents of the gut traverse the mouse intestine in 46 h (6567).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that through rapid turnover and mixing of the mucus layer, the epithelium, and the gut contents as a whole, the mammalian host acts to diminish the ability of the microbiota to establish spatially segregated communities or sizeable single-taxon agglomerations both in the lumen and adjacent to the mucosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the physiology of the microbes themselves also fosters mixing is a question raised by the extensive micrometer-scale taxonomic intermingling in densely populated mucus-rich regions of our images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacteria comprising the artificial human gut microbiota characterized in this study are nonflagellated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion is unlikely to be a significant force within the viscous gel of the mucus layer (29), although there is little information about how foraging of mucus glycans by resident microbes affects mucus viscosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the means by which mixing is achieved, its effect is to diminish micrometer-scale spatial structure in the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The microbial assemblage we employed was simple enough so most of the abundant taxa could be simultaneously visualized with multilabel FISH and complex enough to permit a variety of possible taxontaxon interactions and spatial distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inevitably, our findings are dictated by the microbes that we chose to create this synthetic community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not know whether the consortium of 15 taxa studied display a spatial organization that is representative of the native mouse gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this low diversity consortium of human gut-derived bacterial strains is less likely to form spatially structured communities than the native mouse gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, members of a more complex community of human gut microbes, representing lineages from Bacteria and other domains of life (e.g., methanogenic archaeons and eukaryotes) could demonstrate more pronounced differences in their replication rates and stronger spatial associations with one another or with food particles, host cells, mucus, or other features of the gut habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed spatial arrangement differs dramatically from the highly ordered and more clustered arrangements visible in human dental plaque (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dissimilarities could reflect a number of factors including differences in flow rates in the two ecosystems and the absence of a surface in the gut to which microbes can stably adhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouth, continuous rapid flow of saliva ensures that adherence to a surface, either directly or indirectly via binding to other adherent microbes, is critical for remaining in the habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, chemical communication in salivary flow is most effective at distances on the order of micrometers (1) so precise positioning relative to metabolic partners is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deeper understanding of spatial relationships in the gut should be gained as methods are developed for quantifying the distribution of nutrients and metabolic products over different spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gnotobiotic animal models harboring defined consortia of microbes and fed diets of known composition and physical (e.g., particulate) properties represent a starting point for these types of studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, follow-up experiments in which gnotobiotic mice are fed purified dietary fibers of defined composition and size could provide an opportunity to identify taxa that exhibit reproducible patterns of cooccurrence or spatial association with the population of food particles represented in their colons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the relative effects of propulsive contractions, nonpropulsive mixing, and/or the rate of renewal of the mucus layer can be explored using gnotobiotic animals with mutations that affect their gut motility and/or the composition of their mucus (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genetic manipulations can also be applied to gnotobiotic zebrafish where the transparency of the organism can support in vivo imaging of microbial communities (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter feature avoids a potentially confounding variable; namely, that mesoscale and microscale spatial structure may be disrupted in unknown ways during the processing of gut tissues taken from euthanized animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting datasets should enable modeling both in silico and in ex vivo experimental bioreactors, including gut-on-a-chip systems (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these efforts should provide information about forces that promote or retard mixing at microscale levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Put another way, studies of microscale mixing provide an opportunity to determine how this parameter is related to the niches (jobs) of community members (both symbionts and pathogens), the expressed functional properties of a microbiota (including its resiliency to perturbations), and whether changes in this spatial feature are a reflection of, or causally related to, various types of dysbioses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collection_of_Samples_from_Gnotobiotic_Mice_and_Preparation_for_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments involving mice were performed using protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee of the Washington University School of Medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two 8-wk-old, male, germ-free C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with a 15-member bacterial consortium prepared and administered using procedures described in earlier reports (4, 54), and then maintained in a gnotobiotic isolator under a strict light cycle (lights on at 0600 hours and off at 1800 hours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two additional mice were gavaged with a two-member bacterial community composed of B. thetaioatomicron VPI-5482 and E. rectale ATCC 33656, and two control mice were maintained as germ-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were fed a sterilized, low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich chow (Product 7378000; B&K Universal) ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were killed 14 d after gavage of their bacterial consortium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distal fourth of the small intestine and the proximal third of the colon were snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These frozen segments were cut into 5- to 10-mm-long pieces, and molten 0.5% agarose was pipetted onto the two cut ends of each piece.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C, then washed, resubmerged in molten 0.5% agarose, dehydrated in acetone for 1 h, infiltrated with Technovit 8100 glycol methacrylate resin with several changes over 12 h at 4 °C, and were then transferred to embedding solution where they were allowed to solidify for 12 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embedded samples were sectioned with a Sorvall JB-4 microtome (Dupont Instruments) to 510 µm thickness and subjected to fluorescent labeling experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed paraformaldehyde rather than Carnoys fixative because paraformaldehyde is commonly used for microbial FISH (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our direct comparison of the two methods revealed similar preservation of mucus and other spatial landmarks in methacrylate-embedded colonic segments fixed with either Carnoys solution or paraformaldehyde (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Probe_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Candidate probes identified using the probe design function of the ARB software package (75) were further analyzed by calculating the overall free energy of hybridization (G0overall; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  76) for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A set of 16S rRNA-directed oligonucleotides was selected that were predicted to be taxon-specific at the same hybridization stringency (arbitrarily chosen to be 20% formamide).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probes were synthesized (Invitrogen) with a 5 fluorophore and their specificity evaluated by hybridization to pure cultures of target and nontarget bacterial strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FISH_Analysis_of_Colonic_Sections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FISH was carried out at 46 °C for 6 h in 0.9 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.01% SDS, 20% HiDi formamide (Applied Biosystems), and 2 µM of each probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then washed twice for 10 min each at 48 °C in wash buffer (0.215 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA), incubated in DAPI in PBS at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, washed in PBS, dehydrated through a series of ethanol washes [3 min each in 50%, 80%, and 96% (vol/vol) ethanol], mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P36934; Invitrogen) with a No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.5 coverslip, and placed in the dark at room temperature for at least 24 h before imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FISH on pure cultures was carried out in the same way, but without DAPI staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lectin_and_Mucin_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Labeling of methacrylate sections with WGA was carried out after the FISH hybridization and washing steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were incubated in 40 µg/mL WGA conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  W11261; Invitrogen) in PBS at room temperature for 15 min in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed briefly in PBS, dipped in distilled H2O, dehydrated through a series of ethanol washes and mounted as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides to be labeled with anti-mouse colonic mucin (anti-MCM, a gift of Dr. Ingrid B. Renes, Erasmus MC-Josephine Nefkens Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) were treated with blocking buffer (2% goat serum; 1% BSA; 0.2% Triton X-100; 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with anti-MCM diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer for 12 h at 4 °C, rinsed three times for 3 min each in PBS, incubated with blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A21070; Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1 h, rinsed three times for 3 min each in PBS, incubated with WGA, washed, and mounted as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Acquisition_and_Linear_Unmixing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectral image stacks were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with a QUASAR spectral detector and a Plan-Apochromat 63×, 1.4 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective lens or a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with a GaAsP spectral detector and a Plan-Apochromat 40×, 1.4 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation wavelengths of 633 nm, 594 nm, 561 nm, 514 nm, 488 nm, and 405 nm were employed sequentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear unmixing was carried out using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) or using a custom algorithm on the Mathematica platform (Wolfram Research) using the concatenated reference spectra shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the unmixing procedure and figure preparation are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_Arrangement_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images of each taxon were segmented in FIJI using the IsoData or RenyiEntropy global thresholding algorithm (77) and were then imported into DAIME version 2.1 for analysis of spatial arrangement using linear dipoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Linear_Unmixing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectral images were unmixed using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) or using a custom algorithm on the Mathematica platform (Wolfram Research) that permitted concatenation of spectral images sequentially acquired from the same field of view using six different excitation wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concatenation effectively made use of information about the excitation spectrum as well as the emission spectrum of each fluorophore (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images from probe sets 1 and 2 were unmixed using ZEN, and images from probe set 3 were unmixed using Mathematica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference spectra for the Mathematica unmixing consisted of nine FISH probe-conferred spectra, two autofluorescence spectra from food particles, one autofluorescence spectrum from the host tissue, and a background spectrum from a position that was not occupied by any object.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image stacks from probe set 3 acquired with 594 nm excitation were also unmixed using ZEN with six reference spectra (for fluorophores Alexa 594, Alexa 647, and Alexa 660; an autofluorescence spectrum from a food particle; an autofluorescence spectrum from the host tissue; and a background spectrum from a position that was not occupied by any object) and the unmixed Alexa 660 image used in place of that unmixed on the Mathematica platform because of its better signal-to-noise ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acquisition_of_Reference_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For unmixing in ZEN of cells hybridized with probe sets 1 and 2, reference spectra were acquired from cells grown as monocultures and hybridized with taxon-specific probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on fluorescently labeled cells in spectral image stacks acquired with each excitation wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All autofluorescence and background spectra included in the reference spectral libraries were obtained from ROIs selected in experimental images of intestinal sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For unmixing in Mathematica of cells hybridized with probe set 3, reference spectra of FISH probe-targeted bacterial species were acquired using a pure culture of each taxon incubated with a mixture of all 15 target-specific FISH probes (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of the FISH probe-labeled bacterial strains were acquired using the same image acquisition conditions employed for intestinal sections, except that when cultured bacterial cells emitted significantly stronger fluorescent signals than their counterparts in intestinal sections, laser intensities were reduced for cultured cells without changing the relative intensities of the six lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference spectra were sampled from concatenated spectral image stacks of individual FISH probe-labeled bacterial cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An averaged spectrum from most or all cells in an image was recorded as a reference spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Binarization_and_Bacterial_Cell_Count  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectrally unmixed images were digitally segmented into binary images using the Bernsen local thresholding algorithm (79) in ImageJ (80) followed by the find maxima watershed algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles outside the size range of 2150 pixels were digitally removed from the segmented binary images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Segmented binary images were screened individually to ensure that the positions of the cells defined in the binary images reflected bacterial cells visible in presegmentation images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For automated cell counting in Mathematica, segmented images were divided into an 8 × 8 grid, and objects in each grid square were counted; the dimensions of each grid square were 19 m × 19 m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pseudocolored_Images_for_Visual_Inspection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For multicolor FISH image presentation, the image from each unmixed fluorophore channel was assigned a pseudocolor, and then images of each FOV showing different bacterial groups and autofluorescence were merged and brightness and contrast adjusted for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of autofluorescent food particles shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 B and D, 4, and 7 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S4 are from single unmixed autofluorescence images; those in Fig 3 A and C are an average intensity projection of three autofluorescence images corresponding to three different reference spectra read from food particles in images acquired with 405-nm excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A median filter, radius two pixels, was applied to the unmixed Alexa 405 image in Fig 3 A and C for noise reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
