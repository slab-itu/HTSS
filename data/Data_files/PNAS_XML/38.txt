Determinants of spontaneous mutation in the bacterium Escherichia coli as revealed by whole-genome sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because genetic variation underlies evolution, a complete understanding of evolutionary processes requires identifying and characterizing the forces determining the stability of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mutation accumulation and whole-genome sequencing, we found that spontaneous mutation rates in three widely diverged Escherichia coli strains are nearly identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the importance of DNA damage in driving mutation rates, we investigated 11 strains, each defective for a major DNA repair pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking result was that only loss of the ability to repair or prevent oxidative DNA damage significantly impacted mutation rates and spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that, with the exception of those that defend against oxidative damage, DNA repair pathways may exist primarily to defend against DNA damage induced by exogenous agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A complete understanding of evolutionary processes requires that factors determining spontaneous mutation rates and spectra be identified and characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mutation accumulation followed by whole-genome sequencing, we found that the mutation rates of three widely diverged commensal Escherichia coli strains differ only by about 50%, suggesting that a rate of 12 × 103 mutations per generation per genome is common for this bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four major forces are postulated to contribute to spontaneous mutations: intrinsic DNA polymerase errors, endogenously induced DNA damage, DNA damage caused by exogenous agents, and the activities of error-prone polymerases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the relative importance of these factors, we studied 11 strains, each defective for a major DNA repair pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking result was that only loss of the ability to prevent or repair oxidative DNA damage significantly impacted mutation rates or spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that, with the exception of oxidative damage, endogenously induced DNA damage does not perturb the overall accuracy of DNA replication in normally growing cells and that repair pathways may exist primarily to defend against exogenously induced DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thousands of mutations caused by oxidative damage recovered across the entire genome revealed strong local-sequence biases of these mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found that the identity of the 3 base can affect the mutability of a purine by oxidative damage by as much as eightfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutation_Rates__Spectra__and_Biases_of_Wild-Type_E_coli_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although E. coli has been a model organism for decades, estimates of its spontaneous mutation rate vary by more than an order of magnitude (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 and the references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study using MA/WGS, we found that the rate of spontaneous base-pair substitutions (BPSs) of E. coli K12 was 2 × 1010 mutations per nucleotide per generation (5), about a third of the rate expected based on results with reporter loci (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One goal of the current study was to determine if this mutation rate pertains only to K12 or is characteristic of other E. coli strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we performed MA/WGS with two relatively recently isolated human commensal E. coli strains, ED1a and IAI1, that are diverged from E. coli K12 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results for BPSs from all the MA/WGS experiments reported here are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BPS rates in ED1a and IAI1 did not differ significantly from each other but were each 50% higher than that of our wild-type K12 strain, PFM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these differences are significant (t = 4.6, 4.4, df = 22, 20, P = 1 × 104 and 3 × 104 for ED1a and IAI1, respectively), the rates nonetheless are within the same order of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined that the mutation rate of PFM2 when cultured on minimal glucose medium was nearly the same as when it was cultured on LB medium, which supplies mainly peptides as carbon and nitrogen sources (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spectra of the types of BPSs were comparable among the three strains (Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A shows the conditional mutation rates, i.e., the rates of each type of BPS relative to the numbers of A:T or G:C base pairs in each genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the mutation rates differ among the strains, it is more informative to look at the fractions of each type of BPS, again normalized to the number of A:T or G:C base pairs (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BPS spectra of all three strains were dominated by transitions, particularly G:C to A:T transitions, which is the expected spectrum based upon previous locus-specific and genome-wide experiments (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all three strains the ratio of BPSs in coding versus noncoding DNA was almost half of that expected from the ratio of coding versus noncoding DNA in the genomes (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations for each strain did not yield a ratio of BPSs in coding versus noncoding DNA as small as the observed ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result does not reflect selection against mutations in coding DNA; for each strain the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations did not differ significantly from the ratio obtained from simulations (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study we showed that the bias against coding DNA disappeared when MMR was defective, indicating that MMR preferentially repairs coding sequences (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The frequency of mutations in PFM2 grown on LB is biased by neighboring nucleotides; in particular, transitions at A:T base pairs in the context 5ApC3/3TpG5 occur twice as often as would be expected from the frequency of this dimer in the genome (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Here and throughout this paper the mutated base is underlined and in bold-face type.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ED1a and IAI1 also showed this bias, but for IAI1 the bias was not significant at the P  0.05 level (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three strains growing on LB also showed a strong DNA strand bias: G:C to A:T transitions were twice as likely to occur with C templating the lagging strand and G templating the leading strand rather than vice-versa (Table S3) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, culturing PFM2 on minimal glucose medium eliminated the sequence bias and diminished the strand bias (Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA cytosine methyltransferase (Dcm) transfers a methyl group to the 5 position of the internal Cs in CCWGG sequences; because 5-meC is prone to deamination, creating T, CCWGG sequences are hotspots for G:C to A:T transitions (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reproduce this finding for PFM2 (cultured in LB and in minimal medium) and ED1a but not IAI1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three genomes 2% of the total G:C base pairs occur at the internal position of CCWGG sites, but these base pairs accounted for 14% (12/86) of the G:C transitions when PFM2 was grown on LB, 6% (8/128) when PFM2 was grown on minimal medium, and 6% (12/194) in ED1a; these values are significantly greater than expected (2 = 53; P  0; 2 = 9, P = 0.003; and 2 = 15, P = 0.0001, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in IAI1 only 4% (6/162) of the G:C transitions occurred at CCWGG sites, a value not significantly different from that expected (2 = 1.4, P = 0.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) transfers a methyl group to the 6 position of As in GATC sequences; GATC sequences are hotspots for A:T transversions (5), presumably because 6-meA depurinates, and depurinated sites produce transversions (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three genomes 3% of the total A:T base pairs occur in GATC sites, but these base pairs accounted for 24% (12/62) of the A:T transversions when PFM2 was grown on LB, 10% (5/53) when PFM2 was cultured on minimal medium, and 16% (14/87) in IAI1; these values are significantly greater than expected (2 = 43, P  0; 2 = 4, P = 0.05; and 2 = 39, P  0, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no preference for A:T transversions to occur at GATC sites in ED1a (3/71 observed, 2/71 expected, 2 = 0.02, P = 0.88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That G:C base pairs in CCWGG sites were not significant hotspots in IAI1, and A:T base pairs in GATC sites were not significant hotspots in ED1a, but both were hotspots in PFM2, suggests that methylase activities among these strains differ even though both Dcm and Dam are encoded in all three genomes (www.kegg.jp/kegg/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In almost all the experimental strains in this report small indels (4 bp) occurred at about 1/10th the rate as BPSs and more frequently were losses rather than gains of base pairs (Tables 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discovered many years ago (14), indels occurred predominantly in mononucleotide runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth on minimal glucose medium appeared to decrease the indel mutation rate, particularly of 1-bp events; however, because there were so few indels, few statistically significant conclusions can be drawn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcription can impact mutation rates in several ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ssDNA is exposed during transcription and is more vulnerable to damage than dsDNA, high rates of transcription can be mutagenic (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed DNA strand, should lower mutation rates in transcribed genes (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Head-on collisions between replication and transcription destabilize the replication machinery and can lead to mutations (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study of E. coli K12 strain PFM2, we found no evidence that transcription affected the frequency of mutations (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This negative result was reproduced here with IAI1, ED1a, and PFM2 growing in minimal medium and with all the experimental strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no statistically significant bias for mutations to occur in highly transcribed genes or in genes oriented so that transcription is in the direction opposite the direction of replication (even among highly transcribed genes), nor was there a bias for any specific base change to occur on the transcribed versus the nontranscribed strand (Tables S4S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using different methods to analyze our published data, Chen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) found a small (1730%) increase in mutation frequencies in highly expressed genes, but this increase was significant only in an MMR-defective strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impact_of_DNA_Repair_Pathways_on_Spontaneous_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second goal of this study was to determine if, in normally growing cells, loss of a given DNA repair pathway would change the mutation rate or the mutational spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, it could be concluded that the repair pathway in question is important in preventing the mutations that arise from DNA damage induced by endogenous activities or by ubiquitous exogenous agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our choice of which DNA repair pathways to investigate was based on previous reports that their loss had mutational consequences (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that in this report we have not included two major mutation-avoidance pathways, proofreading during DNA replication and removal of uracil from the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported the effects of inactivating the DNA MMR pathway (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequence_Context_of_8-OxoG_Mutagenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiments revealed that the local sequence context strongly influences the frequency of mutations caused by 8-oxoG (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mutT mutant strain, 50% of the A:T to C:G mutations occurred in the sequence 5ApA3/3TpT5, although, based on the frequency of that dimer pair in the genome, the expected percentage was only 30%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only 10% of the A:T to C:G mutations occurred in the context 5ApC3/3TpG5, although the expected percentage was 22%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was an eightfold difference in mutagenic potential between the triplet that was most permissive, 5GpApA3/3TpTpC5, and the triplet that was most restrictive, 5CpApC3/3GpTpG5 (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, A:T to C:G transversions in the mutT mutant strain were not DNA-strand biased, occurring equally often with A templating the leading strand as with A templating the lagging strand (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both the mutY and mutM mutY mutant strains 45% of the G:C to T:A mutations occurred in the context 5GpC3/3CpG5, although the expected percentage was only 33% (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The context 5GpT3/3CpA5 was inhibitory; only 9% (mutY) and 5% (mutM mutY) of the G:C to T:A transversions occurred in this context, although the expected percentage was 22% (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most permissive triplet was 5ApGpC3/3TpCpG5, and the most stringent triplets were 5TpGpT3/3ApCpA5 (mutY) and 5ApGpT3/3TpCpA5 (mutM mutY), again accounting for an eightfold difference in mutagenic potential in the mutM mutY strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to G:C to T:A transversions, G:C to C:G transversions in the mutM mutY mutant strain were biased by the 5 base: of the 21 G:C to C:G transversions, 16 occurred in the context 5GpG3/3CpC5, although only five were expected ( 2 = 12, P = 7 × 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, 5GpG3/3CpC5 was identified in an mutM mutant strain as a hotspot for G:C to C:G transversions induced by the oxidizing agent menadione (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G:C to T:A transversions in mutY and mutM mutY mutant strains were not strand biased (Table S3), but G:C to C:G transversions in the mutM mutY mutant strain were  30% more likely to occur with G templating the leading strand than with G templating the lagging strand (16/21 observed vs. 10/21 expected; 2 = 3.4, P = 0.06).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The local sequence context could affect the probability of a base being damaged or repaired, of errors occurring during replication, of mismatches being corrected, and/or of polymerase extending DNA synthesis from a mismatched base pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We briefly discuss the influence of sequence context on replication errors below; a more extensive discussion that includes other factors is given in SI Discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the mutT mutant strain A:T to C:G mutations occur when 8-oxoG is inserted opposite A in the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that DNA polymerase makes this insertion most readily if it has just inserted a T opposite a template A and least readily if it has just inserted a G opposite a template C. A simple explanation for this bias is that the weaker T:A base pair permits the incoming 8-oxoG to approach in the syn orientation, allowing it to base pair with A (56), whereas the stronger G:C base pair inhibits this orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mutY and mutM mutY mutant strains, G:C to T:A transversions occur when A is inserted opposite 8-oxoG in the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutational bias observed suggests that DNA polymerase is more likely to insert an A opposite 8-oxoG if it has just inserted a G opposite a template C than if it has just inserted an A opposite a template T. A simple explanation is that template 8-oxoG may be more likely to swing into the syn orientation, or to be stably maintained in that orientation, if the 3 base pair is the strong C:G rather than the weak T:A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data also indicate that base-stacking must play a role in potentiating or preventing mutations, because the 3 base had little influence when it was the complement of those indicated above (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_the_Results_from_MA_WGS_Analyses_and_Previous_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned above, the DNA repair pathways investigated in this report were chosen from published reports that their loss resulted in changes in spontaneous mutation rates or spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, with the exception of DNA repair activities dealing with oxidative damage, our results did not reproduce these previous findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In retrospect, this result is not surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most investigations of mutational processes have relied on reporter genes for mutational readout, and these reporter genes may not be representative of the genome as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, reporter genes may enter into use because they are highly mutable or responsive to particular types of DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although special sequences can reveal relatively rare but important mutational processes, such as hotspots, amplifications, complex multiple mutations, and aberrant recombination, such events at these loci may not contribute detectibly to the mutational load when the whole genome is the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the MA/WGS method may be blind to some mutational events, our results confirm previous conclusions (1) that the most significant threat to genomic integrity overall is DNA damage by reactive oxygen species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies of mutational accumulation in E. coli have resulted in the following four conclusions about the determinants of spontaneous mutation:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bacterial strains used in this study and their methods of construction are given in Table S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligonucleotides used to perform and confirm genetic manipulations are listed in Table S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MA_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MA lines originated from single colonies of a founder and were propagated through single-colony bottlenecks daily as described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_Generations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of generations that each MA line experienced was estimated from colony size as previously described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean of these values for each strain is reported in Table 1 and was used to calculate mutation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_DNA_Purification__Library_Construction__and_WGS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was purified using the PureLink Genomic DNA purification kit (Invitrogen Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were constructed either by the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) or by the Indiana University Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing was performed either by BGI using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform or by the University of New Hampshire Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS) using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNP_and_Short_Indel_Calling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Procedures for SNP and indel calling were as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli K12 strain MG1655 [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference sequence NC_000913.2] was used as the reference genome sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences and mutations reported in this paper have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRP013707) and in the IUScholarWorks Repository (URI hdl.handle.net/2022/20340).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutation_Annotation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Variants were annotated using custom scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein-coding gene coordinates were obtained from the GenBank page of reference sequence NC_000913.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPSs in coding sequences were determined to be synonymous or nonsynonymous based on the genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonsynonymous BPSs were designated conservative or nonconservative based on the Blosum62 matrix (69) with a value 0 considered conservative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monte_Carlo_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each strain a random distribution of BPSs corresponding to the observed mutational spectra was simulated using a custom script; the number of mutations was fixed at the observed numbers, and 1,000 trials were simulated (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Standard statistical analyses were used (70, 71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confidence limits (CLs) on the overall rates of BPS and indels were calculated from the mean and variance of the mutations per MA line for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLs for the different types of mutations were calculated from the mean and variance of 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations for each strain; P values based on these calculations are indicated in the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial_Strains_and_Media  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Culture medium for rich conditions was Miller Luria Broth (LB) (Difco; BD), liquid or agar plates, and for minimal conditions was VogelBonner minimal (VB min) 0.2% glucose (72) liquid or agar plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: carbenicillin, 100 µg/mL; kanamycin (Kn), 50 µg/mL; chloramphenicol, 10 µg/mL; nalidixic acid (Nal), 40 µg/mL; rifampicin (Rif), 100 µg/mL; and anhydrotetracycline, 500 µg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wild-type E. coli strains ED1a and IAI1 were obtained from E. Denamur (University of Paris Diderot, Paris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ED1a was originally isolated in the 2000s and is in the B2 phylogenetic group of E. coli; IAI1 was originally isolated in the 1980s and is in the B1 phylogenetic group of E. coli (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type E. coli K12 strain PFM2 (5) is a prototrophic derivative of the reference strain MG1655 (73, 74), which is a descendent of an E. coli K12 strain isolated in 1922 (75) and is in the A phylogenetic group of E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our laboratory strain of MG1655, which was obtained from R. Maurer (76), has the same sequence differences from MG1655(Seq) as the MG1655 isolate deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC47076 (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, PFM2 and its derivatives do not have the point mutations in gatC and glp, or the insertion sequence (IS) element insertions in crl and oppA-ychE that recently were found in MG1655 (Seq) (77) and were incorporated into the reference sequence NCBI NC_000913.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason we continue to use NCBI NC_000913.2 as our reference genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our strains do not have an IS element insertion at the flhDC promoter found in many MG1655 isolates (78) but do have an extra insertion of IS186 approximately at nucleotide 1877858.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mutant E. coli K12 strains used in this study are derivatives of PFM2 and are described in Table S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene deletions were designed to have little or no effect on downstream genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the gene deletions were moved into PFM2 and derivatives from the Keio collection of indel mutants (79) by P1vir phage transduction (72); the KnR element was then removed by flippase (FLP) recombination (80) leaving an in-frame scar sequence that encodes a 34-aa peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove an entire operon (e.g., umuDC), recombineering was used to generate a similar nonpolar deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several strains with multiple deletions were generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two strains, PFM22 and PFM40, both deletions were derived from the Keio collection and thus have the same scar sequence; before sequencing, all MA lines derived from these strains were analyzed by PCR to ensure that recombination had not occurred between the scars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other second or third deletions were generated by scarless recombineering using either I-SceI endonuclease activity (81) or sucrose toxicity (82) for counterselection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make a KnRI-SceI site cassette, we linearized pKD13 (80) with AfeI and ligated it to a 39-bp double-stranded oligo containing the I-SceI endonuclease recognition site (5-GATCCTATATTACCCTGTTATCCCTAGCGTAACTAAGCT-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method used to construct each strain is given in Table S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene deletions were confirmed either by PCR and sequencing or by phenotype (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the deletion oligos and PCR primers are given in Table S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The scarless deletions of the various genes are as follows: ada retains the first three and the last three codons; mutM retains the first and last seven codons; dinB retains the first two and the last seven codons; xthA retains the first and the last 26 codons, thus retaining the ydjXp5 promotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polB deletion was designed to retain the hepAp2 promoter in the polB coding sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First the entire polB coding sequence in PFM101 was replaced with a KnRI-SceI cassette amplified from an in-housemodified pKD13 (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cassette was replaced with a 508-bp fragment of polB consisting of the sequence for the first 12 N-terminal codons with engineered stop codons at the eighth and 12th positions followed by the 75 C-terminal codons; the intervening codons are deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fragment was generated by overlap extension PCR (83) with primers polB del and polBseq reverse using PFM2 gDNA as template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial fragment was extended upstream of the polB gene with primer polBseq forward, generating the deletion fragment that replaced the KnRI-SceI cassette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phenotypic_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for UV sensitivity, cells from overnight liquid cultures were streaked onto an LB agar plate and were exposed to UV light in 10-s intervals; PFM35 (uvrA) was seven times more sensitive than PFM2 to UV exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity to methylating, alkylating, and oxidizing agents was tested using LB gradient plates or by radially streaking cells on an LB agar plate with a central filter disk on which the agent was spotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gradient plates, a maximum concentration of 8.8 mM methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or 0.0013% tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used; for streak tests, 70 L of 300 mM N-methyl-N-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or 70 L of 1.17 M (10%) MMS was used (chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich Co.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PFM40 (alkA tag) was more sensitive to MMS than was either single-deletion mutant or PFM2; PFM88 (ada ogt) was more sensitive to MMS and to MNNG than was either single-deletion mutant or PFM2; PFM180 (xth nfo) was more sensitive to TBHP and to MMS than was either single-deletion mutant or PFM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_Mutation_Rates_by_Fluctuation_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutation rates to NalR or RifR were estimated using fluctuation tests as described (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation rate was calculated using the MaSandriSarkar maximum likelihood method (85) implemented by the FALCOR web tool found at www.mitochondria.org/protocols/FALCOR.html (86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MA_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MA lines originated from single colonies isolated on agar plates from a founder (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For early experiments, (with PFM61, PFM94, PFM6, PFM91, PFM35, PFM40, PFM88, PFM22), founders were generated by inoculating a LB broth culture from freezer stocks, growing overnight, and plating an appropriate dilution on LB agar plates (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experiment on minimal medium (PFM2m), VB min was used instead of LB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For later experiments (with IAI, ED1a, PFM166, PFM180, PFM101, PFM133, and PFM166), an inoculum from the freezer stock was streaked onto a LB agar plate and incubated overnight; one well-isolated colony was excised from the agar plate, soaked for 30 min in 0.85% NaCl + 0.01% gelatin, and vortexed for 60 s. Appropriate dilutions then were plated onto LB agar plates to obtain well-isolated colonies to start the MA lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsequently each MA line was streaked for single colonies each day on a LB agar plate at 37 °C as described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PFM2m experiment, cells were streaked on VB min agar plates; because cells grow more slowly on minimal medium, these plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 d. After passage, plates were stored at 4 °C for 2 d. If a well-isolated colony was not available for streaking on a particular day, a new streak was made from the same colony on the stored plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of daily passages required for each MA experiment was determined from the mutation rate estimated by fluctuation analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For two strains, PFM35 and PFM40, we underestimated the true mutation rate and stopped the experiment too soon; these lines then were streaked from the frozen stocks made after the last passage, and the experiment continued (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 for a further discussion of this procedure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_Generations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of generations between passages was estimated from the diameter of the colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cells in colonies of different diameters was determined for each of the MA experiments independently using the method previously described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of generations that gave rise to a colony of a given diameter is the log2 of the number of cells in the colony, which usually was approximately 28 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the experiment daily colony diameters were converted to generations for each line; the mean of these values is reported in Table 1 and was used to calculate mutation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_DNA_Preparation__Library_Construction__and_WGS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was purified using the PureLink GenomicDNA purification kit (Invitrogen) from 0.75 mL of overnight LB cultures inoculated from the freezer stocks made after the last passage of each MA line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA concentration and purity were assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) or an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When MA experiments were run concurrently, we confirmed the identity of the lines with diagnostic PCR on the gDNA before library construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gene-deletion strains the presence of the deletion was checked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type strains ED1a, IAI1, and PFM2 were confirmed by PCR of three regions that had different lengths in the three backgrounds: the primer pair aslB forward and hemY reverse gave products of 2.7 kb in PFM2, 1.2 kb in IAI1, and 1.7 kb in ED1a; the primer pair parC forward and vgiB reverse gave products of 3.2 kb in PFM2, 1 kb in IAI1, and 2.3 kb in ED1a; and, the primer pair yeiI forward and rihB reverse gave products of 2.7 kb in PFM2, 2.6 kb in IAI1, and 1.5 kb in ED1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Libraries for PFM6, PFM22, PFM35, PFM40, PFM61, PFM88, PFM91, and PFM94 were made by the BGI and were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries for PFM2m were made by the Indiana University CGB and were sequenced by BGI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries for ED1a, IAI1, PFM101, PFM133, and PFM180 were made by the Indiana University CGB and were sequenced at the University of New Hampshire HCGS using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For quality-control purposes, reads with any one of the following characteristics were discarded: (i) 10% unreadable bases; (ii) 20% low-quality (Q20) bases; (iii) adapter contamination (15-bp overlap allowing up to 3-bp mismatch); (iv) duplicate read-pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After such filtering, 100130 × (460598 Mbp) of paired-end reads (2 × 90 bp), and 5578 × (253359 Mbp) of paired-end reads (2 × 101 bp) per MA line were retained for lines sequenced by BGI and HCGS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNP_and_Short_Indel_Calling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Procedures for SNP and indel calling were as described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli K12 strain MG1655 (NCBI reference sequence NC_000913.2) was used as the reference genome sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina reads were aligned to the reference with the BurrowsWheeler short-read alignment tool, BWA version 0.7.9 (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short indels (4 bp) were called based on the read mapping of the SNP calling procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences and mutations reported in this paper have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRP013707) and in the IUScholarWorks Repository (URI: hdl.handle.net/2022/20340).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some MA lines were eliminated because of poor sequence coverage (less_than30×).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some MA lines carried shared mutations, which arise from mutations that occur during the initial growth of the founder or from cross-contamination during streaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous analysis of the PFM2 dataset (5), we eliminated any MA line that had shared mutations, but for the analyses reported here we retained such lines and assigned the shared mutations to one of them according to the deduced lineage, if possible, or randomly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only MA lines with irreconcilable conflicts or with no unique BPS were eliminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalyzing the PFM2 data by these criteria resulted in two additional MA lines, six BPSs, and three indels (Tables 1, 4, and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net result compared with the previously reported rates (5) is a 5% decrease in the rate for BPSs and, because there are few indels, a 62% increase in the rate for indels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent paper (13) the PFM2 sequence reads reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 were reanalyzed, and an additional 15 BPSs and seven indels (4 nt) were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had eliminated seven of the BPSs because they did not meet our sequence coverage criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining eight BPSs identified by Barrick et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13) were each shared among two MA lines and had been eliminated in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5; these four unique BPSs are now included in the six additional BPSs in the reanalyzed PFM2 dataset (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seven indels identified in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 also were shared; five MA lines shared one indel, and two MA lines shared the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two unique indels have been added to the PFM2 dataset in Tables 4 and 5, as has one indel that had been mistakenly eliminated as shared but was unique: one line had a +C mutation, whereas the other lines had a C mutation at the same site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Standard statistical analyses were used (70, 71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLs on the overall rates of BPS and indels were calculated from the mean and variance of the mutations per MA line for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each strain had a different number of generations and lines, plus different genome sizes for ED1a and IAI1, we used these final mutation rates and variances multiplied by 1010 in t tests to evaluate differences in mutation rates statistically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each strain the df was calculated as the number of unique values in the mutations per MA line; the df for comparing two strains was the sum of the two dfs minus 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For strains with high rates of specific mutations (PFM22, PFM61, PFM6, and PFM94), statistical comparisons could be made using the mean and variance of the mutations per MA line for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For strains with low numbers of the different types of mutations, CLs were calculated from the variance of the 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations described in Materials and Methods; P values based on these calculations are indicated in the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where applicable the BenjaminiHochberg procedure (88) with the false-discovery rate set at 0.5% or 1.0% was applied to evaluate multiple comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiments revealed that mutations caused by 8-oxoG are strongly sequence dependent (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mutT mutant strain, A:T to C:G transversions were three- to fourfold more likely to occur if an A rather than a C was 3 to the mutated A, whereas in the mutY and mutM mutY mutant strains, G:C to T:A transversions were three- to eightfold more likely to occur if a C rather than a T was 3 to the mutated G (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local sequence could affect the probability of initial damage, of subsequent repair, of errors occurring during replication, and/or of polymerase extending from the mismatched base pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss some of these possibilities below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because MutT prevents the insertion of 8-oxoG into the DNA, the sequence bias seen in the mutT mutant strain cannot be caused by different susceptibilities to damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, because MutM and MutY act on DNA containing 8-oxoG, sequence-specific susceptibility of guanines to oxidation could be important in determining their mutagenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local sequence contexts have been shown to influence the extent of oxidation of guanines in vitro, but the results are not consistent and do not correlate well with our mutation results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NpGpT triplets had low oxidation potential in vitro and also were poorly mutated in our experiments, our most mutated triplets, NpGpC, were reported to be both relatively unreactive (89, 90) and highly reactive (91, 92), depending on the oxidizing agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence bias could reflect differential targeting by DNA repair enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mutT mutant strains MutM activity decreases the frequency of A:T to C:G transversions (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the observed sequence biases in the mutT mutant strain were caused by the activity of MutM, the sequence 5Tp(8-oxoG)3 should be a poor substrate, and 5Gp(8-oxoG)3 should be a good substrate for MutM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in an in vitro study, 5Gp(8-oxoG)3 was a poor substrate for MutM (93); in contrast, a more recent study concluded that MutM efficiently repairs 8-oxoG with a 5 C, T, or G (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these in vitro results do not support the hypothesis that the sequence specificity we found in the mutT mutant strain was caused by MutM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of sequence context on MutY activity, which should increase the frequency of A:T to C:G transversions (57), appears not to be well studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the sequence biases reflect the potential for replication errors, the results from the mutT mutant strain suggest that, in general, DNA polymerase inserts 8-oxoG opposite template A three to four times more frequently if it has just inserted a T opposite a template A than if it has just inserted a G opposite a template C. The simplest explanation for this bias is that the weak T:A base pair allows the incoming 8-oxoG to approach in the syn orientation, allowing it to base pair with A (56), whereas the strong G:C base pair inhibits this orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, stacking interactions with the 8-oxoG must play a role, because T or G 3 to the mutated A did not have such strong effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stacking interactions that would be most informative are the incoming configurations 5Tp(8-oxoG)3 and 5Gp(8-oxoG)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a structural study of dinucleotides, 5 purines were shown to be well stacked and 5 pyrimidines poorly stacked with 8-oxoG, suggesting that a 5 pyrimidine provides the 8-oxoG with flexibility (94); however, in this study there was little difference between the two purines or the two pyrimidines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mutY and mutM mutY mutant strains, G:C to T:A transversions occur with 8-oxoG in the template, so if the mutations are caused by replication errors, the mutational bias observed suggests that DNA polymerase is, in general, three to five times more likely to insert an A opposite 8-oxoG if it has just inserted a G opposite template C than if it has just inserted an A opposite template T. A simple explanation is that template 8-oxoG may be more likely to swing into the syn orientation or to be stably maintained in that orientation if the 3 base pair is the strong C:G rather than the weak T:A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In confirmation, the crystal structure of DNA Pol I with template 8-oxoG suggests that a rigid template favors the syn orientation of 8-oxoG (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, however, our data indicate that base stacking must play a role, because G or A 3 to the mutated G did not have strong effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, a third determinant of mutagenic potential is the ability of the mutagenic mispair to escape proofreading and be extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study provided strong evidence that E. colis replicase, DNA polymerase III (Pol III), is responsible for inserting 8-oxoG opposite template A in a mutT mutant strain and that Pol III is poor both in correcting the resulting 8-oxoG:A mismatch and in extending from it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the alternative polymerases, particularly Pol I and Pol IV, are likely to be responsible for extension from the mismatch (96).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain the sequence bias of the A:T to C:G transversions in the mutT mutant strain, 5Tp(8-oxoG)3 paired with template 3ApA5 should be well preserved and extended; in contrast, to explain the sequence bias of G:C to T:A transversions in the mutM and mutM mutY mutant strains, the same dimer in the opposite orientation, 5ApA3 paired with template 3Tp(8-oxoG)5, should be poorly preserved and extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolution of this conundrum awaits further studies of the how the alternative polymerases interact and extend from these sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
