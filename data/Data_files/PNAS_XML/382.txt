Early emerging system for reasoning about the social nature of food  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Food choice can serve as a social shibboleth, whereby information about what an individual eats affords insight into her cultural background and social relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence for an early-emerging system linking food preferences to social identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants expect people to share food preferences, unless those people belong to different groups, suggesting human reasoning about food preferences is fundamentally social.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, infants generalize disgust toward a food even across people who belong to different groups, suggesting that infants are particularly vigilant to social information that might signal danger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This research opens new lines of investigation regarding infant social cognition and food selection across the lifespan, and has implications for social policy surrounding nutrition, heath, and obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selecting appropriate foods is a complex and evolutionarily ancient problem, yet past studies have revealed little evidence of adaptations present in infancy that support sophisticated reasoning about perceptual properties of food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that humans have an early-emerging system for reasoning about the social nature of food selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, infants reasoning about food choice is tied to their thinking about agents intentions and social relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas infants do not expect people to like the same objects, infants view food preferences as meaningfully shared across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants reasoning about food preferences is fundamentally social: They generalize food preferences across individuals who affiliate, or who speak a common language, but not across individuals who socially disengage or who speak different languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, infants reasoning about food preferences is flexibly calibrated to their own experiences: Tests of bilingual babies reveal that an infants sociolinguistic background influences whether she will constrain her generalization of food preferences to people who speak the same language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, infants systems for reasoning about food is differentially responsive to positive and negative information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants generalize information about food disgust across all people, regardless of those peoples social identities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas food preferences are seen as embedded within social groups, disgust is interpreted as socially universal, which could help infants avoid potentially dangerous foods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies reveal an early-emerging system for thinking about food that incorporates social reasoning about agents and their relationships, and allows infants to make abstract, flexible, adaptive inferences to interpret others food choices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across studies, infants were from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, representative of the Chicago area: 43.2% White, 25.6% Black, 4.5% Asian, 17.1% Hispanic, and 9.5% Multiracial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents gave informed consent for their infants to participate and were compensated with either a travel reimbursement or a gift for their child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies all portrayed videos embedded in Keynote software that were presented onto a large screen, such that the videos were 4-feet high and 7-feet wide, making the actors appear approximately life-sized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants watched the videos from a high-chair positioned 5.5 feet from the screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Dataset S1 for details regarding infants' responses to all conditions of all studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 32 full-term infants (18 females, M = 14:12, range 13:19 to 15:15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were randomly assigned to the food or object condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimuli consisted of two actors sitting at a table with two bowls (A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study featured familiarization (three trials) and test phases (six trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All movies were 10 s long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During familiarization, one actor liked one of the bowls (A) by saying, Ooh!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I like that!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in a high-pitched voice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During test, the second actor disliked each bowl on alternating trials by saying, Ew.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I dont like that.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in a low-pitched voice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the food condition, the actors each ate the food before expressing their opinion; in the object condition, the actors each lifted and examined the bowl itself before expressing their opinion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We counterbalanced the following: which actor was first, which bowl she talked about, and which bowl was referred to first in the test phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Familiarization and test trials were infant-controlled, meaning trials advanced when an infant met the looking criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trials started when motion on the screen ended, and ended when the infant looked away for 2 consecutive seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants looking was coded by two coders who were unaware of condition (the first coder wore noise-cancelling headphones and viewed only the infants face, and the second coder only watched the test phase of the videos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first coder recorded infants looking live, during the study, by watching the videos on an infant monitor from behind the projection screen, and the second coder coded independently from recorded video of the session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured reliability by looking at whether the two coders agreed on the endpoint of each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 94% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also looked at nonparametric statistics to determine whether the patterns of results held across the majority of individuals in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants in the object condition looked longer when the second actor disliked bowl B (n = 13 of 16, binomial P = 0.021, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the majority of infants in the food condition looked longer when the second actor disagreed with the first by disliking the food in bowl A (n = 13 of 16, binomial P = 0.021, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2a  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 32 full-term infants (16 females, M = 14:7, range 13:12 to 15:4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three additional infants were excluded because of fussiness (n = 2) and experimenter error (n = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was identical to the food condition of study 1, with the addition of an introduction phase (three trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were randomly assigned to see the actors either affiliate or disengage before eating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 91% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeated-measures ANOVA on test trial looking times also revealed a main effect of pair (F2, 29 = 3.57; P = 0.041), indicating decreased looking across the session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants who saw the actors affiliate looked longer when the second actor disagreed by disliking bowl A (n = 13 of 16, binomial P = 0.021, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the majority of infants who saw the actors disengage looked longer when the second actor disliked bowl B (n = 13 of 16, binomial P = 0.021, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2b  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 16 full-term infants (7 females, M = 14:9, range 13:9 to 15:14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study design was identical to the affiliation condition of study 2a, except the actors expressed their opinions about the bowls themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 93% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants looked longer when the second actor disliked bowl B (n = 14 of 16, binomial P = 0.004, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_4a  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 48 full-term monolingual infants (21 females, M = 10:26, range 10:5 to 11:28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One additional infant was tested but excluded because of fussiness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design was like the food condition of study 1 with a few changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, infants saw an introduction phase (three trials, 30-s each) before familiarization where the actors introduced themselves by speaking either English or Spanish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actors were bilingual, which allowed us to randomly assign infants to see the actors either speak the same language (EnglishEnglish; SpanishSpanish), or speak different languages (EnglishSpanish).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, infants saw familiarization (three trials) and test phases (six trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show all infants the same videos, actors expressed liking by saying, Ooh!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ooh!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in high-pitched voices, and expressed disliking by saying, Ugh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ugh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in low-pitched voices after eating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The repeated-measures ANOVA on test-trial looking times revealed a marginal main effect of trial type (F1, 45 = 3.75; P = 0.059) and a significant effect of pair (F2, 44 = 5.86; P = 0.006), indicating decreasing looking across the test session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 95% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants who saw the actors speak the same language looked longer when the second actor disagreed by disliking bowl A (n = 25 of 32 combining across same-language conditions, binomial P = 0.002, two tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the majority of infants who saw the actors speak different languages looked longer when the second actor disliked bowl B (n = 14 of 16 from EnglishSpanish, binomial P = 0.004, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_4b  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 16 multilingual infants (8 female, M = 11:2, range 10:15 to 11:22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to English, infants were exposed to their non-English language between 10% and 70% of the time according to parental report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The languages they heard were: Spanish (n = 8), French (n = 3), Cantonese (n = 1), Gujarati (n = 1), Mandarin (n = 1), Swahili (n = 1), and Tagalog (n = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 93% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants looked longer when the second actor disagreed by disliking bowl A (n = 15 of 16, binomial P less_than 0.001, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supporting Information for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 32 full-term infants (18 females, M = 14:21, range 13:19 to 15:23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One additional infant was tested but excluded because of experimenter error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants saw an introduction phase where the two actors socially disengaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Familiarization and test events were like study 1, but the pattern of emotions switched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coders agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 94% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeated-measures ANOVA on test trial looking times also revealed a main effect of pair (F2, 29 = 11.663; P less_than 0.001), indicating a decrease in looking across the test session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants in the food condition looked longer when the second actor actively disagreed by liking bowl A (n = 15 of 16, binomial P less_than 0.001, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the majority of infants in the object condition looked longer when the second liked bowl B (n = 12 of 16, binomial P less_than 0.076, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Experiment_3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants in study 3 were 32 full-term 14-mo-old infants recruited from the greater Chicago area (18 females, mean age, 14 mo, 10 d, range 13:12 to 15:9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies 1 and 2 suggest that early thinking about food preferences may be tied to reasoning about social relationships and social groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, infants found disagreement about food preferences unexpected for some people (i.e., those who have affiliated) but not for others (i.e., those who have disengaged).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these results are because of infants linking social group membership to shared food preferences, then infants should also make the related inference that people in the same group should agree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 3 replicated study 2a, except that test trials asked about agreement rather than disagreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in test trials the second actor liked each food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When she liked food A, she actively agreed with the first actor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when she liked food B, she provided no information because the first actor had not interacted with that food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we asked whether there were cases where infants found it unexpected, and therefore looked longer, for the second actor to agree with the first actor by liking the food in bowl A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of pair (F2, 60 = 3.30; P = 0.049), indicating a decrease in looking across the test session, and a significant interaction showing that infants patterns of looking to the two types of test trials (A vs. B) differed across the conditions (affiliation vs. disengagement; F1, 30 = 17.70; P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the interaction, we analyzed the conditions separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants who saw the actors affiliate looked significantly longer when the second actor liked the food in bowl B (M = 9.5 s), the perceptually novel event, than when she actively agreed with the first actor by liking the food in bowl A (M = 6.8 s; F1, 15 = 21.42; P = 0.002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the actors socially disengaged, infants looked significantly longer when the second actor actively agreed by liking the food in bowl A (M = 9.1 s) than when the second actor liked the food in bowl B (M = 6.3 s; F1, 15 = 6.60; P = 0.021).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the patterns of looking held across the majority of infants, we also looked at nonparametric statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of infants who saw the actors affiliate looked longer when the second actor liked bowl B (n = 14 of 16, binomial P = 0.004, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the majority of infants who saw the actors disengage looked longer when the second actor agreed by liking bowl A (n = 15 of 16, binomial P less_than 0.001, two-tailed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, infants found it unexpected for people who socially disengaged to converge in their food preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The live coder and the reliability coder agreed about the look-away that ended the trial on 92% of trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, studies 2 and 3 suggest that infants use social information to make inferences about whether people will agree and disagree in their food preferences: they expect people who affiliate to agree and people who disengage to disagree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_4b  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we did not plan to investigate differences based on the particular languages to which the multilingual infants were exposed, and we did not have an a priori prediction about the results, half of our sample were infants who were exposed to English and Spanish (n = 8), and half were infants who were exposed to English and another non-Spanish language (n = 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post hoc analyses revealed that both groups of infants, those who were exposed to English and Spanish (F1, 7 = 13.555; P = 0.008) and those who were exposed to English and a non-Spanish language (F1, 7 = 19.243; P = 0.003), generalized the food preference across two individuals, one who spoke English and the other Spanish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, infants did not need to be specifically familiar with both presented languages (in this case, English and Spanish) to expect generalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, regular experience hearing multiple languages, regardless of which specific languages, may influence infants expectations about the link between spoken language and food preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that infants inferences about who will share food preferences are adaptively responsive to variation in their social environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
