The conceptual structure of face impressions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current theory of face-based trait impressions focuses on their foundation in facial morphology, from which emerges a correlation structure of face impressions due to shared feature dependence, face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we proposed that perceivers lay conceptual beliefs about how personality traits correlate structure their face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that conceptual trait space explains a substantial portion of variance in face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we find that perceivers who believe any set of personality traits (e.g., trustworthiness, intelligence) is more correlated in others use more similar facial features when making impressions of those traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest lay conceptual beliefs about personality play a crucial role in face-based trait impressions and may underlie both their similarities and differences across perceivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humans seamlessly infer the expanse of personality traits from others facial appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These facial impressions are highly intercorrelated within a structure known as face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research has extensively documented the facial features that underlie face impressions, thus outlining a bottom-up fixed architecture of face impressions, which cannot account for important ways impressions vary across perceivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classic theory in impression formation emphasized that perceivers use their lay conceptual beliefs about how personality traits correlate to form initial trait impressions, for instance, where trustworthiness of a target may inform impressions of their intelligence to the extent one believes the two traits are related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This considered, we explore the possibility that this lay conceptual trait spacehow perceivers believe personality traits correlate in othersplays a role in face impressions, tethering face impressions to one another, thus shaping face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In study 1, we found that conceptual and face trait space explain considerable variance in each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In study 2, we found that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits judged those traits more similarly in faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, using a face image classification task, we found in study 3 that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits used more similar facial features to make those two face trait impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings suggest lay beliefs of how personality traits correlate may underlie trait impressions, and thus face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies face impressions are not only derived bottom up from facial features, but also shaped by our conceptual beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given relatively common conceptual (19) and face (3) trait spaces among perceivers, they should show substantial overlap with one another on average if perceiver lay theories of personality shape their face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that face trait space and conceptual trait space would not match.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, one can imagine the belief that dominant people are intelligent, responsible, and outgoing, yet the facial cues that give rise to dominance impressions may not give rise to intelligence impressions (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spaces could organize themselves by any number of factors that could structure trait concepts (e.g., valence, such as in a halo effect; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is important to directly assess the correspondence of conceptual and face trait spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first sought to empirically measure conceptual trait space (of the 13 traits used to estimate seminal models of face trait space; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), and assess whether face trait space reflects its structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) (20), a powerful technique to assess similarity in such multivariate spaces (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this technique, each trait space is represented as a similarity (i.e., correlation) matrix (pairwise relations of all traits to each other; Fig 1 A and B), and then flattened into a vector of the unique pairwise similarity values between each trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because traits within a single matrix were measured on the same scale, similarities within each matrix were calculated using the standard distance metric of Pearson correlation, specifically, the pairwise correlations of trait judgments made of faces (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But because raw values in different matrices have different meanings, we assessed the correspondence between separate matrices (e.g., conceptual and face trait space) using Spearman rank correlation, which uses rank order rather than raw values (i.e., Pearson correlations) to estimate relationships between distances in the two spaces (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured conceptual and face trait space in two separate samples of participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each trait space was measured within a set of 13 personality traits used in seminal work quantifying face trait space: aggressive, caring, confident, dominant, egotistic, emotionally stable, intelligent, mean, responsible, sociable, trustworthy, unhappy, and weird (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarities in the conceptual trait matrix were calculated using a straightforward pairwise similarity rating: the average degree to which participants believed each unique pairwise combination of personality traits are interrelated in other people (n = 113; e.g., trustworthydominant pair: If someone is trustworthy, how likely are they to be dominant?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 1B, Top) (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate face trait space, 90 different faces were rated by participants on each of the 13 trait stimuli (n = 415; each participant randomly assigned to one of the 13 trait stimuli) (Fig 1B, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as hypothesized, the conceptual and face similarity matrices explained a substantial amount of variance in one another {Spearman (76) = 0.82, 2 = 0.67, P less_than 0.0001, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.88]; Fig 1C}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that, when any two traits (e.g., caring and intelligent) are deemed more correlated in others, judgments of those traits in other peoples faces exhibit a corresponding similarity or dissimilarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We replicated this relationship between conceptual and face trait matrices with a different face trait space, using trait judgment data from the original research defining the face trait space (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that egotistic was removed in this analysis, as it was not present in this specific dataset.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a near-identical significant correlation between the conceptual and face trait model replicated this finding {Spearman (64) = 0.84, 2 = 0.71, P less_than 0.0001, 95% CI = [0.75, 0.90]}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results provide evidence for a strong correspondence between conceptual trait space and face trait space, consistent with a long history of research suggesting this correspondence (1315, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 1 provides evidence that face trait space shares considerable structure with conceptual trait space (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if conceptual associations play a role in shaping face trait space, perceivers own face trait space should reflect their personal beliefs in how traits are conceptually associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while conceptual and face trait spaces were estimated on average across subjects in study 1, study 2 accounted for between-subject differences in trait associations, assessing the relationship between perceivers idiosyncratic conceptual and face trait spaces (n = 206).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This question is an important step in addressing whether perceivers own conceptual trait associations influence their face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By current perspectives (1, 6), overgeneralized facial cues (e.g., resting smile resemblance of a face) activate specific trait concepts (e.g., trustworthiness) identically across perceivers, due to adaptive associations between traits and those overgeneralized cues, and regardless of perceivers conceptual association between the cue-related trait impression (e.g., trustworthiness) and other trait impressions made from the same face (e.g., dominance, creativity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such perspectives do not predict that face impressions would relate to individual differences in conceptual associations, whereas our account does indeed predict this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each participant was randomly assigned to one unique pair from a subset of the pairwise combinations in study 1: assertive, caring, competent, creative, self-disciplined, and trustworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Due to practical limitations in measurement, note this looks through a pinhole at this process, only investigating single trait pairs per subject, rather than measuring the entirety of their trait spaces needed to acquire a full picture of this process.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants evaluated faces on both assigned traits, then later provided a conceptual similarity judgment between those traits, as in study 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in this study, participants served as the unit of analysis, with a score for their conceptual and face trait similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test our hypothesis, we correlated participants idiosyncratic face and conceptual trait similarities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants conceptual similarity rating for a given trait pair was correlated with how similar those traits were judged in faces {Spearman (204) = 0.34, 2 = 0.12, P less_than 0.0001, 95% CI = [0.21, 0.46]} (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate a correspondence between how similar a participant idiosyncratically deems two traits and how similarly the participant judges those traits in others faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the results replicate and extend those of study 1, documenting correspondence between conceptual and face trait spaces on an individual level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have seen that conceptual trait space and face trait space explain considerable variance in one another (study 1) and further explain individual differences in each other (study 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have testable implications for face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If two different trait impressions are more or less correlated with one another, the facial features that typically evoke those impressions are likely to shift toward or away from one another, fundamentally altering the featural space underlying face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, perceivers who differ in the degree of conceptual association between traits would see these traits differently in faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, someone who believes agreeable people are often open to experience may make both impressions from faces based on more similar visual features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Someone who does not think agreeable people are often open to experience, on the other hand, may make both impressions based on less similar features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this possibility, we applied a recently advanced reverse-correlation technique, which allowed us to estimate the facial features underlying participants perceptions of traits in a data-driven manner (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this technique, we obtained a featural vector in face space that represents each participants visual representation of each trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we estimated the perceived visual similarity of different traits in faces for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical to study 2, we then tested whether a participants idiosyncratic conceptual similarity between any two traits related to the visual similarity in features that evoke those specific traits for the participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant (n = 185) was randomly assigned to one unique pair from the unique pairwise combinations of the Big Five factor personality traits: agreeable, conscientious, extroverted, neurotic, and open to experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These traits were used to increase generalization of the findings of studies 1 and 2 and also given prior success in deriving these traits within the statistical face model we used (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants performed a forced choice image classification task (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) for each trait assigned, then later provided their idiosyncratic conceptual similarity rating between those traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, our data included each participant as the unit of analysis as in study 2, with a score for their conceptual and face trait similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypotheses, a participants conceptual similarity between two traits was correlated with the visual similarity in facial features associated with those traits {Spearman (183) = 0.40, 2 = 0.16, P less_than 0.0001, 95% CI = [0.27, 0.51]} (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that the extent to which the visual features underlying each trait impression are more or less similar to those of other trait impressions relates to perceivers own conceptual association between those traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate this in Fig 2B, in which we present the agreeable and open-to-experience classification images produced from two individual participant responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a participant who deems agreeableness and openness to be more conceptually related tends to see these traits as visually more similar in peoples faces (i.e., uses similar features to make these impressions; see Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, our findings suggest that perceiver lay theories of personality may play an important role in face-based trait impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that conceptual trait space and face trait space explain a considerable amount of variance in each other (study 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between conceptual trait associations and face trait associations is further evidenced by our findings that face impression judgments correlate within perceivers to the degree they believe those traits are more similar conceptually (study 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we found that conceptual trait associations predict the visual features perceivers use to infer those traits in others faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings provide correlational evidence suggesting that face impressions (e.g., intelligence) are partly derived from one another (e.g., trustworthiness), to the extent perceivers believe those traits are correlated in other people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current results provide several important contributions to theories of face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of conceptual trait associations in face impression processes adds a crucial top-down layer to what have been predominately feature-driven bottom-up models (1, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If face impressions are derived from one another by way of their conceptual associations, this process may explain considerable correspondence in the structure of face impressions across perceivers (study 1; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3), given similar correspondence in conceptual trait associations across perceivers (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above and beyond this commonality, this process may explain important individual differences in perceivers face impressions and trait space (studies 2 and 3), to the extent their conceptual trait associations vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the findings bolster recent proposals arguing that face trait space may reflect a dynamic integration of not only intrinsic facial-feature covariation but also conceptual associations, stereotypes, and other social cognitive factors (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the notion that individual differences in conceptual associations between traits shapes perceptions comports well with seminal person perception research that posited a role of implicit personality theory in nonface trait impressions (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results therefore suggest that these classic insights with respect to general impression-formation patterns (outside of face perception) may apply to face-based trait impressions as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A common correlated structure of trait impressions has been observed not only in face impressions, but also in person knowledge and group-level stereotypes (1, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure extends further to explain mental state inferences (23), as well as neural representations during social perception (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That perceptions across domains share such similar structure is striking, and perhaps telling of a common cognitive basis for correlated social perceptions (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could directly investigate the role of conceptual trait spaces in shaping the structure of person perception in other domains, such as abstract representations of others (e.g., outside the domain of face evaluation; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) and social groups (12), including the possibility of empirically connecting these various spaces together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, RSA approaches (20) have been leveraged to assess correspondences across various domains, such as actual personality (25) and social categorization (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, understanding the contribution of perceiver conceptual trait associations to social perception across these domains may be paramount to understanding real-world social behavior that is quite consequential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dimensions of both face impressions and group stereotypes are highly consequential, in situations as serious as election outcomes (4, 27) and criminal sentencing (5, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research should assess whether important individual and cultural differences in conceptual trait space alter critical social decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With respect to these dimensions, the results may provide a parsimonious explanation for cases in which their correlations may cease to be independent and shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one example, trait impressions of less familiar others may be more intercorrelated and lower dimensional than those of familiar others (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be the case that perceivers rely more on their conceptual trait space, in which trait judgments are highly correlated, to make impressions of unfamiliar others when more specific person knowledge is unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, additional information about targets allows trait dimensions of sociability and morality, typically linked to one another (1, 12), to become orthogonal (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This account could also generalize to explain models of trait impressions in intergroup contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, use of a conceptual trait space to make wide personality inferences toward unfamiliar outgroup members may underlie systematically biased (3234) and therefore homogenous trait impressions (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, increased information about targets may disengage use of the conceptual trait space (i.e., individuation; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another notable example is the more negative relationship between trustworthiness and dominance impressions of female compared with male faces (36), presumably due to stereotypes linking female likability with submissiveness (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that unique conceptual trait spaces, such as when considering different social groups (e.g., conceptual associations between traits when regarding females vs. males), may lead to differential associations between face impressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could measure shifts in conceptual trait space in different social contexts to assess whether variations in face trait and group-level trait space emerge from a conceptual basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are important limitations of the current work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, the correlational nature of our design precludes any strong inference about the causal impact of conceptual knowledge on face trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative possibilities exist, including face impressions shaping conceptual trait space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At face value, it seems unlikely that individual differences in face impression correlations (due to mere featural processing of the same face stimuli) could exert such a consistent influence on participant conceptual associations between personality traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially the case, given perceivers would have to track whether impressions of faces from one task somehow reflected those in the second separate task; and there is a considerable lack of awareness concerning which features underlie perceivers judgments (2, 3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our current data cannot exclude these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research should seek causal evidence of the influence of conceptual knowledge on face trait space by manipulating conceptual knowledge directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another noteworthy limitation is the use of languagetrait concept terms such as trustworthinessto measure both face impressions and conceptual associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue has been central to longstanding debates concerning the origins of lay personality theory models, in which researchers have debated whether measured trait concept associations are merely semantic in nature, rather than underlain by beliefs about actual personality traits of others (for a review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If perceivers trait-term semantic associations (e.g., believing the words kind and sociable mean the same thing) are all that is behind their conceptual and face trait associations, similarity in conceptual and face trait spaces may be an artifact of language and uninteresting for understanding social behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speaking against this possibility, many researchers have found evidence that trait concept correlations are independent of semantic features and argued semantic explanations do not obviate socially meaningful and consequential trait relations (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, such ruling out has not been applied in the current domain of face impressions, which future research should evaluate in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could examine whether the significance of a trait impression changes, for instance whether conceptual shifts in intelligence impressions impact its affective (e.g., evaluative priming) or behavioral (e.g., hiring decisions) consequences for perceivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we found that lay conceptions of personality traits are strongly related to trait impressions based on other peoples facial appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common structure that emerges across perceivers in face impressions (1, 3) has considerable resemblance to commonly shared conceptual trait structure (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond any such shared structure, individual differences in perceivers conceptual trait associations are related to the unique structure of their face impressions and the features that underlie them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings suggest that the way we infer personality traits from faces is not only determined by the physical appearance of a face, but also by our own lay conceptual beliefs regarding the personality of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
