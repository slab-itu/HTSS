Epigenetic modification of OXT and human sociability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elucidating the genetic and biological substrates of social behavior serves to advance the way basic human nature is understood and improves the way genetic and biological markers can be used to prevent, diagnose, and treat people with impairments in social cognition and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that epigenetic modification of the structural gene for oxytocin (OXT) is an important factor associated with individual differences in social processing, including self-report, behavior, and brain function and structure in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across many mammalian species there exist genetic and biological systems that facilitate the tendency to be social.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxytocin is a neuropeptide involved in social-approach behaviors in humans and others mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there exists a large, mounting body of evidence showing that oxytocin signaling genes are associated with human sociability, very little is currently known regarding the way the structural gene for oxytocin (OXT) confers individual differences in human sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we undertook a comprehensive approach to investigate the association between epigenetic modification of OXT via DNA methylation, and overt measures of social processing, including self-report, behavior, and brain function and structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic data were collected via saliva samples and analyzed to target and quantify DNA methylation across the promoter region of OXT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a consistent pattern of results across sociability measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People that exhibit lower OXT DNA methylation (presumably linked to higher OXT expression) display more secure attachment styles, improved ability to recognize emotional facial expressions, greater superior temporal sulcus activity during two social-cognitive functional MRI tasks, and larger fusiform gyrus gray matter volume than people that exhibit higher OXT DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide empirical evidence that epigenetic modification of OXT is linked to several overt measures of sociability in humans and serve to advance progress in translational social neuroscience research toward a better understanding of the evolutionary and genetic basis of normal and abnormal human sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic, behavioral, and neuroimaging data were collected from a sample of healthy participants within the surrounding community in Athens, Georgia (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed to test for associations between OXT DNA methylation values and self-reported attachment style, recognition of dynamic emotional facial expressions, brain activity during two social-cognitive tasks (Fig S2), and regional gray matter volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Attachment_Style  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regression analysis revealed a significant association between DNA methylation of OXT and self-reported anxious attachment style [R2 = 0.06, t(1, 128) = 2.83, P = 0.005, two-tailed] (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater OXT DNA methylation was associated with higher anxious attachment-style scores (r = 0.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People exhibiting greater DNA methylation of OXT report higher levels of anxious attachment style (i.e., insecure attachment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between DNA methylation of OXT and anxious attachment style remained statistically significant when participants sex and age were entered as covariates (P = 0.006).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT methylation and avoidant attachment style were not significantly associated [r = 0.03, t(1, 128) = 0.38, P = 0.71].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emotion_Recognition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the dynamic facial emotion-recognition task, we observed that greater OXT DNA methylation was associated with lower emotion recognition accuracy [r = 0.21, t(1, 127) = 2.41, P = 0.017, two-tailed] (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People exhibiting greater DNA methylation of OXT tended to be less accurate when categorizing emotional facial expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between OXT DNA methylation and emotion recognition accuracy remained statistically significant when participants sex and age were entered as covariates (P = 0.014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we observed a significant effect for accuracy across all emotion categories, we also tested for associations between OXT DNA methylation and accuracy within each emotion expression category (happy, angry, sad, and fearful).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that greater OXT DNA methylation was associated with lower emotion recognition accuracy for angry (r = 0.21, P = 0.019) and sad (r = 0.20, P = 0.027) facial expressions, but not for happy (P = 0.91) or fearful (P = 0.95) facial expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between OXT DNA methylation and reaction time during the task was not statistically significant (P = 0.36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Neuroimaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested for an association between OXT DNA methylation and brain activity during two social-cognitive tasks (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emotional perspective-taking task engages the ability to think about views and feelings of other people within a social scene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For emotional perspective-taking, we contrasted blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response while participants performed the emotional perspective-taking condition to BOLD response collected during the shape-matching condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-brain regression analysis revealed that greater OXT DNA methylation values were associated with reduced right superior temporal sulcus (STS) activity during emotional perspective-taking [k = 407; peak voxel: Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI): 48, 38, 4; t = 4.59, P less_than 0.001] (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People exhibiting greater DNA methylation of OXT show reduced STS activity while emotional perspective-taking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between OXT DNA methylation and right STS activity remained statistically significant when the participants sex and age were entered as covariates (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses testing for sex differences and a Sex × Methylation interaction effect on right STS activity were not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested for an association between greater OXT DNA methylation values and larger contrast values between emotional perspective-taking and shape matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No clusters of increased brain activity were found to be associated with greater OXT DNA methylation (i.e., positive correlation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT DNA methylation was not associated with accuracy (P = 0.32) or reaction time (P = 0.22) during the emotion perspective-taking task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The emotion attribution task engages the ability to think about the reason why another person is emotionally reacting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For emotion attribution, we contrasted BOLD response collected while participants performed the emotion attribution condition to BOLD response collected during the gender-matching condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-brain regression analysis revealed that greater OXT DNA methylation values were associated with reduced right STS (k = 60; MNI: 42, 60, 2; t = 3.03, P = 0.002), right fusiform gyrus/middle occipital gyrus (Fus/MOG) (k = 106; MNI: 40, 60, 10; t = 3.26, P = 0.001), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (k = 92; MNI: 58, 26, 24; t = 3.23, P = 0.001) and left fusiform (Fus) activity (k = 101; MNI: 26, 72, 8; t = 3.04, P = 0.001) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between OXT DNA methylation and right STS, Fus/MOG, IFG, and left Fus activity remained statistically significant when participants sex and age were entered as covariates (P less_than 0.005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses testing for sex differences and a Sex × Methylation interaction effect on right STS, Fus/MOG, IFG, and left Fus activity were not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested for an association between greater OXT DNA methylation values and larger contrast values between emotion attribution and gender matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No clusters of increased brain activity were found to be associated with greater OXT DNA methylation during the emotion attribution task (i.e., positive correlation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT DNA methylation was not associated with accuracy (P = 0.28) or reaction time (P = 0.86) during the emotion attribution task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Neuroimaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a whole-brain analysis with OXT DNA methylation values entered as the predictor variable and gray matter volume as criterion variable, while total brain volume, sex, and age were entered as covariates using the VBM8 toolbox (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/) in SPM8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this analysis demonstrated that greater OXT DNA methylation values were associated with reduced gray matter volume within the right fusiform gyrus (Fus) (k = 354; MNI: 48, 57, 14; t = 4.44, P less_than 0.0005) (Fig 4) (i.e., negative correlation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses testing for sex differences and a Sex × Methylation interaction effect on right Fus gray matter volume were not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested for an association between greater OXT DNA methylation values and increased gray matter volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater OXT methylation values were not associated with increased gray matter volume in any brain regions (i.e., positive correlation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT DNA methylation values were not associated with total brain (P = 0.23), gray matter (P = 0.42), or white matter (P = 0.45) volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across several different metrics, including self-report, behavior, and the function and structure of the brain, we observed that epigenetic modification of OXT, via DNA methylation, is associated with individual differences in human sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that greater OXT DNA methylation, presumably linked to lower OXT expression, is associated with less-secure self-reported attachment (greater anxious attachment) and a reduced ability to recognize emotional facial expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the brain, we observed that greater OXT DNA methylation is associated with reduced neural activity within brain regions important for social-cognitive functioning, including the STS, fusiform gyrus, and IFG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observed that greater OXT DNA methylation is associated with reduced gray matter volume within the right fusiform gyrus, a brain region important for face processing and social-cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, these findings provide empirical, cross-modal evidence that OXT is a gene linked to human sociability and that epigenetic modification of OXT confers individual differences in human sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings provide strong support that oxytocin pathway genes regulate the expression of social behavioral phenotypes in humans and other mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT is one gene among several that influences the oxytocin signaling pathway (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OXT codes for a precursor protein synthetized to produce oxytocin and neurophysin I (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurophysin I is the carrier protein for oxytocin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings from this study are in accordance with animal studies demonstrating aberrations in social behavior in OXT knockout mice (11, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Ferguson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) showed that OXT knockout mice fail to develop social memory and Winslow et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) showed that OXT knockout mice exhibit reduced infant vocalizations and abnormal aggressive and fearful behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, there is sparse evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms of OXT are associated with social behavior, such as social bonding between mother and child and breastfeeding (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Love et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27) demonstrated a link between OXT (rs4813625) and anxious attachment style, anxiety, emotional well-being, and dopamine function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There also exists some evidence that OXT is associated with conditions characterized by aberrations in social-cognition, such as autism (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current findings strengthen the link between OXT and human social behavior and suggest that the way OXT is methylated, and ultimately expressed, affects the function and structure of specific brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unfortunately, within this study we did not measure OXT expression directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is evidence that OXT DNA methylation is associated with OXT expression in bovine cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bovine cells that express OXT have low levels of promoter methylation, whereas cells that do not express OXT have high methylation levels in this region (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is currently unclear how exogenous and endogenous factors may impact DNA methylation of the OXT gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation is modified in response to early childhood experience (29), neuronal activity (30), and social stress (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important for future epigenetic studies on OXT to include variables representative of individual life experience and psychological stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we characterized epigenetic modification of OXT via DNA methylation values derived from saliva samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exist several factors associated with this approach that warrant consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its association with sociability, methylation patterns observed in saliva may not reflect DNA methylation patterns in the relevant brain regions, as we did not measure methylation in brain loci specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies, however, indicate that DNA derived from saliva may be a good proxy for methylation within brain tissue (21, 32) and may reflect epigenetic programming that is not tissue-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, salivary DNA may represent a noninvasive tissue for biomarker testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, methylation of the majority of CpG sites evaluated in this study were correlated, a common phenomenon in CpG islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, average methylation across the region was analyzed, and a subset of these CpG sites may be just as informative as the region evaluated with this assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed that greater DNA methylation of OXT, presumably linked to lower OXT expression, is associated with higher anxious attachment-style scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with extant data showing that oxytocin administration facilitates social-approach behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following oxytocin administration, people tend to trust one another more (2), stand in closer proximity to one another (3), and display a more secure attachment style (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured both anxious and avoidant attachment styles, and observed that OXT methylation values were associated with the anxious form, but not with the avoidant form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An anxious attachment style reflects the tendency to display fear or anxiety about the value one has within relationships, and in extreme scenarios, to be overly dependent on relationship partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current finding indicates that OXT may influence social bonding during development and affects the way people form and maintain intimate social relationships with others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that greater DNA methylation of OXT is associated with lower accuracy in determining the emotional expression from dynamic faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in accordance with evidence associating oxytocin with social perception (33) and with emotional face recognition (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxytocin may affect emotion recognition by increasing attention toward specific relevant cues, such as the eye region of faces (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we observed an association between OXT methylation and overall accuracy during the task, we also tested for emotion category-specific associations and found that methylation is associated with accuracy during the angry and sad conditions, but not during the happy or fearful conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emotion-specific pattern was unexpected, requires replication, and should be considered with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One factor, however, that may have influenced the likelihood of detecting an effect within the happy condition was the consistently high accuracy (happy accuracy: mean= 99%, SD = 2.6; all others: mean less_than 91%, SD  9.0) observed during this condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings support the role of oxytocin signaling genes in the perception, processing, and recognition of emotional facial expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across two social-cognitive fMRI tasks, we observed that OXT DNA methylation is associated with STS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People exhibiting lower OXT methylation displayed greater right STS activity during an emotional perspective-taking task and an emotion attribution task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both fMRI tasks are designed to elicit activation within brain regions encompassing the mentalizing/theory of mind networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emotional perspective-taking task requires a person to estimate the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of other people who are in different emotional situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emotion attribution task requires a person to estimate the cause of another persons emotional reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the emotional perspective-taking and the emotion attribution task involve thinking about the mental states of other people (i.e., mentalizing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STS is an important brain region within the mentalizing network (24) and is functionally and structurally aberrant in conditions characterized by deficits in social-cognition, such as autism (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An inspection of each of the STS clusters observed in this study indicates that each cluster is located relatively posterior within the sulcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reviewing characteristics of tasks that elicit STS activity, Hein el al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36) found that the anterior portion of the STS is mainly involved in speech perception, whereas the posterior portion is mainly involved in cognitive tasks, such as theory of mind and face processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current finding is consistent with a prior neuroimaging study demonstrating that oxytocin administration enhances STS activity in individuals with autism (37), and with a recent finding that OXTR methylation is associated with STS activity (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note however, that Puglia et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) reported a positive association between OXTR methylation and STS activity, and we observed a negative association between OXT methylation and STS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that methylation of specific genes within the oxytocin signaling pathway affects the function of the STS differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, these data show that the STS plays an important role in the relationship between oxytocin signaling genes and the way humans process social-cognitive tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the emotion attribution fMRI task, we also found that OXT methylation is associated with IFG and fusiform gyrus activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFG functions to regulate response tendencies during cognitive, emotional, and social decision-making (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emotion attribution task requires participants to decide which social-emotional scene they believed caused a persons (depicted in a photograph) emotional reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average reaction time during the emotion attribution condition (mean = 2324.13 ms, SD = 322.39) was considerably longer than during the gender-match condition (mean = 1804.32, SD = 281.32), indicating that additional neurocognitive resources were required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings may indicate that individuals displaying greater IFG activity (associated with reduced OXT DNA methylation) may be allocating more neurocognitive resources when thinking about the emotional states of others, compared with those displaying less IFG activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the structural MRI analysis demonstrated an association between OXT DNA methylation and gray matter volume of the fusiform gyrus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is currently unknown how oxytocin pathway genes influence brain development and ultimately the structure of specific brain tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exists limited evidence that other oxytocin genes, such as OXTR, correspond to individual differences in brain structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39) and Inoue et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40) showed a link between OXTR and amygdala volume, and Tost et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (41) showed a link between OXTR and hypothalamus volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusiform gyrus contains the fusiform face area and plays an import role in initial face representation and facial identity recognition (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior research in various patient groups shows that greater fusiform gyrus gray matter volume is associated with an improved ability to recognize facial expressions (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OT administration is associated with increased fusiform gyrus activity (45) and OXTR methylation is associated with fusiform gyrus reactivity to emotional facial expressions (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, these findings suggest that fusiform gyrus structure and function may influence the relationship between OXT DNA methylation and the processingand ultimately the recognitionof faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There exist several important limitations of this study that warrant consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First and foremost, the sample size for this study was modest (n ranged from 120129).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study on OXT methylation in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, based on effect sizes reported in studies investigating other oxytocin genes (19, 20, 46, 47), namely OXTR, and behavior or brain associations, we estimated that a sample size of 66 or larger would be adequate to test each of our hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect size estimate, however, does not account for many other factors, such as publication bias; therefore, our results should currently be interpreted with caution until they can be replicated in an independent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, there exist other oxytocin signaling genes that may influence human sociability in similar or different ways, such as CD38, that were not considered in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, there may not be a linear relationship between DNA methylation in this region and oxytocin protein levels, and further studies are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, our sample was relatively homogeneous, and was comprised of people within a relatively narrow age range (1835 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it will be important to investigate how age and various life experiences may impact DNA methylation throughout the lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our findings do not provide any direct empirical information regarding the production, function, or accessibility of oxytocin within the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive evidence that epigenetic modification of OXT is linked to several overt measures of sociability in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings serve to advance progress in translational social neuroscience research toward understanding the evolutionary and genetic basis of normal and abnormal human sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recruited 129, fluent English-speaking (72 females, 57 males; mean age = 21.37 y, SD = 3.49 y) adults from the University of Georgia and surrounding community to participate in genetic and behavioral testing and neuroimaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants were screened for neurological and psychiatric conditions (via self-report) and MRI contraindications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided written informed consent as detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the University of Georgia Institutional Review Board approved all procedures within this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this total sample, 129 completed genetic testing, 129 completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), 128 completed the emotion recognition task, 121 completed the emotional perspective-taking fMRI task, 120 completed the emotion attribution fMRI task, and 121 completed structural neuroimaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete listing of subgroup-specific demographic data are provided in Table S1, along with a description of factors that affected participant retention, data collection, and quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Saliva_Collection_and_DNA_Extraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saliva samples were collected using Oragene Discover OGR-500 kits (DNA Genotek).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted using prepITL2P reagent (DNA Genotek) and was quantified with PicoGreen (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Methylation_of_OXT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One microgram of DNA was treated with bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation of CpG sites (Fig 1) in the promoter region of the OXT gene (chr20: 3,052,2663,053,162; hg19 build) were analyzed using EpiTYPER (MassARRAY system; Agena Biosciences) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forward (aggaagagagTTTTTTTGTTTTATTTTAGTGGTTTAGG) and reverse (cagtaatacgactcactatagggagaaggctTCTTACCTCCCAAAAAACAATTCTA) primers corresponding to chr20:3,052,0093,052,392 were designed using EpiDesigner (Agena Bioscience), and the spectrum characteristics were validated with RSeqMeth (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycling conditions were: denaturation (94 °C for 15 min) then 50 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were electrophoresed using 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel to confirm amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CpG sites were unambiguously interrogated, and their genomic locations are detailed in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass spectra methylation ratios were generated using EpiTYPER v1.2 (Agena Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we confirmed the reliability of the OXT methylation assay by using Epitect unmethylated (0%) and methylated (100%) DNA samples (Qiagen) as positive controls (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each participant, average OXT DNA methylation values were calculated by averaging across a total of nine CpG cites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Demographics_and_Subject_Data_Retention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the emotion recognition behavioral task, one participant failed to complete the task properly and was excluded from the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the emotional perspective-taking fMRI task and structural MRI data (VBM analysis), neuroimaging data were not collected for five participants and three participants exhibited structural brain anomalies and where therefore removed from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the emotion attribution fMRI task, neuroimaging data were not collected for five participants, three participants exhibited brain structural anomalies, and one participant exhibited excessive movement during the collection of data and were therefore removed from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is part of a larger project to gather data on genes, cognition, sociability, and brain structure and function funded by the Office for the Vice President of Research at the University of Georgia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of participants reported on in this article also completed an educational background form, birth-order questionnaire, mood questionnaire, and a control of attitudes fMRI task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific a priori hypothesis regarding associations among these variables and the OXT gene were not developed and thus statistical analyses designed to test for links among these variables were not carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emotion_Recognition_Task__Data_Processing_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral data were inspected to ensure participants followed instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accuracy was calculated by dividing the total number of correct responses by the total number of stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average reaction time was calculated based on correct response trials only, overall and for each emotional expression condition (happy, angry, sad, and fearful).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regression analyses were performed using SPSS (v22: www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spss/) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significance threshold of P = 0.025 was used for each of analysis (accuracy and reaction time) to protect against type I errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-brain imaging data were acquired on a GE-Signa 3T scanner (General Electric) at the University of Georgia Bio-Imaging Research Center (birc.uga.edu/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional images (213 for emotional perspective-taking and 195 for emotion attribution) were acquired using a gradient echo T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI) scan and were obtained using a flip angle of 90°, repetition time (TR) = 2.0 s, echo time (TE) = 25 ms, 40 slices, and a field-of-view (FOV) = 220 mm × 64 matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_MRI_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution whole-brain imaging data using a T1-weighted spoiled grass gradient recalled sequence were acquired on a GE-Signa 3T scanner and the following parameters were used: repetition time, 24 ms; echo time, 4.5 ms; flip angle, 20°; matrix size, 256 × 256; FOV, 25.6 cm; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; 164 contiguous slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

fMRI data were preprocessed and statistically analyzed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom) and implemented through Matlab R2013a (www.mathworks.com/?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were temporally realigned to the middle slice, spatially realigned to the first in the time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were then coregistered and spatially normalized into standard stereotactic space (MNI template) and spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_Data_Preprocessing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural MRI data were initially visually inspected for artifacts or structural abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VBM analyses were performed using SPM8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/) as implemented through the VBM8 toolbox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the origin of each participants structural image was manually set to the anterior commissure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, each image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, and then transformed to MNI stereotactic space using affine and nonlinear spatial normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segmented images were then iteratively registered by the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra toolbox (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process created a template for the group of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting template image was transformed to MNI stereotactic space using affine and nonlinear spatial normalization with intensity modulation by the Jacobian determinant of the deformation flow field computed for each image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting images were transformed to MNI space and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
