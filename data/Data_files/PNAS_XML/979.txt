In situ modeling of multimodal floral cues attracting wild pollinators across environments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The coeveolution of flowers and pollinators is well known, but how generalist pollinators identify suitable flowers across environments and flower species is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoverflies, which are found across the globe, are one of the most important alternative pollinators after bees and bumblebees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we measured, predicted, and finally recreated multimodal cues from individual flowers visited by hoverflies in three different environments (hemiboreal, alpine, and tropical).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that although flower signatures were unique for each environment, some cues were ubiquitously attractive, despite not resembling cue combinations from real flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide unique insights into how a cosmopolitan pollinator identifies flower objects across environments, which has important implications for our understanding of pollination as a global ecological service.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With more than 80% of flowering plant species specialized for animal pollination, understanding how wild pollinators utilize resources across environments can encourage efficient planting and maintenance strategies to maximize pollination and establish resilience in the face of environmental change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fundamental question is how generalist pollinators recognize flower objects in vastly different ecologies and environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, pollinators could employ a specific set of floral cues regardless of environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, wild pollinators could recognize an exclusive signature of cues unique to each environment or flower species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoverflies, which are found across the globe, are one of the most ecologically important alternative pollinators after bees and bumblebees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have exploited their cosmopolitan status to understand how wild pollinator preferences change across different continents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without employing any a priori assumptions concerning the floral cues, we measured, predicted, and finally artificially recreated multimodal cues from individual flowers visited by hoverflies in three different environments (hemiboreal, alpine, and tropical) using a field-based methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that although flower signatures were unique for each environment, some multimodal lures were ubiquitously attractive, despite not carrying any reward, or resembling real flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it was unexpected that cue combinations found in real flowers were not necessary, the robustness of our lures across insect species and ecologies could reflect a general strategy of resource identification for generalist pollinators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide insights into how cosmopolitan pollinators such as hoverflies identify flowers and offer specific ecologically based cues and strategies for attracting pollinators across diverse environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Observing flowers in three climate regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Location of the three regions used for collection of data at specified dates (coinciding with hoverfly peak seasons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Region color coding is used in all figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images show Episyrphus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Eristalis sp., respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of (B) Hot and (C) Cold flowers from the three regions as indicated by colored frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flower species are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address wild pollinator preference across climates, we sampled floral phenotypic and abiotic data resulting in 1,000,000 data points from 153 individual flowers in three different environments, of which 112 were Hot (i.e., visited by hoverflies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These points consisted of illuminance, reflected UV and visual wavelengths (308760 nm), absolute flower size (area, maximum and minimum ferret), corolla circularity and type, inflorescence type, volatile identities and ratios (up to 96 volatiles), humidity, and CO2 measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of attractive (Hot, Fig 1B, flower species listed in SI Appendix, Table S1) and less attractive, although not necessarily repellent (Cold, Fig 1C) flowers in the immediate vicinity of each other (SI Appendix, Fig S2A) indicates that it would be difficult to conclude that hoverfly flower choice is based on visual cues alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, composite flowers could be either Hot (Fig 1B, vi and viii) or Cold (Fig 1C, viii), and the same flower species could be both Hot and Cold (Fig 1B, iii and Fig 1C, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow flowers, which are often listed as attractive for hoverflies (1921, 27), were also found in both categories (Fig 1B, iii and Fig 1C, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 16 angiosperm families belonging to 13 orders of flowers were sampled from the three regions (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the variation of species suggests the potential for large variations in floral signature among and between the different geographic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed techniques for local sampling of spectral (Fig 2A), abiotic (Fig 2B), and volatile factors (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S2) from individual flowers in the field, without assuming any cues relative importance for hoverfly choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used photographs to quantify flower size and circularity (Fig 2A, iiv), manually score corolla shape (SI Appendix, Table S3), and account for flower abundance in the immediate vicinity of the measured flower (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined the volatile signature emitted by each flower using a recently developed technique for snapshot sampling of volatiles in the field at any moment (36) (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing all samples with GC-MS (Fig 2C, black data show a Hot and gray data a Cold Rhododendron campanulatum flower), we identified 96 different compounds from the 153 samples (SI Appendix, Table S5), constituting a variety of chemical classes, but only a small number of compounds were significantly different between Hot and Cold flowers (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used multivariate data analysis to predict combinations of attractive or less attractive cues for hoverflies in each environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed separate multivariate data analyses (MVA) for each region, first employing principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce color information, and then orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) analysis to identify parameters associated with Hot or Cold flowers (Fig 3 AF and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We pooled data from flowers visited by any hoverfly genus, as their identity did not appear to influence the results (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the OPLS, we identified variables with a loading score (P value) greater than 0.1 (dashed lines, Fig 3 AF) and error bars that did not cross 0, and used these to model Hot and Cold floral signatures (colored bars, Fig 3 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we were not attempting to find the most attractive flower species, and we often found both Hot and Cold flowers of the same species (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2), species information was not included in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we were investigating attractive combinations of floral phenotypic and abiotic cues, as they were detected in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all cases, hoverflies were predicted to use multimodal cues for identifying suitable flower signatures (colored bars, Fig 3 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some parameters were found in all three regions, but sometimes had opposite effects on hoverfly visitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that hoverflies use unique multimodal flower signatures in each region and suggests that environmental or ecological changes in the saliency of these signatures could also occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters were not affected by parameter randomization or by specific hoverfly genera (i.e., Episyrphus sp., SI Appendix, Fig S5), suggesting that they are neither a result of chance nor a function of hoverfly genera sampled at each location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next used the predicted signatures for each region (Fig 3 AF) to create artificial lures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often, Hot and Cold cues were not mutually exclusive (Fig 3 GJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we had to choose some color, shape, size, and odor for all lures (Fig 4A) and for parsimony chose the opposite of the predicted cue if no variable was available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uppsala, for example, there were more variables associated with Hot signatures (Fig 3C) than Cold (Fig 3D), but since many contained information about size, shape, and color (blue and red data, Fig 3C), we predicted that they would impact Cold signatures, too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Bangalore Cold lure (Fig 4A, vi) consisted of stellate (blue bar, Fig 3F), green (red bar, Fig 3F), and comparatively large (blue bars, Fig 3F) clustered corollas (blue bar, Fig 3F) with nonanal and decanal (green bars, Fig 3F) in a microcentrifuge tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used similar reasoning for the other lures, and, where we had no inflorescence information from the OPLS, lures were placed individually (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally created a negative control (an odorless black circle, Fig 4A, viii) and a unique positive control for each region exhibiting color, size, shape, and odor profiles from an exclusively Hot flower species found in each environment (e.g., Potentilla fruticosa for Uppsala, Fig 4A, vii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that there was no sugar or pollen reward in the lures to reduce risk of individual hoverflies returning to the lures, or learning new flower signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we placed the lures in the same three environments and recorded hoverfly visits in the same spatial and temporal locations where the floral data were collected the previous year (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, our lures attracted 150 visits in Sikkim, 112 in Uppsala, and 146 in Bangalore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that visits to the eight lures were significantly different from chance (i.e., equal visits to all lures, 2 test, P less_than 0.0001 in all regions; P less_than 0.001 in all regions when excluding visits to the real flower) and that the lures were as attractive as a real flower in both Sikkim and Uppsala (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data show few hoverfly visits to the negative control, but other insects did visit it (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a detailed breakdown of visits by certain hoverfly species, see SI Appendix, Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold lures exhibited varying degrees of attraction both within and across environments, implying that the MVA was not necessarily able to predict less attractive Cold signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus conclude that it is possible to use OPLS multimodal signatures to create artificial lures that are attractive to pollinators within and across environments, despite the lures not mimicking real flowers or manipulations of real flowers (as in, e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 and 3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important as the specific combinations of color, shape, size, and odor in our lures (SI Appendix, Fig S8) do not exist in the natural environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our work offers a field-based methodology to examine cues involved in insect pollination across different environments that can be useful for other studies assessing how environmental and ecological changes affect plant and animal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we cannot confirm hoverfly perception of the floral cues, all measured cues were quantified in situ in the field, whereas previous analyses have often been laboratory-based, such as recording flower color under a xenon lamp (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When measured in the field, cue variation in our lures across conditions was striking (SI Appendix, Fig S8), suggesting that hoverfly sensory systems, or indeed those of any pollinator, must compensate for such variation when locating a flower in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, our methodology was agnostic to flower species, and indeed, the same species could be found among both Hot and Cold samples (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 B and C and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we employed no a priori assumptions about each cues relative importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our resulting artificial lures (Fig 4A) were solely based on the variables predicted from the MVA (Fig 3) rather than attempting to recreate or modify real flowers or presume hoverfly perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is radically different from most previous work using artificial flowers (25, 37) or modifications of real flowers (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MVA (Fig 3 AF) was generally able to predict attractive signatures, but was less effective at predicting nonattractive signatures (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we controlled for local abiotic and biotic factors that could affect attractiveness (i.e., microclimate or community effects), the model could have been impacted by an inability to identify true negatives in the field, the lack of mutually exclusive cues between Hot and Cold flowers (Fig 3 GJ) or unmeasured factors (27) such as flower microstructure, movement, or pollen and nectar content, which could have reduced our ability to predict nonattractive signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our use of artificial lures also allowed us to assess wild pollinator attraction to floral cues across environments without confounding effects of environment on floral biology and floral cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some signatures, such as the predicted Bangalore Hot lure, were attractive only in their own environment, while the predicted Uppsala Hot lure was attractive everywhere except Uppsala (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences highlight the importance of both individual and community effects of floral traits on the apparency or context of selected cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, while our selection of Hot and Cold flowers attempted to decouple community effects, it is possible that the attractive observations, particularly in Sweden, may still have been impacted by pollination webs, networks, or magnet effects not measured here and therefore not present in our artificial lures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results also highlight the potential for hoverfly syndromes (myophily), particularly with our Sikkim lure, which was attractive in all tested environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoverflies are known to exhibit landmark association, specific visitation patterns, and floral constancy (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While hoverflies are suggested to overlap with bees in floral choice and constancy (27), there are cases of potential selection for floral traits based on hoverfly visitation (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sikkim, hoverflies and other flies are the predominant pollinators, as bees, birds, and other animals are uncommon at high elevations (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There could thus be strong selection on Himalayan flowers to be attractive to hoverflies, their major pollinators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that pollinators are selective to floral traits and that floral signals are essential for the assessment of flowers (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it was unexpected that our lures did not need to replicate specific combinations of cues found in real flowers (e.g., the smell and color of a rose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, our results show that these generalist pollinators do not require real flowers, but can be attracted to combinations of cues obtained from several attractive flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These combinations were not random or likely unimodal, as not all of our lures with similar characteristics (e.g., blue or yellow color) were equally attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in contrast to previous studies replicating real floral cue combinations (25, 28, 29) and implies that generalist pollinators could potentially select from a series of multimodal cues as a form of independent, rather than interactive, syndrome (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy would also allow pollinators to locate suitable resources in unknown environments and contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the attractiveness of our lures across insect species (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7), our results might reveal the potential for generalist syndromes, particularly when the predictions were made by observing several species (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies parsing the relative attraction of multimodal cues to both naive and experienced pollinators can help us to unravel the role of pollinator and floral ecology across environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides unique strategies for understanding wild pollinator preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robustness of our lures (e.g., the Himalayan signatures) across communities and climates suggests that these cues, or flowers exhibiting these cues, could also increase the attractiveness of habitats such as agricultural fields over different ecologies and geographies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cues must now be tested in large-scale field trials to assess their efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our methodology and large-scale data on wild pollinator preferences could also be beneficial for current efforts to increase habitat and forage resources in and around agricultural areas for pollinators (1), and could be used in many other ecological studies that analyze changes in resource use across environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, since our results also suggest that wild pollinators rely only on a small number of cues, drastic changes in flower phenology due to habitat disruption, environmental change, or monocultures could make it difficult for wild pollinators to locate suitable pollination sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially important considering that the current study sampled an extremely reduced subset of all flowers in each region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, consideration should be taken while planting crops and gardens to retain the consistency of the floral signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the region-specific differences in attractive floral signatures also suggest that climate, habitat, and geography play an important role in shaping plantpollinator relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there may not be a one size fits all answer to attracting pollinators across all environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide important insights about the impact of climate and environment on plantanimal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments directly assessing the plasticity of pollinator choice under ecological or environmental variation are needed to test these predictions and to understand the ecology of alternate pollinators in the face of our ever-changing environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Locations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated hoverfly flower visitation in three environments selected for differences in climate, altitude, and hoverfly presence (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 and 11): (i) alpine North Sikkim, India, at altitudes ranging from 2,300 m (Chapten) to 4,200 m (Chopta valley) during May 1015, 2015 and May 612, 2016; (ii) hemiboreal Uppsala, Sweden, at an altitude of 29 m during July 24August 7, 2015 and August 1424, 2016; (iii) tropical Bangalore, India, at 1,500 m altitude during November 5December 8, 2015 and November 22December 19, 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2015 season comprised data collection from individual real flowers, and the 2016 season the attractiveness of artificial lures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all locations, both cultivated gardens and wild flower patches were measured to provide different floral communities (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While agnostic to flower and hoverfly species, observations focused on hoverflies found in multiple regions, specifically Eristalis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and E. balteatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were collected at the time of day and year for hoverfly activity at that location, with floral species dictated by hoverfly choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected data from 57 real flowers in Sikkim (33 Hot and 24 Cold), 53 in Uppsala (43 Hot and 10 Cold), and 43 in Bangalore (36 Hot and 7 Cold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A flower was classified as Hot (Fig 1B) if a hoverfly landed on it, or Cold (Fig 1C) if the flower was in the immediate vicinity of Hot flowers (less_than2 m, SI Appendix, Fig S2A), but no hoverflies approached during the observation time (30 min3 h as determined by weather conditions and cue collection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hot and Cold flowers, which could be from the same species or even plant (e.g., Rhododendron sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), were selected for relative proximity to avoid local biotic and abiotic effects or plantpollinator landscape issues (27) related to spatial or temporal webs, networks, or matrices that could affect attraction (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to these stringent guidelines, not all Hot flowers were accompanied by a corresponding Cold flower unless we could confirm a lack of visitation, but all Cold flowers were selected as a function of Hot flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified data from flowers visited by any hoverfly, but Hot flowers were visited by Eristalis (22 of 33 in Sikkim, 31 of 43 in Uppsala) and Episyrphus (2 of 33 in Sikkim, 4 of 43 in Uppsala, 31 of 43 in Bangalore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Visual_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a LM-120 light meter (Amprobe) to measure local, ambient illuminance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photographs of each flower were obtained with a Sony DSC-HX1 with and without a 10- × 10-cm dull gray fabric collar around the flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corolla shapes were manually scored (SI Appendix, Tables S3), as was the relative abundance of conspecific flowers (SI Appendix, Tables S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified the surface area of each flower as seen by an approaching hoverfly using Fiji software (46) by first removing the background collar (Fig 2A, ii and iii) and converting the flower pixels to black and white (Fig 2A, iv) to quantify the black pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were converted to flower area in square centimeters by comparison with the pixels corresponding to the background fabric of known size (Fig 2A, ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Fiji software (46) to calculate Ferets diameter (solid lines, Fig 2A, i) and minimum Feret (i.e., the longest and shortest distances between two parallel tangents at the flower outline; dashed lines, Fig 2A, i), and to quantify flower circularity from 0 to 1, where 1 is a perfect circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured each flowers reflected light using an Ocean Optics Jaz-200 spectrophotometer with the optic fiber tip (25-cm, 600-m Premium Fiber, UV/VIS) at an 45° angle against the flower, using a 1-ms integration time, a boxcar of 10, and 10 averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We standardized against the reflectance from a Spectralon diffuse reflectance white standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abiotic_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a custom-built portable sensor to record humidity and CO2 from within or close to single flowers directly at the time of observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were not compared with ambient conditions as values changed rapidly due to wind, sun, or other natural perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor was custom built by Daniel Veit, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany, and incorporated the following components: CO2 sensor, SENCO21002 (MB Systemtechnik); temperature and humidity sensor, SHT75, 6675271 (RS Components); air pump, G12EB (Gardner Denver); 5 V (EXP-R24-347) and 24 V (68-066357) Voltage Regulators (Exp Tech Saarbrüken and ELV Electronik, respectively); and data acquisition, DAQ USB 6009 (National Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abiotic sensor was controlled with LabView (National Instruments) from a PC laptop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made by placing a Teflon tube connected with the air pump within 1 cm of the flower to bring local air to the sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling was performed for 3 min and averaged after removing the first 50 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Volatile_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volatile signatures were collected using 5-mm-long, 1.5-mm i.d./3.5-mm OD polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tubes (Carl Roth Rotilabo, silicone tube) modified from a protocol by Kallenbach et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubes were prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile/methanol for 3 h, dried under nitrogen, and subsequently heated from 40 °C to 260 °C at 10 °C/min to 260 °C for 160 min under 4 bar nitrogen in a Tube Conditioner (Gerstel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDMS tubes were then cooled to 25 °C, and the procedure was repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditioned PDMS tubes were stored in amber vials flushed with nitrogen at 20 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volatiles were sampled for 4 h by three PDMS tubes suspended above the flower on a steel wire at up to 3 cm and covered with an ethanol-cleaned plastic cup to protect from sunlight and wind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were stored in amber vials at 4 °C until analysis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blank tubes were taken to each sampling site, stored with the samples, and analyzed along with the samples to identify potential contaminants (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Desorption of volatiles employed a Gerstel Thermal Desorption Unit (TDU) in splitless mode and a Cooled Injection System (CIS 4) controlled by Gerstel Modular Analytical Systems Controller C506 and Gerstel Maestro 1 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDMS tubes were introduced into the TDU at 30 °C using a Gerstel MultiPurpose Sampler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 1-min delay at 30 °C, the TDU temperature was increased to 200 °C at 100 °C/min for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Desorbed volatiles were transferred at 210 °C and trapped in a silanized glass wool liner of the CIS at 50 °C using liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 0.20 min of equilibration, the CIS was ramped to 220 °C at 12 °C/s and held for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volatiles were separated and identified in solvent vent mode with a purge flow to split vent of 30 mL/min at 1.5 min and vent flow of 70 mL/min; vent pressure at 7.07 psi for 0.01 min using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with a 5977A MSD mass spectrometer using an HP-5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) with helium carrier gas at 1 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column oven was kept at 40 °C for 1 min, increased to 180 °C at 5 °C/min with a 5-min hold, and finally increased to 270 °C at 25 °C/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compounds were identified by MS in electron impact mode with ionization energy of 70 eV, a transfer temperature of 250 °C, and source and quadrupole temperatures of 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GC-MS acquisition was performed using Agilent MassHunter Workstation software B.07.02.1938.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative analysis employed Masshunter Qualitative Analysis, version B.07.00, by matching the mass spectral data of the peak with library spectra (National Institute of Standards and Technology and libraries created from standards), comparing their relative retention index (C6C30 hydrocarbons; Sigma Aldrich), comparing their elution order, and comparing their retention time with standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A silicon derivative peak, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (RRI-991, Basepeak m/z 281), was used as an internal standard, and relative ratios were determined based on normalized peak areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis_and_Model_Flowers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed two types of MVA for data sampled from each region individually, using Simca (MKS Data Analytics Solutions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used PCA (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5) to identify components that vary together and OPLS to separate variables associated with Hot or Cold flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrophotometer data gave 1,500 data points for each flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the color data swamping the dataset, we employed PCA on the color data alone and used the loadings from the significant components in the total data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Artificial lures were created using paper printed with an HP Laserjet Pro-500 Color MFP printer (M570dw; HP Inc.) with color verified by spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corolla shape was manually cut, and odor blends added to microcentrifuge tubes were placed in the center of each flower or in the ground beneath the lure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative control consisted of a large black circle (5-cm diameter) with no odor in the microcentrifuge tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created a unique positive control for each region, which closely mimicked the color, size, and odor of a real, generally attractive flower species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uppsala, we mimicked a P. fruticosa flower (Fig 4A, vii), in Sikkim a Ranunculus, and in Bangalore, a Cosmos flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the field, we placed the eight artificial lures equidistantly in two to three circles with a 90-cm diameter (distance was set to control for potential crossover effects of volatile cues from nearby lures and confirmed by PDMS measurement in standardization trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After placing the lures in the ground, we added the odor compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volatiles were replaced after 2 h for longer observational periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the circles was used to quantify the phenotypic and abiotic (not added, but measured for consistency) cues (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for potential magnet effects (28) from our lures and surrounding flowers, as well as local abiotic and biotic factors such as microclimates and community effects, we executed two types of controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, all eight model placements were randomized across trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, on several days multiple circles were createdone in a neutral area with no natural flowers and one in an attractive area where hoverflies were observed to visit nearby flowers (within 90 cm as in lure placement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a few cases, we also assessed lure height as a potential factor for attractiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference between these perturbations, suggesting that local or community factors did not affect lure attractiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During 24 h, we quantified the number of hoverfly visits to each of the eight flowers in the circle (individual flies could not be scored, although obvious multiple visits to the same lure were not counted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visits were identified as either a landing, if the hoverfly landed on the artificial lure, or as an approach, if a hoverfly performed a directed flight toward the flower (to within 510 cm; SI Appendix, Fig S6 A, C, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a comparison, we quantified visits by other insects (SI Appendix, Fig S6 B, D, and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if the visits to the different lures were significantly different from chance (equal visits to all lures), we performed a 2 test with significance of P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compared the visits to the flower lures with the visits to the positive and negative controls, respectively, using a Fishers exact test with significance of P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
