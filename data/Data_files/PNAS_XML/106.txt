title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mitochondrial functions modulate neuroendocrine, metabolic, inflammatory, and transcriptional responses to acute psychological stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In humans and animals, stress triggers multisystemic physiological responses that vary in nature and magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organisms response to stress, rather than actual stressors, leads to allostatic load that predisposes to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study in mice demonstrates that a specific cellular component that sustains life via energy transformation and intracellular signalingthe mitochondrioninfluences the organisms integrated response to psychological stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each component of the stress response assessed was modified by at least one mitochondrial defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When analyzed collectively, stress-induced neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, and transcriptional responses coalesced into unique signatures that distinguish groups based on their mitochondrial genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work shows that mitochondria can regulate complex whole-body physiological responses, impacting stress perception at the cellular and organismal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experience of psychological stress triggers neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, and transcriptional perturbations that ultimately predispose to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the subcellular determinants of this integrated, multisystemic stress response have not been defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central to stress adaptation is cellular energetics, involving mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that abnormal mitochondrial functions would differentially modulate the organisms multisystemic response to psychological stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By mutating or deleting mitochondrial genes encoded in the mtDNA [NADH dehydrogenase 6 (ND6) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] or nuclear DNA [adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)], we selectively impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain function, energy exchange, and mitochondrial redox balance in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting impact on physiological reactivity and recovery from restraint stress were then characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that mitochondrial dysfunctions altered the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis, sympathetic adrenalmedullary activation and catecholamine levels, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, circulating metabolites, and hippocampal gene expression responses to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mitochondrial defect generated a distinct whole-body stress-response signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate the role of mitochondrial energetics and redox balance as modulators of key pathophysiological perturbations previously linked to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work establishes mitochondria as stress-response modulators, with implications for understanding the mechanisms of stress pathophysiology and mitochondrial diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with normal mitochondria (WT) are compared with mice with mtDNA mutations in genes encoding ND6 and COI, decreasing electron transport chain and respiratory capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANT1/ animals have impaired ATP/ADP transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and NNT/ animals are deficient in a major intramitochondrial antioxidant system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Mouse cartoons were adapted from clker.com.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown is the experimental time course, with sequential blood collection from the tail (cohort 1), the 60-min continuous stress paradigm (cohort 2), and the no-stress control animals (cohort 3) used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the physiological role of specific mitochondrial functions, we generated mice with ubiquitously expressed, homoplasmic (i.e., whole-body) mutations in two mtDNA genes, ND6P25L (25) and COIV421A (26, 27); these mutations decrease the activity of respiratory chain complexes I and IV by 29% and 40%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we studied mice harboring deletion of nDNA genes ANT1 (28) and NNT (29); ANT1 impairs mitochondrial ATP export to the cytoplasm, and NNT regulates the intramitochondrial redox balance (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mitochondrial defects studied have human equivalents of known pathogenic nature (25, 27, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four mutant strains, in addition to wild-type control mice, were subjected to 30 min of restraint stress in a closed, ventilated tube (SI Methods), followed by 90 min of recovery, with blood drawn at T = 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min to monitor the dynamics of stress responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second cohort of mice was exposed to 60 min of uninterrupted restraint stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study design is detailed in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HPA_Axis_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All strains had low levels of corticosterone (CORT) at baseline when unperturbed, indicating no basal differences among genotypes in HPA axis activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 30-min stress exposure, mice with normal mitochondria (WT) showed a robust rise in CORT (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing an mtDNA mutation in ND6 but not COI exaggerated this effect (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, deleting the ADP/ATP translocator ANT1 caused more severe activation of the HPA axis, with CORT peaking at 170% of control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, removal of the mitochondrial redox-regulator gene NNT blunted the CORT increase to only 56% of control (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine these strain differences further, a second cohort of mice was exposed to restraint stress for 60 min, and blood was collected at the end of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mtDNA mutations showed an exaggerated stress-induced CORT elevation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 60-min levels in ANT1-deficient mice were not statistically different from control, probably because their excessive CORT response at 30 min triggered feedback inhibition of the HPA axis and thus blunted subsequent CORT output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, NNT deficiency again blunted CORT elevation, showing the lowest CORT levels across all strains (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next measured circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate CORT release by the adrenal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACTH differences did not reach statistical significance, but ACTH was lowest in CORT-hypersecreting ANT1-deficient mice and was highest in the CORT-hyposecreting NNT-deficient mice (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with enhanced feedback inhibition onto the pituitary gland in ANT1-deficient mice and the lack thereof in NNT-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an index of adrenal sensitivity, the CORT/ACTH ratio indicates adrenal hypersensitivity in the mtDNA mutant mice, whereas a trend towards greater sensitivity was observed in ANT1-deficient mice, and the lowest degree of sensitivity observed in NNT-deficient mice (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter finding was expected, based on the discovery that NNT deficiency leads to familial glucocorticoid deficiency associated with loss of cortisol-secreting cells in the adrenal cortex (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, although mitochondrial electron transport chain (ND6, COI) and energy transfer (ANT1) deficiency cause hyperactivation of the HPA axis, mitochondrial redox imbalance in NNT-deficient mice was associated with CORT hyposecretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAM_Axis_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HPA and SAM axes cooperate during the stress response and exert reciprocal effects on each other (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore circulating concentrations of the SAM-derived biogenic amines norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) were examined in blood at rest and following 60-min restraint stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected in mice with normal mitochondrial function stress increased NE levels by 110% (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the mtDNA mutations, although the ND6 defect slightly blunted the NE increase, the COI defect exaggerated it, NE levels being 38% higher in COI mutants than in WT stressed animals (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the nDNA mutants, NNT deficiency caused slightly higher NE levels in response to stress than WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the NE level did not change in response to stress in the ANT1-deficient mutants (which had the highest circulating CORT), the baseline NE levels in this mutant were elevated by 67% (two-tailed students t-test, P less_than 0.01) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same pattern as for NE was observed with E. ANT1 deficiency limited the E increase to only 26% of that in WT mice, whereas the COI mutation caused the highest stress-related rise in E levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ND6- and NNT-deficient mice, the stress-induced increase in E was mildly blunted (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same pattern was found for DA, with ANT1 deficiency causing the lowest and COI mutation the highest DA levels during stress (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, 5-HT levels were not altered with stress in WT animals or in the mice with mitochondrial defects except for COI-deficient mice, in which there was a considerable 48% increase in 5-HT from baseline (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, mitochondrial defects significantly modulated the NE and DA response to stress (two-way ANOVA stress Ã— mitochondrial genotype interaction, P less_than 0.05), whereas only a trend (P = 0.08) was present for E, and no change was seen for 5-HT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That mitochondrial functions are related to biogenic amine metabolism was indicated further when we analyzed the relationships between circulating levels of these molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemically, DA is the precursor to NE, which then is metabolized into E (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT resting and WT stressed mice, NE levels were highly correlated with its immediate precursor DA (r2 = 0.80, P less_than 0.001) (Fig S2), suggesting efficient DA-to-NE conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 FI presents significant correlations between related biogenic amines in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, although the ND6 mutation eliminated this relationship between DA and NE, ANT1 deficiency resulted in a nearly perfect correlation, with a slope nearly twice that of WT suggesting more efficient DA-to NE-conversion (Fig 3J, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This more efficient precursor-to-product (DA-to-NE) conversion may explain why ablation of ANT1 increased the baseline NE by 67% (Fig 3A) with a concomitant 30% decrease in precursor (Fig 3C) at baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because biogenic amine metabolism involves mitochondria-associated enzymes, we speculate that the higher mitochondrial content in several ANT1-deficient tissues, including muscle and heart (28) and hippocampus (Fig S2B), could contribute to this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another noteworthy point is the strong correlation (r2 = 0.72) between DA and the end product E, which was eliminated by the presence of any of the mitochondrial defects (Fig 2K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the negative correlation between NE and E in WT mice was specifically reversed (becoming positive) by the COI mutation (Fig 3L, Inset), which likewise is the only mitochondrial defect to uncouple 5-HT from DA levels (Fig 3M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate profound disruption of biogenic amine metabolism by mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energy_Metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both CORT and the catecholamines NE and E mobilize glucose and lipids into circulation, inducing a diabetes-like state of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia that could contribute to the health-damaging effects of chronic stress (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore monitored the levels of blood glucose and two related lipid species, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and triglycerides, during stress and recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stress-induced hyperglycemia was marked in mice with normal mitochondria (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hyperglycemia was exaggerated by both mtDNA defects but only significantly so in the ND6-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, deleting ANT1 markedly blunted the stress-induced hyperglycemic response (despite dramatic CORT output and elevated basal catecholamines), with glucose rising only slightly above baseline level during stress and remaining constant throughout recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, although NNT deficiency was associated with hypocortisolemia, it caused the most severe hyperglycemic response to stress (Fig 4A), possibly as a result of impaired insulin secretion and action (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because stress-induced CORT and glucose increases were measured concurrently, we could analyze their relationships as representing an aspect of the organisms sensitivity to CORT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing the various mitochondrial defects had a profound effect on the CORT/glucose relationship, as indicated by the bidirectional shift in a two-component plot juxtaposing both parameters (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift illustrates how mitochondrial defects broadly modulate stress-induced hyperglycemia, possibly by impacting systemic CORT sensitivity, as well as other factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with glucose, the stress response in lipid profiles was more moderate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During stress, NEFAs fluctuated near baseline levels in all except ANT1-deficient mice (Fig 4C), which showed markedly lower levels at baseline and increased levels during stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the recovery phase, NEFA levels remained near baseline except in the COI-deficient and ANT1-deficient groups, which experienced an increase in NEFAs during the first 30 min of recovery and then remained stable during the next hour (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For triglycerides, the same response across genotypes was observed, consisting of a steady rise during stress and decline during recovery, likely reflecting initial hepatic output followed by uptake in peripheral tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception, however, is the COI mutation, which seems to have stabilized triglycerides during stress, resulting in the lowest levels at the 30-min and 120-min time points (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the exaggerated reactive E and NE levels in COI defective mice, the transformation of triglycerides into NEFAs by the lipolytic action of catecholamines (34, 35) could account for the stabilization or lowering of triglycerides to the benefit of NEFAs during stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further the stress metabolic profiling, we measured concentrations of circulating amino acids reflecting intermediary metabolism, in the resting condition and after 60 min of restraint stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine is increased in patients with severe mitochondrial dysfunction, including patients with ANT1 mutations (28), and accordingly was increased in resting ANT1-deficient as compared with WT mice (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice with WT mitochondria, stress significantly decreased circulating levels for 13 (65%) of the 20 amino acids investigated (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the stress-reactive profiles across genotypes, a heat map with hierarchical clustering of the mean relative difference stressresting was generated, demonstrating that each mitochondrial defect induced a different amino acid response signature (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In particular, the stress-reactive amino acid profile was most distinct in mice with the respiratory chain complex I ND6 defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which class of amino acids was most discriminatory between mitochondrial defects, a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was conducted, identifying ornithine, lysine, and arginine (of variable importance in projection scores 1) as major contributors to genotype differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trio of dibasic amino acids is specifically involved in the mitochondria-associated urea cycle for the deamination of biomolecules (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inflammation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both psychosocial stressors (5) and metabolic stress (i.e., hyperglycemia) (37, 38) elevate the circulating inflammatory marker IL-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, IL-6 levels were increased substantially after 60 min of restraint stress in all mouse strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although stress induced a threefold increase in IL-6 from baseline in WT mice, the elevation in mitochondrial mutants ranged from 4.2- to 6.8-fold (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of mtDNA and nDNA defects either exaggerated or had no effect on this proinflammatory phenotype, as indicated by higher fold change from baseline (Fig 5A), absolute increase in IL-6 concentration units (Fig 5B), and recovery after stress (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hippocampal_Gene_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the impact of mitochondrial dysfunctions on stress-induced changes in gene expression, we measured hippocampal transcript levels for 26 genes previously shown to be differentially regulated after psychological stress and selected mitochondrial genes (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that mitochondrial defects altered the expression of 21 genes (81%) in response to stress (Fig S4 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When analyzed by hierarchical clustering to detect similarly behaving genes, both mtDNA mutants showed a strikingly different transcriptional response patterns to stress compared to other genotypes (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the stress-related induction of genes related to brain remodeling, synaptic function, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dynamics was lowest in WT mice, highest in mtDNA-mutant mice, and intermediary in mice with nDNA defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression of specific genes was differentially modulated by each mitochondrial dysfunction defect investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most notable was the effect on the immediate-early gene (IEG) c-Fos, indicating recent neuronal activation (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mice with normal mitochondria, c-Fos transcript levels after 30-min restraint stress followed by 90-min recovery were 1.2-fold above resting levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mitochondrial defects exaggerated this effect, except in COI-deficient mice, in which only a trend was present (1.6-fold, P = 0.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest c-Fos stress induction was caused by the mitochondrial oxidative stress-promoting NNT deficiency, with transcript levels rising 2.7-fold above resting levels (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stress significantly induced IL-6 gene expression in the hippocampus of WT mice (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both COI and ANT1 defects blunted this effect, and accordingly these strains also had the lowest circulating IL-6 levels after stress (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the ND6 defect appeared to increase IL-6 reactivity both peripherally (circulating levels) and centrally as indicated by a trend toward further elevated transcript levels in the ND6-deficient brain compared with WT at 2 h after stress (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all mitochondrial defects substantially attenuated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) down-regulation in response to stress, with a trend for NNT (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is surprising in the case of the ND6- and ANT1-deficient mice, which showed elevated circulating levels of CORT (Fig 2A) that might have been expected to potentiate rather than modulate the central GR transcriptional response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in biogenic amines also may play a role in the deregulation of GR expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mitochondria_Modify_Whole-Body_Stress-Response_Signatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we sought to determine whether mice with different mitochondrial defects exhibited divergent multisystemic stress-response signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the integrated stress response across physiological systems, the mean stressresting difference was calculated for all measured neuroendocrine, metabolic, inflammatory, and transcriptional parameters in each genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationships between each calculated parameter across the five mitochondrial genotypes are quantified in a correlation matrix (Fig 6E) with details provided in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed coordinately regulated parameters across genotypes, which composed three major clusters based mostly on their enrichment for (i) expression of brain remodeling and mitochondrial genes, neurotransmitters, and branched-chain amino acids; (ii) CORT reactivity and dibasic amino acids; (iii) circulating levels of glucose, lipids, catecholamines, CORT, and IL-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reveals coregulated physiological parameters in response to psychological stress and their correlations across mitochondrial genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When these integrated stress-reactivity data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to extract directionality and magnitude of change, each genotype was found to exhibit a unique stress-response profile (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-component model showed good explanatory power, accounting for 73.7% of the total variance in the combined dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting each genotype along both components showed that NNT deficiency caused an upward and leftward shift relative to WT, whereas ANT1 deficiency caused a directionally opposite downward and rightward shift of greater magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both mtDNA mutations caused a pronounced rightward shift in profile, with the shift being higher in magnitude with the ND6 mutation than with the COI mutation (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the physiological variables responsible for these changes for each mitochondrial defect, we then performed hierarchical clustering of all study variables (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis demonstrates that each mitochondrial defect exhibits distinctive features creating a unique multisystemic stress-response signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acute_Restraint_Stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For acute restraint stress (ARS), two different cohorts of mice were studied, as detailed in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cohort 1, mice were restrained for 30 min followed by 90 min of recovery before being killed; for cohort 2, mice were restrained for 60 min and were killed immediately to obtain trunk blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For restraint, mice were placed in ventilated 50-mL conical plastic tubes (Fig S6) as previously described (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During recovery the cohort 1 mice were returned individually to separate cages (to avoid fighting) containing home-cage bedding and a nestlet to create a familiar environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice had free access to food and water for the duration of the recovery period (30120 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ARS experimental protocol was initiated at 08:00AM for cohort 1, and all animals (including controls) were euthanized sequentially between 09:30AM and noon (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 2 and control mice were euthanized within a matched time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal experiments were performed by the same male and female experimenters wearing industrial gowns to minimize experimenter-related stress induction (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blood_and_Tissue_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before restraint, the tail was snipped (5 mm) with sharp scissors, and blood was collected: less_than5 L for glucose measured with a hand-held glucose meter (Bayer Ascensia Contour no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9556C, glucose strips no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7098C), and 50 L to measure CORT, NEFAs, and triglycerides was collected in heparinized glass capillary tubes (Fisherbrand, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22-260-950) and placed immediately at 4 Â°C for the remainder of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice then were weighed and placed into restrainers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter blood was collected from the tail at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residual tail blood was cleared twice by gentle massaging before each sampling to obtain freshly circulating blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immediately following the last time point, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation, and 500 L of trunk blood was collected in EDTA blood tubes (BD Vacutainer, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3664450) and stored immediately at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, bilateral dissection of the left and right hippocampi was performed under a binocular microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain tissue was snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at 80 Â°C until use for molecular analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole blood collected in capillary tubes (Fisherbrand no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22-260-950) was centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 Ã— g. Plasma then was collected and frozen at 80 Â°C until further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole trunk blood was transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 4,000 Ã— g for 6 min; plasma was collected and frozen immediately at 80 Â°C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neuroendocrine_and_Metabolic_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ACTH and IL-6 levels were measured from 50 L of plasma from trunk blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACTH was quantified by a competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EK00121), and IL-6 was measured by ELISA (Invitrogen no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KMC0062), according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations were determined by fitting absorbance measurements to standard curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CORT was measured using a double-antibody I125 RIA (MP Biomedicals 07-120103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma was diluted 1:100 with steroid diluent and then processed per the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were read in a scintillation counter, and concentrations were determined by fitting to a standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasma NEFAs were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Diagnostics, NEFA-HR) following the manufacturer's instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure measurements were within the linear range of detection, plasma samples from 0-min and 15-min samples were diluted 1:2, and 30-min, 60-min, and 120-min samples were diluted 1:4 in distilled H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triglycerides were similarly measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method (Stanbio Laboratory, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2200-430), according to the manufacturer's instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were diluted 1:2 in distilled H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both assays, concentrations were determined by fitting to a standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasma_Amino_Acids_and_Catecholamine_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amino acids concentrations were determined using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system, using precolumn derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catecholamine (NE, E, DA, and 5-HT) levels were determined by LC-MS using an Agilent 1260 Infinity LC system coupled to an Agilent Triple Quad 6410B MS unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma samples were prepared for LC-MS analysis as described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  80 and 81, with the following modifications: To 150 L of plasma, 150 L of water, 160 L of ethanol, and 40 L of pyridine were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catecholamine derivatization was performed by adding 20 L of ethyl chloroformate with gentle agitation until bubbles disappeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derivatized catecholamines were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was dried, reconstituted in 100 L of 0.1% of formic acid, and injected into the LC-MS system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For chromatographic separation, a Poroshell 120 column (EC-C18) (Agilent no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  699775-922; 3 Ã— 100 M) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solution A was 0.1% formic acid, and solution B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formate and 0.005% trifluoroacetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow gradient started with 50% of solution B, increasing to 60% after 3 min, 70%, after 5 min, and 100% at 615 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catecholamine retention times were NE, 2.80 min; E, 3.65 min; DA, 4.73 min; and 5-HT, 3.28 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precursorproduct used for each compound was as follows: E, m/z 382310; NE, m/z 368178; DA, m/z 370252; 5-HT, m/z 321203.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catecholamine concentrations were determined by the area under the peak for each species, fitted onto standard curves prepared with reference plasma samples spiked with known concentrations of catecholamines ranging from 3.5100 pmol/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from the frozen right hippocampus homogenized in QIAzol with a motorized pestle homogenizer (VWR no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47747-370).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, Genomic DNA Eliminator Solution was used to remove nDNA, and RNA was processed with the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  73404).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw RNA was eluted in water and DNase-treated (Turbo DNA-free kit, Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AM1907) to remove trace genomic and mtDNA, confirmed by real-time PCR using SYBR Green and primers for the nDNA gene B2m, and mtDNA gene ND1 as previously described (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA quality was assessed before and after DNase treatment on the Bioanalyzer 2100, yielding RNA integrity numbers between 8.9 and 9.1 (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA then was quantified using the Qubit RNA HS kit (Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  933834).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One microgram of RNA was used for reverse transcription to cDNA using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis kit (Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11904-018) primed with 100 ng of random hexamers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18080-044).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4331182) for genes listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different mRNA transcripts were detected for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, GR.2) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taqman Universal Master Mix, assay reagents (Life Technologies no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4440047), and diluted cDNA samples were dispensed into 384-well plates using an automated liquid-handling station (epMotion) and were read immediately on a Viia7 thermocycler per the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR cycling conditions were 95 Â°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 Â°C for 15 s and 60 Â°C for 1 min with data acquisition at 60 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending upon the abundance of the target gene initially checked by qRT-PCR, cDNA was used at different dilutions to obtain Cts between 23 and 28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gene was assayed simultaneously on all samples with a no-template control and two no-reverse transcriptase controls, with all samples measured in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reference genes, the average of the four housekeeping genes was computed (Actb, B2m, Htrp1, GAPDH), which collectively demonstrated stability both across genotypes and in response to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript expression level for each gene was determined by the Ct method (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, we observed that across all strains IEG c-Fos, but not more stable genes (e.g., GR, Mef2c), was induced within minutes after displacing the holding cage (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid induction of gene expression introduced considerable variability and increased baseline c-Fos levels in nonstressed control animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, significant increases in c-Fos transcript were detected after stress, underscoring the robustness of these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a technical point of view, these rapid-response changes underscore the importance of minimizing variability through careful timing of experimental procedures such as cage displacement, and support the assumption that minimal environmental perturbations are sufficient to elicit stress responses in group-housed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mtDNA_Copy_Number  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MtDNA copy number was measured by qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total genomic DNA was extracted and purified (DNeasy; Qiagen no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  69506) from the left hippocampus and diluted to 2.5 ng/L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of mtDNA to nDNA was quantified by the Ct method using the following primer pairs: -2 microglobulin forward (GCGCCTGTTTGCGAGTGTGC) (35) and reverse (GGAGTCTAGGGGCTCCCGCC) for nDNA, and ND1 forward (TAACCGGGCCCCCTTCGACC) and reverse (TAACGCGAATGGGCCGGCTG) for mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR mixture contained 1Ã— iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  172-5120), 400 nM primers, and 5 ng of template DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A combination of one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA with HolmSidaks multiple comparisons, 95% confidence intervals, and two-tailed students t-tests assuming unequal variance were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was established at P = 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were processed and analyzed in Microsoft Excel and Prism 6 (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering heatmaps, PCA, and PLSDA were performed with MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca) (83) and the Broad Institute GenePattern platform (www.genepattern.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For amino acid data, fold change from stressresting differences was used for hierarchical clustering using the Euclidian distance measure and Ward clustering algorithm in MetaboAnalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gene-expression data, mean change stressresting was used for hierarchical clustering using default parameters (Pearsons correlation) in GenePattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For stress-response profiling, group differences for all measured parameters were scaled using default parameters (mean-centered and divided by the SD of each variable); their correlation was evaluated by Pearsons r, and hierarchical clustering was also performed using the Euclidean distance measure and Ward clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial bioenergetics modulates the stress response, we genetically manipulated specific mitochondrial functions in mice and studied the impact of these manipulations on multiple physiological parameters in response to restraint stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All investigated neuroendocrine, metabolic, inflammatory, and transcriptional responses were perturbed by at least one of the mitochondrial defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, each mitochondrial defect produced a unique stress-response signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results therefore establish that mitochondria impact the nature and magnitude of physiological and molecular responses to a controlled psychological stressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that mitochondria influence how stress signals are translated at the subcellular and systemic levels thus providing the groundwork for investigating the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the stressdisease cascade and the role of multisystemic physiological dysregulation (i.e., allostatic load) in mitochondrial disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To adapt successfully to environmental challenges, organisms must mobilize integrated stress responses coordinated across multiple organ systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organisms ability to face daily stressors with the appropriate multisystemic physiological response and to recover effectively is necessary for its survival (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, stress adaptation has been a determining factor in species evolution (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of human health, stress maladaptation arising from dysregulation of multiple organ systems leads to allostatic load, which contributed to translating chronic stress to disease (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sources of chronic psychological and social stressors leading to physiological perturbations and allostatic load are pervasive in modern society, and understanding the subcellular mechanisms that determine stressors influence on the biology (i.e., psycho-somatic mechanisms) is necessary to design effective strategies to counter the resulting disease susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several lines of work support the notion that mitochondria impact stress physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the population, about 1 in 4,300 individuals harbors pathogenic mtDNA defects (42), similar to those of the mtDNA mutant mouse models deficient in ND6 and COI, which impair respiratory chain function and thus limit energy production capacity (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical stressors such as exercise increase energy demand and induce metabolic changes across organ systems, which normally are matched by a defined increment in breathing effort, heart rate, and secretion of catecholamines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, patients with mtDNA mutations exposed to exercise of the same absolute intensity as controls with normal mtDNA show exaggerated ventilatory and cardiovascular responses out of proportion to the actual workload (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, exercise-induced SAM axis activation is exaggerated in patients with mitochondrial disorders, with catecholamine levels escalating two- to threefold above those of individuals with normal mtDNA (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our results (Fig 5A), patients with ANT1 mutations also show elevated baseline levels of systemic NE and total catecholamines (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-reactive axes are thus under mitochondrial regulation, whereby mitochondrial dysfunction alters the perceived physiological severity of various stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, as in our study, the impact of mitochondrial defects appears to consist in an exaggerated activation of allostatic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to activating the SAM axis, exercise as a physiological stressor also engages the HPA axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, individuals showing HPA hyperresponsiveness to exercise also show greater reactivity to psychological stress (45), suggesting that common systemic factor(s) may underlie neuroendocrine responses to stressors of various nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being preserved across tissues, mitochondrial bioenergetics could fulfill the role of systemic neuroendocrine modulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is consistent with the notion that, by supplying the majority of cellular energy, mitochondria contribute to the organisms overall adaptive capacity (6, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, mice with multiple mtDNA variations (47) and with heteroplasmic mixture of two different mtDNAs (48) exhibit altered catecholamine levels, neurobehavior, and cognition during stressful conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although specific mitochondrial functions have been postulated to be key components of the stress response (14), the effects of targeted perturbations of mitochondrial functions on systemic stress responses had not been defined previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, specific mitochondrial dysfunctions led to a mismatch between different allostatic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CORT is the major glucogenic hormone, acting in part by mobilizing hepatic glycogen stores and inducing insulin resistance in peripheral muscles to increase blood glucose and preserve it for central use by the brain (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CORT and glucose therefore are physiologically linked parameters under normal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the ablation of ANT1, although leading to the most pronounced CORT response (to a concentration nearly double that of WT), caused only a modest stress-induced rise in blood glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, NNT deficiency had the opposite effect; with very little CORT secretion because of adrenal cortex dysfunction (31), NNT deficiency was associated with severe hyperglycemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion likely contribute to this effect (29, 33) and could explain why psychological stress during the Trier social stress test (TSST) in humans preferentially favors hyperglycemia in those with preexisting diabetes and insulin resistance (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, stress-related cortisol levels also exhibit racial and ethnic differences (50), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a persons ancestors geographical origin (e.g., African American vs. European) associates with variations in mtDNA sequence (i.e., haplogroups) that can impact mitochondrial functions (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, given the accumulating evidence that mitochondria modulate HPA axis function, inherited differences in mitochondrial function possibly could contribute to observed interindividual differences in HPA axis reactivity and associated metabolic perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another apparent mismatch induced by mitochondrial dysfunction was the dissociation of ACTH and CORT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased circulating ACTH released from the pituitary gland is normally associated with proportional increased CORT output from the adrenal glands (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in mice with NNT deletion, which exhibit adrenal insufficiency and hypocortisolemia (53), this relationship was abrogated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of this mismatch may relate to the loss of specific CORT-producing adrenocortical cells by apoptosis (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reasons for the contrasting higher CORT output in relation to ACTH (i.e., more sensitive adrenal glands) in mice with mtDNA mutations and ANT1 deletion (Fig 2C) are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, clinically, the dissociation of ACTH and CORT has an unknown etiology but indicates a pathophysiological state (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its etiology possibly represents differences in the innervation of the adrenal glands by the autonomic nervous system or other factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results and those of others (31) show that changes in mitochondrial function could account for such physiological mismatch and may contribute to interindividual differences in HPA axis function and CORT dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolic profiles and their modulation by mitochondrial function may impact long-term disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolic profiles as defined by circulating plasma levels of amino acids (54) and lipids (55) are robust predictors of diabetes and cognitive decline, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this light, two notable conclusions may be drawn from our data: (i) acute psychological stress alters metabolic profiles involving glucose, lipids, and amino acids, possibly contributing to long-term disease susceptibility (6); and (ii) mitochondrial functions significantly modulate the effects of psychological stress on metabolic perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conclusions are consistent with the central role of mitochondria in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and intermediary metabolism and their involvement in the pathogenesis of several common complex age-related diseases (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our results indicate that mitochondria participate in the processing of subcellular stress signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A given stressor does not directly determine the magnitude or nature of the resulting physiological response (40), because stress signals are processed, or interpreted by the integrated action of the brain and other systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, contextual factors and psychological anticipatory states influence physiological CORT reactivity to the standardized TSST (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catecholamine secretion by the SAM axis also is modulated by perceived coping self-efficacy (i.e., one's self-perceived ability to cope with a threat) (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, metabolic factors modulate stress responses: Oral glucose uptake amplifies the CORT response to psychological stress (60), and activation of the HPA axis during the TSST also is modified by genetic variations in the serotonin receptor 1A gene and prior exposure to stressful life events (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, intrinsic metabolic and genetic factors modulate how stressors are interpreted and the magnitude of resulting physiological responses from the SAM and HPA axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we isolated mitochondrial function as a single independent variable by studying syngenic mice that harbored different mitochondrial gene variants living in a controlled environment, and evaluated its effect on multisystemic stress responses to a standardized psychological stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that the mitochondria act as intracellular processors of stress signals capable of modulating downstream systemic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One interpretation of these findings is that mitochondria perturb normal communication between various cells and organs involved in the stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the brain, mitochondria directly regulate communication between neurons by modifying synaptic structures and neurotransmitter release (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cells, mitochondrial dysfunction may repress transmembrane cellcell communication machinery (18), possibly impairing cellular communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the extent to which the HPA axis secretes CORT, an endocrine signal of communication between organs, is largely blunted by NNT deficiency (Fig 2A) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same line of reasoning applies to mitochondria-induced perturbations of other endocrine signals, such as catecholamines by the SAM axis, and specific metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by affecting the production of signals conveying information between organs and cells, mitochondrial dysfunction may impair the normal communication required for stress appraisal and thus may alter overall stress response patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain function appears to be particularly sensitive to the modulatory effect of mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are preferentially affected in patients with systemic mitochondrial diseases (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria are emerging as potent neuromodulators (64) capable of both influencing neuronal development (65) and dynamically regulating synaptic transmission (62, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, improving mitochondrial antioxidant capacity by the overexpression of catalase specifically in mitochondria increases hippocampal-dependent memory and reduces anxiety (67), further substantiating the notion that changes in mitochondria beyond ATP production can serve a regulatory role on brain function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, animals selectively bred for their high stress-reactivity profiles have less active hippocampi with proteomes that differ most significantly in specific mitochondrial metabolic enzymes (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings extend these observations by demonstrating that mitochondria modulate the extent to which different genes are expressed in response to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the persistent activation of IEGs (i.e., c-Fos) was promoted by all mitochondrial defects, the regulation of other genes (e.g., IL-6, mGlu2/3, GR, MR) was reversed or blunted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with recent findings that mitochondrial dysfunction can exert robust and bidirectional regulation across the majority (70%) of genes within the human genome (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stressful experiences, on their own, do not cause damage or disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, it is the organisms responses to stress that have the potential to result in physiological dysregulation and dysfunction, culminating in allostatic load and disease (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates how mitochondria can shape the major stressresponse pathways, thereby recalibrating the multisystemic response to psychological stress (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed in humans to determine if inherited interpersonal polymorphic differences in mtDNA (i.e., haplogroups) and other common mtDNA mutations (42, 69) are sufficient to modify physiological responses to psychosocial stressors and thus mediate the association between stress exposure and later mental and somatic (i.e., psychosomatic) illness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allostatic load driven by mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to mitochondrial disease pathogenesis and clinical variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Determining whether the accumulation of functional and structural changes in mitochondria, i.e., mitochondrial allostatic load (6), acquired across the lifespan can modify a persons physiological response to environmental challenges will also be important to ascertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial function is impacted by diet and exercise/sedentary behaviors (70), which can notably influence the accumulation of mtDNA damage with age (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging evidence indicates that early-life exposure to stress and psychopathology are associated with alterations in leukocyte mtDNA copy number in adulthood (72, 73) and with changes in mitochondrial gene expression in the brain (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, new-generation antidepressive agents (e.g., l-acetylcarnitine) are known to potentiate some aspects of mitochondrial function (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, current evidence thus suggests that mitochondrial bioenergetics may play a role in translating stressful experiences into abnormal psychological states and their related somatic symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this emerging paradigm, mitochondria lie at the interface of genetic and environmental factors contributing to disease trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting mitochondria thus may open new avenues to promote biological resilience and to understand further the bioenergetic and allostatic mechanisms by which environmental stressors promote disease across the lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee from the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse strains used for this study were generated on the C57bl/6eij (WT and ND6-, COI-, and ANT1-deficient) and C57bl/6j (NNT-deficient) backgrounds and were bred in our laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-body homoplasmic point mutations in the mtDNA were introduced in two different genes, each encoding a subunit of the respiratory chain ND6 G13997AP25 (25) and COI T6589CV421A (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear DNA deletions of ANT1 (28) and NNT truncation (29) were performed as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the NNT-deficient stain is characterized by NNT truncation and mitochondrial redox imbalance (76), other variants on this genetic background could contribute to the observed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male mice between 10 and 13 mo of age were housed in the same room, three to five mice per cage, on a 11-h:13-h light:dark cycle until the morning of the experiments, and were fed standard chow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experimental procedures including the acute restraint stress procedure, blood and tissue collection, neuroendocrine and metabolic measurements, plasma amino acids and catecholamine levels, gene expression by real-time PCR, mtDNA copy number, and statistical analyses are described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
