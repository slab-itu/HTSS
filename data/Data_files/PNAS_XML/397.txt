CD4+ T-cellindependent mechanisms suppress reactivation of latent tuberculosis in a macaque model of HIV coinfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the World Health Organization, one in three humans is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 10% of these individuals risk developing active, clinical tuberculosis (TB) over their lifetimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus increases this risk substantially, with depletion of CD4+ T cells believed to drive disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a minority of coinfected individuals can control the infection, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling coinfection using macaques, we discovered that one-third of the animals maintained latency despite complete ablation of lung CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that protective immune responses mediated by CD8+ T cells and B cells correlate with TB control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have important implications in development of both prophylactic and therapeutic measures against TB and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The synergy between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV in coinfected patients has profoundly impacted global mortality because of tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV significantly increases rates of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) to active disease, with the decline in CD4+ T cells believed to be the major causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, nonhuman primates were coinfected with Mtb and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), recapitulating human coinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of animals exhibited rapid reactivation of Mtb replication, progressing to disseminated TB and increased SIV-associated pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a severe loss of pulmonary CD4+ T cells was observed in all coinfected macaques, a subpopulation of the animals was still able to prevent reactivation and maintain LTBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigation of pulmonary immune responses and pathology in this cohort demonstrated that increased CD8+ memory T-cell proliferation, higher granzyme B production, and expanded B-cell follicles correlated with protection from reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal mechanisms that control SIV- and TB-associated pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CD4-independent protective immune responses warrant further studies in HIV coinfected humans able to control their TB infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these findings will provide insight into natural immunity to Mtb and will guide development of novel vaccine strategies and immunotherapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical_Correlates_of_Infection_During_Mtb_SIV_Coinfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thirty-seven macaques were exposed to low-dose aerosols of Mtb CDC1551, delivering 25 colony-forming units (CFUs) into the lungs (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery in a low dose, as opposed to a high dose (e.g., 1,000 CFUs) (14) or intermediate dose (e.g., 100 CFUs) (26), was used to establish a state of LTBI devoid of clinical signs of active TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were infected by Mtb, as evidenced by conversion of tuberculin skin test (TST) and PRIMAGAM (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macaques remaining TST/PRIMAGAM-positive at 7 wk postinfection but not exhibiting symptoms of disease, such as elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP), high thoracic radiograph (chest X-rays, CXR) scores, or the presence of culturable Mtb in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), were deemed asymptomatic and the infection was classified as latent TB (LTB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantifiable measures described above were paired with inputs from our veterinarians about respiratory rates, anorexia, pyrexia, and progressive weight loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the 37 animals exposed to Mtb, 10 animals developed active TB (ATB) and were excluded from the subsequent LTB/reactivation protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subset and six historical controls (n = 16) were used to obtain clinical, microbiological, and lung pathology data for comparison and were defined as the ATB control group (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-seven animals did not show signs of ATB by week 9 after Mtb infection, such as progressive weight loss (Fig 1C), pyrexia (Fig 1D), CRP elevation (Fig 1E), or radiological presence of pulmonary granulomatous disease (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group was classified as the LTB group and animals were randomly divided into two subgroups either to receive SIV intravenously (defined as the LTB test group, n = 14), or remain SIV-naive (defined as the LTB control group, n = 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Survival was used as a key reporter of reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals developing extensive TB after SIV coinfection were termed reactivators, and these animals were humanely killed at prescribed time points after evaluation by our veterinarian, as described in detail in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nine Mtb/SIV coinfected animals of 14 (64%) in the LTB test group showed reactivated TB and were killed within 1319 wk after Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five coinfected animals (36%) survived, did not meet the clinical criteria for reactivated TB, and were termed nonreactivators (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cohort was killed 1921 wk after Mtb infection for collection of tissues for analysis following necropsy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these animals maintained LTBI throughout acute SIV infection, they did not develop AIDS within the 1012 wk after SIV challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of the animals in the LTB control group (11 of 13, 84%) and none of the animals in the active control group (0 of 16, 0%) survived to the termination of the study (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two animals in the LTB control group spontaneously reactivated despite remaining SIV-uninfected throughout the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survival difference between the coinfected animals in the LTB test group and the animals in the LTB control group was significant, using both a Wilcoxon (P = 0.0002) and a log-rank (P = 0.0005) test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, the ATB control group displayed significant weight loss, recapitulating the wasting seen in human TB (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent to SIV coinfection, both reactivators and nonreactivators exhibited significant weight loss compared with the LTB control group, likely because of progressive SIV infection (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike with weight loss, for pyrexia, results for reactivators were significantly different from those of both nonreactivators and the LTB control group, with temperature increases similar to those of the ATB control group (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactivators and ATB group also displayed higher CRP levels in the peripheral blood, an indication of severe inflammation (Fig 1E), and they exhibited identical patterns when CXRs were analyzed for the severity of granulomatous disease (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these clinical manifestations highlight the robustness of the NHP model of coinfection for emulating human active, latent, and reactivated TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microbiological_Aspects_of_ATB__LTB__and_Coinfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the bacterial burden in BAL and various organs of the infected macaques following euthanasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following SIV infection, reactivators exhibited mean BAL CFU values significantly higher (104) than those of nonreactivators (102) or animals in the LTB control group, with results indistinguishable from those of animals with ATB (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, two of five nonreactivating animals showed detectable, culturable Mtb in BAL at the endpoint of the study, indicating potential late reactivation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approximate mean of 100 bacilli per gram could be cultured from the lung of animals with LTB, indistinguishable from the nonreactivators (P = 0.988), whereas a highly significant, 100-fold increase in bacilli could be cultured from the lungs of reactivators (Fig 2B); these reactivators had as much culturable Mtb in their lungs as animals with ATB (104 CFU per gram).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured Mtb burdens in extrathoracic tissues, including bronchial lymph node (Fig 2C), spleen (Fig 2D), liver (Fig S1), and kidney (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In bronchial lymph node, the CFU burden in both the ATB group and reactivators was significantly higher than in the LTB control group and nonreactivators (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, reactivators not only harbored greater bacterial burden in their spleen, liver, and kidney relative to LTB and nonreactivators but also relative to animals with ATB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These microbiological results display similar qualities to human TB/HIV coinfection, where high bacterial burden and increased dissemination have been well documented (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Peripheral_Viral_Loads  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because differential viral replication and titers could possibly explain the differences in the reactivator versus nonreactivator subgroups with respect to reactivation, we measured plasma viral loads after SIV infection in four randomly selected animals from both groups, using previously described methods (22) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean log10 plasma viral load at 2 wk after SIV was 7.02 and 6.70 for reactivators and nonreactivators, respectively, and these differences were not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma viral loads were not significantly different between the two groups at any time point, clearly suggesting that disparate peripheral viral loads were not the reason for differential reactivation of LTB in the two subsets of the LTB test group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TB-_and_SIV-Associated_Pathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pulmonary pathology analyses correlated well with clinical and microbiological findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coinfected animals that reactivated exhibited significantly more pulmonary lesions relative to nonreactivators and animals from the LTB control group, as determined by gross (Fig S2) and histopathological examination (Fig 3 AD), and by morphometric quantitation (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the LTB control group animals (Fig 3B) and nonreactivators (Fig 3D) had significantly fewer granulomas, with an average of 45% of the total lung area affected by TB lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animals also displayed reduced TB-related pathology, inclusive of edema, pneumonia, and generalized foci of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, reactivators (Fig 3C) displayed 30% lung involvement on average, comparable to an average involvement of 40% of the lung of animals with ATB (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the differences in the extent of lung pathology between reactivators and nonreactivators were highly significant (P = 0.004), despite a smaller group size for the latter (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All coinfected animals demonstrated lesions consistent with SIV-induced pulmonary pathology, including lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and septal thickening (Fig 4 A and E), type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig 4 A and F), increased accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages (Fig 4G), lymphocytic perivasculitis (Fig 4 B and H), and lymphangitis (Fig 4 C and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas all coinfected animals displayed signs of SIV-induced pathology, reactivators showed significantly increased total pathology (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, reactivators scored higher than nonreactivators on each measure of pathology (Fig 4 FI), with the exception of septal thickening (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, ZiehlNeelsen staining revealed a high bacterial burden in the lymphocytic perivasculitis lesions, suggesting a possible causality of dissemination to extrathoracic organs (Fig 4J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the peripheral viral loads were comparable, the increased SIV-associated pathology may suggest increased viral replication in the lung of reactivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore further assessed pulmonary viral replication by analyzing lung sections for the presence of SIV mRNA by in situ hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral titers in serum were similar among all SIV coinfected animals, whereas reactivators harbored significantly more SIV-infected cells (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of cells infected by SIV were CD3+ T cells (Fig 5C), a few macrophages (CD68+CD163+) were also SIV+ (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, together with the increased TB-associated pathology, demonstrate that both pathogens appear to synergize to overcome the immune control at the microenvironmental level of the granuloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immune_Correlates_of_Mtb_SIV_Coinfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied the accumulation of various immune cell types in both whole blood and BAL in a subset of animals from each coinfected group to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of SIV-mediated reactivation of LTBI in macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SIV coinfection led to a massive depletion of CD4+ T cells in the lungs of all coinfected animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of CD4+ T cells in BAL of reactivators and nonreactivators dropped to 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively, of CD3+ T cells 3 wk after SIV infection (Fig 6A), in contrast to 31% in the LTB control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the depletion of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood was actually significantly greater in nonreactivators, comprising 26% of CD3+ lymphocytes compared with 40% in reactivators (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater depletion of CD4+ T cells in tissues relative to the peripheral blood following SIV infection is well documented in both humans and macaques (30), and this was consistent with our findings that the fold-change in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the BAL of reactivators and nonreactivators was 12- and 13-fold, respectively (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the comparative change in whole blood was only twofold in both reactivators and nonreactivators (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate the comparable extent of CD4+ T-cell depletion from the lungs of animals with two distinct clinical outcomes after SIV coinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells in BAL of reactivators and nonreactivators were not significantly different (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our findings in BAL, CD4+ T cells taken from the lung at killing displayed similar frequencies, comprising 4% of total CD3+ T cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, characterization of lung sections by staining showed comparable spatial distributions of CD4+ cells in pulmonary lesions from both reactivators and nonreactivators (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that comparable depletion of CD4+ T cells occurred in both reactivators and nonreactivators and therefore that this depletion is not responsible for the varying clinical outcomes among the coinfected macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When comparing different subgroups of the relatively few CD4+ T cells in BAL, there was no significant difference in the percentage of central memory (CD28+CD95+) cells (Fig 6D) or their rate of proliferation, as marked by Ki67+ (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing effector memory cells (CD28CD95+), reactivators had a significantly higher percentage of cells in BAL (Fig 6F), albeit the rate of turnover was not significantly different (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the absolute number of central (TCM) and effector (TEM) memory cells sharply declined after SIV infection, such that both reactivators and nonreactivators retained 4% and 5% TCM, and 15% and 13% TEM, respectively (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing the absolute numbers of memory cells responding, the difference in TCM was not significant between the two groups (Fig S3), whereas reactivators had significantly more TEM in BAL 7 wk after Mtb infection and 3 wk after SIV infection (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the number of naive (CD28+CD95) cells revealed that reactivators and nonreactivators retained 52% and 65%, respectively, indicating that truly naive cells are spared from SIV-induced depletion (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the percentage of CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells (CD25+Foxp3+) found in BAL 3 wk after SIV infection was significantly higher in nonreactivators (Fig 6H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in CD4+ Tregs in nonreactivators, coincident with decreased CD4+ TEM, suggests a role for these regulatory cells in limiting disease-causing pathology, which was increased in reactivators (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there were significantly more TCM in the periphery of nonreactivators (Fig S4), this finding was not observed at the site of infection (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, there was no marked difference in the percentage of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood expressing the lymph node homing marker CCR7 or the tissue homing marker CCR5 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The percentage of CD8+ T cells recruited to BAL expectedly increased because of SIV coinfection, thus contributing to a sharp decrease in the CD4:CD8 ratio in all coinfected animals, irrespective of their reactivation status (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6C and 7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage or the number of central and effector memory CD8+ T cells present in the BAL after coinfection (Fig 7 C and E), nonreactivators however had a significantly higher rate of turnover, as marked by Ki67+, indicating these cells were active and proliferating (Fig 7 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further study the role of CD8+ T cells at the site of infection, we assessed the extent of granzyme B production by immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactivators displayed significantly reduced production of granzyme B in the lungs compared with the nonreactivators (Fig 7 GI), indicating a correlation between increased granzyme B production, which occurs at least partly within CD8+ T cells (31, 32), and increased control of both SIV- and TB-associated pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of cells expressing granzyme B were CD3+ lymphocytes (Fig 7H), natural killer (NK) cells likely represent the CD3 cells producing granzyme B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used flow cytometry to further assess whether the disparate responses in the two subgroups following SIV coinfection could result from changes in the profiles of NK T cells (NKT) or NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the percentage and absolute numbers of NKT (CD3+CD8+CD56+) and NK (CD3CD8+CD56+) cells, including subsets expressing perforin, were not significantly different based on the reactivation phenotype (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was a general trend toward slightly greater accumulation of both NKT and NK cells in the lungs of nonreactivators relative to reactivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data showing increased proliferation in both the central and effector memory populations lend credence to the roles of CD8+ T cells and granzyme B in the control of Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BALT_Proximal_to_Granulomas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously demonstrated that the presence of inducible lymphoid follicles, also termed inducible BALT (iBALT), correlates with protection from TB (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals with LTBI harbor greater areas of iBALT within lung lesions relative to animals with ATB, in which BALT was replaced by neutrophils (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our current study, nonreactivators often formed multiple, well-organized areas of lymphoid follicles, as observed by H&E staining, as well as by chromogenic staining against CD20 (Fig 8 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is complete ablation of CD4+ T cells in the lungs, BALT still persisted in nonreactivators, occupying a greater average percentage area of the lungs than in reactivators (Fig 8 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection strongly correlates with extensive BALT formation as we have observed that macaques mucosally vaccinated with a BALT-inducing isogenic mutant, Mtb sigH, exhibited complete protection upon lethal challenge (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, iBALT in nonreactivators exclusively harbored tingible body macrophages (Fig 8G), specialized macrophages that are involved in germinal-center reactions (35) and that are especially critical for the phagocytosis of apoptotic B cells undergoing affinity maturation (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our findings indicate that protection from reactivation of Mtb infection occurs independently of CD4+ T-cell depletion and correlates rather with increased levels of iBALT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One-third of the worlds population has LTBI, and yet the mechanisms by which LTBIs are controlled have not been defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergence of the HIV epidemic revealed the significance of CD4+ T cells in controlling TB in humans (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our study, a subset of coinfected macaques retained control of LTBI despite complete ablation of pulmonary CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection from reactivation correlated with enhanced CD8+ T-cell function, increased iBALT persistence, and the resulting effects on local pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise roles of these CD4-independent components in HIV coinfected humans warrant further investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite contrasting clinical outcomes, every coinfected macaque in our study exhibited indistinguishable pulmonary CD4+ T-cell depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonreactivating animals had an enhanced effector CD8+ T-cell population, conceivably leading to suppression of both viral replication and SIV-related pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, animals with reactivation TB had lower effector CD8+ T-cell counts and showed increased SIV- as well as TB-associated pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To counter immune control, it is highly likely that the two pathogens synergize within the lungs of reactivated animals and exacerbate pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by data that reactivators had significantly more SIV-infected cells within the granuloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the perivascular lesions were significantly aggravated, had high bacterial burdens, and possibly led to increased bacterial dissemination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the colocalization of the virions and the bacilli within the same cells in granulomatous lesions has been described previously (22), their interactions in this local environment remain undercharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that, in reactivators, microenvironmental changes provide specific niches conducive to replication of both pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, we hypothesize that CD8+ T-cellmediated responses can suppress SIV replication in tuberculous granulomas and limit SIV-induced pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In nonreactivators, both CD8+ T-cell proliferation and function were found to be increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the percentages of CD8+ T cells recruited to the lung were similar, the proliferation of central and effector memory CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in nonreactivators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, granzyme B expression in CD3+ T cells suggests a correlation between the presence of functional CD8+ T cells and protection from SIV-mediated reactivation in primates (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with previous observations that macaques not only lose bacillus CalmetteGuérin vaccination-induced protective immunity upon experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells, but also reactivate Mtb infections suppressed by chemotherapy at a higher rate (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the presence of CD3 cells producing granzyme lends credibility to the role of NK cells in mediating control of both SIV and Mtb infection (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effector role of CD8+ T cells in the control of Mtb infection in humans has recently been described to inversely correlate with bacterial load in sputum (39), and HIV coinfection can impair Mtb-specific CD8+ T degranulation and proliferation (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the effector roles of CD8+ T cells in curtailing reactivation need to be further investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to CD8+ T cells and altered pathology, we also found that the presence of BALT proximal to the granuloma strongly correlates with control of TB reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we have shown that increased BALT presence was associated with increased protection in mice, NHPs, and humans (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, protective immunity to TB, induced by a novel vaccine, also correlated strongly with the presence of BALT (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that the persistence of BALT increased protection from reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise role of B cells in TB infection control remains to be determined, existing evidence suggests that B cells are required for optimal development of immune responses against Mtb (15, 16, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the presence of tingible body macrophages in BALT suggests that B cells are undergoing affinity maturation or that cross-priming of CD8+ T cells occurs within these lymphoid follicles, allowing site-directed activation of macrophages (33, 35, 42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that these protective lymphoid follicles proximal to the granuloma lead to localized T-cell activation and enhanced B-cell and humoral immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immune correlates of protective immunity and the mechanism of HIV-induced enhanced susceptibility to reactivation TB are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic studies into CD4+ T-cellindependent immune control of human TB, particularly the roles of CD8+ T cells, B cells, and the resulting pathologies, are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge will facilitate design of novel interventions against TB, including vaccines and immunotherapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NHP_Infection__Sampling__Clinical_Procedures__and_Euthanasia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, and were performed in strict accordance with NIH guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior data suggested two different outcomes were possible when latently Mtb-infected macaques were exposed to SIV: reactivation in a majority of animals or continued latency in a small subset (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-seven specific pathogen-free, retrovirus-free, mycobacteria-naive, adult rhesus macaques that were bred and housed at the Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) and that ranged from 3 to 12 y of age were assigned to two groups, based on power calculations to detect, with sufficient power, statistically significant differences between the reactivating and nonreactivating groups following coinfection with SIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All macaques were aerosol-exposed, as described previously (14, 22, 26, 44), to a low dose (25 CFU implanted) of Mtb CDC1551.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of the macaques was also exposed approximately 9 wk later to 300 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of SIVmac239 administered intravenously in 1 mL saline, as described previously (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control subset received an equal volume of saline intravenously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Criteria for killing included presentation of four or more of the following conditions: (i) body temperatures consistently greater than 2 °F above preinfection values for 3 or more weeks in a row; (ii) 15% or more loss in body weight; (iii) serum CRP values higher than 10 mg/mL for 3 or more consecutive weeks, CRP being a marker for systemic inflammation that exhibits a high degree of correlation with active TB in macaques (22, 23); (iv) CXR values higher than 2 on a scale of 04; (v) respiratory discomfort leading to vocalization; (vi) significant or complete loss of appetite; and (vii) detectable bacilli in BAL samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were collected before and after Mtb infection, as well as after SIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSTs were performed 1 or 2 wk before infection and at 3 wk after Mtb infection, as previously described (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXRs were acquired 2 wk before Mtb infection and at 3, 7, 11, and 14 wk after Mtb infection, as previously described (14, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CXRs were scored by veterinary clinicians in a blinded fashion on a subjective scale of 04, with a score of 0 denoting normal lung and a score of 4 denoting severe tuberculous pneumonia, as previously described (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before vaccination/infection, all 37 animals received a normal score of 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was drawn 1 or 2 wk before Mtb infection and then weekly thereafter for measuring complete blood count and serum chemistry (22, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood collected in EDTA tubes (Sarstedt AG & Co.) was used for whole-blood flow cytometry using the panels described earlier (14, 26, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAL samples were obtained, as previously described, 2 wk before Mtb infection, again at 3, 7, 11, and 14 wk (22, 26), and then analyzed for CFUs and flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humane endpoints were predefined in the animal use protocol and applied as a measure of reduction of discomfort (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TNPRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal-related procedures and activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At necropsy, lung, spleen, and liver tissues were collected and processed, as previously described, using two sections of pulmonary tissue that represented every lung lobe in at least one sample (14); CFU were determined per gram of tissue (22, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lung pathology at necropsy was determined as described previously (22, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TB pathology was determined for multiple sections in each lung and averaged for each animal in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SIV-induced pathology was reported per section from three reactivators and three nonreactivators, with multiple sections analyzed per animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flow cytometry was performed on whole blood and BAL samples from all animals, as previously described (14, 26, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescent immunohistochemistry, chromogenic staining, and in situ hybridization were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, as previously described (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#
