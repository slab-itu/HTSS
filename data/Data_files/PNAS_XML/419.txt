Genetic mapping of male pheromone response in the European corn borer identifies candidate genes regulating neurogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most male moths find their mates by following species-specific pheromones released by females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the importance of pheromone communication in reproductive isolation, much is still unknown about its genetic basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated male responses in the two pheromone races of the European corn borer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reasonable hypothesis, that males of the two races differ in the genes encoding the receptor proteins that respond to the two pheromone components, was previously rejected without a convincing alternative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that instead male choice was correlated with genes affecting growth and differentiation of the nerve cells that may contain these receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpected finding resolves the dilemma and points to another layer of complexity in the evolution of sexual pheromone communication systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sexual pheromone communication system of moths is a model system for studies of the evolution of reproductive isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females emit a blend of volatile components that males detect at a distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species differences in female pheromone composition and male response directly reinforce reproductive isolation in nature, because even slight variations in the species-specific pheromone blend are usually rejected by the male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms by which a new pheromone signalresponse system could evolve are enigmatic, because any deviation from the optimally attractive blend should be selected against.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the genetic mechanisms enabling a switch in male response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a quantitative trait locus-mapping approach to identify the genetic basis of male response in the two pheromone races of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male response to a 99:1 vs. a 3:97 ratio of the E and Z isomers of the female pheromone is governed by a single, sex-linked locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the chromosomal region most tightly linked to this locus contains genes involved in neurogenesis but, in accordance with an earlier study, does not contain the odorant receptors expressed in the male antenna that detect the pheromone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implies that differences in the development of neuronal pathways conveying information from the antenna, not differences in pheromone detection by the odorant receptors, are primarily responsible for the behavioral response differences among the males in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with other moth species reveals a previously unexplored mechanism by which male pheromone response can change in evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crossing_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hybrid crosses were set up between the Z and E strains, and resulting male progeny were backcrossed to Z-strain females for seven consecutive generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each generation we scored behavioral responses to Z, E, and hybrid pheromone blends using artificial lures for 50150 males (fewer for the third and fourth backcrossed generations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each generation, one of the scored males with a hybrid phenotype was chosen for backcrossing to a Z-strain female to produce the next generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 649 males were phenotyped, using the wind tunnel setup described in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the last generation of backcrossing, DNA was isolated from all 649 phenotyped males, and genotypes were scored at nine sex-linked markers (kettin, five ORs, ldh, bgi012356, and bgi03892).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preliminary scoring showed a loss of genetic polymorphism correlated with behavioral response in the last two backcross generations, probably because of the inadvertent selection of a homozygous male for continuation of the backcrossing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, only 470 males from the first five generations could be used for final mapping of 21 sex-linked genes and the QTL analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also genotyped 143 females (20 per generation) to aid in map construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative intensity of individual male behavioral responses to each of the pheromone blendsZ, hybrid (H), and Ewas summarized using a quantitative score that assigned numerical weights to two key behaviors previously shown to be correlated with directed flight toward the pheromone source (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behaviors are wing-fanning, a rapid vibration of the wings while remaining in a stationary position, and extrusion of the hair pencil scales at the tip of the abdomen, which release the male pheromone during courtship at close range (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wing-fanning could be strong and continuous or weak and intermittent (onoff), and hair pencil extrusion could be present or absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latency time, i.e., the number of seconds between presentation of the stimulus and the initiation of wing-fanning, was also factored in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial set of numerical weights for these behaviors was first chosen arbitrarily, such that the scored response to a given pheromone blend increased with the occurrence and intensity of wing-fanning, increased more with a shorter latency time, and increased even more with the extrusion of hair pencil scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from the three lures were combined by subtracting the H and E lure responses from the Z lure response, so that Z-strain males would have the highest score, because these are male-informative backcross progeny from a pure Z-strain mother.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypic scores then were calculated for each male (see Fig S1A for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial QTL analysis, the parameter set of numerical weights was optimized using a discriminant function approach, to discriminate more precisely between the responses of Resp locus homozygotes vs. Resp locus heterozygotes (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Linkage_Maps  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the contribution of each chromosome to male behavioral response, a preliminary map using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers covering all 31 chromosomes was constructed, using data from the 120 progeny of the first backcross generation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then mapped an additional 21 genes on the Z chromosome using the progeny of all backcrosses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes were chosen based on their Z-chromosomal location in Bombyx mori, and their orthologs in O. nubilalis were PCR-amplified using degenerate primers designed from multispecies sequence alignments (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the gene order in O. nubilalis between kettin at one end and paraplegin near the other end was the same as in B. mori.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not map any genes surrounding Tpi, where Wadsworth et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39) have detected a region of low recombination that probably corresponds to an inversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the order of the two end markers pdp1 and bgi03892 was inverted (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inversion between bgi03892 and another marker was also detected in O. nubilalis by Kroemer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found that the Z-linked marker bgi002071 in B. mori was autosomal in O. nubilalis, as was also shown for marker G23 just above kettin by Kroemer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the segment of the Z chromosome above kettin in B. mori appears to be autosomal in O. nubilalis and therefore segregates independently from the behavioral response trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QTL_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A QTL analysis using 198 AFLP markers that were mapped to the 31 chromosomes spread over 45 linkage groups showed that the Z chromosome was the only one with a significant effect on the male behavioral response, (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in agreement with the findings of Dopman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13), who used a qualitative flight assay to map the major Resp gene to the Z chromosome in a backcross to the E strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantitative measurement of male behavior additionally permits an estimate of the contribution of minor genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with the Z chromosome with a significant logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 5.0, explaining 25% of the variance in behavioral score, the chromosome with the next largest effect is AFLP linkage group 31, explaining 11% of the variance, but this effect was below the P less_than 0.05 significance threshold (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other linkage group has an LOD score higher than 1.5 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then conducted a more extensive QTL analysis using 12 genes on the Z chromosome, using data from all 470 phenotyped and genotyped males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interval mapping produced a single broad peak of the log-likelihood function at position 84.2 cM with an LOD score of 8.7 covering an interval of 36 cM, containing one or more QTLs for the behavioral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR cluster occurred near one edge of this broad interval (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this large interval to optimize the behavioral scoring function (SI Materials and Methods), which increased the LOD score at the peak to 27.8 cM and narrowed its width to 12 cM (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, for the final QTL analysis we added genotype scores for an additional 12 markers, 6 of which were located within the 12-cM interval (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resulting log-likelihood function showed a single narrow peak at position 85.3 cM near the marker kon-tiki with an LOD score of 29.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2-LOD confidence interval in which the LOD score exceeds 27.6 is 8 cM wide and covers positions 83 cM to 91 cM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likelihood that Resp occurs at the peak is more than 100 times greater than the likelihood that it occurs outside the 2-LOD confidence interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The log-likelihood function also showed a second peak at 108 cM with a maximum LOD score of 20.5, flanked by two markers (paraplegin and pdp1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak is approximately 107 times less likely to be the Resp locus than any position within the 2-LOD confidence interval, but it could represent a second QTL with a smaller effect on the behavioral score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we conducted fixed-effects two-way ANOVA using genotypes at the markers nearest the major and minor peaks as factors (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major peak effect was highly significant (P less_than 0.0001); the minor peak effect and interaction effects were not (P = 0.46 and P = 0.37, respectively for the marker to the left of the minor peak and P = 0.49 and P = 0.18 for the marker to the right of the minor peak), indicating that any possible contribution of the minor peak effect and interaction effect to the overall variance of the behavioral score is less than 10% of the contribution of the major QTL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_Candidate_Genes_for_the_Behavioral_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next evaluated the OR cluster as a candidate for the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster maps to position 72 cM; in scoring OnubOR5, OnubOR4, and OnubOR6, we did not detect any crossovers within the cluster (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR genes occur at 85.3 cM, 13.3 cM away from the larger QTL peak, somewhat closer than the distance of 20 cM found by Lassance et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) between the ORs and the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR cluster is even further away (36 cM) from the smaller peak at 108 cM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LOD score of the OR cluster is 20.5, making it very unlikely to be the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak at 85.3 cM is 109 times more likely, and any location within the 2-LOD confidence interval is at least 107 times more likely to be the Resp locus than is the OR cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight hump in the LOD score at the OR cluster (Fig 3) might indicate a smaller contribution to the behavioral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the possibility that the ORs represent a third, minor QTL, we conducted a two-way ANOVA using the marker genotypes at the QTL peak and the ORs as factors (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, the main effect of the peak was highly significant (P less_than 0.0001), but neither the main effect of the OR genotype (P = 0.84) nor the interaction effect (P = 0.13) was significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the nonsignificant effect of the OR genotype depended on the genotype of the markers near the peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sequence variation at the OR cluster makes no consistent contribution to male pheromone preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2-LOD confidence interval around the major peak contains two of the marker genes, kon-tiki and bric-a-brac (bab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing our O. nubilalis map with the B. mori and Danaus plexippus genomes, a total of seven genes have been mapped between ldh and bgi012356 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, six of these geneshighwire, pentraxin, trol, kon-tiki, bab, and CCR4-notseem to be involved in neurogenesis (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes seem to control neuronal axonal growth and orientation processes specifically in insects and other animals (see references in Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the genome comparisons to identify other candidates for Resp showed a total of 12 genes (including kon-tiki and bab) located within the Resp region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight have one or more identifiable protein domains, six have homologs in Drosophila with some functional information, and three are not similar to any protein of known function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although none has an obvious connection to pheromone sensory physiology, several are implicated in neurogenesis; we discuss these possible roles below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strategies_for_QTL_Analysis_of_the_Male_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the purpose of fine-scale genetic mapping, there are disadvantages in using any male response as a dichotomous trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single error in scoring that trait will produce a spurious recombinant in the linkage map, resulting in an inaccurate location of the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple errors in scoring the trait will inflate the estimated recombination rate in the region of the Resp locus, increase the inaccuracy of its location, and tend to bias the location of the Resp gene toward the end of a chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the behavioral trait is assumed to be scored without error, there is no way to estimate statistically the effects of possible scoring errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likelihoods of different gene orders can be compared, but the spurious recombinants will decrease the likelihood of the most likely order and will inflate the estimate of recombination rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we took great care to devise a quantitative score and used a discriminant function approach to discriminate more precisely between homozygote and heterozygote responses, as explained in detail below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two behavioral characters were measured as a response to each of the pheromone blends (Z, H, and E): wing-fanning and hair pencil extrusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each blend, a behavioral score was calculated by weighing the behaviors as shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each male was held within a tube with screening at both ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pheromone plume could pass through the tube, and the male could be observed at close range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allowed us to test many males in succession, greatly increasing the sample size in each generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If males had been allowed to fly to the lure, recapture of the male within the wind tunnel would have been required, possibly resulting in damage and likely influencing the response to the next blend to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimization_of_Preference_Score  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The LOD function resulting from the preliminary QTL analysis exhibited a broad peak at 84.2 cM in the interval Q between bgi00672 and bgi12356, with a maximum LOD score of 17.7, explaining 22% of the phenotypic variance in the behavioral score (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this entire interval Q to optimize the weightings in the behavioral score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified four groups: 149 males homozygous for the Z allele at all marker loci in the interval (group A); 149 heterozygous males with one Z allele and one E allele at all marker loci in interval Q (group B); 73 males with at least one crossover in the interval, producing some homozygous and some heterozygous markers within interval Q (group C); and 99 males with missing data, such that none of the other conditions could be established with complete certainly (group D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unless there is a double crossover within one of the subintervals Q1, Q2, or Q3 (Fig S3), group A males are homozygous for the entire interval Q of the Z-strain chromosome and therefore must be homozygous for the Z allele of the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double crossovers within one of the three subintervals would not be experimentally detectable, unless additional markers were scored within them, but we can estimate the probability of a double crossover as 0.05 (see below); thus overall at least 95% of group A males are expected not to show a double crossover and thus to be homozygous for the Z allele of the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the same reasoning, at least 95% of group B males are expected to be heterozygotes, with one Z allele and one E allele at the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, independent of the actual position of the Resp gene within interval Q, we can take A and B as representative groups of Resp ZZ homozygotes and ZE heterozygotes, respectively, and can use these two groups in a discriminant function analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis determines which combination of parameters in the formula for the behavioral score best discriminates between the two genotypes at the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The goal of discriminant analysis is to find the set of predictor variables that best discriminates between two types of observations described by a known class variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the class variable is the genotype at the Resp locus (assumed to be known for groups A and B), and the predictor variables are the parameters used to calculate the behavioral score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ask the following: Is the way we initially chose to measure the phenotypic score the best way to characterize the behavioral differences between the genotypes, and, if not, can we find a better way?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although classical discriminant function analysis assumes that the predictor variables are normally distributed, we make no such assumptions because we return to the original concept of the discriminant rule as defined by Fisher (84), namely to maximize the between-groups sum of squares, SSbetween, relative to the within-groups sum of squares, SSwithin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SSbetween is equivalent to the squared difference of the behavioral score means of groups A and B, and SSwithin is related to the weighted average of the variance of the behavioral score within the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched the space of parameters used to define the behavioral score over a regular grid and calculated the SSbetween/SSwithin ratio (hereafter the SS ratio) for each parameter set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined the optimized parameter set (Par13.3) as that which produced the largest value of this ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the optimized parameter set increased the SS ratio from 84.2 to 137.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QTL analysis using the same markers with the new behavioral score calculated for all the males (groups AD) shifted the LOD peak 2 cM to the right, to 86.2 cM, increased the maximum LOD value from 17.7 to 26.1, and increased the fraction of phenotypic variance explained from 22 to 31%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently used the optimized parameter set to calculate the behavioral scores used for the final QTL analysis using more markers within interval Q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the probability of an undetected double crossover within intervals Q1, Q2, or Q3 by taking each interval length (3.9, 5.9, or 26.3 cM), converting them to crossover probabilities (0.037, 0.055, or 0.204), squaring these, and adding them to produce a sum of 0.046 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Squaring the crossover probabilities assumes no interference; typically there is interference, and the frequency of double crossovers will be much smaller than 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double crossovers within interval Q involving single crossovers in Q1 and Q2, or in Q1 and Q3, or in Q2 and Q3 will be more common, but these are detectable, and such males are classified into group C. The occurrence of undetected double crossovers in interval Q will affect only the assumption that group A males have no E allele at the Resp locus and that group B males have no Z allele at the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these assumptions are violated up to 5% of the time, the discriminant analysis will be only slightly less discriminating than optimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have seen that, even when suboptimal, the discriminant analysis approach greatly improved the peak LOD score and the fraction of variance explained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our subsequent analysis (see below) eliminated the OR cluster from serious consideration as a candidate for the Resp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the OR cluster had been included in the interval Q along with the Resp locus, so no bias against the OR cluster was introduced by excluding it from the discriminant analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_Peaks_in_the_Likelihood_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the major peak, the log-likelihood function resulting from the final QTL analysis showed a second peak at 108 cM with a maximum LOD score of 20.5, flanked by the two markers paraplegin and pdp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak is approximately 107 times less likely to be the Resp locus than is any position within the 2-LOD confidence interval, but it could represent a second QTL with a smaller effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we conducted two-way fixed-effects ANOVA, using the genotype at kon-tiki (the marker nearest the major peak in the largest number of males genotyped) as one factor and the genotype at paraplegin or pdp1 as the other factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependent variable was the behavioral score for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each ANOVA, kon-tiki had a highly significant main effect on the behavioral score (P less_than 0.0001), but the main effect of the other marker and the interaction effect were not significant (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when the large effect of the main peak is accounted for, the overall contributions of markers near the minor peak are not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a peak rising above two nonsignificant markers may be caused by the contrasting marker effects within a given genotype class for kon-tiki (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For kon-tiki EZ heterozygotes the pdp1 ZZ homozygote has a higher average score than the pdp1 EZ heterozygote, but for kon-tiki ZZ homozygotes the pdp1 ZZ and EZ scores are the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For kon-tiki EZ heterozygotes the paraplegin ZZ and EZ are the same, but for kon-tiki ZZ homozygotes paraplegin ZZ is higher than paraplegin EZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, possessing two copies of the Z allele at markers around the minor peak increases the tendency to prefer the Z blend in some but not all genetic backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is a second minor QTL under this peak, its effect depends on the genotype at the major QTL, and its contribution to the overall variance of the behavioral score is less than 10% of the contribution of the major QTL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_ORs_as_Candidate_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the possibility that the ORs represent a third, minor QTL, we conducted a two-way, fixed-effect ANOVA using the genotypes at kon-tiki and the ORs as factors (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependent variable was the behavioral score for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, the main effect of kon-tiki was highly significant (P less_than 0.0001), but the main effect of the OR genotype and the interaction effect were both nonsignificant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR genotype had contrasting effects on the behavioral score, depending on the kon-tiki genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within kon-tiki EZ genotypes, OR ZZ homozygotes had higher scores than OR ZE heterozygotes, but for kon-tiki ZZ homozygotes, OR ZZ homozygotes had lower scores than OR EZ heterozygotes (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sequence variation at the OR cluster makes no consistent contribution to male pheromone preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By fine-scale mapping of the male response in O. nubilalis, we found candidate genes that had not been implicated in previous studies of male pheromone perception in moths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, confirming previous work (31), we ruled out variation in other candidate genes, i.e., the ORs that detect pheromone components and have been implicated in studies of other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will explain the justification for our approach in analyzing behavior, point out some aspects of our mapping methods, reconsider the role of the pheromone receptors, and discuss the possible roles of genes in the chromosomal region we have identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mapping the genes underlying the male behavioral response, we deliberately chose to measure traits different from but correlated with the final, evolutionarily relevant outcome: a mating with a female of the same strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome has traditionally been measured by observing male behavior and flight toward a female or an artificial pheromone dispenser at the upwind end of a wind tunnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultimate criterion of response is considered to be touching and attempting to copulate with the pheromone source, and this criterion has been used as a qualitative, dichotomous trait in previous mapping studies (13, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has been justified by the observation that E-strain males may exhibit earlier signs of attention to the Z lure and the opposite applies to Z-strain males; such signs are unreliable predictors of the final outcome (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent studies have shown that early responses by Z-strain males can lock them in to subsequent behaviors that are maintained even if the pheromone lure is experimentally switched from Z to E while the moth is in midflight (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, variation in the early responses also may be a relevant indicator of genetic differences between the Z and E strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we scored male response as a quantitative trait by observing the preflight responses of males to different pheromone blends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in individual assay time greatly increased the number of males that could be scored against all three pheromone blends over the generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though 68% of the variance in this quantitative trait was nongenetic or was caused by minor genetic factors, QTL analysis could define an interval on the Z chromosome that accounted for 32% of the variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our methods enabled the quantitative assessment of previously suspected candidate genes and identified candidates that had not previously been considered; this assessment would have not been possible if the response had been scored as a dichotomous trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our method avoids inaccuracies in fine-scale genetic mapping caused by errors in scoring male response as a dichotomous trait, which are inevitably confounded with recombination (see the discussion of mapping strategies in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The exclusion of the cluster of ORs from the QTL region means that sequence variation in those genes, whether in the coding sequence or in noncoding regions that affect their expression patterns, cannot be directly responsible for the difference in male response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the possibility remains that differences in OR expression or function may be controlled by a trans-acting transcription factor located within the QTL region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously found no qualitative difference in OR expression: Both strains have the same ORs, localized at the same positions on the antenna, with the same number of sensilla and neurons housing them (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did find quantitative differences in the expression of OnubOR4 and OnubOR6 (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences could be caused by a trans-acting transcription factor or could be affected by changes in neuron size and number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the genetic factor underlying male response in the Ostrinia pheromone strains must be different from that of H. virescens and H. subflexa, in which the male behavioral responses and most of the neurophysiological responses to pheromone components cosegregated with the autosomal OR cluster (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The candidate genes in the Resp QTL region (Table 1) suggest that other factors affect the structure, function, or connectivity of the OSNs or other neurons in the antennal lobe or elsewhere in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three candidates are similar to genes of unknown function in the sequenced genomes of other lepidopteran species (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other candidates could potentially play a role in gene regulation: One has a Tudor domain also found in proteins that bind to methylated histones (41), and the other has a SANT (switching-defective protein 3, adaptor 2, nuclear receptor corepressor, and transcription factor IIIB) domain involved in histone modification (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two candidates, aldose epimerase and a lipid-binding -tocopherol transfer protein, have domains not necessarily specific to the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four genes within the QTL region and two just outside it are similar to genes with roles in neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the latter, trol (terribly reduced optic lobes, also called perlecan) is a large multidomain heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix with Laminin G domains that binds to and stores other signaling molecules controlling neuroblast proliferation (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other side of the QTL region is CCR4-Not, coding for the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex (44, 45), which interacts with the conserved P body component HPat/Pat1 to regulate synaptic terminal growth in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We consider that four genes mapping within the QTL region are most likely to play a relevant role in neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila melanogaster, kon-tiki encodes a transmembrane protein that promotes cell migration in muscle development (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar mechanisms have been proposed to generate directed migration and target recognition of myotubes as well as neuronal axon and dendrite growth toward their synaptic partners (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second likely candidate is a gene with LIM and homeobox domains characteristic of many transcription factors that has also been described as a neural-patterning gene in several organisms [i.e., Drosophila, mice, and Caenorhabditis elegans (50)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third likely candidate is archipelago (ago), which encodes an F-box protein and part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts with the Notch signaling pathway and suppresses tissue growth in flies and tumor development in vertebrates (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in the fourth likely candidate, bab, have many consequences, including disordered arrangements of eggs in the ovaries in D. melanogaster (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both antennae and tarsi, bab causes distal segment fusion (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein encoded by bab possesses a BTB domain also found in the Drosophila genes tramtrack and Broad-Complex (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, bab was recently found to interact with other transcription factors in a network that patterns the developing olfactory tissue in D. melanogaster (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to differing in their behavioral response to female pheromones, E- and Z-strain males also differ in the connections between the antennal OSNs and the antennal lobe of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Z strain, the OSNs that respond to Z11-14:OAc project their axons onto the large, medial glomerulus of the antennal lobe, and the OSNs responding to E11-14:OAc project onto the smaller, lateral glomerulus (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the E strain, these connections are reversed (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In F1 hybrids, the connections are similar to those in the E strain, but the lateral and medial glomeruli are more similar in size, and glomerular size appears to be Z-linked (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Z-linked mutant in B. mori shows a similar rewiring of neuronal connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type B. mori males, OSNs expressing the bombykol receptor BmOR1 target their axons to the larger toroid glomerulus, whereas OSNs expressing the bombykal receptor BmOR3 send their axons to the smaller cumulus (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In null mutants of the Z-linked acj6 gene, BmOR1-expressing OSNs are rare or absent, and BmOR3-expressing OSNs project instead to the toroid (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant males are attracted not by the main pheromone component bombykol but instead by the minor component bombykal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have confirmed that acj6 is also Z-linked in O. nubilalis, but it segregates independently from the QTL interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, acj6 maps distal to kettin on the Z chromosome of B. mori, far from the QTL interval (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite intriguing similarities in the phenotype caused by mutation of acj6 in Bombyx, acj6 does not seem to be responsible for male response in O. nubilalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nevertheless, it is possible that one of the genes in the QTL interval could have a similar effect on axonal targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila (unlike mammals) the expression of a given OR in a sensory neuron is not directly involved in glomerular targeting (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, upstream-acting transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation separately specify both the downstream expression of a particular OR (63) and the axonal guidance of that neuron to its cognate glomerulus in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In O. nubilalis, both strains possess the same cluster of ORs for pheromone detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the newly identified candidate genes could control the expression of specific ORs in different OSNs [as inferred by Koutroumpa et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35)] or the targeting of these OSNs to the antennal lobe, or both processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third possibility is a change in the antennal lobe itself, governing which OSNs will connect to which glomeruli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a change is suggested by the results of transplanting antennae of E-strain males onto Z-strain males: The chimeric males responded only to the Z blend (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this example, the Z genotype of the recipient bearing the antennal lobe had a greater influence than the E genotype of the OSNs in the transplanted antennae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One other extensively studied trait is the spike amplitude of OSNs responding to the E or Z component in the two strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E-strain males, the E-responding OSN has bigger spike amplitude than the Z-responding OSN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Z-strain males, the magnitudes of the spike amplitudes are reversed, and in hybrids they are more nearly equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spike amplitude is correlated with the diameter of the dendrite projecting into the sensillar lymph (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies found that spike amplitude was autosomally inherited (66), not sex-linked (18), and was not on the autosome controlling female pheromone production (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later studies found that spike amplitude was not correlated with male behavioral response (67) but also may have a minor Z-linked component (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a strain difference in electroantennogram responses that also appears to be Z-linked (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further discussion on spike amplitude measurements and the interpretation of these results in the light of sex-linkage can be found in Koutroumpa et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not score spike amplitudes or whole-antennal responses in this study because of the prohibitive workload of neurophysiological preparations of each male after the behavioral assays, but further mapping of these traits would be worthwhile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our QTL-mapping approach has revealed several genes involved in neurogenesis that may account for the differences in male behavioral response between pheromone strains in O. nubilalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the previously established importance of changes in the ORs, as supported by phylogenetic analysis, functional expression, and genetics, other changes can shift preference without any change in the ORs themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further advances will result from the application of QTL mapping to other recently diverged species pairs or species with pheromone races, as well as from functional studies of the candidate genes we have identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Laboratory colonies of ECB Z and E strains were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Z-strain colony derived from cornfield-collected adults in Kéty town, county of Tolna, Hungary in 2004.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E-strain colony was established from larvae extracted from maize stems collected by Magda Rak-Cizej of the Agriculture and Forestry Institute, Novo Mesto, Slovenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of the strains was monitored by GC analysis of female pheromone production following the protocol of Kárpáti et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (68), and male response was evaluated with an electroantennogram (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All insects were reared on a semiartificial diet (69) until pupation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults were fed a 5% honeywater solution throughout their adult lives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were kept at 25 °C, relative humidity 70% under an 18-h/6-h light/dark photoperiod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The day of emergence was considered day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Backcrosses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All crosses were single-pair crosses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is crossing-over in male Lepidoptera (70), we conducted male-informative backcrosses to generate recombination in the Z chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-pair matings were set up hybridizing pure Z-strain females with E-strain males (ZE hybrid) and E-strain females with Z-strain males (EZ hybrid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F1 hybrid males were backcrossed to pure Z-strain females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected one out of 30 hybrid families, namely family EZ2, because it was highly fecund.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sons of the EZ2 family that showed hybrid behavior in the wind tunnel bioassays were backcrossed with pure Z-strain females, giving rise to the first backcross generation (BC1: ZEZ2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two BC1 families were continued to second-generation backcrosses, i.e., ZEZ2-4 and ZEZ2-7 families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because only the ZEZ2-7 family generated enough offspring, we continued the backcrossing procedure with this family for six additional generations (BC2BC7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One family for each of the subsequent BC2BC7 families was phenotyped and genotyped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wind_Tunnel_Phenotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All 649 backcross males were tested separately in the wind tunnel for response to each of the Z, E, and H blends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our wind-tunnel assays were based on a series of behavioral male responses to each of the pheromone blends, i.e., resting, wing fanning (on/off), strong wing fanning, and hair pencil extrusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each category was given a score (Fig 1 and Fig S1), so that we had a weighted and quantitative measurement for each male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The males were 12 d old and were sexually and olfactorily virgin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All males were behaviorally tested at the second hour of their scotophase, with 70% humidity and optimal temperature of 19 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each male was kept in a cylinder 2 cm in diameter with gauze on both ends so that the air plume with the pheromone could pass through the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this setup we were able to keep the males captured during the assay, avoiding the need to recapture them (and possibly damage them) at the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same males for subsequent matings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three pheromone blends were ordered from Pherobank and were separately presented to each of the males for 1 min maximally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During one experimental day, all males were tested first with the Z blend, followed successively by the H and E blends, with an interval of 30 min to ventilate the wind tunnel between the tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a male showed the hair pencil extrusion response or after 1 min, the male was removed from the wind tunnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latency of each reaction to the blend was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the behavioral response was ambiguous, the male was retested on the following day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mapping_and_Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We mapped the chromosomes using AFLP markers, using a protocol adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On polyacrylamide gels, the markers scored were present in the pure E-strain female, the F1 hybrid male, and the heterozygous backcross males and were absent in the pure Z-strain male, the F1 Z-strain female, and in the homozygous backcross offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposite pattern was scored as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scored 198 AFLP markers from 47 primer combinations in 123 samples (parents and F1 and BC1 males and females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MapMaker 3.0 (72) we grouped 180 of these markers into 45 linkage groups, with at least two markers from different primer pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of markers for the 35 linkage groups varied from 2 to 11; the average number was 5.14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fine-scale mapping on the Z chromosome, we used intron-size polymorphisms or SNP variation in 21 Z-linked genes that were scored in all backcross males; then recombination rates were determined in MapMaker as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified that all polymorphic differences used in the mapping also differed among wild-type Z and E males in the laboratory strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QTL_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the phenotypic scores for all male behaviors, we first determined which linkage groups explained a significant portion of the variation, using R-studio using t test-based marker regression as implemented in R/qtl (version 0.98.490).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established significance thresholds for LOD scores empirically by permutation tests using 10,000 permutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After finding a significant LOD score for only the Z chromosome, we conducted QTL analysis with the 21 Z-linked genes using MAPMAKER/QTL 1.1 (73, 74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the gene order determined by MapMaker 3.0, with a backcross design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extracted the numerical values of the LOD scores from the program output and plotted them in Excel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
