Wnt5a is essential for hippocampal dendritic maintenance and spatial learning and memory in adult mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The maintenance of neuronal morphology in the adult brain is an understudied area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using tissue-specific deletion in mice, we reveal Wnt5a, a member of the Wnt family of developmental morphogens, as an essential factor for the long-term stability of dendritic architecture in the adult hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a influences synaptic plasticity and related cognitive functions in the mature hippocampus through CaMKII-mediated signaling, Rac1-dependent actin dynamics, and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding-mediated NMDA receptor biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the long-term, Wnt5a-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal signaling and excitatory synaptic transmission is responsible for the maintenance of dendritic arbors and spines in adult CA1 pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insight into the poorly understood structural maintenance mechanisms that exist in the adult brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stability of neuronal connectivity is critical for brain functions, and morphological perturbations are associated with neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how neuronal morphology is maintained in the adult brain remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify Wnt5a, a member of the Wnt family of secreted morphogens, as an essential factor in maintaining dendritic architecture in the adult hippocampus and for related cognitive functions in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a expression in hippocampal neurons begins postnatally, and its deletion attenuated CaMKII and Rac1 activity, reduced GluN1 glutamate receptor expression, and impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial learning and memory in 3-mo-old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increased age, Wnt5a loss caused progressive attrition of dendrite arbors and spines in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 pyramidal neurons and exacerbated behavioral defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a functions cell-autonomously to maintain CA1 dendrites, and exogenous Wnt5a expression corrected structural anomalies even at late-adult stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal a maintenance factor in the adult brain, and highlight a trophic pathway that can be targeted to ameliorate dendrite loss in pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell-Autonomous_Requirement_for_Wnt5a_in_Maintaining_Adult_CA1_Dendrite_Arbors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed Wnt5a expression in the mouse hippocampus at 1 wk after birth, which increased prominently by 2 wk and was sustained at adult stages (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a mRNA was localized throughout the hippocampal formation, and was enriched in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression pattern in the hippocampus is consistent with previous findings (21) and that in the Allen Brain Atlas (www.brain-map.org/), where Wnt5a expression has also been noted in the cerebellum and to a lesser degree in the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb in the adult mouse brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of Wnt5a expression in hippocampal neurons correlated with the appearance of pre- and postsynaptic proteins (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That prominent hippocampal Wnt5a expression is detected only at postnatal stages was intriguing, given the reported roles of Wnt5a in embryonic processes in the brain (15, 2225).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a expression in the postnatal hippocampus, together with evidence supporting the role of Wnts in regulating morphological changes in cultured hippocampal neurons (26, 27), prompted us to address the functions of Wnt5a in hippocampal neurons in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this end, we crossed floxed Wnt5a (Wnt5afl/fl) mice with the pan-neuronal Nestin-Cre line (28) to delete Wnt5a in all neurons starting at embryonic stages (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a was undetectable in the Nestin-Wnt5afl/fl hippocampus throughout postnatal ages, including postnatal day 21 (P21) by in situ hybridization (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that levels of other Wnts were unaltered in the absence of Wnt5a (Fig S1 C and D), indicating that Wnt5a loss did not elicit compensatory changes in the expression of other Wnt genes in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the early deletion of Wnt5a (Fig S1 AC), there were no obvious differences in gross morphology and projections of hippocampal layers between Nestin-Wnt5afl/fl mice and control Wnt5afl/fl littermates at 1 mo (Fig S1E), when hippocampal neural circuit establishment should be complete (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed examination of dendritic morphology of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons revealed normal dendrite length, complexity, and spine densities in 1-mo-old mutant mice (Fig S1 FJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that Wnt5a is dispensable for establishing dendritic arbors and for spine formation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo, contrary to published reports that Wnt5a promotes neuronal morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons (15, 18, 19, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To next address if Wnt5a might function in the mature hippocampus, we crossed Wnt5afl/fl mice with calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)-Cre mice, where Cre expression starts at 2.5 wk after birth and is restricted to forebrain excitatory neurons in the hippocampus and cortex (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt5a deletion was near complete in the CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl hippocampus by 3 mo of age (Fig S2 A and B), whereas other Wnts showed normal expression (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, we observed a decrease in the thickness of the CA1 dendritic layers in 6-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice using MAP2 immunostaining, although hippocampal cyto-architecture and axonal projections were unaffected (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better visualize the morphologies of individual CA1 neurons and their processes and to pinpoint the onset of dendritic defects triggered by the postnatal loss of Wnt5a, we crossed CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice with Thy1-GFP-M transgenic mice that have mosaic GFP expression in the hippocampus (34), and analyzed neuronal structure at different ages from 3 to 12 mo (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sparsely labeled CA1 pyramidal neurons in Thy1-GFP;CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice had normal dendrite arbor complexities and lengths at 3 mo of age (Fig 1 D, H, L, and M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by 4.5 mo, Thy1-GFP;CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl neurons showed striking dendritic deficits that progressively declined in older animals (Fig 1 EG, and IM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on Sholl analyses, distal dendrites at distances 50 m and farther from the soma were more severely affected than proximal dendrites (Fig 1 IK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control mice, the total dendritic length remained remarkably stable between 3 and 12 mo of age (4,866 ± 175 m at 3 mo vs. 4,978 ± 162.7 m at 12 mo) (Fig 1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice exhibited a pronounced decrease in dendritic length between 3 and 12 mo of age (4,780 ± 132.4 m at 3 mo vs. 2,810 ± 62.36 m at 12 mo) (Fig 1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of dendritic spine densities also revealed a significant reduction (31.5% decrease) in 6-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice compared with controls (Fig S2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the profound dendritic shrinkage in adult CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice, there was no overt loss of neurons in these animals even at 12 mo (Fig S2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate a requirement for Wnt5a in the maintenance of dendrite arbors and spine densities in adult CA1 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wnts are known to act either as autocrine (cell-autonomous) or paracrine (noncell-autonomous) secreted factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Wnt5a is deleted from all excitatory hippocampal neurons in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice, we are unable to distinguish between these two modes of signaling using the conditional mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Wnt5a has a cell-autonomous or noncell-autonomous role in the hippocampus, we performed mosaic analyses by lentiviral delivery of GFP-T2A-Cre or GFP alone into subsets of hippocampal neurons in Wnt5afl/fl animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral infections were done at 2 mo and mice harvested 3 mo later for morphological analyses (Fig 1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found stunted dendritic arbors in sparse GFP-labeled CA1 neurons with significant reductions in branch complexity and length in Wnt5afl/fl animals infected with GFP-T2A-Cre but not GFP alone (Fig 1 OR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mosaic Wnt5a elimination causes poorly branched and diminished dendritic arbors in isolated Cre-expressing neurons despite the presence of non-Creexpressing neighboring neurons that are capable of releasing Wnt5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Wnt5a secreted from adult CA1 neurons maintains neuronal morphology in an autocrine manner, likely because of limited diffusibility attributed to the lipid-modified and hydrophobic nature of Wnts (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt5a_Is_Essential_for_Hippocampal_Synaptic_Plasticity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dramatic changes in adult neuronal morphology with Wnt5a loss prompted us to ask whether Wnt5a is essential for hippocampal synaptic transmission in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed electrophysiological recordings in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice at 3 mo of age, a time when CA1 neuronal morphology is still intact, and at 6 mo when the morphology is impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that basal synaptic transmission is normal in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice at 3 mo but not at 6 mo, consistent with impaired dendritic structures at this age (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the probability of synaptic release at presynaptic sites by paired pulse facilitation (PPF) analyses and found that PPF was comparable between CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice and control littermates at both 3 and 6 mo of age (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal presynaptic properties in Wnt5a-deficient mice suggests that Wnt5a acts primarily at postsynaptic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hippocampal neurons exhibit prominent synaptic plasticity in which activity-dependent modulation of the strength of synaptic connections underlies learning and memory (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, broad-spectrum Wnt antagonists have been shown to affect synaptic structure, plasticity, and cognitive functions in adult organisms (3741).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are 19 vertebrate Wnts, and which Wnt is essential for these functions in the adult brain in vivo remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the role of Wnt5a in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological correlate of strengthening of synaptic transmission, we used -burst stimulation to induce LTP at Schaffer collateralCA1 synapses in 3-mo-old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings from Wnt5afl/fl control slices revealed a robust induction of LTP and a sustained maintenance phase (Fig 2 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl slices showed a significant reduction in both induction (274.3 ± 18.2% in control slices vs.. 201 ± 7.9% in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl slices, P = 0.0002) and maintenance (190.8 ± 13.3% in control slices vs. 151.9 ± 5.4% mutant slices, P = 0.01) phases of LTP (Fig 2 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impairment in LTP detected at 3 mo in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice when neuronal structure and basal synaptic transmission are still intact, suggests that synaptic plasticity is more susceptible to the loss of Wnt5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address if Wnt5a contributes to NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD), an electrophysiological correlate of weakening of synaptic transmission, we used a standard low-frequency stimulation paradigm to induce LTD in the CA1 hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the LTP defect, we found no differences in LTD between mutant and control mice at 3 mo of age (Fig 2 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate a specific role for Wnt5a in the potentiation of synaptic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt5a_Is_Essential_for_Spatial_Learning_and_Memory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synaptic plasticity is widely considered to be a cellular mechanism that underlies learning and memory (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, structural maintenance of synaptic connectivity has been postulated to be critical for life-long memories (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the decreased CA1 LTP in 3-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice, we subjected Wnt5a mutant mice to behavioral paradigms to evaluate cognitive functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the novel-object recognition test, which evaluates the preference of mice to explore a new over a familiar object (45), adult Wnt5afl/fl mice showed a significant preference for the novel object, with 3- and 6-mo-old mice spending 70.8 ± 5.5% and 68.1 ± 8.1% of time exploring the novel object, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice showed no preference for the novel object at both 3 and 6 mo of age (Fig 3 A and B), indicating a deficit in recognition memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in these mice, we used the Morris water maze to test an animals ability to use spatial cues to locate a hidden platform in a tank of water (46) (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice had visual acuity and swimming speeds comparable to littermate controls (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-month-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice took significantly longer time to locate the hidden platform during the initial training period of 12 consecutive days using four trials per day (see schematic in Fig 3C), compared with age-matched controls, eventually achieving similar latencies as control mice on the sixth day (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six-month-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice also required significantly more time to find the platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 6-mo-old mutants did not achieve similar latencies as control mice, even when tested on the 12th day (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that acquisition of spatial learning is impaired in the absence of structural deficits in 3-mo-old Wnt5a mutant mice, but that learning deficits are exacerbated with the appearance of morphological abnormalities in older animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate reference memory, we conducted a probe trial on day 13 in which the platform was removed and measured the amount of time that mice spent in the original target quadrant (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both 3- and 6-mo-old mutant mice spent significantly less time in the target quadrant and made fewer platform crossings (Fig 3 F and G and Fig S4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed a reversal training by relocating the hidden platform to the opposite quadrant from days 1425 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the intial training phase, 3-mo-old Wnt5a mutant mice required more days of training to find the new platform, but eventually reached similar latencies as control mice (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 6-mo-old mutant mice took significantly longer to find the platform compared with control littermates even on day 25 (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then conducted probe trials for 7 d (days 2632) to assess memory retention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-month-old mutants maintained a preference for the target quadrant for the 7 d of the probe trial (Fig 3H), whereas this preference was lost in 6-mo-old mutants by the fifth day (Fig 3I), suggesting a marked decay in memory retrieval in older mutant animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, the findings from the Morris water maze test support an essential role for Wnt5a in the acquisition of spatial learning and memory storage in adult animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the cognitive dysfunction in 3-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice were consistent with the LTP defects observed at this age but appeared before the onset of anatomical impairments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more pronounced behavioral defects in 6-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice suggest a progressive decline in cognitive functions with the manifestation of dendritic abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt5a_Loss_Disrupts_Calcium_and_Cytoskeletal_Signaling_Pathways_and_CREB-Mediated_Transcription_of_Glutamate_Receptors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wnts are known to exert their effects by signaling through three effector pathways: the canonical -catenindependent pathway, a Ca2+-dependent pathway, and the planar cell polarity pathway (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found comparable levels of nuclear -catenin and Axin2, c-myc, and NeuroD1, all transcriptional targets of canonical -catenin signaling (48), between CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl and control Wnt5afl/fl hippocampus at 3 mo (Fig S5 AC), indicating that canonical Wnt signaling is unaffected by Wnt5a depletion in the mature hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the Wntcalcium pathway, where Wnt ligands promote an increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, Wnt5a treatment acutely elicited a calcium response in 92% of cultured rat hippocampal neurons transfected with GCaMP3, whereas only 43% of neurons responded to control treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the number of calcium transients was fivefold higher in Wnt5a-treated neurons (Fig 4 AC and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed biochemical analyses to assess activation of CaMKII, a critical regulator of hippocampal connectivity and functions (51, 52), in vivo, in young adult CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice at 3 mo before the appearance of structural anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a phospho-specific antibody that detects activated CaMKII (threonine 286 phosphorylation on CaMKII and T287 on CaMKII) (53), we found a pronounced attenuation of phosphorylated CaMKII (59% decrease) and CaMKII (57% decrease) in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at a critical serine 831 site (54, 55) has been functionally linked to synaptic plasticity and retention of spatial memory in mice (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a marked decrease in phospho-S831-GluA1 in postsynaptic density fractions from the mutant hippocampus (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest decreases in phosphorylation of CaMKII and GluA1 as the molecular underpinnings for the impairments in synaptic plasticity and spatial memory in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calcium signaling within synapses could couple to transcriptional responses via shuttling of a Ca2+/CaM/CaMKII complex to the nucleus to promote phosphorylation of CaMKIV, which then phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor CREB (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of CaMKIV and CREB were significantly reduced in nuclear fractions from 3-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl hippocampal tissues (Fig 4 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Wnt5a deletion altered nuclear CREB phosphorylation, we assessed levels of several synaptic proteins (Fig S5 D and E) and found that only GluN1, the obligatory NMDA receptor subunit, was decreased (Fig 4 HJ), raising the possibility that GluN1 transcription is CREB-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any changes in levels of other NMDA receptor subunits, GluN2a/2b, that are coexpressed and coassembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with GluN1, in the mature hippocampus (Fig 4 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified three putative CRE sites (CRE1 at 212 bp, CRE2 at 238 bp, and CRE3 at 770 bp) in a 1-kb region upstream of the transcription start site in the mouse GluN1 promoter (Fig 4K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a dual luciferase assay, Wnt5a stimulation of hippocampal neurons for 6 h significantly increased luciferase activity compared with control treatment (Fig 4 K and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of just the two proximal CRE elements (212 to 216 bp and 238 to 242 bp) abolished Wnt5a-induced luciferase activity (Fig 4L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal an unexpected role for Wnt5a in enhancing GluN1 transcription through a noncanonical pathway that involves calcium-CaMKII-CREB activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We finally examined the planar cell polarity pathway where noncanonical Wnts induce cytoskeletal dynamics by activating small GTPases, such as Rac1 and JNK signaling (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rac1 is a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in dendrites and spines (60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active Rac1-GTP and phospho-JNK levels were significantly reduced in hippocampal homogenates prepared from 3-mo-old CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice (Fig 4 MP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rac1 activity can also be influenced by CaMKII activity via CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the Rac1-specific GEFs, Tiam1 and Kalirin-7 (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that Wnt5a signals via CaMKII and Rac1-mediated signaling, as well as CREB-mediated GluN1 synthesis to maintain synaptic plasticity and structure in the adult hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Late_Induction_of_Wnt5a_Reverses_Dendrite_Attrition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that adult Wnt5a-deficient mice have profound defects in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, dendrite morphology, and related molecular changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Could restoring Wnt5a expression prevent or even correct synaptic signaling and dendritic defects in adult CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we expressed Wnt5a using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) virus carrying a Cre-dependent Wnt5a transgene, DIO-Wnt5a, in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, to address if Wnt5a expression rescues signaling defects observed at 3 mo, we delivered Wnt5a at this time point and performed biochemical analyses at 2 wk after viral infection (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting of hippocampal homogenates revealed that AAV-mediated Wnt5a expression was sufficient to correct the impairments in CaMKII and CREB phosphorylation, GluN1 expression, and Rac1 activity in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice (Fig 5 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a direct and acute role for Wnt5a in regulating calcium and Rac1 activity and enhancing CREB-mediated synthesis of NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits in the mature hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next addressed whether the dendrite atrophy in adult CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl neurons was permanent or could be reversed by Wnt5a administration well after the onset of structural abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we delivered AAV-DIO-Wnt5a into Thy1-GFP;CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice at 6 mo when CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice exhibit pronounced regression of dendritic arbors, and mice were harvested 3 mo after AAV infections for morphological analyses (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simultaneously delivered AAV-DIO-mCherry as a means to label infected neurons that are also GFP+ to facilitate tracing of neuronal morphologies in isolated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, AAV-mediated expression of Wnt5a in Thy1-GFP;CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl resulted in dendritic arbors that were comparable in complexity and lengths to control Thy1-GFP;Wnt5afl/fl neurons (Fig 5 GJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, with infection with AAV-DIO-mCherry alone, we observed substantial decreases in dendrite complexity and lengths in Thy1-GFP;CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl CA1 neurons (Fig 5 GJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that dendritic attrition in adult mutant neurons can be reversed, and reveals that Wnt5a, remarkably, promotes substantial dendritic growth and branching in the adult brain when neuronal connectivity is thought to be largely immutable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wnts are evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules that have been classically associated with embryonic patterning and establishment of neural circuits (47, 64, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That these classic developmental cues may have critical functions in the adult brain has been implied by recent findings that broad-spectrum blockade or activation of Wnt pathway components affects synaptic structure, plasticity, and cognitive functions in adult animals (3741).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surprisingly little is known about which of the 19 vertebrate Wnts is essential for adult nervous system functions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, manipulation of the Wnt pathway through overexpression of antagonists, such as Dickkopf-1 (38, 41), deletion of the Lrp6 coreceptor (40), or the cytoplasmic effector, -catenin (37), may have consequences on neuronal connectivity and function that are independent of Wnt ligands, via effects on cellcell adhesion, JNK signaling, and GPCR-mediated cAMP signaling (6668).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that deletion of a single Wnt family member, Wnt5a, is sufficient to elicit profound disruptions in synaptic plasticity, structural maintenance, and learning and memory in adult mice, identifying the importance of this particular noncanonical Wnt in later-life functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the loss of Wnt5a cannot be compensated for by other Wnts in the adult hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results, summarized in the model in Fig 6, define a causal sequence of events where Wnt5a first influences synaptic plasticity and related cognitive functions in the adult hippocampus through CaMKII-mediated signaling, Rac1-dependent actin dynamics, and CREB-mediated NMDA receptor biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the long-term, Wnt5a-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal signaling and excitatory synaptic transmission is responsible for the maintenance of dendritic arbors and spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insight into the poorly understood structural maintenance mechanisms that exist in the adult brain, and suggest Wnt5a signaling as a molecular target in ameliorating dendrite shrinkage and cognitive decline associated with pathological situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finding that embryonic deletion of Wnt5a in neurons did not elicit any structural abnormalities in CA1 pyramidal neurons during development suggests that neuronal Wnt5a is dispensable for the establishment or maturation of hippocampal connectivity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were surprising in the context of reported developmental functions for Wnt5a in cultured hippocampal neurons, and in embryonic processes in other brain regions (15, 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hippocampal neurons, several signaling pathways have been shown to influence dendrite morphogenesis, maturation, and stability in vitro and in vivo (1, 6, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the absence of Wnt5a, other signaling mechanisms, including other Wnt molecules (26, 27), could provide trophic support to hippocampal CA1 dendrite arbors and spines at least for the first several months of life in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Wnt5a derived from nonneuronal sources may support hippocampal formation in the absence of neuron-derived Wnt5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the profound defects in adult mice lacking Wnt5a suggest that these mechanisms are unable to compensate for Wnt5a loss at later stages of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we demonstrate that Wnt5a, derived from CA1 pyramidal neurons themselves, is critical for sustaining dendritic architecture in the adult hippocampus, implying that specificity for neuronal wiring is intrinsic to active neurons themselves in hippocampal circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, our limited understanding of the molecular cues that influence neuronal morphology in adult animals has largely come from analyses of cortical neurons in genetically modified mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the examples are adult mice with deletion of BDNF and its receptor TrkB (7, 8), the adhesion molecule -catenin (70), and the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings identifying Wnt5a as being essential for the maintenance of adult CA1 hippocampal neurons is relevant to understanding the structural bases of hippocampus-dependent behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that synaptic plasticity is most susceptible to the postnatal depletion of Wnt5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice had impaired CA1 LTP and related behavioral defects at 3 mo of age, a time when basal synaptic transmission and dendritic morphology are intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal presynaptic properties indicate that Wnt5a acts primarily at postsynaptic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant Wnt5a has previously been shown to acutely modulate NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that Wnt5a likely modifies synaptic strength through CaMKII-mediated signaling events, including the phosphorylation and subsequent trafficking/conductance of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, Rac1-dependent regulation of actin dynamics in dendritic spines, and regulation of NMDA receptor biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attenuation of small GTPase-mediated signaling and excitatory synaptic transmission, both postulated to be critical determinants in stabilizing neuronal connectivity (61, 73, 74), may underlie the gradual attrition of dendritic arbors and spines in later life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mice with forebrain-specific deletion of GluN1 have impairments in plasticity at CA1 synapses and spatial memory acquisition (75), these findings suggest that down-regulation of NMDA receptor synthesis contributes, in part, to the functional and behavioral defects that we observed in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NMDA receptor-mediated LTD is impaired in mice with CaMKII-Cremediated deletion of GluN1 (75), that we observed normal LTD responses in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice can be attributed to the fact that residual GluN1 expression in Wnt5a mutant mice may still allow sufficient Ca2+ influx to promote LTD, consistent with the view of differential Ca2+ requirements for LTD versus LTP (76, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, targeted GluN1 deletion has also been reported to result in modest (35%) decreases in GluN2a/2b protein expression, but unaltered levels of GluN2a/2b mRNA (78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in GluN2a/2b subunits was attributed to their aberrant retention in the ER and protein degradation when GluN1 is unavailable (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That we did not observe any changes in GluN2a/2b protein levels in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice is likely because the GluN1 depletion in our study (34%) is less robust compared with the near-complete depletion previously reported in GluN1 conditional null mice (78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, residual GluN1 expression in CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl mice might be sufficient to avoid ER-associated degradation of the GluN2a/2b subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the total GluN2a/2b protein content was unaltered in the CaMKII-Wnt5afl/fl hippocampus, it is possible that their synaptic localization might be affected by Wnt5a loss, given previous findings that Wnt5a modulates the surface expression of GluN2b in cultured hippocampal neurons (80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, the Wnt5a receptors that mediate effects on dendritic maintenance and synaptic functions in the adult hippocampus remain to be determined, although likely candidates include the Ror1/2 receptor tyrosine kinases and Frizzled-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ror1/2 have been demonstrated to be bona fide Wnt5a receptors in vivo (81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ror2 is abundantly expressed in mature CA1 dendrites, promotes dendritic activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling and, notably, is necessary for Wnt5a-mediated potentiation of NMDAR currents in acute hippocampal slices (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ror2 may function in coordination with Frizzled receptors; in particular, Frizzled-9 is localized to postsynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons, binds Wnt5a via its cysteine-rich domain in biochemical analyses, and the Frizzled-9 cysteine-rich domain is required for Wnt5a-mediated changes in spine densities in cultured hippocampal neurons (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The early LTP defects and the cognitive decline followed by retraction of dendrites and spine loss observed in adult Wnt5a mutant mice bear similarities to the progression of events in animal models of Alzheimers disease (83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent genetic evidence implicates deficiencies in Wnt signaling, largely the canonical arm, in the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments in Alzheimers disease (40, 84, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study emphasizes that noncanonical Wnt signaling is essential for maintaining synaptic function and connectivity in the adult brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That late induction of Wnt5a expression even after the onset of substantial neuronal atrophy, remarkably restores dendrite morphology in adult neurons, highlights the capacity of the adult nervous system to undergo large-scale structural changes, and suggests a Wnt5a-dependent trophic pathway that could be harnessed for therapeutic purposes in pathological situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

AAV-EF1a-DIO-mCherry and AAV-CMV-GFP were obtained from University of North Carolina Vector Core (2.4 × 1013 viral particles per milliliter, stock by Deisseroth laboratory) and University of Pennsylvania Vector Core (5.2 × 1013 viral particles per milliliter), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV-CMV-DIO-Wnt5a was generated by Vigene Biosciences (2.8 × 1013 viral particles per milliliter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For viral injections, mice were deeply anesthetized with avertin (tribromoethanol, 0.25 mg/g body weight; 2methyl2butanol, 0.16 L/g body weight) and mannitol (to prevent edema, 10 mg/g body weight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral or AAV vectors were stereotaxically delivered to the hippocampus using coordinates that were previously described (89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injections, mice were allowed to recover and killed for biochemical analyses 2 wk after infections for biochemical analyses or 3 mo later for morphological analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dendrite_Reconstructions_and_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thy1-GFP mouse brains were harvested and fresh frozen in OCT, and serial coronal sections (200 m) were prepared using a cryostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain sections were mounted on slides and preserved with PermaFluor mounting medium (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP-filled CA1 pyramidal neuronal morphologies were imaged using 20× objective to visualize entire dendritic fields (512 × 512 pixels; 1-m optical scanning) followed with a 3 × 4 tile scan using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Z-stacks were stitched together using Zen imaging software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the analyzed neurons were sufficiently bright to allow complete tracing of dendrite arbors, and had intact dendritic arbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal somas and dendritic structure were manually traced with Imaris 7.7 software (Bitplane) to create 3D reconstructions of dendritic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic arbors that could not be confidently reconstructed were not used in the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total dendrite lengths were quantified using Imaris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic complexities were analyzed by 3D Sholl analysis, and calculating the number of dendrite intersections with concentric spheres that radiated from the soma in 10-m-radius increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five neurons were traced per animal, and the average used as the value for each mouse during statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Golgi staining was performed with FD Rapid Golgistain kit on mouse brains that were fresh-frozen in OCT and serially sectioned (200 m) using a cryostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic arbors were analyzed as described previously (90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, Golgi-impregnated pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region were traced using Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField) under a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, equipped with a motorized stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were done by an investigator blinded to the genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the analyzed neurons were well stained, isolated and had intact dendritic arbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic length of each traced neuron was calculated using NeuroExplorer software (MicroBrightField).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five neurons were traced per animal, and the average used as the value for each mouse during statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure spine density, we took images of distal apical dendrites ( greater than 100 m away from the soma) of hippocampal CA1 pramidal neurons at 63× magnification using a Zeiss Axiovision microscope with a AxioCam HRC digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of each dendritic spine along these dendrite segments was assessed manually and counted using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spine density for each animal was obtained from at least 15 dendrites per mouse with a total length of 2,0003,000 m traced for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rac1_GTPase_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Rac1/Cdc42 Activation Assay (EMD Millipore; 17441) was used to detect Rac1 activity in hippocampal homogenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, hippocampal lysates were precleared with glutathione-agarose beads (100 L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were incubated with a fusion protein (GST-PAK) coupled to agarose beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST-PAK specifically binds to Rac1 or Cdc42 in its GTP-bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rac1-GTP in the pull-downs was detected by immunoblotting using a Rac1-specific antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Slice_Preparations_and_Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three- or 6-mo-old male mice were anesthetized with the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane before decapitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were rapidly dissected out and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) low-Ca2+/high-Mg2+ dissection buffer containing 2.6 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 211 mM sucrose, 11 mM glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 7 mM MgCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 350-m transverse hippocampal slices were prepared using a vibratome (Leica; VT1000s) in dissection buffer followed by recovery in a static submersion chamber filled with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM glucose at 30 °C for at least 1 h before LTP or 2 h before LTD recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Slices were transferred to a recording chamber where they were perfused continuously with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of 3 mL/min at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hippocampal CA1 fEPSP was evoked at 0.033 Hz with a 125-m platinum/iridium concentric bipolar electrode (FHC) placed in the middle of the stratum radiatum of CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synaptic responses were recorded with ACSF-filled microelectrodes (12 M), positioned 200 m away (orthodromic) from the stimulating electrode, and were quantified as the initial slope of fEPSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inputoutput relationships were obtained for each slice with various stimulus intensity and responses were set to 45% maximum for LTP experiments and 55% maximum for LTD experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inputoutput curves were plotted as the fEPSP slope against the presynaptic fiber volley amplitude across all stimulation intensities and the slope for the linear fit of the fiber volleyfEPSP slope relationship were obtained from each slice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPF was recorded with an interstimulus interval of 25250 ms. PPF data were presented as a ratio of the second response slope relative to the first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTP was induced by -burst stimulation, consists of four trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz, with each burst consisting of four stimuli given at 100 Hz and 10-s intertrain interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTD was induced by long-frequency stimulation consists of 900 single pulses at 1 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All hippocampal slice electrophysiological recordings were performed by an experimenter blind to the animal genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was determined with a two-way ANOVA for PPF and a two-tailed, unpaired t test for inputoutput relationship, LTP, and LTD. Representative traces are averages of 4 (PPF and inputoutput relationship) or 10 (LTP and LTD) traces, and stimulus artifacts have been removed for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calcium_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hippocampal neurons from E18 rat pups were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (1 g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and grown in Neurobasal growth medium supplemented with 2% B27, 2 mM GlutaMax, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 g/mL streptomycin, and 5% FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were switched to serum-free Neurobasal medium 24 h postseeding and fed twice a week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were cotransfected with GCaMP3 and TdTomato at 1415 d in vitro using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, coverslips containing neurons were assembled onto a closed perfusion chamber and continuously perfused with ACSF buffer with 2 mM Mg2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 min of baseline recording (F0), neurons were perfused with Wnt5a- or L-conditioned media diluted (1:500) in ACSF buffer with 1 mM Mg2+ for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All imaging experiments were performed at 37 °C using a Zeiss spinning disk confocal (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GCaMP3 was imaged at 488-nm excitation and collected through a 505- to 550-nm filter, whereas the TdTomato signal was imaged at 561-nm excitation and 575- to 615-nm emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were imaged using a 63× oil objective (N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.40) at a rate of six images per minute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH) by calculating the normalized change in average GCaMP3 over TdTomato fluorescence intensities from neuronal soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence intensity change is expressed as F/F0 and the amplitude of fluorescence change (Fmax/F0) represents the extent of GCaMP3 intensity change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To monitor GluN1 promoter activity, the GluN1Cypridina reporter construct was generated by subcloning a 1-kb region upstream of the transcription start site of mouse GluN1 into pCLuc Mini-TK 2 Vector (New England Biolabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were cotranfected with GluN1Cypridina reporter and a control pSV40-GLuc vector that encodes for Gaussia luciferase under the control of the constitutive SV40 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days following transfection, neurons were stimulated with Wnt5a or L media diluted 1:500 in culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the luciferase proteins are secreted, supernatants were harvested and mixed with either Cypridina or Gaussia luciferase substrates and reporter gene activity was monitored with BioLux Cypridina and Gaussia luciferase assay kits (New England Biolabs) using a luminometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
