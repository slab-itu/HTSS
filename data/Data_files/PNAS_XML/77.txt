HER2 missense mutations have distinct effects on oncogenic signaling and migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) missense mutations in breast and other cancers potentially make such tumors susceptible to current and future HER2-targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the majority of HER2 mutations occur in HER2 nonamplified cancers, and whether these mutations will predict for sensitivity to HER2-directed therapies remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genome editing, the data presented here suggest that HER2 missense mutations are functionally distinct and require additional oncogenic input to impart cancerous phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that HER2 missense mutations by themselves may not be reliable predictors of response to HER2-targeted therapies, a hypothesis currently being tested in genomically driven clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) missense mutations have been reported in human cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutations occur primarily in the absence of HER2 gene amplification such that most HER2-mutant tumors are classified as negative by FISH or immunohistochemistry assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unclear whether nonamplified HER2 missense mutations are oncogenic and whether they are targets for HER2-directed therapies that are currently approved for the treatment of HER2 gene-amplified breast cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we functionally characterize HER2 kinase and extracellular domain mutations through gene editing of the endogenous loci in HER2 nonamplified human breast epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In in vitro and in vivo assays, the majority of HER2 missense mutations do not impart detectable oncogenic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the HER2 V777L mutation increased biochemical pathway activation and, in the context of a PIK3CA mutation, enhanced migratory features in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the V777L mutation did not alter in vivo tumorigenicity or sensitivity to HER2-directed therapies in proliferation assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest the oncogenicity and potential targeting of HER2 missense mutations should be considered in the context of cooperating genetic alterations and provide previously unidentified insights into functional analysis of HER2 mutations and strategies to target them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Targeted_Knockin_of_Single_Copy__Heterozygous_HER2_Missense_Mutations_in_HER2_Nonamplified_Human_Breast_Epithelial_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model HER2 missense mutations as found in human cancers, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene targeting to create an isogenic panel of HER2 mutant knockin MCF-10A and MCF7 human breast epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two cell lines do not overexpress or have amplification of HER2, thus heterozygous knockin cell lines contain one wild-type and one mutant copy of HER2 and express HER2 protein at levels consistent with HER2 nonamplified tumors (SI Appendix, Fig S1) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three AAV gene-targeting vectors were used as backbone vectors to introduce each of seven previously reported mutations into the extracellular or kinase domains of HER2 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two heterozygous HER2-mutant clones were generated for each HER2 mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also generated wild-type control clones using wild-type AAV vector backbones for both MCF-10A and MCF7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lines were verified to have a single integrated copy of the desired mutation and equivalent expression of the mutant and wild-type alleles using PCR and RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix, Table S1 for a list of cell lines generated and used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_V777L_Mutation_Increases_HER2_Signaling_Pathway_Activation_in_Nontransformed_MCF-10A_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overexpression studies have identified that HER2 mutations, including G309A, S310F, L755S, V777L, and R896C activate HER2 signaling and promote transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether these effects could be recapitulated in genome edited clones, we initially performed Western blotting analysis on our MCF-10A isogenic panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF-10A is a nontransformed human breast epithelial cell line with a mostly diploid karyotype that requires EGF supplementation for proliferation in culture (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genome editing, we have demonstrated that MCF-10A cells can be transformed by the introduction of oncogenic mutations both in vitro and in vivo (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that MCF-10A HER2 V777L cells showed increases in phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, and ERK compared with control cell lines in 0.2 ng/mL EGF (physiologic) (Fig 2A) and EGF-free (SI Appendix, Fig S2) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference in AKT phosphorylation was noted in gene targeted clones (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S2), indicating that activation of the HER2 receptor by this mutation preferentially activates ERK signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, other HER2 mutations did not consistently activate HER2 signaling in MCF-10A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that HER2 mutations, even those occurring in the same domain of the protein, have distinct effects on signaling pathway activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_Mutant_MCF-10A_Cells_Do_Not_Exhibit_Oncogenic_Properties_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior overexpression studies identified that HER2 mutations can lead to transformative changes, including increases in anchorage independent growth and aberrant morphology in 3D culture, even without detectable increases in HER2 phosphorylation (4, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed a series of assays to identify transformed properties of our HER2 mutant cell line panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas parental MCF-10A cells require EGF supplementation, EGF independence has been demonstrated to be a feature of transformation in MCF-10A cells (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HER2 mutations did not confer EGF independence (SI Appendix, Fig S2), and there was little difference in proliferation rates between control and HER2 mutant cells in assay media containing either 0.2 ng/mL (physiologic) or 20 ng/mL (maintenance dose) EGF (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested the ability of HER2 mutations to promote anchorage independent growth in MCF-10A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockin of HER2 V777L was not sufficient for colony formation in soft agar, although MCF-10A cells that overexpress HER2 V777L mutant cDNA formed robust colonies in soft agar as previously reported (4) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anchorage independent growth in semisolid medium was not observed in other MCF-10A HER2 mutant cell lines (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined acinar morphology of MCF-10A HER2 mutant knockin cells in 3D culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All HER2 mutant knockin cell lines formed spherical structures with normal polarization similar to controls (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was distinct from phenotypes observed with overexpression of HER2 mutant cDNAs, which led to larger, irregular, spiculated structures with abnormal protrusions (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_V777L_and_L755S_Mutations_Increase_HER2_Pathway_Signaling_Activation_in_MCF7_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas biochemical signaling differences were modest in MCF-10A HER2 knockin cell lines, we hypothesized that HER2 missense mutations may be highly context dependent and require cooperating genetic alterations found in cancer cells to promote additional transformative features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we created an isogenic panel of HER2 mutant MCF7 cell lines containing single copies of HER2 mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parental MCF7 cell line is derived from a metastatic pleural effusion in a patient with ER-positive breast cancer and does not overexpresses HER2 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two HER2 kinase domain mutations, L755S and V777L, and one extracellular domain mutation, G309A, were chosen for genome editing in MCF7 cells because these mutations have been characterized via overexpression studies to result in increased pathway activation, oncogenic phenotypes, and, in the case of L755S, resistance to lapatinib (4, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that MCF7 contains two copies of an activating E545K PIK3CA mutation and one wild-type copy of PIK3CA (19), a known oncogene involved in PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathway signaling (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We initially tested the effects of HER2 mutations in MCF7 cells by examining signaling pathway activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the results in the MCF-10A background, MCF7 HER2 V777L cells showed increases in phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, and ERK compared with parental MCF7 and control cells in serum-starved conditions (Fig 3A) and HER2 in serum-supplemented media (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the L755S mutation increased activation of HER2 signaling pathway proteins in MCF7 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, MCF7 cells have greater basal expression of HER3 than MCF-10A cells, and MCF7 HER2 V777L and L755S cell lines exhibited an increase in HER3 phosphorylation (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, AKT activation did not differ significantly among MCF7 parental, control, and HER2-mutant cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this pathway activation, HER2 mutations did not affect proliferation in MCF7 cells (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_Missense_Mutations_Cooperate_with_Mutant_PIK3CA_for_Augmented_Pathway_Activation_in_MCF7_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because MCF7 HER2 L755S and V777L cells showed greater signaling activation than their MCF-10A counterparts, we hypothesized that mutant PIK3CA E545K in MCF7 may cooperate with HER2 mutations to increase pathway activation and other transformed phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have implicated PIK3CA mutations in transformation and activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway (17, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we used genome editing to introduce the HER2 V777L mutation into MCF7 cells that had previously undergone gene targeting to restore the PIK3CA alleles to wild type (referred to as MCF7 corrected) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting cells have three wild-type copies of PIK3CA and a heterozygous HER2 V777L mutation (referred to as MCF7 corrected + V777L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MCF7-corrected + V777L cells displayed slightly lower levels of phosphorylated HER2 and HER3 compared with MCF7 HER2 V777L cells, but relatively more than both MCF7 and MCF7-corrected cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the HER2 V777L mutation activates the MAP kinase pathway in MCF7 cells and that mutant PIK3CA may augment this signaling, similar to our past studies (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both MCF7-corrected and MCF7-corrected + V777L cells had dramatically reduced AKT phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has been shown that the absence of PIK3CA mutations in MCF7 cells lowers activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway (19), it was unexpected that isolated activation of HER2 signaling via the V777L mutation did not lead to any discernible increase in AKT phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result, along with the concurrent increases in ERK phosphorylation, again suggests that V777L HER2 preferentially activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway rather than the PI3 kinase/AKT signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7 corrected and its derivatives also grew similarly to each other, but more slowly than MCF7 parental cells in serum-supplemented conditions (Fig 3D and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acinar_Morphology_and_Anchorage_Independent_Growth_in_MCF7_HER2_Mutant_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine any morphologic effects of HER2 mutations in MCF7 cells, we conducted Matrigel assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cell lines appeared similar to parental and control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cells were seeded in Matrigel along with the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, there was little to no effect on the size or morphology of the acini (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then performed soft agar colony formation assays to test the ability of HER2 mutations to promote anchorage independent growth in MCF7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas MCF7 V777L clones showed a trend toward increased colony number, this was modest relative to controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, MCF7 HER2 G309A and L755S did not differ significantly from controls (Fig 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with lapatinib had a strong inhibitory effect on colony size and formation in all tested cell lines, though there were no significant differences between HER2 knockin clones and controls (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7-corrected + V777L mutant cells did not exhibit transformed phenotypes in in vitro assays compared with controls (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that, whereas PIK3CA mutations may cooperate with HER2 mutations to accentuate signaling activation in MCF7 cells, this cooperativity is not sufficient to increase anchorage independent growth or promote abnormal acinar morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cooperativity_Between_HER2_and_PIK3CA_Mutations_Leads_to_Increased_Signaling_Activation_in_MCF-10A_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the effects of HER2 missense mutations as single copies were greater in MCF7 cells compared with MCF7 corrected cells, we wanted to confirm that activating E545K PIK3CA mutations in MCF7 HER2 mutant cells contributed to the observed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we created PIK3CA and HER2 double mutant cell lines by knockin of the PIK3CA E545K mutation into our MCF-10A HER2 L755S and V777L cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These resultant double knockin (DKI) cell lines (referred to as L755S DKI and V777L DKI) are heterozygous for their respective HER2 mutation and for the PIK3CA E545K mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first analyzed activated signaling pathways via Western blot in DKI and control cell lines in media with 0.2 ng/mL or without EGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously demonstrated that MCF-10A cells with knockin of PIK3CA E545K (referred to as MCF-10A + E545K) activated both the PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways compared with MCF-10A parental cells (14, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF-10A HER2 V777L cells had increased levels of HER2 phosphorylation compared with MCF-10A + E545K cells but had similar levels of ERK phosphorylation (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, both L755S DKI and V777L DKI cell lines showed increases in HER2, EGFR, and ERK phosphorylation compared with MCF-10A + E545K cells and in ERK activation compared with their respective single HER2 mutation knockin cell lines in media supplemented with 0.2 ng/mL EGF (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in EGFR phosphorylation were less apparent in EGF-free media conditions (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DKI cell lines also showed slight increases in AKT phosphorylation compared with PIK3CA single knockin cells in EGF-free conditions (Fig 5B), but not in the presence of 0.2 ng/mL EGF (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there was an increase in the ratio of phosphorylated HER2 to total HER2 in L755S DKI and V777L DKI cells compared with their respective single knockin cell lines in EGF-free conditions, which was also present in both L755S DKI and one of two V777L DKI cell lines in 0.2 ng/mL EGF conditions (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HER2 is classically considered upstream of PI3K, these results indicate that under certain conditions, interactions between mutant PIK3CA and mutant HER2 may lead to rewiring and dysregulation of signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar pathway dysregulation has been reported in other studies (17, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because PIK3CA mutations have been shown to confer EGF-independent growth properties to MCF-10A cells, we tested if HER2 mutations could augment this phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L755S and V777L DKI cells proliferate in EGF-free media, but this growth was not increased compared with MCF-10A + E545K cells (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the combination of HER2 and PIK3CA mutations did not confer anchorage independent growth to MCF-10A cells, and proliferating colonies were not observed in soft agar assays (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next seeded the L755S and V777L DKI cell lines in Matrigel to examine their morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both L755S DKI and V777L DKI cells grew with a morphology similar to controls that was not affected by treatment with lapatinib (SI Appendix, Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that, whereas signaling pathway activation was increased in DKI cell lines, this is not sufficient to promote transformation in these assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_V777L_and_PIK3CA_E545K_Double_Mutant_Cell_Lines_Have_Increased_Migratory_Capacity_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because HER2 overexpression and activation of HER2 signaling have been described to lead to increases in cell migration, we next tested the migratory capacity of HER2 mutant cell lines in scratch wound healing and chemotactic microchannel migration assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In scratch wound experiments, MCF-10A V777L DKI cells exhibited significantly increased wound closure compared with both MCF-10A + E545K and L755S DKI cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with lapatinib significantly reduced the migration of V777L DKI cells (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L755S DKI cells exhibited slower wound closure than the MCF-10A + E545K cells, indicating that the ability to promote migration may be unique to the V777L mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single V777L knockin cells did not migrate more quickly than MCF-10A parental or control cells (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with these results, the MCF7 HER2 V777L cell line also showed an increase in wound closure compared with parental control, which was decreased with lapatinib treatment and not present in MCF7-corrected + V777L cells (Fig 6 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the migratory capacity of cells with and without HER2 V777L mutation in collagen-Icoated microchannels using a microfluidic device constructed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (2326).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This device allows for the characterization of single-cell migration, rather than the collective migration observed during wound closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual cells migrate up a chemotactic gradient inside 10-µm-tall channels of prescribed widths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all tested cells do not efficiently migrate through narrow channels (10 µm wide or less) we focused our quantitative analysis on cells migrating in 50-µm and 20-µm wide channels (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MCF-10A V777L DKI cells displayed higher migration velocity and persistence (defined as the ratio of net cell displacement to total distance traveled) inside the 50-µm channels compared with MCF-10A + E545K cells (Fig 6E and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, MCF7 V777L cells exhibited an increased migratory propensity compared with parental MCF7 (Fig 6F and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both MCF-10A V777L DKI and MCF7 V777L migrated faster than their corresponding controls in 20-µm wide channels, no significant difference was detected in persistence (Fig 6 E and F and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HER2 V777L cooperates with the PIK3CA E545K to confer increased migratory potential in breast epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_Missense_Mutations_Do_Not_Lead_to_Increased_Tumor_Growth_or_Invasion_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of HER2 mutations to increase tumor formation and xenograft growth was tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7 HER2 mutant cell lines did not differ significantly in their growth compared with controls in the presence or absence of estrogen supplementation (Fig 7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the L755S and V777L DKI MCF-10Aderived cell lines did not form tumors in vivo (Fig 7C), in contrast to our prior results with mutant KRAS and PIK3CA double knockin cell lines (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a tail vein injection assay to test the in vivo invasiveness of MCF7 HER2 mutant cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7 has low metastatic capability and infrequently forms disease sites in the lungs after tail vein injection (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HER2 mutant cells did not form sites of disease in the lungs of nude mice as determined by gross and microscopic inspection (Fig 7D and SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest additional oncogenic alterations are required to impart invasive phenotypes to HER2/PIK3CA mutant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_and_PIK3CA_Mutations_Cooperate_to_Increase_Interaction_Between_HER3_and_p85  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined potential interactions in the HER2 signaling pathway that may be responsible for the cooperative effects of HER2 and PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown that overexpression of HER2 in cells with PIK3CA mutations enhance HER2-mediated signaling through HER3 and p85 (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the MCF7 cell line panel, we performed immunoprecipitation assays to examine the effect of HER2 and PIK3CA mutations on HER3/p85 dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7 HER2 L755S and V777L cells showed an increase in HER3p85 interaction relative to HER2 and PIK3CA wild-type cells (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HER3 levels are significantly lower in MCF-10A cells, this precluded our ability to perform immunoprecipitation assays in our MCF-10A cell line panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we overexpressed mutant or wild-type HER2 and PIK3CA, along with wild-type HER3 in HEK293T cells to examine the consequences of their interactions in another cellular background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our results with MCF7 cells, the presence of HER3p85 dimers increased in cells transfected with both V777L HER2 and E545K PIK3CA compared with wild-type controls (SI Appendix, Fig S7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in HER3p85 interaction in V777L mutant cells may represent a potential signaling pathway rewiring leading to increased MAP kinase activation via HER3/PI3 kinase interaction as we have previously described (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the V777L HER2 missense mutation in combination with PIK3CA mutations increase the formation of HER3p85 dimers as a potential mechanism of increased MAP kinase pathway signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HER2_Mutations_and_Proliferative_Response_to_HER2_Targeted_Therapies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that overexpression models of HER2 mutations revealed differential sensitivities to HER2 targeted drugs, we measured the IC50 values of two HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lapatinib and neratinib, on our isogenic HER2 knockin cell line panel (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4 and Fig S8) (4, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For MCF-10A cells, 6501,000 nM lapatinib was necessary to inhibit cell proliferation for cells regardless of HER2 and/or PIK3CA mutation status (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas MCF7 cells were relatively insensitive to lapatinib, HER2 mutations again did not alter the response to lapatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cells harboring a HER2 L755S mutation did not exhibit resistance to lapatinib in terms of proliferation or biochemical pathway activation (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to lapatinib, HER2 mutations did not predict for increased sensitivity or resistance to neratinib in our models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neratinib was slightly more potent in L755S DKI cell lines compared with controls (SI Appendix, Fig S8 and Table S4), though not so for MCF7 HER2 L755S cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all cell lines were relatively insensitive to trastuzumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, cell lines with both a PIK3CA and a HER2 mutation were not more sensitive to the PI3K p110-specific inhibitor BYL-719 than cells with a single PIK3CA mutation, though cells without a PIK3CA mutation were relatively resistant to BYL-719 (SI Appendix, Fig S8 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HER2 mutations in nonamplified/nonoverexpressed breast cancers represent a phenomenon that can potentially be exploited therapeutically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas previous overexpression studies of mutant HER2 cDNAs have suggested a number of HER2 mutations are activating and promote transformation, our study found only the V777L mutation to be of functional significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the effects of the HER2 V777L mutation appear to be accentuated by a PIK3CA mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently across two different human breast cell line models, HER2 V777L combined with PIK3CA E545K imparted features of increased signaling pathway activation and migration as noted by changes in Western blotting, scratch wound healing, and microchannel migration assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the HER2 V777L kinase domain mutation led to an increased interaction between p85 and HER3 in the presence of a PIK3CA E545K mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that HER2 missense mutations require additional genetic alterations to promote features of transformation, leading to an increased interaction of known signaling partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the HER2 mutation L755S, which previous overexpression studies have shown imparts resistance to lapatinib (4, 10, 18, 31) did not show obvious resistance phenotypes in our genome edited cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenous expression of L755S mutant HER2 in our models may not be sufficient to produce resistance to lapatinib due to lower levels of the mutant protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may be of clinical importance, because patients that do not have amplification/overexpression or high expression of L755S mutant HER2 may still be sensitive to lapatinib, an FDA approved therapy for HER2-amplified breast cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trials are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of targeting HER2 mutations in HER2 negative cancers with FDA approved therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the rarity and variety of HER2 mutations, such trials may be underpowered to definitively address this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the majority of HER2 mutations in clinical samples are not amplified or overexpressed, our approach using somatic cell gene targeting has led to previously unidentified insights into this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we recognize that limitations of our models, including the inability to analyze immunologic effects of HER2-directed therapies, varying protein expression levels, and tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our isogenic cell line models provide useful tools for understanding the functional consequences of HER2 mutations in isolation and in combination with other oncogenes, as well as testing responses to targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study illustrates that different HER2 mutations impart distinct phenotypes depending on the individual mutation and the presence of other genetic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with recent work demonstrating similar findings for AKT1 and HER3 mutations (32, 33) and has implications for predicting response to targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in our study, HER2 mutations did not overtly promote cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it may be expected that HER2 targeted therapies would not show differential sensitivity to cells harboring these mutations in terms of reducing cell number in standard growth assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the V777L HER2 mutation in the appropriate context led to an increase in cellular migration, potentially resulting in increased metastatic potential that was affected by the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HER2-directed therapies in this regard may possibly afford clinical benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results underscore the need for examining multiple aspects of cancer phenotypes when assessing response to targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The variable effects of individual HER2 mutations coupled with a requisite need for oncogene cooperativity may prove challenging for the use of HER2 mutation status to guide therapy for patients with breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies have implicated oncogenic mutant PIK3CA as a potential partner to HER2 mutations, and, indeed, HER2 kinase domain mutations and PIK3CA mutations have been reported concurrently in breast cancer sequencing efforts (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the effects of PIK3CA mutations in conjunction with HER2 mutations due to their close relationship as members of the same signaling pathway; however, it is likely that there are other genes, which when mutated, cooperate with HER2 missense mutations to impart transformative effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the relatively low frequency of HER2 missense mutations may be explained by the need for concurrent oncogenic mutations to achieve a selective advantage in HER2-mutant tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, it may explain why many HER2 mutations in our isogenic models did not have a detectable phenotype, even though they are recurrently found in human cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work in this regard is ongoing and may help elucidate whether mechanisms of cooperativity are shared or unique among altered oncogenes and tumor suppressors and HER2 mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, using an isogenic panel of nonamplified/nonoverexpressed HER2-mutant cell lines, we have determined that the majority of HER2 mutations alone are not sufficient to promote transformative phenotypes in breast cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HER2 kinase domain mutations, notably V777L, can exhibit cooperativity with the activating PIK3CA E545K mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells with both HER2 V777L and PIK3CA E545K mutations exhibited key features of transformation in vitro, including oncogenic signaling pathway activation and increased migratory potential, but not increased tumorigenicity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of our genome-edited cell lines did not yield an overt phenotype, this has clinically impactful consequences given that most cancers with HER2 missense mutations do not have concurrent overexpression/amplification of HER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, given the current landscape evaluating HER2 targeted therapies in cancers harboring these mutations, the positive aspect of our findings and their importance to clinical oncology warrants emphasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, these findings provide a previously unidentified context for the study and clinical significance of HER2 mutations, in that detailed analysis and study of coexisting mutations in patients may be required to make meaningful patient management decisions regarding HER2-directed therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results support that HER2 missense mutations may be targetable in the appropriate genetic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
