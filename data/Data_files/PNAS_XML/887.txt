Direct dating of Neanderthal remains from the site of Vindija Cave and implications for the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Radiocarbon dating of Neanderthal remains recovered from Vindija Cave (Croatia) initially revealed surprisingly recent results: 28,00029,000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implied the remains could represent a late-surviving, refugial Neanderthal population and suggested they could have been responsible for producing some of the early Upper Paleolithic artefacts more usually produced by anatomically modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This article presents revised radiocarbon dates of the human bones from this site obtained using a more robust purification method targeting the amino acid hydroxyproline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that all the Neanderthal remains are from a much earlier period (40,000 cal B.P.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These revised dates change our interpretation of this important site and demonstrate that the Vindija Neanderthals probably did not overlap temporally with early modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous dating of the Vi-207 and Vi-208 Neanderthal remains from Vindija Cave (Croatia) led to the suggestion that Neanderthals survived there as recently as 28,00029,000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent dating yielded older dates, interpreted as ages of at least 32,500 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have redated these same specimens using an approach based on the extraction of the amino acid hydroxyproline, using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Prep-HPLC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is more efficient in eliminating modern contamination in the bone collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The revised dates are older than 40,000 B.P., suggesting the Vindija Neanderthals did not live more recently than others across Europe, and probably predate the arrival of anatomically modern humans in Eastern Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) to find additional hominin remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified one bone that is Neanderthal, based on its mitochondrial DNA, and dated it directly to 46,200 ± 1,500 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also attempted to date six early Upper Paleolithic bone points from stratigraphic units G1, Fd/d+G1 and Fd/d, Fd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One bone artifact gave a date of 29,500 ± 400 B.P., while the remainder yielded no collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally dated animal bone samples from units G1 and G1G3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dates suggest a co-occurrence of early Upper Paleolithic osseous artifacts, particularly split-based points, alongside the remains of Neanderthals is a result of postdepositional mixing, rather than an association between the two groups, although more work is required to show this definitively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 10 samples from Vindija Cave were selected for AMS radiocarbon dating (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included three previously dated Neanderthal specimens (Vi-207, Vi-208, and Vi-33.19), as well as a fourth Neanderthal bone (Vi-*28) discovered using zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) screening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to test the reality of the co-occurrence of earlier Upper Paleolithic bone and antler point artifacts with the Neanderthal remains, we selected six osseous points for dating (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test collagen preservation, we took 35 mg bone powder, using tungsten carbide drills, and measured the %N content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an indicator of collagen preservation (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that only one bone point sample (Vi-3446) had sufficient levels of nitrogen to warrant full sampling for collagen extraction and AMS dating; the remainder failed and therefore were not sampled further (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included the sample from a split-based bone point (Vi-3437) that had been analyzed in the laboratory previously, producing only a small collagen yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We decided to attempt to redate it, using a larger starting mass of bone powder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, there was insufficient collagen remaining from this sample after pretreatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also selected four animal bones of Cervidae (Vi-*17), Panthera sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Vi-*6), Ursus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Vi-*7), and Bovidae (Vi-*60), identified by ZooMS from stratigraphic units G1 and G1G3 to explore the potential issue of postdepositional mixing in the deposits further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ZooMS_Collagen_Fingerprinting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used ZooMS to identify potential hominin bone fragments among the unidentified faunal remains from the G1 and G3 levels, as well as the stratigraphic unit G1G3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the 383 samples we analyzed yielded poor collagen preservation, which prevented any identification to genus or taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 101 samples produced identifiable spectra; a summary of all taxa identified by ZooMS is shown in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assemblage is dominated by Ursus, and only six of the 27 taxa identified by morphological study of the bones in Miracle et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) could be identified here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a single hominin specimen (Fig 1 A and B), which again highlights the use of applying such techniques to groups of unidentified Paleolithic bone samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone was analyzed using ancient DNA techniques to enable a formal species identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Analysis_of_the_Human_Bones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA revealed that all four human specimens fall into Neanderthal mitochondrial variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full mitochondrial genomes of Vi-207 and Vi-*28 were reconstructed with an average coverage of 103-fold and 257-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondrial DNA sequence of Vi-207 was identical to Vi-33.25 and Feldhofer 1 mitochondrial genomes, whereas Vi-*28 had an identical mitochondrial sequence to Vi-33.17 (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Vi-33.25 and Vi-33.17 were found in layer I of Vindija Cave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously published, Vi-33.19 has the same mitochondrial sequence as Vi-33.16 (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of lower endogenous DNA content in Vi-208, a full mitochondrial genome could not be reconstructed for the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, from the limited amounts of mitochondrial sequences, we were able to trace most of the observed variants to variations found in previously sequenced Neanderthal mitochondrial genomes (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AMS_Dating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nine of the samples selected produced enough collagen (or hydroxyproline) to be dated by AMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All dates obtained on the four Neanderthal specimens at the ORAU are reported in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also list the dates obtained on two other hominin samples: Vi-75-G3/h-203, analyzed at the Uppsala Radiocarbon Laboratory (Sweden) (23), and Vi-2291-18 (level G, sublayer unknown), prepared at the Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, and dated at the ORAU (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different sample pretreatments are also indicated in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vi-208 and Vi-207 produced hydroxyproline dates of 42,700 ± 1,600 and 43,900 ± 2,000 B.P., respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ages are significantly older than any of the dates obtained previously for these specimens using the AG (gelatinized filtered collagen) and AF (ultrafiltered collagen) procedures, and this strongly suggests that noncollagenous high molecular weight contaminants, probably crosslinked to the collagen, were still present in the sample previously dated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is only by hydrolyzing the collagen and selecting the hydroxyproline that we were able to successfully remove these contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The AMS measurement of the third human bone from level G1 (Vi-*28), identified using the ZooMS method, gave a date of 46,200 ± 1,500 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these three HYP (extraction of hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed bone collagen) dates obtained on the Neanderthal bones from level G1, we performed a 2 test using the modern fraction F14C and its error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error weighted mean is 0.0038 ± 0.0005 with a t value of 2.57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If t is less_than5.99, the value for 2, the error weighted mean is not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the results obtained on the three Neanderthal bones from level G1 are statistically in agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vi-33.19 (level G3) was also dated using the hydroxyproline method and produced a date of 44,300 ± 1,200 B.P., which is a more precise date than the one obtained using the AF procedure (45,300 ± 2,300 B.P.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AF determination had a low target current in the AMS (85% of normal current) and was imprecise for this reason.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the two dates overlap suggests no significant contamination in this bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these dates show a significantly older occupation of the site by Neanderthals, suggesting the site cannot be considered to be a refugium for late-surviving Neanderthals (Fig 2, code in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two other dates obtained on samples Vi-33.26 and Vi-75, even if obtained with a method that can be less efficient in removing contamination, confirm the dating of level G is more than 42,000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only one bone point (Vi-3446P41417) produced enough nitrogen during prescreening to warrant pretreatment chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less than 500 mg bone was available, so we applied an AG (gelatin) treatment to maximize the collagen yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a date of 29,500 ± 400 B.P., which we consider to be a minimum age, as this pretreatment has been shown before to underestimate the age of ancient bones such as this (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test possible perturbation in level G1, we also dated four faunal samples identified as originating from levels G1 and G1G3, using ultrafiltration (AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples produced dates that were all greater than or very close to the radiocarbon limit (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples are less likely to have been treated with conservation materials than the human bones, and therefore were not prepared using the HPLC method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these faunal bones are from level G1 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see more variation that would be expected statistically if we combine the three Neanderthal bones and three faunal bones from level G1 for a 2 test (error weighted mean, 0.0027 ± 0.0004; t = 22.52; 2 = 11.07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows there is bone of variable radiocarbon age in the G1 level and suggests the possibility of postdepositional mixing and movement of material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In consequence, the bone tools cannot be associated with the Neanderthal remains unless further direct radiocarbon dating using the HYP approach is undertaken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the low collagen content of the points appears to preclude this at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-amino acid AMS dating of the Vindija Neanderthals has yielded results that are substantially older than the previous ages that were initially obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the Neanderthals predate 44,000 cal B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest this group was not a late-surviving refugial Neanderthal population, as previously thought, and means the group almost certainly did not overlap with early anatomically modern humans in this part of Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite our best attempts, we were not able to date the bone industry associated with the archaeology of level G1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one date we obtained from a later stratigraphic unit was younger than 30,000 B.P., but because the bone was not treated with the most rigorous pretreatment chemistry methods, it could potentially be older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dating of other faunal materials from level G1 highlighted a significant range in age, which could indicate a perturbation of the general sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question, then, of whether some of the points could have been produced by Neanderthals remains open; however, it is parsimonious to conclude that the split-based point at least must have a maximum age of 32,00034,000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  based on evidence for its association with the Aurignacian in other regions, and so it likely postdates the Vindija Neanderthals significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone points have been recovered throughout Eurasia with dates as early as 37,000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e.g., from the Aurignacian site of Pesko and the Châtelperronian site of Arcy-sur-Cure) (6, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore clear that both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals produced bone points, with only split-based bone/antler points being diagnostic of the earlier facies of the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our perception of the biological transition between Neanderthals and modern humans has changed radically during the last decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence suggests interbreeding and a significant temporal overlap between the two from 44,00040,000 cal B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our hydroxyproline dates and the DNA results, the Vindija Neanderthals date before the period when the first modern humans arrived into Europe and interbred with Neanderthals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bone_Screening_by_ZooMS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting or ZooMS to analyze preserved type 1 collagen (COL1) from small unidentified bone fragments from the Vindija site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COL1 is characterized by three polypeptide (alpha) chains, and within these chains there are small differences in the amino acid sequences among different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These offer the possibility of identification of species-specific amino acid markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to determine the relative mass-to-charge (m/z) values of the tryptic digest peptides in each bone sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing these values with a library of known fauna, we identified bones to genus or species in some instance (2731).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We screened a total of 383 unidentified bone samples from Vindija Cave (levels G1, G3, and stratigraphic unit G1G3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Radiocarbon_Dating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used two different methods to prepare the samples for AMS dating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, samples from artifacts were pretreated following the routine ORAU procedure, comprising a decalcification, base wash, reacidification, gelatinization, and ultrafiltration (coded AF in the ORAU), as described by Brock et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample P41417 produced too little collagen for ultrafiltration, so the treatment was halted after gelatinization (coded AG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four human bone samples were dated using the single amino acid radiocarbon dating method developed at ORAU (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method involves separation of the underivatized amino acids from hydrolyzed bone collagen samples using preparative HPLC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the method are described in the SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroxyproline (HYP), was isolated by Prep-HPLC, combusted, graphitized, and AMS-dated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pretreatment approach is the most efficient technique to remove contaminants, including conservation materials (unless collagen-based glue has been applied).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
