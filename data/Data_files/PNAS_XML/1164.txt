Long-term urban carbon dioxide observations reveal spatial and temporal dynamics related to urban characteristics and growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have focused on cities due to intensive emissions, viable policy levers, and interested stakeholders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric observations can be used to independently evaluate emissions, but suitable networks are sparse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a unique decadal record of atmospheric CO2 from five sites with contrasting urban characteristics that show divergent trends in CO2 emissions across a city.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with population growth reveals a nonlinear relationship that may reflect how urban form affects CO2 emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four state-of-the-art global-scale emission inventories capture the nonlinear relationship with population density but not the divergent long-term trends across the city.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that CO2 monitoring networks can provide insight into urban carbon cycle processes and provide policy-relevant information to urban stakeholders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cities are concentrated areas of CO2 emissions and have become the foci of policies for mitigation actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, atmospheric measurement networks suitable for evaluating urban emissions over time are scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a unique long-term (decadal) record of CO2 mole fractions from five sites across Utahs metropolitan Salt Lake Valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine excess CO2 above background conditions resulting from local emissions and meteorological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ascribe CO2 trends to changes in emissions, since we did not find long-term trends in atmospheric mixing proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three contrasting CO2 trends emerged across urban types: negative trends at a residential-industrial site, positive trends at a site surrounded by rapid suburban growth, and relatively constant CO2 over time at multiple sites in the established, residential, and commercial urban core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of population within the atmospheric footprints of the different sites reveals approximately equal increases in population influencing the observed CO2, implying a nonlinear relationship with CO2 emissions: Population growth in rural areas that experienced suburban development was associated with increasing emissions while population growth in the developed urban core was associated with stable emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four state-of-the-art global-scale emission inventories also have a nonlinear relationship with population density across the city; however, in contrast to our observations, they all have nearly constant emissions over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that decadal scale changes in urban CO2 emissions are detectable through monitoring networks and constitute a valuable approach to evaluate emission inventories and studies of urban carbon cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Site_Descriptions_and_Methodology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SLV is located within Salt Lake County, Utah in the intermountain west of the continental United States and has a population of just over 1 million people (Salt Lake County 2010 census; https://www.census.gov/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is bounded by the Wasatch and Oquirrh Mountains on the east and west sides of the valley, the Traverse Mountains to the south, and the Great Salt Lake to the northwest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SLV CO2 site locations, elevation, and inlet heights are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1 and the hourly averaged CO2 mole fractions are shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made every 5 min using nondispersive infrared gas analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibrations were conducted every 1 or 2 h depending on the site using working reference gas tanks with known CO2 mole fractions traceable to the World Meteorological Organization CO2 Mole Fraction Scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix and refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29 and 30 contain further details about the instrumentation and measurement procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the contribution of local processes to the measured CO2 mole fraction, we subtracted CO2 mole fractions representing background conditions from the hourly observations to obtain the excess CO2 of the urban atmosphere above background conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background mole fractions (Fig 1, black lines and SI Appendix) were obtained from a smoothed fit (35) applied to modeled CO2 from Carbon Tracker (36) (Version CT2013B) from a region upstream of the SLV, as well as from the mountaintop CO2 observation site at Hidden Peak (HDP) that represents free tropospheric mole fractions (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatiotemporal_Patterns_of_Excess_CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temporal patterns of CO2 mole fractions have diel and seasonal components that reflect atmospheric mixing and emissions from both biological and anthropogenic sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On diel timescales, the nighttime boundary layer is typically shallow, trapping emitted CO2 near the ground resulting in elevated CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sunrise, daytime surface heating deepens the boundary layer, diluting surface emissions and entraining free tropospheric air with lower CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes, along with photosynthetic uptake by plants, lead to reduced daytime surface CO2 (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On seasonal timescales, wintertime CO2 is elevated due to increased natural gas combustion (29, 31) and persistent cold-air pools that trap emissions near the surface (12, 29, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal here is to evaluate how these processes vary across the urban area and affect the diel and seasonal variations in CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis we divided the year into a cold period (OctoberMarch) and a warm period (AprilSeptember) referred to as winter and summer, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of two periods rather than four conventional seasons was motivated by the gradual transition between warm-season low and cold-season high excess CO2 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The broad outlines of the excess CO2 across the SLV, typically referred to as an urban dome (31, 38) are visible, with the Daybreak (DBK) and University of Utah (UOU) sites on the periphery of the urban dome having lower excess CO2 while the Sugarhouse (SUG), Murray (MUR), and Rose Park (RPK) sites located within the urban dome have higher excess CO2 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric mixing processes can be observed on diel and seasonal timescales (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On diel timescales, the location within the valley and topographic shading from the steep surrounding mountains determines the timing of solar heating and breakup of the nighttime boundary layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decline of excess CO2 in the morning can be observed first at DBK on the southwestern margin of the SLV while the northeastern UOU site was the final site to respond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On seasonal timescales, the shorter winter days have fewer hours of low excess CO2 in the afternoon than during summertime afternoons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SUG had the largest wintersummer difference in monthly averaged excess CO2 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seasonal difference arises from nighttime CO2 at SUG that is apparent compared with MUR and RPK (Fig 2B), and may be due to the influence of household natural gas combustion, as this site is surrounded by residential housing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPK had the highest summertime excess CO2, especially apparent in the early evening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This site is located 2.9 km north of the largest electric utility generation facility in the SLV, within 10 km of five petroleum refineries, and 4 km east of the Salt Lake City International Airport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most electricity consumed within the SLV is generated outside of the SLV and would therefore not contribute to CO2 mole fractions within the valley, the facilities within the SLV are used when demand for electricity peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hestia, a high-resolution, bottom-up CO2 emissions model (39) that has been developed for the SLV (40) (Fig 2, Bottom), indicates that emissions from electricity generation peak in the early evening in the summer (Fig 2C) because of demand from air conditioning, which may explain the rapid increase in early evening excess CO2 at RPK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the winter this site had the lowest midafternoon excess CO2 of all of the sites except for DBK, which was far from the urban center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there was minimal urban development between this site and the Great Salt Lake (16 km northwest), we hypothesize that the low afternoon excess CO2 was caused by onshore lake breezes (41) that carried air with CO2 closer to background conditions from over the Great Salt Lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DBK site exhibited negligible diel variability in the wintertime, contrary to the other sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was likely due to the sites location at the edge of the SLV urbanized area (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At night when excess CO2 mole fractions were typically elevated, the shallow boundary layer caused the site to be largely outside of the volume of air strongly influenced by local urban processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the onset of insolation triggered mixing of the air in the valley, this air mass expanded outward to include DBK, leading to higher mole fractions during the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern resulted in a relatively constant wintertime excess CO2 diel profile (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Long-Term_Trends_in_Excess_CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-term urban CO2 records allow us to examine temporal urban carbon cycle changes across contrasting urban settings, and to evaluate hypotheses for these changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trends of excess CO2 were calculated by first removing the seasonal cycle with a harmonic function fit and then calculating the least-squares linear regression and 2 confidence intervals (35) (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated trends from specific times to examine periods with consistent atmospheric mixing conditions [Fig 3; Annual: all months; Winter: OctoberMarch; Summer: AprilSeptember; All hours: 0023; Night: 0005; Day: 1217, Local Standard Time (LST)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the average excess CO2 for each day to represent statistically independent observations sufficiently devoid of autocorrelation (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A symbols show the mean excess CO2 for that season and time of day calculated after gap filling the data to prevent biases from data gaps; however, the trends and error bounds were calculated before gap filling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows the slope and 2 confidence intervals of the trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The winter and summer time series are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S11 as well as in a table listing the slope and 2 confidence intervals (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The long-term excess CO2 trends show divergent patterns across the SLV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern SLV, RPK had a negative trend of 0.77 ± 0.54 ppm/y1 (Annual in Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the central and northeastern sites (UOU, SUG, MUR) the trends were small, with the slope of the Annual trends lacking statistical significance, but there were a few subtle seasonal and diel deviations from this overall pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant negative trends were found during the summer at UOU, while positive daytime trends were found at SUG in both summer and winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the other trends at these sites and MUR were statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the southwestern SLV, DBK had a positive trend of 0.49 ± 0.07 ppm/y1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because urban CO2 mole fractions are influenced by atmospheric mixing as well as anthropogenic emissions and biospheric exchange, we first examined atmospheric mixing proxies to evaluate potential explanations of temporal change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the lowest region of the atmosphere where landatmosphere exchange of CO2 fluxes occurs, so changes in the depth of the PBL can impact observed CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the PBL height derived using the bulk Richardson method (43) from twice-daily radiosonde launches from the Salt Lake City International Airport and found that the percentage change in the PBL height is smaller than the relative magnitude of the 2 confidence intervals of the excess CO2 trends, meaning the excess CO2 trends cannot be attributed to changes in the PBL height (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since radiosonde observations were only available from the airport in the northern part of the SLV, we also compared surface temperatures at the airport and at a meteorological station near DBK to investigate whether surface warming in the southwest part of the valley could be causing additional turbulent mixing locally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the magnitudes of temperature changes in the southwest part of the SLV were smaller than those at the airport, suggesting that the excess CO2 trends at the DBK site also cannot be attributed to changes in atmospheric mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with prior work that has found no long-term trend in other metrics for atmospheric mixing in this region (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since prior studies have found that biological fluxes had a minimal influence on overall emissions in the SLV (31, 33, 34), and research investigating future scenarios indicates that increasing urban vegetation cover would have a negligible effect on overall emissions (32), we explored factors that could explain temporal and spatial variations in drivers of anthropogenic CO2 emissions as probable drivers of the excess CO2 trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior work has indicated that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are closely related to population distributions at broad spatial scales (e.g., state and national); however, the spatial pattern of emissions from different sectors becomes complex and less certain at finer spatial scales (e.g., urban) (6, 39, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, CO2 emissions from electricity generation often occur at remote locations far from urban centers and are therefore uncorrelated with urban population patterns; furthermore, on-road emissions show nonlinearities with population density (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, studies comparing nationally gridded emissions to population in urban areas have argued that emissions increase proportionally with urban size (46) or have superlinear scaling behavior (47), depending on how the urban boundaries are defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent analysis of SLV emissions in 2011 using Hestia suggests that emissions from the residential sector exhibit slightly sublinear scaling with population at the census block group level (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the relationship between population and emissions, we have to consider the source region of emissions influencing the monitoring sites, i.e., the atmospheric footprint (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model driven by meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (49) to generate mean midafternoon atmospheric footprints averaged over late summer (August and September) from 2007 and 2012 (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time period of August to September was chosen to avoid the complex meteorology during the winter and to minimize the influence of biological fluxes, which are larger during the preceding months at the heart of the growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the averaged footprints from 2007 and 2012 along with the inferred fluxes and found only small differences, so we assumed that the average footprint from the two years is a reasonable first-order approximation of summertime midafternoon transport in every year (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaged footprints were then used to calculate midafternoon fluxes of CO2, from which we subtracted modeled biological fluxes to derive fossil fuel fluxes (Fff).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slopes of the long-term Fff trends are shown in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The footprints were also used to examine the population changes (50) that the sites were sensitive to over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the footprint-weighted population increased by approximately equal amounts over the course of this study at each of the SLV sites (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the long-term trends in excess CO2 and Fff diverged between the sites, there must have been a nonlinear relationship between CO2 emissions and population changes over time within the footprints of the stations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the population growth from rural (less_than1,000 people/mi2), suburban (1,0005,000 people/mi2), and urban (5,000 people/mi2) areas and found that the population growth in rural areas was twice as large within the DBK footprint compared with the other sites, while the growth in suburban and urbanized areas was more comparable between the sites (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonlinear relationship is illustrated by the comparison of summertime midafternoon Fff versus the population density at each of the sites for every year (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship represented by the exponential curve fit is a function of the spatial pattern of emissions across the city (lower emissions in rural areas) as well as the temporal evolution of emissions that increased in low population density rural areas, but stabilized in suburban and urban areas with higher population densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since midafternoon summertime emissions come primarily from the on-road sector (Fig 2), we hypothesize that the increasing fluxes at low population densities observed at DBK were driven by increased on-road emissions resulting from the conversion of undeveloped rural land into suburban developments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with prior modeling looking at the entire United States that found on-road emissions were higher in suburban areas than in rural areas (44) and that emissions increased when rural areas were developed into suburban areas (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, per-capita on-road emissions can decline at higher population densities, leading to stable CO2 emissions even as total population increases (45), which is consistent with the stable CO2 Fff observed at the MUR, SUG, and UOU sites, even as population increased within the atmospheric footprints of these sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RPK site deviates slightly from this overall relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be because the site was surrounded by multiple large industrial point sources, as noted earlier, with the largest being a natural-gas-fired electric utility power plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electricity generation and fuel consumption at this plant has declined by 4050% since 2009 when RPK began observations, with considerable month-to-month variability (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electricity production declined in part because production has shifted outside of the SLV to newer, more efficient facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decline in emissions represents a possible explanation for the negative excess CO2 trend observed at RPK; however, the power plant is located between the urban center and the site, making it difficult to disentangle these sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work is needed to evaluate this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trends_in_Emission_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The excess CO2 trends can be compared with trends in nationally or globally gridded fossil fuel emission inventories across the SLV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently the spatial characteristics of gridded inventories have been compared (52) and here we build upon this by examining the decadal trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four inventories have sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to examine the SLV: EDGAR (Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research) (53), FFDAS (Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System) (54), ODIAC (Open source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic CO2 emissions) (55), and DARTE (Database of Road Transportation Emissions) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EDGAR and ODIAC distribute national CO2 emission estimates spatially with surrogates such as population, satellite-derived night lights, power plant locations, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FFDAS optimally solves an emissions model subject to the distributional constraint of nighttime lights, population, power plants, and a road basemap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DARTE is an on-road emissions inventory based on traffic count data and estimates of vehicle fleet composition; however, since it only includes the on-road sector, the magnitude of emissions is lower than the other inventories and we instead focus on the trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hestia inventory is highly spatially resolved, but only a single year of emissions is currently available so a comparison over time is not yet possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the SLV, the Fff derived from the inventories are broadly consistent with the Fff derived from the observations (SI Appendix); however, the simplified modeling framework we have implemented limits a comprehensive comparison of the magnitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sensitivity test in SI Appendix explores this in greater depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the global emission inventories spatially allocate national total emissions based on surrogate metrics they will, by definition, not entirely reflect local emissions (e.g., large industrial CO2 emissions away from a given locale could be partly allocated inside the locale based on spatial surrogates such as night lights or population).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we do not, a priori, expect close agreement between the trends in emissions and excess CO2 trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the purpose of these inventories is to examine subnational spatiotemporal emission patterns and our records provide the first opportunity for a comparison over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All four inventories indicate stable Fff across the SLV over time, in contrast to the divergent trends we observe in the observationally derived Fff (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is surprising, since we noted earlier that DARTE has a nonlinear relationship with population density in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that within the SLV, the nonlinear relationship is present in all four inventories, but it is driven entirely by a fixed spatial pattern of emissions (as demonstrated by FFDAS in Fig 4B; the other inventories are shown in SI Appendix), as opposed to the observations where the nonlinear relationship is driven by both spatial and temporal changes in emissions (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several possible explanations for the different spatiotemporal changes across the SLV in the emission inventories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A close examination of the Fff time series shows that the inventories that rely on downscaled national emissions (EDGAR, ODIAC) are highly correlated with US total emissions, indicating that their temporal variability is driven primarily by national emissions and not by temporal changes in their spatial allocation proxies (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is compounded by the inventories not always reflecting the emissions of a given locale because of the relationship between industrial emitters and consumers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, inventories that use a constant road basemap (DARTE, FFDAS) may not have captured emissions associated with the growth in the road network and associated on-road emissions when rural areas were developed into suburban developments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comparisons demonstrate some of the challenges facing urban applications of current global emission inventories that use spatial proxies to distribute emissions as well as the potential for future improvements, such as using long-term multisite urban records to calibrate spatial allocation proxies to better reflect local trends in emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work should also investigate high-resolution emission models (e.g., Hestia) that are optimized for urban emissions and incorporate local emissions information that can enable a more detailed comparison with multiple atmospheric monitoring locations over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study shows that long-term, spatially distributed urban CO2 monitoring networks yield insights into the carbon budgets of urban areas that contain an increasing fraction of the worlds population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These urban atmospheric CO2 observations integrate atmospheric processes, biospheric exchange, and temporal changes in emissions related to urbanization processes such as changing transportation patterns and suburban growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in Fff were likely the primary driver of long-term trends in excess CO2 in the SLV as there were negligible changes in atmospheric mixing and prior studies concluded that biospheric processes had minimal effects on overall emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We draw several conclusions from our analysis of the long-term trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, divergent CO2 emission trends were detected despite similar levels of population growth and thus, changes in urban fossil fuel CO2 emissions likely did not scale linearly with population changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapidly increasing daytime emission rates during the summer occurred in areas with initially low population density that underwent conversion of rural land to suburban developments while emissions were stable in the urban core despite population increases, consistent with prior modeling efforts examining changes in on-road emissions over space and time (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While excess CO2 trends in other urban centers with established monitoring programs are also likely stable (3), this does not account for changing emissions in rapidly expanding suburban areas, with important implications for policy makers who want to take greenhouse gas emissions into account in urban growth planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spatiotemporal patterns and contrasting trends may be representative of urban transitions in many US cities that have stabilizing emissions in their urban cores, and expanding suburban growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, trends in the northern, industrial part of the SLV declined coincident with a reduction in power production by a nearby electric utility power plant, representing a possible explanation for the decline and highlighting the importance of large urban point sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, state-of-the-art gridded emission inventories with sufficient spatial resolution and temporal coverage indicate relatively stable emissions in the SLV, while our observations point to divergent trends in Fff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergent trends contribute to a nonlinear relationship between population density and CO2 emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nonlinear relationship also is evident in the emission inventories because of the spatial pattern of emissions, but it is muted by the lack of temporal trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comparisons can provide key metrics to evaluate emission inventories over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of data from local emissions sources, to the extent possible, could provide improved agreement with the observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observations support the conclusion that multiple monitoring stations are needed to track urban CO2 emissions (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our observations suggest that urban CO2 networks that do not also include sites sensitive to expanding urban and suburban areas could miss important changes in carbon fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capturing and understanding patterns in suburban areas is important as they tend to have a higher household carbon footprint than urban centers (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, anticipating urban and suburban growth patterns has a role for monitoring network design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our data show that changes in CO2 emissions are detectable in urban monitoring networks on a decadal scale, especially when long-term emission trends and observations are linked through atmospheric inversion modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial efforts should be expanded with temporally explicit atmospheric transport modeling to resolve the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emissions in the SLV that can be compared quantitatively with detailed emissions inventories or highly resolved estimates of CO2 emissions such as Hestia (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As other cities establish long-term, multisite CO2 observation networks of sufficient duration, intercity and intracity comparisons will become possible, leading to further insights into how dynamic urbanization processes impact the carbon cycle and the development of tools for stakeholders to evaluate emission mitigation efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
