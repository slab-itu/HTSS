Supramolecular PEGylation of biopharmaceuticals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pharmaceutical practice has transitioned away from small-molecule drugs to the use of biomolecules (peptides, proteins, and antibodies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where formulation of small molecules focused primarily on solubility, biopharmaceuticals introduced an array of complications due to their more complex secondary and tertiary structures, contributing to concerns surrounding aggregation and denaturation over time in formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we outline an approach using noncovalent supramolecular affinity to endow biopharmaceuticals with a polymer known to inhibit protein aggregation and improve solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method stands in contrast to similar approaches to covalently graft the same polymer onto the protein, instead offering a broadly useful and modular formulation excipient that can be combined with authentic unmodified protein drugs to extend shelf life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The covalent modification of therapeutic biomolecules has been broadly explored, leading to a number of clinically approved modified protein drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modifications are typically intended to address challenges arising in biopharmaceutical practice by promoting improved stability and shelf life of therapeutic proteins in formulation, or modifying pharmacokinetics in the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward these objectives, covalent modification with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been a common direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a platform approach to biopharmaceutical modification is described that relies on noncovalent, supramolecular hostguest interactions to endow proteins with prosthetic functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a series of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])PEG conjugates are shown to substantially increase the stability of three distinct protein drugs in formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leveraging the known and high-affinity interaction between CB[7] and an N-terminal aromatic residue on one specific protein drug, insulin, further results in altering of its pharmacological properties in vivo by extending activity in a manner dependent on molecular weight of the attached PEG chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supramolecular modification of therapeutic proteins affords a noncovalent route to modify its properties, improving protein stability and activity as a formulation excipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this offers a modular approach to append functionality to biopharmaceuticals by noncovalent modification with other molecules or polymers, for applications in formulation or therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although CB[7] exhibits exceptional binding affinities for a broad range of guest molecules (18, 21, 22, 24), it has been significantly more difficult to functionalize or conjugate than other classes of cyclic host molecules (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three synthetic routes have recently been described to prepare functionalized CB[7] derivatives with synthetically useful chemical handles (2730).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Isaacs group methods, an azido-functional CB[7] derivative (CB[7]N3) was synthesized to conjugate the macrocycle to PEG using copper-free click chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEG of three different molecular weights (5, 10, and 30 kDa), having a single terminal modification of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO), were reacted with CB[7]N3 to yield CB[7]PEG consisting of a single PEG chain connected via a triazole linkage to the CB[7] macrocycle (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationmass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and NMR confirmed formation of the products (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no CB[7] starting material could be detected by electrospray ionization MS. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with UV/visible detection (Fig 2 A and B) was performed to further verify the reaction between PEGDBCO and CB[7]N3 and characterize the resulting CB[7]PEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UV/visible spectrum upon GPC elution demonstrated a characteristic change in absorbance from reaction of the PEGDBCO starting material to CB[7]PEG by triazole formation, with a blue shift in max from 290 to 248 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the DBCO and triazole signatures appeared concurrent with elution of the polymeric backbone, as indicated by the refractive index trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, MALDI-MS demonstrated a characteristic increase in molecular weight for CB[7]PEG relative to the PEGDBCO starting material (Fig 2C) with a shift in the observed spectrum following reaction of the 30-kDa PEGDBCO with CB[7]N3 that corresponded to a mass increase of 1,152 Da, consistent with addition of a single CB[7]N3 moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other conjugates showed a similar increase relative to each PEGDBCO starting material (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these studies confirmed both facile and quantitative conversion of CB[7]N3 and PEGDBCO starting materials to yield CB[7]PEG conjugates of three distinct PEG lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulinused to treat diabetes and one of the most common biopharmaceuticalshas limited stability and is prone to the formation of immunogenic fibrillar aggregates in physiologic conditions (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-specific PEGylation of insulin has been achieved to control both its physical stability and pharmacological properties, and was shown to reduce aggregation, fibril formation, immunogenicity, and allergenicity, as well as increase serum half-life (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin also presents an N-terminal aromatic phenylalanine that has demonstrated high-affinity binding to CB[7] (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the known affinity for this N-terminal aromatic residue is expected to be 100- to 1,000-fold higher than that for any other residue on insulin, creating a strong preference for CB[7] binding specifically at this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, insulin is an ideal candidate protein to assess supramolecular PEGylation using CB[7]PEG with varying molecular weight PEG chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm binding of CB[7]PEG to recombinant insulin, a competitive binding assay was performed using acridine orange (AO) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, the fluorescence emission spectrum of AO is collected in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the fluorescence intensity of AO increases when complexed with CB[7] relative to its emission when free in water, reduction in fluorescence resulting from dye displacement is indicative of CB[7] binding to another ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As insulin is added, the CB[7]AO complex dissociates due to the stronger binding affinity of the N-terminal phenylalanine residue to CB[7], leading to a reduction to the measured fluorescence intensity of AO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When fitting these data to a one-site competitive binding model, no significant difference in the binding constant toward insulin was observed in comparing unmodified CB[7] to CB[7]PEG (e.g., CB[7], KD = 2.3 ± 0.2 M, vs. CB[7]PEG30k, KD = 2.1 ± 0.3 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the presence of a pendant PEG chain of at least 30 kDa did not alter CB[7] binding to insulin, indicating no steric inhibition of CB[7] binding to the 5.8-kDa insulin protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CB[7]PEG binding to insulin did not result in changes to the secondary structure of the insulin protein, as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether CB[7]PEG binding stabilizes insulin and prevents its aggregation, assays were performed in physiologic salt concentrations using PBS buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 °C with continuous agitation to determine the kinetics of insulin aggregation in a solution of 1 mg/mL protein (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, transmittance was measured at 540 nm, a wavelength at which insulin and CB[7]PEG have negligible absorbance, to detect the formation of aggregates that scatter light formed in solution over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining aggregation time (tA) as the time upon which a 10% reduction in transmittance is observed, recombinant insulin aggregated following 13.6 ± 0.2 h of agitation while insulin formulated with CB[7] aggregated following 14.2 ± 0.4 h. Meanwhile, insulin formulated with each molecular weight of CB[7]PEG did not aggregate during the 100-h kinetic study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is important, as it shows that CB[7] binding to insulin alone does not contribute to improved formulation stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, the addition of PEG polymers of comparable molecular weights alone or in combination with unmodified CB[7] was not found to prolong insulin stability beyond that observed for insulin alone (Fig S4), highlighting specifically the importance of supramolecular PEGylation using CB[7] conjugated to PEG in enhancing the stability of recombinant insulin in formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial 100-h kinetic study, transmittance of the insulin samples formulated with CB[7]PEG was measured once daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No aggregation was observed at the 100-d endpoint of these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, formulation of insulin with each of the three CB[7]PEG conjugates extended stability in solution, from 14 h to over 100 d. Subsequently, in vitro activity was measured for all insulin formulations after 100 d of aging through doseresponse studies of AKT phosphorylation (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When insulin had been formulated with each of the CB[7]PEG conjugates and aged for 100 d under physiologic conditions with agitation, the LogEC50 was comparable to that for freshly dissolved insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a two-log reduction in activity was observed for insulin that had been aged for 100 d alone or in formulation with CB[7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with data for insulin aggregation, formulation with CB[7]PEG was found to preserve both the stability and activity of insulin for up to 100 d in stressed conditions, whereas insulin alone as well as that formulated with unmodified CB[7] aggregated within 14 h and was significantly less active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glucagon and an antibody for human CD20a variant of which is used clinically as Rituximabwere also evaluated to determine whether CB[7]PEG exhibits a stabilizing effect that extends to formulation with other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite an absence of high-affinity N-terminal aromatic amino acid guests that exist on insulin, CB[7]PEG was still expected to bind with significant affinity to midchain residues on these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, at concentrations used typically for formulation of biopharmaceuticals (i.e., on the order of 1 mg/mL), significant binding would still be expected even at these lower regimes for supramolecular affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-CD20 was aged under agitated conditions alone or in formulation with the various CB[7]PEG conjugates for 24 h in PBS at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this time, its function was measured through reactivity with a human B-cell lymphoma cell line known to display a high density of CD20 on its surface (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case where agitation was performed in the presence of CB[7]PEG, the antibody retained its activity in binding to these cells, evidenced by fluorescence intensity values from flow cytometry comparable to those for the fresh antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the antibody was agitated in formulation alone or with unmodified CB[7], a significant reduction in activity was observed with a two-log decrease in the fluorescence signal, approximately equivalent to the signal produced from these cells when no antibody had been added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of glucagon, the protein typically remains soluble for less than 1 h before undergoing aggregation and precipitation, which can result in the formation of cytotoxic amyloidogenic fibrils (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poor glucagon stability has also proved limiting to its use as a component in bihormonal diabetes therapy (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, when glucagon was formulated with CB[7]PEG, it remained soluble for at least 24 h in solution, whereas glucagon alone precipitated from solution in under 1 h (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, glucagon remained in its native and active -helical conformation for at least 24 h when formulated with CB[7]PEG (Fig 4C), confirming no amyloid formation during this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, formulation with CB[7]PEG conjugates provides a method to preserve the stability of protein drugs when used as a formulation excipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, this method was found to preserve the stability and function of three very different protein drugsinsulin, glucagon, and an antibodyindiscriminate of their primary sequence, molecular weight, or secondary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the case where the protein did not contain an N-terminal aromatic residue, supramolecular interactions with the proteins in combination with standard formulation concentrations were sufficient to impart PEGylation benefits on these therapeutic biomolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, CB[7]PEG is proposed as a versatile and modular platform excipient to facilitate increased stability and shelf life of biopharmaceuticals, thereby limiting the formation of inactive and possibly immunogenic aggregates in formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulin has additional interest in that it presents a N-terminal aromatic guest that binds with an affinity upward of 1,000-fold higher than proteins lacking such a feature (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affinities this high might thus facilitate complex formation for certain in vivo scenarios where a weaker affinity interaction would disassemble due to rapid dilution or competition from other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a s.c. depot that arises following routine injection of insulin might afford an environment favorable to short-term interaction of the N-terminal phenylalanine on the protein with CB[7] through limiting dilution and competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the effect of CB[7]PEG on the pharmacological properties of insulin in vivo was probed further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mouse model of insulin-deficient diabetes, prepared using streptozotocin to induce pancreatic beta-cell death (37), was used to evaluate the function of CB[7]PEG delivered with insulin (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the onset of diabetes, mice were fasted overnight to ensure an average starting blood glucose level of 450 mg/dL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant insulin was then administered s.c. at a dose of 1 IU/kg in a saline vehicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, an identical dose of insulin was administered along with CB[7], CB[7]PEG5k, CB[7]PEG10k, or CB[7]PEG30k.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All insulin formulations reduced average blood glucose to a normoglycemic level (less_than200 mg/dL for a mouse) following a single s.c. administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of this initial drop in blood glucose appears independent of formulation and likely arises from the reported dose-independent sensitivity of the streptozotocin (STZ) mouse model for administered insulin at short time intervals following administration (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals that received either recombinant insulin or insulin formulated with CB[7] became hyperglycemic again 2 h following administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, animals that received insulin formulated with CB[7]PEG5k and CB[7]PEG10k remained normoglycemic for 3 and 5 h, respectively, following administration, whereas insulin formulated with CB[7]PEG30k preserved normoglycemia until the 6-h endpoint of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this 6-h endpoint, the average blood glucose level of mice in this group was 129 mg/dL, well within a normoglycemic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the duration of activity for recombinant insulin was directly dependent on molecular weight of the PEG chain attached to CB[7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological function of the authentic recombinant insulin protein can therefore be controlled by noncovalent modification, enabling the duration of therapy to be tuned through modular selection of PEG chain length without a need for direct modification to the therapeutic protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism by which CB[7]PEG extends the activity of insulin in vivo is most likely attributable to the known depot effect for insulin administration (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin administered s.c., which is the most common route for patient administration and which was performed here, must reach vascular circulation before eliciting its function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  s.c. administration of compounds less_than1 kDa in molecular weight are typically preferentially absorbed directly via capillary circulation, whereas larger compounds (including insulin) primarily leverage interstitial fluid flux of lymphatic circulation to reach the vasculature, resulting in delayed systemic bioavailability (4042).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is known that molecular weight (and by extension, viscosity) affects the rate at which compounds can traffic to the lymphatic circulation (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, supramolecular PEGylation of insulin using PEG chains of various molecular weights likely contributes to delayed and controlled uptake, creating a sustained source of insulin in the s.c. space by increasing the effective molecular weight of the complex as a result of CB[7]PEG binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEGylation is also well known to provide a steric protective effect on proteins in limiting access by proteolytic enzymes (1013, 44), a role that may also be filled by supramolecular PEGylation in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CB[7] binding has also been demonstrated to protect proteins from protease activity (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has previously been speculated that binding of CB[7] to the N-terminal phenylalanine is not likely to occur to any significant extent in circulation in vivo because normal insulin concentration in serum is well below the KD for binding of CB[7] to insulin; additionally, a high concentration of serum proteins that bind more weakly to CB[7] introduce competition (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there may be a multifaceted effect of the CB[7]PEG on insulin properties in vivo, the underlying mechanism for the findings here is likely to favor a s.c. depot effect, whereby the CB[7]PEG conjugates slow the absorption of insulin into circulation and/or protect insulin from proteolysis within the artificially high, and thus preferential binding, environment of the depot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the effective concentration within the depot would be significantly higher than that following uptake and dilution in the circulation, a depot would thus favor existence of the bound species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In biopharmaceutical practice, assuring stability and modulating pharmacokinetics are two primary areas of importance; covalent PEGylation has been among the more successful strategies evaluated in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have demonstrated supramolecular PEGylation of therapeutic proteins using CB[7]PEG conjugates, outlining a versatile strategy to facilitate improved protein stability and limit aggregation for biopharmaceutical formulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to conventional PEGylation of proteins, this approach uses interactions between a macrocyclic CB[7] host and amino acid side chains on the protein to endow proteins with PEG functionality noncovalently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this excipient approach may have significant benefit over direct covalent PEGylation, namely, that the authentic therapeutic entity remains unmodified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could have benefits in reducing the risk of immunogenicity for a supramolecular conjugate in comparison with a covalently modified one, as the PEG chain would be only transiently associated with the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, when used in the context of a formulation excipient, it is possible that supramolecular PEGylation would simplify regulatory approval of a previously approved biopharmaceutical in comparison with that for covalent PEGylation of the same protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where therapeutic proteins contain N-terminal aromatic residues, such as is the case for insulin, the higher-affinity interactions may also make possible prolongation of a therapeutic effect in the body through complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach to supramolecular PEGylation thus warrants further exploration as a platform of smart excipients for formulation and shelf-life extension of virtually any biopharmaceutical, with additional function possible for proteins that contain N-terminal aromatic amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the general strategy of endowing proteins with prosthetic functionality using CB[7] binding could extend to use with other polymers or functional groups beyond the PEG demonstrated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesis_of_CB[7]PEG_Conjugates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two synthetic routes have recently been described to prepare monofunctionalized CB[7] derivatives with synthetically useful handles (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CB[7]N3 was synthesized according to the methods developed and reported previously by the laboratory of L.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compound was then used to prepare supramolecular PEG conjugates using copper-free click chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DBCO-functional PEG (PEGDBCO) with molecular weights of 5, 10, and 30 kDa were purchased from Click Chemistry Tools, whereas monofunctional CB[7]N3 was synthesized as described previously (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commercially sourced PEGDBCO derivatives (100 mg, 1.05 eq) were mixed with CB[7]N3 (1 eq) in H2O/DMSO [4 mL, 1:1 (vol/vol)] and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was lyophilized, and the product was characterized by MALDI-MS (Fig S1) and 1H-NMR (400 MHz; Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPC was performed in water on a glucose-modified divinylbenzene column using a Malvern Viscotek system with both refractive index and UV-visible detectors at a 1.0 mL/min flow rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were filtered through 0.2-m PVDF filters before injection onto the column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AO_Competitive_Binding_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For these studies, unmodified CB[7] was purchased from Strem Chemicals, recombinant human insulin was purchased from Life Technologies, and AO was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of CB[7]PEG conjugates to insulin was assessed using the AO dye displacement assay, in accordance with a previously described protocol (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 6 µM of either unmodified CB[7] or the CB[7]PEG conjugates and 8 µM AO were combined with recombinant insulin (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 µM) in H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were incubated overnight in light-free conditions, and fluorescent spectra were collected on an Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan Group), exciting at 485 nm and collecting the resulting fluorescent spectra from 495 to 650 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay in the peak of AO fluorescent signal was fit to a one-site competitive binding model (GraphPad Prism, version 6.0), using the CB[7]AO equilibrium constant reported previously (Keq = 2 × 105 M1) (46), to determine binding constants of unmodified CB[7] and CB[7]PEG to recombinant insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Circular_Dichroism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant human insulin was dissolved at 0.25 mg/mL in H2O in combination with 1 eq of CB[7]PEG, and samples were left to equilibrate for 3 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For glucagon studies, samples were evaluated immediately following the 24-h aggregation study without dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed with a Jasco J-1500 high-performance circular dichroism spectrometer over a wavelength range of 190250 nm using a 0.1-cm-pathlength cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insulin_Aggregation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant human insulin was dissolved at 4 mg/mL in 2 mM HCl with 150 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin was diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS in combination with 1 eq of unmodified CB[7] or CB[7]PEG conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were plated at 150 µL per well (n = 4/group) in a clear 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific Nunc) and sealed with optically clear and thermally stable seal (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate was immediately placed into an Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan Group) and shaken continuously at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance readings at 540 nm were collected every 6 min for 100 h, and absorbance values were subsequently converted to transmittance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls were also performed under identical conditions except with the addition of PEG with molecular weight of 10 or 30 kDa, without unconjugated CB[7].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregation of insulin leads to light scattering, which results in reduction of sample transmittance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time for aggregation (tA) was defined as a  greater than 10% reduction in transmittance from the initial transmittance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the 100-h kinetic study, the plate was maintained under continuous agitation at 37 °C, and absorbance at 540 nm was monitored daily to approximate tA for the CB[7]PEG conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 100 d, with no indication of a change in absorbance for insulin samples formulated with CB[7]PEG, the aggregation study was terminated, and insulin was assessed for activity using a cell-based assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Insulin_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C2C12 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and confirmed free of mycoplasma contamination before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing l-glutamine, 4.5 g/L d-glucose, and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubations occurred in a 5% CO2/water-saturated incubator at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were washed twice with 200 µL of DMEM containing l-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and starved for 2 h at 37 °C in the same serum-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 h, the media was removed and cells were stimulated with 100 µL of insulin samples of various concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, cells were washed twice with 100 µL of cold Tris-buffered saline (1×), followed by lysing the cells for 10 min with 100 µL of cold Lysis Buffer (Perkin-Elmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of phosphorylated AKT 1/2/3 (Ser473) and total AKT 1 were determined from cell lysates using the AlphaLISA SureFire ULTRA kits (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrawell normalized data of phosphorylated AKT 1/2/3 (Ser473) and total AKT 1 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0, with doseresponse curves fitted to a variable slope (three-parameter) stimulation model to determine the EC50 of each insulin sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antibody_Stability_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse anti-human CD20 IgG (Biolegend) was dissolved at 0.5 mg/mL in PBS alone, or with 2 eq of CB[7] or CB[7]PEG conjugates for a total volume of 200 µL into 2-mL glass vials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Into each vial, five 1-mm polystyrene beads (Sigma) were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were subject to vortex agitation continuously for 24 h to induce aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a CD20-positive cell source, human Raji B-cell lymphoma cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and passaged four times before experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each antibody sample, 1 million cells were mixed in 100 µL of various antibody formulations, diluted to a concentration of 1 µg/mL based on a dilution for this antibody determined in separate controls to be an appropriate dilution below saturation for these specific cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated with anti-CD20 antibody (100 µL at 1 µg/mL) for 25 min, following which they were washed, combined with a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500 dilution; Biolegend), and incubated for 25 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following additional washes, cells were suspended in 500 µL of buffer and analyzed on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed by FlowJo, version 10.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glucagon_Stability_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human recombinant glucagon (Sigma) was dissolved at 4 mg/mL in PBS containing 1 mM HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was mixed 1:1 with 1 eq of CB[7]PEG in PBS, or in PBS alone, for a final glucagon concentration of 2 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vials were left to age at room temperature for various times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichroism was performed on samples without dilution, as well as on freshly dissolved glucagon, by using a 100-µm-pathlength cuvette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Insulin_Performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male C57BL/6J, aged 8 wk, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon acclimation for 1 wk in the animal facility, mice were fasted for 4 h before i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of 150 mg/kg STZ (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STZ for injection was dissolved at a concentration of 22.5 mg/mL in 2.94% (wt/vol) in pH 4.5 sodium citrate buffer immediately before injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were allowed to eat ad libitum, and glucose levels were monitored by peripheral tail vein bleeds using a portable glucose meter (Accu-Chek Aviva; Roche) daily until unfasted glucose levels  greater than 400 mg/dL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STZ-induced diabetic mice were fasted overnight before assessing insulin performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were bled at the beginning of the study, and any mouse with a fasting blood glucose level below 300 mg/dL was triaged from the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were then randomized and injected s.c. with insulin dosed at 1 IU/kg (34.7 g/kg) either alone or formulated with 5 molar equivalents of unmodified CB[7] or CB[7]PEG conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, insulin with and without CB[7] or CB[7]PEG was injected in a 200-µL saline vehicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood glucose readings were collected every 30 min using a handheld glucose meter for 6 h following insulin injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
