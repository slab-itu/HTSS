Dental calculus reveals Mesolithic foragers in the Balkans consumed domesticated plant foods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starch record entrapped in dental calculus of Mesolithic human teeth from the site of Vlasac in the central Balkans provides direct evidence that complex Late Mesolithic foragers of this region consumed domesticated cereal grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results challenge the established view of the Neolithization in Europe that domestic cereals were introduced to the Balkans around 6200 calibrated (cal.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC as a part of a package that also included domesticated animals and artifacts, which accompanied the arrival of Neolithic communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that Neolithic domesticated plants were transmitted independently from the rest of Neolithic novelties from 6600 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC onwards, reaching inland foragers deep in the Balkan hinterland through established social networks that linked forager and farmer groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Researchers agree that domesticated plants were introduced into southeast Europe from southwest Asia as a part of a Neolithic package, which included domesticated animals and artifacts typical of farming communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is commonly believed that this package reached inland areas of the Balkans by 6200 calibrated (cal.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC or later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the starch record entrapped in dental calculus of Mesolithic human teeth at the site of Vlasac in the Danube Gorges of the central Balkans provides direct evidence that already by 6600 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC, if not earlier, Late Mesolithic foragers of this region consumed domestic cereals, such as Triticum monococcum, Triticum dicoccum, and Hordeum distichon, which were also the main crops found among Early Neolithic communities of southeast Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that exotic Neolithic domesticated plants were introduced to southern Europe independently almost half a millennium earlier than previously thought, through networks that enabled exchanges between inland Mesolithic foragers and early farming groups found along the Aegean coast of Turkey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Danube Gorges area is split by the River Danube between the territories of present-day Romania and Serbia (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this region, more than 20 sites with Mesolithic deposits were discovered in the mid-1960s and yielded unprecedented data for other areas with known Mesolithic presence in Europe (1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The site of Vlasac is situated in the Lady Whirlpools Gorge of the Danube on the Serbian side of the river (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first excavations at the site were carried out in 19701971 as part of a rescue project (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New excavations at Vlasac began in 2006, and the investigations of the site are ongoing (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resumed work at Vlasac has covered an area of 326 m2 (Fig S1) and takes place upslope from the excavation area investigated in 19701971.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiocarbon dates from both old and new excavations suggest that the site was more or less continuously occupied from the Early Mesolithic, from 9500 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC, but the intensity of occupation increases from the mid-eighth millennium BC (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Late Mesolithic occupation/use of the site covers the period between 7400 and 6200 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New research at Vlasac has indicated that the site was continuously used throughout the period of the MesolithicNeolithic transitionthat is, 62005900 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, there is also evidence for the use of this site in the course of the regional Early/Middle Neolithic (6000/59505500 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the Early Neolithic phase, the first chaff-tempered ceramic finds appeared at Vlasac (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Late Mesolithic domestic features, such as trapezoidal dwellings and numerous and overlapping rectangular stone-lined hearths, testify to the fact that this was a relatively large and likely sedentary complex forager settlement (16, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of formal burials at Vlasac excavated in 19701971 comprises 87 graves, containing 164 individuals (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 17 burials were excavated in 20062009, with the minimum number of 16 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous ground stones were also found at the site (17) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The site of Lepenski Vir is located on the right bank of the Danube River, 3 km upstream from Vlasac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A surface of 2,500 m2 and 3.5 m-thick cultural layers were excavated at this site from 1965 to 1970 (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiocarbon measurements indicate three main phases of human occupation: (a) Early/Middle Mesolithic occupation starting in the second half of the tenth millennium BC and continuing until around 7300 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (Proto-Lepenski Vir phase); (b) MesolithicNeolithic transition phase Lepenski Vir III from 61505950 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC; and (c) Early Neolithic Lepenski Vir III phase from 59505700 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (13, 2123) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the site, the transition period is broadly contemporaneous with the arrival of farming groups in the central Balkans between 6200 and 6000 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this phase, no evidence for farming or stock-herding has been identified to date (22), although different strands of evidence document contact/interaction with early farming groups (4, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site furnished evidence of cultural complexity with numerous dwelling structures with trapezoidal floors and central stone-lined rectangular hearths, sculpted sandstone boulders, ornamented and plane pestles and mortars, and other stone and osseous artifacts and ornaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 134 graves containing the remains of 190 individuals were also reported (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Archaeobotanical investigations were not conducted at the time Vlasac and Lepenski Vir were excavated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New fieldwork at Vlasac included for the first time flotation and analysis of macrobotanical remains (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the Romanian side of the Danube, Schela Cladovei is the only other site of the same MesolithicNeolithic duration that has yielded macrobotanical remains (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available wood charcoals, macrobotanical remains, as well as regional palynological data provide limited information about ecological zones around the sites and wild plant resources potentially available to the Late Mesolithic population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beginning of the Holocene in the Balkans is marked by a shift to warmer and more humid conditions, which led to the expansion of mixed deciduous forests composed of temperate arboreal species such as Quercus, Ulmus, Tilia, Carpinus, and Corylus (2528).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forest undergrowth taxa such as Cornus, Cotinus, Corylus, Sambucus, and Rosaceae suggest the existence of patches of open woodland around the Danube Gorges sites (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also indications of the presence of temporarily (and permanently) wet areas and flooded land close to the settlements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Riparian vegetation has been an important resource for the Late Mesolithic and for Early Neolithic groups as both wood and fruit of Ulmus and Salix/Populus were collected at sites along the Lower Danube region in association with seed/fruit of Hyosciamus, Physalis, Vitis, and Trapa (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analyzed pollen found in coprolites from upper Mesolithic horizons at Vlasac documented the presence of Gramineae grasses around the site as well as the consumption of domesticated Cerealia (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nine individuals recently excavated at the site of Vlasac were analyzed with microfossils preserved in the dental calculus of seven individuals (Fig 2 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on 14C accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates, some directly dating the analyzed burials, five of these seven individuals are dated to the Late Mesolithic (66006450 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC), and two individuals are dated to the MesolithicNeolithic transition phase (62005900 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC) (19) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5 and Table 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were also taken from the dental calculus of three crouched female burials (individuals 8, 20, and 32a) (Fig 2F and Fig S6) from the site of Lepenski Vir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct 14C AMS measurements on two of these three individuals put them in the Early Neolithic timespan (59005700 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC) (Table 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three individuals are gracile and nonlocal based on their strontium isotope ratios (4) and likely originated in the first farming communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from calculus analysis were integrated with the study of dentoalveolar pathologies (caries and periapical lesions) on permanent teeth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four different typologies of starch granules were positively identified in dental calculus from Vlasac and Lepenski Vir and assigned to four important tribes of the Poaceae (grass family) and the Fabaceae (legume family), all well-described in literature (30) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the starch granules were found to be in an extraordinary state of preservation, especially considering the age of the samples, likely due to the low level of processing as a result of inhalation or accidental ingestion during the processing of starchy foods (see SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Type_I  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first type of starch granules found possess a strong bimodal distribution of simple granules characteristic of most grasses of the Triticeae tribe (barley and wheat tribe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such distribution is very frequent in our samples and involves the presence of both large granules oval to subround in 2D shape, lenticular in 3D, with central hilum and few lamellae (known as A-type) and small almost spherical granules with a central hilum (10 m, known as B-type) (30) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptionally, archaeological grains are still lodged close together, indicating a small amount of processing (SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bimodal distribution shows a very high number of B-type grains, and granules are also attached to the calculus matrix (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bimodal distribution is known for Triticeae tribe (e.g., Triticum spp., Hordeum spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 4 and Fig S7), but none of these species had wild progenitors in the Balkans (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thanks to the modality of preservation, it was possible to exclude wild species of the Triticeae and Bromideae tribes (known to have bimodal starch granules) that could have been eaten at the time in the region (31, 32) on the basis of their morphology (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 AH and S8A) as well as most recent literature on phylogenetic evaluation of Poaceae species (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also noticed that recovering good quality seeds and starch granules from some of the mentioned wild wheat species was very difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Aegilops spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are absent from assemblages with analyzed macrobotanical remains found at Mesolithic and Early Neolithic sites in the central Balkans (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, none of the species of the genus Bromus growing in the region are bimodal (SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules of the Triticeae tribe with morphologies remarkably similar to those found on Late Mesolithic and MesolithicNeolithic phase individuals from Vlasac were found in Early Neolithic individuals from Lepenski Vir (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further confirmation that archaeological starch granules belong to domesticated species of the Triticeae tribe is provided by the pollen record, as very large grains of Cerealia grasses were recovered in human coprolites from two Late Mesolithic sites in the Danube Gorges (Vlasac and Icoana) and were interpreted as coming from domesticated species (29, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Vlasac, Gramineae pollens of Cerealia type with a diameter no larger than 38.5 m are dominant in coprolites from lower Mesolithic horizons (1.6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diameter is considered the limit between spontaneous and domesticated Cerealia grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantity of small Cerealia pollens decreases in coprolites from upper Mesolithic horizons, where large Cerealia-type grains with diameters larger than 50 m (sometimes up to 53 m) appear (3.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in upper Mesolithic horizons, pollen grains of legumes have also been found (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Type_II  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Type II of starch granules was found in the form of intact large suboval aggregates of small compound granules (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with our reference collection and literature (30), both compound granules and the aggregate are consistent in size and shape with those of the species from the Aveneae tribe (oats tribe), both wild (e.g., Avena sterilis, Phalaris minor) (Fig S8 B and C) and domesticated (e.g., Avena sativa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules of the Aveneae tribe were found in the Late Mesolithic samples only, and they could have been either deliberately harvested, exchanged, or ingested as weeds of crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Type_III  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A third group of starch granules also retrieved in dense clusters, in one case of over 200 granules, is consistent with those of the Paniceae tribe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of granule has a 3D polyhedral shape, with central hilum and fissures radiating from it (Fig 3E, Table 1, and Fig S8 FJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although an overlap in size and shape exists among the smaller starch granules of the tribe (35), the large number of our starches and their overall morphologies suggest species of the genus Setaria spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as potential candidates (Fig S8 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several species of the genus Setaria are diffused in the central Balkans (e.g., Setaria viridis, Setaria verticillata, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), a secure identification of archaeological starches needs to be taken with caution, whereas identification to tribe level is rather secure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules of the Paniceae tribe were retrieved from our samples dated to the Mesolithic, MesolithicNeolithic transition, and Early Neolithic phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Type_IV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fourth type of starch granules is consistent with the Fabaeae tribe (peas and beans) and is remarkably consistent with those found in the genus Vicia (vetches) for its small oval 2D shape and its kidney-shape 3D morphology and hilum sunken in a central cleft fissure (Fig 3F, Table 1, and Fig S8J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were lower in number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species of vetches can grow as weeds of crops, and sometimes are eaten raw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single starch granules were found in a number of samples, but these were low in number and often damaged, and it was difficult to reach a secure identification for them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These starches were considered undiagnostic, as they could belong to groups that could not be identified because they were damaged by processing and chewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a pollen grain, characterized by a spheroidal and pantaporate morphology, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50 m in diameter, pores between 3 and 5 m, and spines protruding from the surface, was found embedded in the calculus matrix (Fig 5A) and identified as Malva sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of such pollen in Late Mesolithic calculus could be suggestive of the consumption of honey or its use as herbal medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, nondietary evidence in dental calculus is consistent with a variety of animal (e.g., feather barbules) and plant remains (wood debris and plant fibers) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 C and D and S10), likely to be the result of exposure to dust generated by crafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such remains being below 20 m are interpreted as potential respiratory irritants (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of dentoalveolar pathologies has shown the absence of caries and periapical lesions in examined individuals from Vlasac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, antemortem loss of two teeth (38 and 48) has been recorded in one case (U64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  × 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root exposure caries were found in Neolithic individual 32a from Lepenski Vir (teeth 16, 25, and 26) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals 32a (tooth 17) and 20 (teeth 45 and 46) exhibit antemortem tooth loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, three periapical lesions were identified in individual 8 (teeth 12, 21, and 23) from Lepenski Vir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Supplementary information about dietary remains identified in the Lepenski Vir dental calculus as well as nondietary remains identified in dental calculus from Vlasac and Lepenski Vir are provided below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dietary_Remains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of dental calculus obtained from individuals 8, 20, and 32a from Lepenski Vir yielded starch grains associated with diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, three different typologies of starch granules were identified and assigned to two tribes of the Family Poaceae and to the Family Fabaceae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first type of starch granules show a bimodal distribution characterized by the presence of both small round granules with a central hilum, rarely larger than 10 m, and large oval/lenticular morphology, with central hilum and lamellae (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the experimental comparison (Fig S7 DF), these starches were interpreted as belonging to the Triticeae tribes (barley and wheat tribe) of the family Poaceae and were attributed to the domesticated species according to the consideration made in Considerations on the Conditions of Preservation of Starch Granules in Our Samples and Potential Pathways of Inclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second group of starch granules was retrieved in dense clusters and is consistent with the grains of the tribe Paniceae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of starch granule shows a faceted shape, a central hilum, and fissures often radiate from it (Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large number of our starch granules (sometime more than 200 per cluster) and the morphology of the single grains suggest an attribution to the genus Setaria spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  grains (see Fig S8 FI for experimental comparison).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of such starch granules is also remarkable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species of the tribe Paniceae are in fact part of an important group of food plants known as small millets with lower archaeological visibility compared with others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details on this topic were published by Madella et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a small number of simple starch granules were found in samples that had lost characteristics useful for the identification, often had no extinction cross visible, and appeared somewhat gelatinized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the low number of these starch-type granules and the evident loss of their original morphology, it is not possible to put forth a positive identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such starch granules were described as unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nondietary_Remains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the nondietary remains of the debris found in analyzed dental calculus were consistent with respirable fractions of particulate matter, which being below 20 m would also be naturally airborne, and all of them are therefore potentially respiratory irritants (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finds therefore document the potential of human dental calculus to entrap environmental debris potentially harmful to people, as suggested by an increasing number of studies (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our evidence suggests that starch granules found in large numbers in dental calculus of both Late Mesolithic and MesolithicNeolithic individuals from Vlasac are consistent with tribes of plants that became key staple domestic foods with the start of the Neolithic in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The status of preservation of entire groups of starch granules suggests that their presence in the calculus matrix could be the result of inhalation or ingestion during processing rather than ingestion after cooking, a pathway of inclusion of starch granules rarely taken into consideration in other studies (see Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicate that the earliest domesticated seeds would have reached the Danube Gorges area already by the mid-seventh millennium BC, if not earlierthat is, at least four centuries before what is commonly believed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Greece, at the site of Franchthi Cave (Fig 1), three carbonized seeds of T. dicoccum from mixed Final Mesolithic/Initial Neolithic aceramic units were directly AMS-dated to between 6750 and 6430 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (95% confidence), suggesting the presence of domesticated emmer wheat in southern Greece likely before 6500 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (38), which is contemporaneous with the analyzed Mesolithic individuals in the Danube Gorges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the dated T. dicoccum seeds from Franchthi were tentatively attributed to the Neolithic occupation (38), in the light of our results one may speculate that they relate to forager rather than first farming occupation of the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dates are also broadly contemporaneous with the Early Neolithic occupation at Ulucak (level VI) on the Turkish side of the Aegean Sea (Fig 1) (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent series of dates from the Early Neolithic sites of Dikili Tash, Mavropigi, and Paliambela in Macedonia (Fig 1) suggest that Neolithic communities settled in the region already by 6500 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the central Balkans, the earliest date for an Early Neolithic occupation comes from the site of Blagotin (Serbia) (Fig 1), where OxA-8608 (7480 ± 55) dated a red deer antler to 64406230 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC (95% confidence) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It remains difficult to evaluate the importance of carbohydrate foods in the overall subsistence of Late Mesolithic foragers at Vlasac (25), as it is likely that fish was an important staple resource (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, antemortem tooth loss documented in some individuals could indicate a deteriorated dental health status due to specific dietary habits (e.g., glucose/fructose consumption derived from plants and honey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of caries during the Mesolithic at Vlasac does not contradict the evidence about the consumption of plants rich in fermentable carbohydrates and could directly be related to high calculus rates documented among Mesolithic individuals at Vlasac, as calculus forms during the process of mineralization whereas caries develops through the process of tooth demineralization (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarities between starch grains present in the calculus of Mesolithic individuals from Vlasac and Early Neolithic individuals from Lepenski Vir provide evidence that Mesolithic foragers of the Danube Gorges must have had acquired domestic grains before farming practices became rooted in the Balkans more permanently 6200/6100 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be similar to the process that led to the spread of domesticated maize through trade networks among forager communities of North America before evidence of its cultivation (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been argued that domesticated wheat reached Mesolithic Britain already by 6000 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCthat is, 2,000 y before full-scale agricultural practices were adopted (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the central Balkans, foragers familiarity with Cerealia grasses from 6500 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC, if not earlierthat is, at least 400 y before their full cultivation in this regional contextmight have eased the later quick adoption of agricultural practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence in this region of large sedentary settlements of complex foragers along with numerous grinding stone tools (Fig S2) is in agreement with our results that processing of plant foods, including domesticate species, might have been common already in the Late Mesolithic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This significantly challenges our hitherto understanding of pre-Neolithic adaptations in southeast Europe and suggests that elements of the Neolithic package were transmitted piecemeal and at different times using established networks of interaction between foragers and farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calculus sampling took place on aluminum foil with starch-free gloves worn at all times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average weight for calculus samples was 0.983 g. Once removed, samples were sealed into sterile Eppendorf tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the laboratory, samples underwent specifically developed decontamination procedures (46) (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction and mounting of the microfossils entombed in the calculus matrix involved a weak solution 0.06 N of HCl (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A solution of 50:50 glycerol and ultrapure water was used to allow for the rotation of microfossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of microfossils was carried out using Zeiss and Olympus compound polarized microscopes (100630×) at the University of York and a Leica DM2500 polarized microscope (1001,000×) at the University of Cambridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules were identified on the basis of their 3D morphology, presence, and shapes of features (lamellae, hilum, bumps, and depressions of their surface), characteristics of the extinction cross under polarized light microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large collection of microremains from modern plants native to the central Balkans and the Mediterranean region collected at the Botanical Garden of Belgrade and stored at the University of Cambridge was used as an experimental reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A collection of plants of north European, Mediterranean, and north African origin as well as nondietary items (e.g., plants used for crafts and occupational dust such as wood and pottery) hosted by the University of York was also consulted and successfully used before in other studies (35, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fresh and dry botanical samples were ground in agate mortar using distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different modalities of grinding were applied to record level of damage and/or change in the size of granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ground plant material has also been left in water to understand the swelling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reference collection also comprised experimentally processed seeds (e.g., boiled, ground, chewed) (SI Materials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Criteria of identification that are current standards in the field of modern and ancient starch granules research (47) were followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Caries and periapical lesions have been recorded macroscopically and using a magnifying lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visibility location and size of caries were described following the methodology proposed by Hillson (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both caries and periapical lesions were recorded at the individual tooth level (42, 48) and the Fédération Dentaire Internationale system was used for tooth numbering (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calculus_Decontamination_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fleck of calculus was first observed under incident light microscopy, and the contaminant soil adhering to the surface was removed following established protocols (35, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol consisted of the following steps: A fine acupuncture needle was wet in HCl 0.06 M. A very small area of dirt adhering to the surface was gently dislocated and scraped off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculus was then washed in ultrapure water and left to dry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was then examined again, and the procedure was repeated until the fleck was clean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the surface was satisfactory clean, the calculus samples were removed using a sterile blade and then with a fine sterile acupuncture needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, they were slid into sterile Eppendorf tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrapure water was added, and the calculus was washed up to three times to remove any trace settled on it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once washed, the calculus samples were placed into new sterile Eppendorf tubes and degraded in a weak solution 0.06 N of HCl, enough to cover the entire calculus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contaminant soil removed was also placed on a slide and examined, as an extra safety measure, and no starch was recovered from the contaminant soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A portion of the dissolving calculus was siphoned out with its natant and mounted on clean slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A solution of 50:50 glycerol and ultrapure water was added to the drop on the slide to allow for the rotation of microfossils, a step necessary during the identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been documented how such protocols allow the retrieval of all debris undamaged and often calculus fragments still dissolving can be observed under the microscope, providing further evidence of the integrity of the analysis (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reference collection of modern starch granules included plants native to the central Balkan region as well as many others from the wider Mediterranean region stored at the George Pitt-Rivers laboratory at the University of Cambridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a reference collection hosted at the Department of Archaeology at the University of York that contains plants of North European, Mediterranean, and Northern African origin, including nondietary items, as well as processed and chewed food specimens (e.g., plants used for cordage and containers and occupational dust such as wood and pottery) was also consulted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such reference collection has been successfully used before in other studies (35, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference collection was prepared in a clean laboratory, with handlers wearing dust-free gloves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules were extracted by gently grinding/squashing seeds in a clean jade mortar/pestle, first with and then without a drop of ultrapure water and as gentle as possible to try to obtain starch granules still in situ in the amyloplast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starch granules were mounted using the same mounting media used for the calculus samples to secure a comparison as close as possible to the remains observed in ancient samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The identification of starch granules with bimodal distribution consisting of A- and B-type starch granules as domesticated species of the Triticeae tribe was made based on morphological and archaeological considerations mentioned in the main text of this article as well as distributions of wild species in the region (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following Svoboda (52), we considered the presence of wild taxa of the Triticeae tribe, and the following species are well-known: Aegilops cylindrica (A-type: min., 10.3; max., 28.5; mean, 22.5), Aegilops geniculata (A-type: min., 10.04; max., 31.12; mean, 22.34), Aegilops neglecta (A-type: min., 10.2; max., 19.28; mean, 12), and Aegilops triuncialis subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triuncialis (A-type: min., 10.23; max., 34.2; mean, 21.5) (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our reference collection, we also have Aegilops speltoides (A-type: min., 10.2; max., 34.6; mean, 19.4) and Aegilops comosa (A-type: min., 10.3; max., 38.5; mean, 23) (see Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aegilops peregrina and Aegilops crassa are not bimodal (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that archaeological starch granules were consistent with one of such Aegilops species was excluded through experimental comparison as well as on the basis of recent literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First of all, published data show that very often starch granules of the Aegilops are large and round, reaching often 40 m in size, whereas species of domesticated Triticeae are often below this size (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our reference collection of plant specimens from the area, this is not often the case (as shown earlier in this paragraph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, although the majority of the archaeological starch granules assigned to the Triticeae tribe and proposed as domesticates are still lodged together and therefore difficult to fully measure, many are clearly within the range of domesticated species published by others (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This being said, some of the starch granules can reach up to 40 m, and in our reference collection, granules of domesticates can easily reach that size too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such differences with published data can be explained by different growing conditions, as a number of environmental factors can affect the size of starch granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using specimens from the Balkan region was therefore very helpful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the fact that archaeological starch granules are still lodged together, in our comparison we also focused on their overall morphology, the presence/absence/shape/location of lamellae, as well as the way the starch granules appear as a cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, in the archaeological samples, a large number of starch granules were very clearly still lodged together as they would be in the amyloplast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This aspect allowed us to establish their strong and remarkable bimodal distribution where the large lenticular granules, A-type, are seen emerging from the mass of a high number of B-type starch granules (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the light of such observations, we compared starch granules in their amyloplast in wild species of Triticeae, using both reference material and published data as detailed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild species of wheat (Aegilops) as well as in genera of the Triticeae tribe present in the Balkans, such as Elymus and Agropyrum, in our reference collection, the large A-type granules are predominant in number, an aspect that becomes even clearer when these are viewed in situ (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-type starch granules of the Aegilops species have clearly a round 2D shape, sometimes irregular and with lumps, and a large number of lamellae across the entire granules, denser in the central area of the granules near the hilum, have been observed (see examples of A. cylindrica and A. speltoides in our reference collection; Fig S7 A and B), and this has also been pointed out in earlier published work (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our archaeological samples are clearly not as round but more oval in 2D shape and they lack the number of lamellae across the entire granule as seen in the Aegilops species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the distribution of lamellae in archaeological granules is different from various species of Aegilops we have analyzed and we exclude this aspect as being related to cooking on the basis of experimental comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observations are supported by a number of studies on modern starch granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent phylogenetic reevaluation of morphological variations of starch grains among Poaceae species has stressed that clear bimodal simple grain types characterize species belonging to the Triticum and Hordeum genera but is lacking in a number of wild wheat species of Aegilops, including some of the species known to be present in the Balkans (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been known for some time now that species of Aegilops with bimodal distribution have low B-type starch (57), confirming observations from our reference collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traits on B-type starch are thought to be under genetic control (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thanks to the extraordinary modality of preservation of our archaeological starch granules and to the morphological and genetic aspects described above, we could exclude species of Aegilops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Triticeae tribe, we also considered Hordeum murinum, as this wild species is documented in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we excluded this species on morphological grounds, as large A-type granules were consistently smaller than ours (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fourth, we examined species of Elymus spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e.g., Elymus caninus, A-type: min., 10.3; max., 29.03; mean, 18.34) (Fig S7G) and Agropyrum spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e.g., Agropyrum doricum, A-type: min., 10.5; max., 19.35; median, 12.4; e.g., Agropyrum farctus, A-type: min., 10.25; max., 31.5; median, 16.2) (Fig S7H), which also look more elongated growing in the Balkans, and excluded them on morphological grounds and appearance of starch granules in the amyloplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our reference collection, the starch granules have clearly different overall morphology, and the A-type granules are more oval and smaller than ours (see Fig S7 for an example of such starch granules in their amyloplast).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe our results to be reliable, as we evaluated the morphology of starch granules of interest in this study by using plant material from the region under study as well as other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would also like to stress that the extraction of starch granules from species of Elymus and Agropyrum required several attempts to be successful despite the fact that the plants were mature, suggesting a lower production of starch granules of these species compared with other species of the Triticeae tribe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, although the bimodal distribution is known for at least one species in the Bromideae tribe, Bromus catharticus (57), the latter is not native to the Eurasian region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also excluded other species of the genus Bromus (e.g., Bromus secalinus, Bromus alopecuros, Bromus hordeaceus, Bromus arvensis) on morphological grounds derived from both our reference collection and previously published data (Fig S8A) (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such species have starch granules that do not appear bimodal, and starch granules are around or below 11 m. As we excluded wild species of the Triticeae and Bromideae tribes to be the origin of our starch granules, this leaves us with the domesticated species of the Triticeae tribe available at the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the characteristics used in our comparison/identification related to 3D morphology and lamellae have already been used as criteria for separation among Aegilops spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triticum spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Hordeum spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  when a large number of well-preserved starch granules as well as archaeobotanical data were available (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of the tribe Aveneae was achieved by comparison with published data as well as through the evaluation of experimental starch granules in our reference collection, as mentioned in the main text of the article (Fig S8 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound granules are known in different species of plants including the Poaceae (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our reference collection, we noticed morphological similarities of Aveneae with compound granules of Sesleria caerulea, a species growing wild in many areas of Europe (Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, some species of such genus are still harvested today as wild food in the central Balkans (e.g., Sesleria serbica) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in S. caerulea, the single starch granules forming the compound lump and the lump itself were smaller than the archaeological ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of processes can cause starch granules to swell, including water, cooking, and even grinding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude that the larger starch granules observed in our ancient samples were those of Sesleria species enlarged by the processes listed above, we carried out experimental work to see if starch granules of these species could overlap with those of the Aveneae species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to exclude this possibility as our experiments show how starches of the genus Sesleria lose their morphology when ground or boiled for even just a minute (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, variations caused by cooking/processing in species of the Triticeae tribe were found to be consistent with those of other published studies (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Considerations_on_the_Conditions_of_Preservation_of_Starch_Granules_in_Our_Samples_and_Potential_Pathways_of_Inclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have found that our starch granules (found in large numbers and still lodged together in the amyloplast) exhibit a good overall state of preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations of starch granules due to diagenetic processes, processing, and cooking have been the subject of a number of studies and remain an important area of research in the field of ancient starch research (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is assumed that starch granules in the mouth are by and large the result of deliberate consumption of processed and cooked plants, and therefore morphological changes are to be expected, an increasing number of papers show that a variety of pathways to the inclusion of such remains are equally possible, including accidental inhalation (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of well-preserved starch granules in our ancient samples, including those still apparently lodged in their amyloplast, could be the results of ingestion during the processing of the seeds before cooking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant processing for fibers as well as for starchy food generates a high amount of debris, especially when carried out for prolonged periods of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a well-studied aspect of occupational health for the consequences that such activities have on the respiratory system when inhaled (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although technology and scale of processing changed over time, the processing of plant material is inevitably a dusty craft that results in large quantities of particles to be released in the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such particles can settle on hands, cloths, and hair as well as become airborne and enter the human mouth by transfer from hand to mouth or by inhalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes increase the chances of uncooked and low-processed remains to become incorporated into the calculus matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a pathway of inclusion is very likely and can easily explain the good state of preservation in our remains and should always be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also stress that many species of starchy food are consumed raw, even bitter tubers such as tigernut (Cyperus esculentus) (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Legumes are consumed raw even today in many countries, including some European countries, such as Italy, and could result in well-preserved starch granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot be sure that no processing occurred in our remains, prolonged cooking and high processing result in the release of starch granules out of their amyloplat, something we can exclude in this unique case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of our starch granules have cracks that are very likely the result of grinding, as documented also by stone tools found at both of the examined sites (1517, 61) (Fig S2), and this could clearly generate the release in the air of starch masses that would therefore not be grinded for prolonged periods of time or cooked, hence their still being lodged in the amyloplast in great conditions of preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could also explain some of the largest starch granules, as grinding can enlarge the starch granules (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
