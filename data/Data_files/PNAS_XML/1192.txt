title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The computational form of craving is a selective multiplication of economic value  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Craving is a specific desire state that biases choice toward the desired object.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although extremely common, and in its pathological form a major contributor to negative health outcomes as in addiction and obesity, craving is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a laboratory model of craving, we find craving is reflected in peoples momentary willingness to pay for the things they desire, and for subjectively similar things, consistent with a transient, good-selective change in subjective valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further find the value of the desired goods increases multiplicatively, which might explain several escalation behaviors associated with craving in real-world environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens more lines of research regarding the computational form of craving in health and disease, with implications for marketing actions and consumer choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Craving is thought to be a specific desire state that biases choice toward the desired object, be it chocolate or drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A vast majority of people report having experienced craving of some kind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its pathological form craving contributes to health outcomes in addiction and obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet despite its ubiquity and clinical relevance we still lack a basic neurocomputational understanding of craving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using an instantaneous measure of subjective valuation and selective cue exposure, we identify a behavioral signature of a food craving-like state and advance a computational framework for understanding how this state might transform valuation to bias choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find desire induced by exposure to a specific high-calorie, high-fat/sugar snack good is expressed in subjects momentary willingness to pay for this good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is selective but not exclusive to the exposed good; rather, we find it generalizes to nonexposed goods in proportion to their subjective attribute similarity to the exposed ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second manipulation of reward size (number of snack units available for purchase) further suggested that a multiplicative gain mechanism supports the transformation of valuation during laboratory craving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings help explain how real-world food craving can result in behaviors inconsistent with preferences expressed in the absence of craving and open a path for the computational modeling of craving-like phenomena using a simple and repeatable experimental tool for assessing subjective states in economic terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four-hour fasted nondieters (n = 44) indicated their momentary subjective value in the form of a monetary bid, as well as concurrent desire, for 15 snack foods spanning three categories (sweet, savory, drinks; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each bid trial, subjects indicated the maximum they would pay out of a $5 endowment in the current moment for the good offered on that trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each desire trial, subjects indicated their current desire for the good offered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter served as scaffolding for the psychological process of bidding and a manipulation check for cue exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bid trials were interleaved with desire trials and clustered in blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task could end with 2% probability after each block at which point a single bid trial from the last completed block was realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, subjects knew that their bids now could determine which if any snack they could have now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two blocks (baseline), and before resuming the task for up to 20 additional blocks (postexposure), subjects underwent a brief multisensory cue exposure previously shown to induce food craving (14, 2730) (Fig 1B and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were randomly assigned to undergo exposure for Snickers (a nut and chocolate candy bar, n = 16), Cheetos (cheese corn puffs, n = 14), or Coke (a soft drink, n = 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These goods were chosen based on their temptation level (high-calorie, high-fat/sugar content) and relationship to risk for overeating, as their baseline value correlated with increased subject body mass index (BMI) (Fig S2 and SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features resulted in a subjective experience that, compared with other active control exposures, was most akin to a craving-like state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, exposure was tailored to a particular good with a particular set of attributes to allow us to test for the selectivity of postexposure changes in valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiple postexposure blocks also allowed us to examine any temporal modulation of these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
So far, we find specific desires affect subjective valuation, but we do not yet know how.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Borrowing from methods in computational neuroscience (23, 24), in study 2 we tested three possible algorithmic processes that could explain the change in subjects internal value representation: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An independent sample of 45 subjects completed the same procedures but now had the opportunity to bid for 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, 5 units, or 8 units of the exposed good (n = 24 Snickers, n = 21 Cheetos) as well as two other goods (Snickers or Cheetos, depending on which one was not assigned for exposure, and nut and chocolate trail mix; Fig S5 and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a laboratory model of food craving as a model for craving more generally, we found that selective exposure increased psychological desire for the exposed good and, importantly, its subjective value, consistent with prior work on specific drug cravings (1518) and craving for a range of high-calorie, high-fat foods (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, owing to the use of a constant probability that signaled limited opportunities to purchase the desired snack options (a fixed hazard function in time) and a fairly broad menu, we were able to show the change in valuation was transient, and it generalized on a subjective similarity dimension to other nonexposed goods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probing the underlying algorithmic process, we further found multiplicative scaling best accounted for the change in subjective valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This craving-like state is, this suggests, a positive and good-selective linear reweighing of an individuals internal value representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings could help explain how craving can result in behaviors inconsistent with expressed preferences in the absence of craving and open a path for the computational modeling of craving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, the exposure-induced changes in valuation were indicative of preference reversals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposed options overtook options ranked higher preexposure, which at an economic level suggests craving-like desire can be viewed as a context-dependent change in preference order and understood with existing models of choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a health behaviors perspective, preference reversals of this kind imply that even if people strive to eat healthier or endorse drug-free lifestyles, craving could overshadow the value of health by boosting the value of unhealthy foods or drugs, in line with previous suggestions (6, 7, 9, 10, 32), although see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was manifest even in our nondieter sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The healthier options were rated as subjectively dissimilar to the high-calorie, high-fat/sugar content exposure snacks (Table S2) and were those that exhibited unchanged, and in some instances below-baseline, postexposure values (while the tempting options had consistently higher postexposure values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These preference order data underscore a second main finding of our study: The selectivity of the exposure effect depended on the subjective similarity of a given option to the desired, exposed options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests desire for Snickers does not make one hungrier; it makes one desire Snickers and to some degree subjectively similar goods, such as its closest substitutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is seemingly at odds with an alternative, and equally intuitive, perspective that predicts more similar goods should be less appealing once attention is focused on a target good, perhaps because the discriminability between the two is enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data heavily weigh against this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other data supporting this possibility have been observed (34), however, only when the most similar available good is of lower value than the target/exposed good (e.g., generic or store brand version).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the exposed and most similar goods had comparable values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The similarity effect also argues against the possibility that our results are driven by experimenter demand or mere exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although subjects were not exposed to the most similar goods, their value increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In directly comparing our manipulation to two control manipulations with similar experimenter demands (SI Materials and Methods), (i) a physically identical exposure for a less tempting food and (ii) a picture-viewingonly exposure, we found that, in fact, exposure alone is not sufficient to induce the specific changes in desire or valuation that we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes instead depended on the subjective experience of the exposurehow positively intense it was for the subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with prior work showing that exposure effects on willingness to pay and choice depend on the physical salience of the exposed stimulus (22) and its valence (21), with attention to appetitive vs. aversive goods leading to opposite choice biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in these prior studies subjective experience was not assessed, these studies together with our data support a more active account of exposure effects in value-based choice whereby changes in subjective valuation depend on how positively evocative a stimulus is for the subject, rather than a more passive effect whereby exposure directly primes approach behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the neurobiological mechanism supporting the similarity effect is unknown, one possibility, assuming values for similar goods are represented in physically adjacent brain regions, as some studies have shown (35), is that exposure enhances the value of the exposed, desired good and collaterally the value of goods represented nearby in cortical space, in a manner reminiscent of spatial attentions distribution in visual cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course value can be encoded on a more abstract representational dimension and exposure could act indirectly on these representations, for example, by triggering memories for related goods (36) or by enhancing the weight of a particular attribute (or set of attributes) common to the desired and similar goodsa type of reshaping of a subjects attentional priority map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a basic science perspective, these data suggest we could take advantage of selective cue exposure as a tool to better understand the organization of value representation in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, like devaluation, which dampens identity-specific values (37), such manipulations could be used instead to show selective hypervaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A central aim of computational approaches to psychiatry is obtaining a theoretical, mechanistic, understanding of psychological phenomena (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we aimed to identify the algorithmic process by which laboratory craving is expressed in valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying this process is important because the behavioral motifs associated with specific algorithmic computations can have different neurobiological implementations (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared three such possible algorithmic processes, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, and found multiplicative scaling of subjective valuation best captured the algorithmic process of laboratory craving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplication is one of the most common algorithmic computations throughout neural systems (25) and is observed in valuation systems as well (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the valuation system, composed of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum (41), is a candidate neurobiological substrate of craving (1113) and animal (42, 43) and in vivo human imaging (44, 45) work linking dopamine in this system to behavior and/or subjective experience consistent with craving, we speculate that craving is a gain control-like scaling of valuation signals that might involve dopamine, although as noted this is highly speculative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless the particular bidding procedure we used is implemented in the brains valuation system (46); as such, we expect to be able to directly measure changes in this system that reflect changes in subjective valuation and that will allow us to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also an important next step in linking our findings to real-world behavior as some studies have suggested that neural measures might be more predictive of these behaviors than corresponding behavioral or self-report laboratory measures, particularly at longer timescales (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to providing testable predictions for future neurobiological work, multiplication can also help explain a number of observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, because of the nature of multiplicative scaling, exposure-induced changes in valuation should be larger for things generally of higher value (e.g., those high in tastiness and/or low in healthiness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, the most frequently craved foods in the general population are rich in sugar and fat (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also because of the nature of multiplicative scaling, when we desire something, we should want more of it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could translate into seeking increasing amounts of a desired good, which might explain why people plan to (27) and eventually do (48) consume more of a desired food in laboratory studies and certain eating escalation behaviors in real-world environments (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some methodological considerations and potential avenues for future research are worth noting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, although we used a nondieter community sample to ensure a distribution of exposure effects for food, it remains an open question whether the phenotype we observed in our laboratory model of craving is the same in dieters and in individuals who experience pathological levels of craving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should examine how generalizable our findings are to the full range of craving intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work should also test the boundary conditions of the time course of this subjective state and the mechanisms underlying its dynamics in valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our estimation, effects should fully dissipate in 2 h. But this is in the context of repeated exposure to the opportunity to obtain the desired good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this good is not available, or when a person engages in self-regulation, this time course may be shorter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional (e.g., memory decay) processes could also play a role and require further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we find exposure increases subjective valuation in a selective, but not exclusive, manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes appear to respect underlying relationships among choice options (e.g., based on similarity) and established individual preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also shed light on the underlying algorithmic process, showing the induced subjective state operates through a multiplicative/gain-control like mechanism, the neural implementation of which is an important target for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty-four adults (34 female, ages 1855 y [24.9 (SD = 7.7)]) participated in study 1 and 45 adults (27 female, ages 1859 y [24.1 (SD = 8.7)]) participated in study 2 after giving informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New York Universitys Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects approved all procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because dietary goals affect how food cues influence consumption behaviors (3), we only recruited nondieters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were invited to participate if they rated their current dietary goals in the contemplative or below range on a diet questionnaire, were not diabetic, and did not report any relevant food allergies or restrictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the restricted choice set in study 2 (see below), additional exclusion criteria for this study included a prestudy desirability rating for Snickers and Cheetos 3 (out of 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ratings were completed as part of prescreening before scheduling subjects for their session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 12 subjects who completed study procedures were excluded from all analyses because they (i) did not understand or did not comply with the study instructions (n = 4 from study 1, n = 5 from study 2) or (ii) reported post hoc dietary or medical restrictions not disclosed at the time of screening that would have made them ineligible for the study (n = 3 from study 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the task ended before the exposure manipulation for n = 1 subject from study 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from the remaining 89 subjects are reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All sessions began between 11:00 AM and 12:30 PM or 4:00 PM and 5:30 PM and lasted 2 h. To increase motivation for the snack foods offered, subjects had to refrain from eating or drinking anything for 4 h (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Payment was $20/h plus a bonus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bonus consisted of additional money, a snack, or both depending on individual bidding behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were extensively trained on the bidding procedure, including completion of practice trials and a comprehension quiz with the experimenter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenter then left the room and subjects were alone for the remainder of the time and received all further instructions via the computer screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Economic_Decision-Making_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
See SI Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the task development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task included 15 snack foods and a maximum of 22 blocks (2 baseline + 20 postexposure blocks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block consisted of 30 trials (1 bid and 1 desire rating trial for each of the 15 goods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each trial subjects saw a high-resolution color image depicting a good and below it a mouse-controlled slider bar used to register their bid (from $0 to $5 in $0.01 increments) or desire rating [from 0 to 8 in 0.016 arbitrary unit increments (same spacing as the bid bar)] for that good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bid and desire rating trials were randomly interspersed except for in the first postexposure block, which always began with a desire rating for the exposed good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task was self-paced, but most subjects took 3 min/block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After each block, an animated scrambler appeared on the screen for 10 s, signaling the possibility of the task ending in that moment (which was kept at 2%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the task ended, only bids from the last completed block were eligible for realization (see SI Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were explicitly told this should help them think in the current moment, and pilot data showed this feature of the task helped minimize discounting/forecasting behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data loss due to the 2% hazard rate was minimal (all subjects completed at least 2 postexposure blocks, and 84% completed all 22 blocks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exposure_Manipulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
See SI Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the exposure manipulation and other control manipulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the second task block, the computer program was interrupted with written instructions to find and open a covered tray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tray contained a Snickers bar, bag of Cheetos, or can of Coke (randomly assigned).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adapted from prior work (14, 2730), the multisensory exposure included instructions to examine the item in the tray by opening or unwrapping it, breaking off a piece or pouring it into a cup, and smelling it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were instructed to imagine the taste and texture without actually tasting it, rather by recalling a memory of consuming this item last.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate compliance with instructions and the maintenance of a continuous representation of the exposed good after the exposure, subjects were told they would later have to answer questions about the activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 3 min had elapsed, subjects were instructed to place the item back in the tray, cover it, and resume the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Posttask_Ratings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immediately after bid realization, subjects were asked for a brief description of the memory called to mind during the exposure manipulation, how good or bad they felt, and the intensity of that feeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then completed a series of similarity and subjective attribute ratings (Fig 1C and SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Procedures largely paralleled those of study 1 (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes implemented were aimed at testing the algorithmic process of the exposure effect in valuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of a single vending-machinesized Snickers bar or a 3.5-oz bag of Cheetos, here we used instead fun-sized Snickers bars and 1-oz Cheetos bags offered in units of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify the choice set and reduce the number of trials we omitted drinks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third mixture category snack (nut and chocolate trail mix, also offered in five quantities) was available instead, for a total of 15 unique options (3 snack goods × 5 quantities of each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional changes included (i) subject assignment to one of two exposure groups (Snickers or Cheetos); (ii) because of the repetitiveness of the three-item task, a maximum of 12 task blocks (2 baseline + 10 postexposure blocks); and (iii) an endowment for bidding of $10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were analyzed in Matlab R2015b (MathWorks) using the Statistics and Machine-Learning Toolbox and SPSS v.22 (IBM Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two classes of LMMs were fitted: (i) a priori hypothesis-driven models, as described in Results, and (ii) exploratory/control models (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise noted, all models included fixed-effect intercept and slopes and random intercept and slopes varying by subject and were fitted using fitglme in Matlab, assuming Gaussian distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated-measures ANOVAs and t tests were used to examine the exposure main effect (both studies) and differences in the individually estimated parameters  and  (study 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were considered significant at P less_than 0.05, two tailed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
