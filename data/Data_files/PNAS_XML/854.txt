Effects of maternal investment, temperament, and cognition on guide dog success  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A successful guide dog must navigate a complex world, avoid distractions, and respond adaptively to unpredictable events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What leads to success?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed 98 puppies from birth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Puppies were enrolled in a training program where only 70% achieved success as guide dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More intense mothering early in life was associated with program failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mothers whose nursing style required greater effort by puppies produced more successful offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among young adult dogs, poor problem-solving abilities, perseveration, and apparently greater anxiety when confronted with a novel object were also associated with program failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results mirror the results from rodents and humans, reaffirming the enduring effects on adult behavior of maternal style and individual differences in temperament and cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A continuing debate in studies of social development in both humans and other animals is the extent to which early life experiences affect adult behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also unclear are the relative contributions of cognitive skills (intelligence) and temperament for successful outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guide dogs are particularly suited to research on these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To succeed as a guide dog, individuals must accomplish complex navigation and decision making without succumbing to distractions and unforeseen obstacles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faced with these rigorous demands, only 70% of dogs that enter training ultimately achieve success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What predicts success as a guide dog?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these questions, we followed 98 puppies from birth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that high levels of overall maternal behavior were linked with a higher likelihood of program failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mothers whose nursing style required greater effort by puppies were more likely to produce successful offspring, whereas mothers whose nursing style required less effort were more likely to produce offspring that failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In young adults, an inability to solve a multistep task quickly, compounded with high levels of perseveration during the task, was associated with failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young adults that were released from the program also appeared more anxious, as indicated by a short latency to vocalize when faced with a novel object task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that both maternal nursing behavior and individual traits of cognition and temperament are associated with guide dog success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Demographics of mothers and puppies in the study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summary of young adult tasks that were used in analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample size of observed dataset  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maternal_Style  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From videotapes of mothers and puppies, we extracted seven variables of maternal behavior: time spent in a nursing box with puppies, contact, licking/grooming, lateral nursing (mother lying on side), vertical nursing (mother sitting/standing), ventral nursing (mother lying on stomach), and orienting away from puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behaviors all loaded onto one principal component (PC), Maternal behavior, that explained a significant portion of the variance (54%), remained stable over time, and was correlated with concurrent experimental and hormonal measures of maternal care (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers that scored high on this component were vigilant, often in proximity to their litter, and regularly interacted with their puppies (further details are provided in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mothers also showed higher baseline cortisol levels and a greater stress response when briefly separated from their puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in Maternal behavior were associated with several measures of young adult performance (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs that experienced more maternal care were more active when isolated (task 1b: estimate = 0.57, Wald = 7.35, P = 0.007), slower and more perseverative at multistep problem solving (task 5: estimate = 0.48, Wald = 4.21, P = 0.04), and quicker to vocalize during the novel object task (task 10b: estimate = 0.59, Wald = 5.62, P = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other maternal behavior effects varied by breed (SI Materials and Methods and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in Maternal behavior were also associated with outcome, whereby puppies that experienced lower levels of maternal behavior were more likely to succeed (SI Materials and Methods and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research in other species has shown that specific maternal behaviors, particularly nursing styles, can have long-term effects on offspring development (Introduction), and our Maternal behavior PC included three nursing types that loaded at varying strengths and recalled some differences in nursing styles in other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we analyzed which of the behaviors that loaded strongly onto Maternal behavior were associated with outcome (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We standardized each variable and entered it singly as a predictor variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon determining which variables were significantly associated with outcome in individual models, we combined those variables into a single logistic regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We built a generalized estimating equation (GEE) general linear model (GLM) with outcome as the dependent variable; time in the nursing box, licking/grooming per puppy, vertical nursing per puppy, and ventral nursing per puppy were entered as predictors with breed, maternal parity, sex of puppy, and age at return entered as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter identification (ID) was a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results (Table S6) revealed a main effect of ventral nursing (Wald = 10.20, P = 0.001): Puppies exposed to high levels of ventral nursing were more likely to be released from the program [odds ratio (OR) = 4.22, odds of program release 4.22-fold higher].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also a main effect of vertical nursing (Wald = 34.57, P less_than 0.001), but in the opposite direction: Puppies exposed to more vertical nursing were less likely to be released (OR = 0.25, 75% lower odds of program release).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Young_Adult_Test_Performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dogs participated in 11 tasks of temperament and cognition as young adults, just before entering The Seeing Eye training program (5, 6, 22, 26, 27, 31, 3751) (SI Materials and Methods and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 11 tasks yielded scores that could be summarized by 13 PCs and two standardized/z-scored variables (SI Materials and Methods and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which of the young adult performance tests best predicted program outcome (52, 53) (SI Materials and Methods), we included data from both our primary dataset (n = 98; 66 successes and 32 behavioral releases) and from an additional 32 subjects that had entered the training program but were subsequently released for medical reasons (imputed dataset; Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three young adult test scores were associated with program outcome in both the observed and the observed plus imputed datasets (Table S8, tasks 5, 10b, and 11a): poor performance on the multistep problem-solving task, latency to vocalize when presented with a novel object, and umbrella-opening reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore selected these three tests for inclusion into a final multivariate logistic regression model (Table S9) that used program outcome from only the observed (nonimputed) dataset as the dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three tests remained associated with program outcome (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Maternal_Style_and_Young_Adult_Performance_Combined  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare the predictive strength of maternal style and young adult test performance, we built a single model that incorporated both classes of variables as predictors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Program outcome was the dependent variable, and predictors were the Maternal behavior PC and the three young adult test performance variables listed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included as covariates breed, maternal parity, sex of puppy, and age at return.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter ID was entered as a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in earlier tests, we found a main effect of Maternal behavior (Wald = 4.62, P = 0.03), indicating that puppies raised by mothers with high scores on Maternal behavior were more likely to be released (OR = 2.61, odds of program release 2.61-fold higher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found an association with performance on the multistep problem-solving task (Wald = 4.52, P = 0.03), indicating that dogs performing poorly on this task were more likely to be released (OR = 1.67, odds of program release 1.67-fold higher; Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, young adults of all breeds that were slow to vocalize during the novel object task were less likely to be released (Wald = 4.39, P = 0.04, OR = 0.50, odds of program release 50% lower; Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found an interaction between breed and reactivity to the umbrella-opening task (Wald = 11.00, OR = 0.27, P less_than 0.001): Labrador Retrievers that showed stronger behavioral responses had higher rates of release from the program (Wald = 4.89, P = 0.03, OR = 1.80, odds of program release 1.80-fold higher), whereas Golden Retrievers with stronger responses had lower rates (Wald = 5.28, P = 0.02, OR = 0.48, odds of program release 52% lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, age at return, a demographic factor, was also found to be important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs that returned to headquarters at a younger age had higher rates of program release (Wald = 5.94, P = 0.02, OR = 0.57, odds of program release 43% lower with each additional month remaining with puppy-raising family).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Comparisons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several measures of maternal behavior and young adult performance were significantly associated with outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associations remained significant even when the predictors were combined into a single model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which combination of measures best predicted outcome, we tested the discrimination, or performance, of each model by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), which quantified each models ability to classify a dog correctly as an eventual program release or success (higher AUCs indicate better predictive power) (54, 55) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AUCs and 95% confidence intervals for all models are listed in Table S10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values for all models were above 0.5, indicating that all combinations of maternal and young adult measures were predictive of outcome at above chance levels (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared models, we found that the Maternal behavior-only model was significantly different from the young adult-only model (the latter was better: Z = 1.99, P = 0.05) and the combined Maternal behavior and young adult model (the combination model was better: Z = 2.24, P = 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore concluded that both maternal style and young adult behavior are important, but the young adult measures were more powerful from a predictive standpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For illustrative purposes, we summarize in Fig 1 the main effects of Maternal behavior and young adult performance on outcome and illustrate the likelihood of success when dogs were ranked according to their performance on these measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Breed_Classifications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Puppies from cross-litters (n = 31) were categorized as the breed that contributed over 50% of their genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they were 50% Labrador Retriever and 50% Golden Retriever, they were assigned their mothers breed (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we tested 51 German Shepherds, 60 Labrador Retrievers, and 22 Golden Retrievers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the final analysis of program outcome (n = 98), the sample consisted of 39 German Shepherds, 44 Labrador Retrievers, and 15 Golden Retrievers (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Material_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers were housed singly in indoor pens with access to an outdoor area through a guillotine door, and puppies were contained in towel-lined kiddie pools (nursing boxes) over the first 3 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We coded distinct behaviors by mothers: time spent in the nursing box with puppies, contact, licking/grooming, lateral nursing (mother lying on side), vertical nursing (mother sitting/standing), ventral nursing (mother lying on stomach), and orienting away from puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behaviors all loaded strongly onto one PC, Maternal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This component explained a significant portion of the variance, remained stable over time, and had predictive validity because it was correlated with independent experimental and hormonal measures of mothering (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers that scored high on Maternal behavior were vigilant; often in proximity to their litter; and regularly contacted, licked, groomed, and nursed their puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Maternal_Behavior_as_a_Predictor_Variable  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Maternal behavior scores were significantly positively correlated across weeks 1, 2, and 3 (36), we use week 2 Maternal behavior scores in all analyses as our predictor variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to observe two litters on week 2, so these puppies were given the average of their mothers week 1 and week 3 Maternal behavior scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we could not identify puppies individually on our videotapes, all littermates received the same score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Maternal_Behavior_Association_with_Outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted a GEE-GLM with outcome as the dependent variable, Maternal behavior as the predictor variable, and litter ID as a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breed, maternal parity, sex of puppy, and age at return were included as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results (Table S5) revealed a significant main effect of Maternal behavior (Wald = 12.98, P less_than 0.001): Puppies raised by mothers exhibiting more maternal behavior were more likely to be released from the program (OR = 3.39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The odds of program release were 3.39-fold higher with each SD increase in Maternal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the covariates were significant predictors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Testing_After_Return_to_The_Seeing_Eye_and_After_Surgery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After returning to headquarters for training, males were housed individually, whereas females were often housed with a same-sex kennelmate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All dogs received food twice a day (7:00 hours and 16:00 hours), and water was always available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lights were switched on around 6:30 hours in the morning and turned off at 18:00 hours at night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Young adult testing took place from May through October 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most dogs completed postarrival (PA) testing 2 d (n = 107) or 3 d (n = 22) after they were returned to headquarters from their puppy-raising families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One dog was tested 1 d PA, two were tested 5 d PA, and one was tested 6 d PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority then completed a second round of postsurgery (PS) testing 2 d (n = 100) or 3 d (n = 24) after undergoing anesthesia for alteration surgery and/or hip X-rays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One dog each was tested 8, 16, 21, 22, and 23 d PS, whereas four dogs did not undergo anesthesia at all before PS testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS testing was identical to PA testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All testing occurred in an 11 × 7-ft examination room located within an unoccupied kennel wing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing occurred between 7:30 hours and 17:30 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a testing day, each dog was tested twice and tasks were always presented in the same order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within a given dogs testing session, tasks occurred one after the other with only brief breaks for setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food rewards consisted of Zukes Mini Naturals treats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing sessions were videotaped using Sony video cameras (HDR-PJ230, HDR-CX405) mounted on tripods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following variables were coded from videotape either by one of the authors (E.E.B.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or by a research assistant who had participated in data collection: all variables from isolation, perseveration during multistep problem solving, all variables from the novel object task, and initial response during the umbrella-opening task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the reliability of the video-coded variables, an additional coder coded 20% of randomly selected trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interrater reliability was assessed by calculating Spearmans rho for continuous variables and Cohens kappa for categorical variables (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other performance measures were coded live.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Reduction_Applied_to_Young_Adult_Cognitive_and_Temperament_Tasks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which variables to include in the young adult analysis, we compared the dogs rankings on the 29 scores (derived from 11 tasks; Table S2) at PA testing with their rankings on these same scores at PS testing by computing Kendall rank correlation coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results revealed significant correlations (P less_than 0.05) for 21 of 29 scores and a marginally significant correlation (P = 0.09) for one of 29 scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven of 29 scores were not significantly correlated (P  0.10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the dogs rank order of performance was significantly correlated in 21 of 29 (72%) task variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the lack of correlation in three scores (cylinder task and two detour problem-solving performance measures) was most likely due to a ceiling effect on the task at the time of the second testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the conditions surrounding PA testing were much more consistent across dogs than the conditions surrounding PS testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PA testing happened 2 to 3 d PA in 97% of subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS testing happened 2 to 3 d PS in 92% of subjects, but time of surgery varied by dog and ranged from 1 to 30 d PA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some dogs never had surgery [e.g., dogs earmarked for the breeding program at the time of testing (n = 15), dogs that had previously been spayed or neutered (n = 4), dogs that had medical issues (n = 2)], and three of the four dogs that were previously altered did not undergo anesthesia before their second testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore elected to use only results from PA (the initial) testing in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only seven dogs (five males and two females) were altered before young adult testing, so data for altered and intact dogs were not considered separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using PA data only, we looked at each of the 11 tasks to determine how and/or if each of the task variables could be summarized in one or two PCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results revealed that the 29 variables from all tasks could be summarized by 15 measures: 13 PCs using a varimax rotation and two z-scored variables that were not appropriate for PCA due to unacceptable KaiserMeyerOlkin values below 0.50 (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the modest size of our dataset, it was necessary to reduce the total number of young adult behaviors that could be considered in a multivariate model (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To screen the young adult behaviors most associated with outcome in the program, we first evaluated each task score component in a separate GEE-GLM that clustered young adult dogs by litter as the unit of observation (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models allowed us to evaluate the association between individual task score and program outcome after adjustment for important confounders (breed, maternal parity, sex of puppy, and age at return).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not adjust for multiple testing because we expected that our task performance measures were correlated with one another, especially measures that were derived from the same task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, because our goal was prediction, we needed to look at each measures individual association with outcome to select the best smaller subset to be considered jointly (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Young_Adult_Testing_Association_with_Outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following scores were associated with release from the program: Dogs with slow solve times and high levels of perseveration on the multistep problem-solving task were more likely to be released (Table S9, task 5: OR = 1.75, Wald = 5.63, P = 0.02, odds of program release 1.75-fold higher; Movie S1), whereas dogs displaying a long latency to vocalize during the novel object task were less likely to be released (task 10b: OR = 0.43, Wald = 6.51, P = 0.01, odds of program release 57% lower; Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also a significant interaction between breed and reactivity in the umbrella-opening task (task 11a: OR = 0.23, Wald = 10.30, P = 0.001): Golden Retrievers that visibly reacted to the surprising event were less likely to be released from the program (Wald = 6.22, OR = 0.40, P = 0.01, odds of program release 60% lower), whereas Labrador Retrievers that reacted strongly were more likely to be released (Wald = 4.15, OR = 1.70, P = 0.04, odds of program release 1.70-fold higher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age at return and sex were also significant independent predictors of outcome: Dogs that returned to headquarters at older ages had a lower probability of being released (Wald = 4.41, P = 0.04, OR = 0.59, odds of program release 41% lower), and the risk of program release was 69% lower for males than for females (Wald = 4.03, P = 0.045, OR = 0.31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discrimination_of_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the discrimination of each model, we computed the areas under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the R package pROC (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were computed using the bootstrapping method, also in pROC (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used paired-design roc.tests to compare the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the different models with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Associations_Between_Maternal_Behavior_and_Measures_of_Young_Adult_Test_Performance_in_Which_There_Was_an_Interaction_Between_Maternal_Behavior_and_Breed  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was an interaction between breed and Maternal behavior on superior performance during memory problem solving (Table S4, task 4a: Wald = 4.68, P = 0.03), as well as between breed and Maternal behavior on accuracy during this task (task 4b; Wald = 8.81, P = 0.003): Golden Retrievers that experienced high levels of maternal care were persistent and quick to solve the memory problem-solving task (Wald = 6.25, P = 0.01), but they were also less accurate (Wald = 10.10, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found a significant interaction between breed and Maternal behavior on wariness during the novel object task (task 10a: Wald = 8.25, P = 0.004): Labrador Retrievers that experienced higher levels of maternal care oriented toward the novel objects at high levels but were slow to approach them (Wald = 9.16, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found an interaction between breed and Maternal behavior on recovery during umbrella opening (task 11b; Wald = 7.57, P less_than 0.01): Labrador Retrievers that experienced higher levels of maternal behavior were slower to approach the umbrella postopening and spent less time in contact with it (Wald = 8.51, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like Foyer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) and Guardini et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), we found an association between maternal behavior and young adult behavior in tests of temperament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, contrary to their results, we found that increased maternal behavior was positively associated with undesirable anxiety-related behaviors and performance in young adult dogs, including high activity when isolated, a short latency to vocalize when presented with a novel object, and perseverative errors and poor performance during a problem-solving task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our final model, the only nonbehavioral covariate related to outcome was the age at which dogs were returned for training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs that returned from their puppy-raising families at a younger age (14 mo) were less likely to succeed than older dogs (17 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the results obtained in one previous study (57), where dogs entering training at 17 mo were more likely to succeed than older individuals (up to 27 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that personality traits in dogs, such as calmness and boldness, have been linked to age (58), it seems possible that returning for training at a specific age leads to better acclimation to a kennel setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the accrual of more real-world experiences before training may lead to better outcomes, but only up to a point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even when controlling for the effect of age on outcome, however, behavioral differences in mothers and puppies had significant consequences for success in the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, variation in Maternal behavior was significantly associated with dogs later success in guide dog training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to our expectations, however, puppies that received higher levels of maternal behavior were less likely to succeed in the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may not be an isolated result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parker and Maestripieri (59) point out that the influence of stress on outcome has long focused on extreme disruptions of the parentoffspring relationship, and thus been treated in the literature as a linear function, in which the more early life stress an individual faces, the worse the outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They argue, however, that the relationship is actually quadratic: Too much stress is certainly a bad thing, but so is too little, because young animals then lack the experience of learning to deal independently with stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, facing an intermediate amount of stress in early life can have an inoculating effect on subsequent behavior (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies support this view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although long maternal separations are universally acknowledged to have deleterious consequences (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6164), studies in squirrel monkeys show that repeated short-term separations give young animals a chance to respond to temporary aversive events, which is adaptive over the long term (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These benefits may also extend to cognitive performance and response inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with this view, we found that high levels of ventral nursing were associated with program release, whereas high levels of vertical nursing were related to program success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in nursing styles may provide different opportunities for puppies to prevail over small challenges (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When mothers nursed ventrally, while lying on their stomachs, they were relatively immobile and their nipples were at the puppies face level, making it easy for puppies to stay attached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when mothers nursed vertically, while sitting or standing, nursing was a more difficult, active, and effortful endeavor for puppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical nursing in dogs is most similar to arched-back nursing in rodents, which has been linked to positive outcomes in adulthood, including better spatial memory (19) and lower anxiety (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these effects in rodents might be explained by the nipple switching facilitated by arched-back nursing, which results in increased tactile stimulation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in our population, as in rats (e.g., Fig 1 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67), vertical nursing was the rarest of the nursing styles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one possible explanation for our results is that a moderate amount of maternal care is beneficial but higher levels of maternal care are not challenging enough, and thereby have a negative effect on later performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps in this population of dogs, where all puppies obtain sufficient maternal care and nutrition, receiving comparatively less (or an average amount of) maternal attention fosters resilience, whereas more maternal attention increases vulnerability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One limitation of the current study is the potential confound of genetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all mothers were related to the puppies they were rearing, we are unable to determine a precise causal link between maternal style and later puppy behavior and outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mothers behavior could potentially be an artifact of the dogs genetic makeup contributing to a specific temperament, which is then inherited by the puppy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-fostering studies similar to the studies conducted on rodents (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, 68) might help to disentangle the genetic vs. behavioral effects of maternal style on program outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some measures of temperament and problem-solving abilities were also linked to dogs later success in the guide dog program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a multistep problem-solving task, dogs that perseverated less and were quickest to solve the problem were more likely to succeed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports our prediction that problem solving and impulse control are central to success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, dogs with shorter latencies to vocalize during the novel object task, a likely sign of higher anxiety (69), were more likely to be released from the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with the findings of Harvey et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26), who found that the guide dogs predicted to be successful had lower scores on a fear/anxiety PC at 5 mo of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The component was partially based on vocalizing during tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both the combined model and the young adult-only model had significantly higher AUCs than the Maternal behavior-only model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that young adult temperament and cognitive measures had more predictive power is not entirely surprising, because they were collected much closer to the time of actual outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, however, the AUCs of the maternal style, young adult performance, and combination models were all greater than chance, indicating that data from both the maternal environment and young adult time period can be useful in predicting program outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, we now know that maternal style affects both young adult behavior and outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also know from our combination model that maternal style has a significant effect on outcome, even when controlling for young adult behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it remains for future research to examine whether the association between maternal behavior and program outcome is partially mediated by the association between maternal behavior and young adult performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, what predicts a successful guide dog?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support previous studies on other animals in reaffirming the enduring benefits of maternal carein moderation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they suggest that a few targeted tests associated with temperament, perseveration, and cognition may capture individual differences in ability that continue throughout adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects (Table S1) were 21 mothers (nine German Shepherds, eight Labrador Retrievers, and four Golden Retrievers) and their 21 litters (n = 138 puppies) belonging to The Seeing Eye, Inc. (Morristown, NJ), a philanthropic organization that breeds, raises, and trains guide dogs for the blind and visually impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Seeing Eye granted informed consent to the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mothers lived at the breeding station, where the puppies were whelped and weaned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The young adult testing took place at headquarters, where puppies returned for training and placement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All testing procedures adhered to regulations set forth by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 805210).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mothers and litters were videotaped (n = 328 min per litter on average) over the puppies first 3 wk of life (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Puppies were weaned at 5 wk and then sent at 7 wk to puppy-raising families who fostered, trained basic obedience, and exposed the puppies to a variety of experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects returned to The Seeing Eye at the age of 1317 mo (n = 133) for training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before their formal entrance into the training program, we tested subjects individually on 11 cognitive and temperament tasks (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before 3 y of age, all dogs were either successfully placed as a guide or breeder or released from the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breeders completed 2 mo of guide dog training and then were selected for the breeding program based on health and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dogs could be released at any point, although only 4% of our sample was released before returning for training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary reasons that dogs were released were behavioral, such as lack of confidence, excitability, and inability to focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we were only interested in program release for behavioral reasons, dogs released for medical reasons were excluded from analyses (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the original 138 observed dogs, 29% (n = 40) were excluded from analysis due to release for medical concerns (n = 27), transfer to another organization (n = 1), or missing data on the young adult tasks (n = 12) (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maternal_Style  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complete methods used to study maternal style can be found in a study by Bray et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Young_Adult_Performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All testing took place at The Seeing Eye headquarters (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each dog first completed an hour-long session involving seven tasks (Table S2, tasks 17), was given at least an hour-long break, and then completed a 30-min second session (Table S2, tasks 811) (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main experimenter and dog handler were present at each session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These roles were always filled by two of five females of similar age, with the first author (E.E.B.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as the main experimenter in 87% of sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Processing_and_Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All statistical analyses were carried out in R version 3.3.0 (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for associations between maternal behavior, young adult test performance, and outcome, we built logistic regression models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variance estimates for the statistical tests on the regression coefficients were adjusted for clustering due to litter effects using GEE-GLM (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models were fit using geepack in R (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the calibration of each model, we performed HosmerLemeshow goodness-of-fit tests (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonsignificant P values (P  0.05) for all models indicated there was no evidence of poor fit and all models were therefore correctly specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following previous studies (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21, 36, 37), breed, maternal parity (15), sex of puppy (1/0, male vs. female), litter size (210 puppies), and age in months (1417) when the dog returned for training were included as covariates in all models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birth season (1/0, winter vs. spring) was not included because it was highly correlated with age when dogs returned for training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covariates were then removed using a backward-selection strategy, with the final model retaining confounders that influenced any association of interest by greater than 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first built models to examine the effect of the PC, Maternal behavior, on young adult performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GEE-GLMs used a Gaussian error distribution with litter as the unit of analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next built models to examine how outcome was affected by Maternal behavior, the variables that comprised Maternal behavior, performance on cognitive and temperament tasks as a young adult, and Maternal behavior combined with young adult performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GEE-GLMs were conducted with the logit link and a binomial error distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these models, litter size could be excluded as a covariate due to lack of confounding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we evaluated the predictive ability of these models to discriminate correctly between dogs that were successful and dogs that were released from the program (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
