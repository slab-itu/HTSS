Body sway reflects leadership in joint music performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
People perform tasks in coordination with others in daily life, but the mechanisms are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Granger causality models to examine string quartet dynamics, we demonstrated that musicians assigned as leaders affect other performers more than musicians assigned as followers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were present during performance, when musicians could only hear each other, but were magnified when they could also see each other, indicating that both auditory and visual cues affect nonverbal social interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the overall degree of coupling between musicians was positively correlated with ratings of performance success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have developed a method for measuring nonverbal interaction in complex situations and have shown that interaction dynamics are affected by social relations and perceptual cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cultural and technological achievements of the human species depend on complex social interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonverbal interpersonal coordination, or joint action, is a crucial element of social interaction, but the dynamics of nonverbal information flow among people are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used joint music making in string quartets, a complex, naturalistic nonverbal behavior, as a model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using motion capture, we recorded body sway simultaneously in four musicians, which reflected real-time interpersonal information sharing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Granger causality to analyze predictive relationships among the motion time series of the players to determine the magnitude and direction of information flow among the players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally manipulated which musician was the leader (followers were not informed who was leading) and whether they could see each other, to investigate how these variables affect information flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that assigned leaders exerted significantly greater influence on others and were less influenced by others compared with followers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was present, whether or not they could see each other, but was enhanced with visual information, indicating that visual as well as auditory information is used in musical coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, performers ratings of the goodness of their performances were positively correlated with the overall degree of body sway coupling, indicating that communication through body sway reflects perceived performance success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm that information sharing in a nonverbal joint action task occurs through both auditory and visual cues and that the dynamics of information flow are affected by changing group relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quartet_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In quartet 1, the string quartet played Baroque music excerpts in which all four partsviolin 1, violin 2, viola, and cellowere fairly equal in importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quartet_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The procedure with quartet 1 was repeated in a second string quartet that played Classical music excerpts in which one instrument (most often the first violin) usually has the most important melodic part; however, we instructed the musicians to attempt to perform the piece using their assigned roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the same analyses as in quartet 1, summarized here (SI Results for detailed results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differences_Between_Baroque_and_Classical_Music_Styles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that, although the basic findings would be similar across quartets and musical styles, because Classical music (played in quartet 2) tends to have one instrument playing the melody and the others playing accompaniment, unlike the Baroque music in quartet 1, the quartets would adopt somewhat different coordinative strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unbalanced default leadership hypothesis is supported in that (i) a MannWhitney U test showed that more followers correctly identified the assigned leader when Baroque music was played compared with Classical music (z = 2.45, P = 0.007), and (ii) the KruskalWallis H tests showed that the baseline GCs (i.e., without regard to who was the assigned leader) among the performers in each quartet were more unequal when playing Classical music [2(3) = 18.2, P less_than 0.001, f2 = 0.52] than Baroque music [2(3) = 7.98, P = 0.046, f2 = 0.13].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Results and Fig S1 for detailed results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results showed that anteriorposterior body sway couplings among string quartet performers reflected nonverbal interpersonal coordination, leadership roles, and performers subjective evaluations of their coordinative performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assigned leaders influenced followers more than followers influenced leaders or than one follower influenced another, and this effect was larger when performers could see each other than when they could not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the degree of total coupling within an ensemble was positively associated with the rated goodness of the performance, suggesting that body sway reflects the communication of information critical to performance success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replicated these effects in two string quartets playing music of different compositional styles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings extend our understanding of interpersonal coordination by examining interactions between more than two people in a naturalistic complex coordinative task through experimental manipulation of leadership assignment and visual information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of Granger causality enabled the asymmetric coordination structure among coactors to be disentangled, revealing who leads whom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our methods enabled examination of nonverbal joint action in a naturalistic setting with four coactors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this approach, we were able to examine both overall coordination and the coordination structure associated with leaderfollower, followerleader, and followerfollower roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that visual information selectively facilitates leader-to-follower coupling among four coactors in a string quartet, suggesting that visual communication is most useful for coordinating with a leader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies examined how perceptual or motor manipulations affect precise movement synchronization between coactors at the note-to-note level (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), we used body sway to examine interaction at the more global level of creating a joint aesthetic expression, including factors such as synchronization, phrasing, and dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although previous studies provided descriptions of leadership dynamics in music ensembles (20, 39, 46), our study experimentally manipulated leadership orthogonally to characteristics of the individual musical parts played by each instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This manipulation allowed us to show that information flow changes with leadership assignment and that body sway is not a motor byproduct of music performance, but reflects nonverbal communication between members of a group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important contribution of the present study is the use of Granger causality over more traditional cross-correlation approaches (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of Granger causality analysis enabled us to examine body sway relationships after partialing out predictions within each performer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This handling of auto-correlated series is critical because within-performer movements may be similar across performers due to the use of a common musical score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that cross-correlation analyses of our data were not able to reveal leaderfollower effects evident with the Granger causality approach (SI Results and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the Granger causality approach enabled us to conclude that the coupling relations reflected actual directional information flow between performers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Critical to the idea that body sway coupling reflects interpersonal coordination (14), we found that total interpersonal body sway coupling in a performance correlated with the performers rated goodness of that ensemble performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies showed that, when two participants converse during a coordinative task, their body sways tend to unintentionally and spontaneously couple (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study extends this finding to a nonverbal musical context and shows that body sway interactions are related to the rated outcome success of the joint action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although high-level ensemble performers who have played together for many years are experienced and critical evaluators of the quality of their performances, it would be interesting to investigate relations between total interpersonal body sway coupling and objective measures of performance quality (e.g., acoustic analyses) and ratings by expert and nonexpert audience members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although musical performance has often been characterized as involving auditorymotor coordination, basic research on individuals has shown that visual information can help anticipation of auditory information (48, 49), which could be useful for auditory-guided motor coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this view, previous piano duet studies showed that anticipatory gazing at the head motion of a coactor improved accuracy of synchronization during expressive tempo variations (31, 32) and that seeing a partner facilitated temporal synchronization in a jazz ensemble (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings further show that visual information is particularly helpful for leader-to-follower coordination, suggesting that followers use visual information to anticipatively coordinate their own actions to the leaders performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that, when no one was assigned as the leader in a musical style without strong intrinsic leader roles, body sway couplings among performers increased from the beginning to the end of each piece when they could see each other, suggesting that exchanged visual information helped build up interpersonal auditorymotor coordination in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings indicate that visual information facilitates interpersonal information flow over and above auditory information as a channel for nonverbal communication and improves auditorymotor coordination among coactors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the overall similarity of the results for quartets 1 and 2, the few differences that emerged suggest that characteristics of the taskspecifically, how strongly the musical score suggests a specific leadermodulate group coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in nonmusical domains indicated that the nature of a coordinative task can modulate interpersonal coordinative structure (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51), which is consistent with our findings that the secretly assigned leader was more accurately identified for Baroque than Classical performances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline body sway couplings without regard to leadership role were more equal across musician dyads for Baroque than Classical music (SI Results and Fig S1), suggesting that the relative importance of the four parts intrinsic to the musical score affected interpersonal coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, total interpersonal body sway coordination was related only to rated temporal synchronization between performers for Baroque but not for Classical music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that different musical styles shift the coordinative emphases from timing synchronization to other common aesthetic goals, such as coordinated loudness or timbre, which were not rated explicitly in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to directly examine these issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another question requiring study is how interpersonally exchanged information between ensemble members guides motor coordination within each performer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When listening to an auditory beat, low frequency oscillations in the EEG phase lock with the incoming beats (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the power of beta band (20 Hz) oscillations in both auditory and motor regions fluctuates at the tempo of the auditory rhythm and reflects temporal prediction (5355).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oscillatory activities might also play a role in the prediction of the intentions and actions of others (21, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that music is universal across human societies and is used extensively to promote nonverbal social coordination, it is important to understand how musicians achieve a joint aesthetic goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the findings of the current study using a music ensemble as a model can be generalized and applied to other forms of interpersonal coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence to date indicates that music performance shares the same principles with many other forms of interpersonal coordination (e.g., walking, dancing, and speaking): People tend to coordinate with each others movements in joint actions where there is a common goal, and interpersonal coordination involves perceptual, motor, and social factors (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18 for a review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, understanding how leaderfollower roles, sensory information, and structural elements of the situation affect interpersonal coordination in music performance is critical for understanding joint action in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our method of using Granger causality to uncover bidirectional information flow under experimental manipulation in a naturalistic situation can be applied to understanding group behavior in various situations, such as the important ability to detect who does or does not belong to a particular social group (58), and determining best crowd control procedures for emergency evacuation (59), which are important topics in psychology, computer vision, and public safety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the present study showed that manipulation of leadership roles and visual information interactively modulated interpersonal coordination in string quartets across styles of music played, as reflected by interpersonally coupled body sways indexed by Granger causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling degree was positively associated with the success of coordinative performance, and leader-to-follower influence was highest when performers could see each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these results were obtained in a complex naturalistic environment with more than two individuals, while, at the same time, exercising high experimental control of the factors of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two internationally recognized professional music ensembles participated: the Cecilia String Quartet (four females; mean age = 30.5 y; range = 3034), and the Afiara Quartet (three male, one female; mean age = 32 y; range = 2933).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were right-handed except for the second violin of the Cecilia Quartet and the cello of the Afiara Quartet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants had normal hearing and were neurologically healthy by self-report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consent was obtained from each participant, and they received reimbursement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The McMaster University Research Ethics Board approved all procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stimuli_and_Apparatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data were collected in the McMaster Large Interactive Virtual Environment laboratory (LIVELab) (LIVELab.mcmaster.ca).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quartet 1 (Cecilia Quartet) performed 12 different chorales (Table S1) from the Baroque period (1600 to 1750), composed by J. S. Bach, each between 2 and 3 min long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quartet 2 (Afiara Quartet) also performed 12 different pieces (Table S2), each between 2.5 and 5 min long, from the Classical period (1730 to 1820), composed by J. Haydn and W. A. Mozart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bach chorales consisted of four parallel melodies, which were relatively equal in importance compared with music from the Classical period, in which one instrument typically has the main melody whereas the others play a supportive accompaniment (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The musicians did not rehearse the pieces, nor had they previously performed the pieces together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They did not verbally discuss the pieces although they had their individual parts ahead of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An optical motion capture system (24 Oqus 5+ cameras and an Oqus 210c video camera; Qualisys) recorded the head movements of participants at 179 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four retroreflective markers (3 mm) were placed symmetrically on headbands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant wore the headband around the forehead, located above the nose, eyes, and occipital bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because string quartets sit in a semicircle, we recorded the motion of the head as an index of the global upper-body sway (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional EEG and EKG electrodes were also placed on the chest and head of each participant (data not reported here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was confirmed by the performers that these placements did not constrain their body movements and that they were able to perform as usual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design_and_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A full factorial Role (violin 1 leader, violin 2 leader, viola leader, cello leader, all leader, all follower) × Vision (Seeing, Nonseeing) experimental design was used, collapsing over musical pieces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Seeing condition, performers faced the center of the quartet whereas, in the Nonseeing condition, each faced 180 degrees away from the center, with all participants unable to see one another (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orders of Vision and Role levels were orthogonally counterbalanced across blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the 12 musical pieces was performed twice, once in each Vision condition, yielding 24 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each piece was played in two different Role conditions so the exact same trial was never repeated (Tables S1 and S2 show the complete design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Performers were given confidential sheets that assigned them as either leader or follower on each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performers were informed that there was one leader and three followers in all trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four Role levels were Single-Leader-Role conditions, in that one performer was the leader and the others followers (leader was either violin 1, violin 2, viola, or cello), and two were Ambiguous-Role conditions (all four were leaders, all four were followers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performers were instructed to perform at their best within the role assigned to them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All trials were performed on the same day for quartet 1, and the first and the second halves of the trials were performed 2 d apart for quartet 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prevent the assigned leader from explicitly initiating the performance, trials began with three metronome tones (interonset interval, 875 ms for all pieces played by quartet 1; and 500 ms for pieces played by quartet 2) via speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performers were instructed to follow the tempo and start on the first downbeat after the last tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because some pieces were shorter in duration than others, if necessary, each piece was performed repeatedly until the trial reached 2 min for quartet 1, and 2.5 min for quartet 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A potential concern was that experimentally manipulating leadership might distort natural body sway, but the evidence suggests that such distortion was not the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, performers were not told that body sway was the variable of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, MannWhitney U tests showed that leader/follower role assignment did not significantly modulate any of range, variation, or total moving distance of body sway within any performer of any quartet (P values  0.379), suggesting that body sway was not unnaturally exaggerated or attenuated by experimentally manipulated leadership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, manipulating leadership seems to have influenced only the relationships between players movements, not the movements themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After each trial, each performer rated three aspects of the groups performance using a five-point Likert scale (2 to 2): (i) the overall goodness of the ensemble performance, (ii) the temporal synchronization (taking all levels, from note-to-note to musical phrase, into consideration) of the group, and (iii) the ease of coordination among performers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high level of the musicians and the fact that each quartet had worked together for many years with regular intense rehearsal and concert schedules, we expected that they would be sensitive evaluators of these variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performers who were not assigned as the leader on a particular trial were also asked to identify who they thought was the assigned leader using a forced-choice categorical response measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Processing_and_Granger_Causality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each trial, the recorded motion trajectories were de-noised, spatially averaged, down-sampled, z-scorenormalized, and projected to the anteriorposterior body orientation (SI Methods for details) to produce four body sway time series, one for each performer (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Matlab Multivariate Granger Causality Toolbox (43) was used to estimate the magnitude of Granger causality (GC) between each pair of body sway time series among all four performers in each quartet (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GC is a statistical estimation of the magnitude of how much one time series is predicted by the history of another time series, taking into account how much it is predicted by its own previous history, in the form of a log-likelihood ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger the value of GC, the better the prediction and the more information is flowing from one time series to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that we estimated each GC between two time series conditional on the remaining two time series because, in this way, any potential common influence on other variables was partialed out (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, 12 unique GCs were obtained from each trial, corresponding to the degree to which each of violin 1, violin 2, viola, and cello predicted each of three other performers (Fig 1C and SI Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 12 directional couplings (n = 12) between the various pairs of performers were considered independent (43) and treated as a random factor in a within-subjects analysis (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Single-Leader-Role trials and the Ambiguous-Role trials were analyzed separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Single-Leader-Role analyses, the factor Paired-Role had three levels [leader-to-follower (LF), follower-to-leader (FL), and follower-to-follower (FF)], and Vision had two levels (Seeing and Nonseeing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the 12 directional couplings for each trial, we first estimated the GC, and then we took the mean GCs of the trials belonging to each Vision (Seeing, Nonseeing) × Paired-Role (LF, FL, FF) level as an estimate for each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Ambiguous-Role analyses, Paired-Role had two levels (Leader-all and Follower-all), Vision had two levels (Seeing and Nonseeing), and Time had two levels (Beginning and End).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Time level was extracted from the first and last 30-s epochs from each performance (trial).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we took the mean GCs of the trials belonging to each Vision × Paired-Role × Time level for each directional coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed repeated-measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) on GC scores for analyses of body sway coupling in Single-Leader-Role and Ambiguous-Role conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow-up post hoc analyses were performed for each significant F-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analyzing correlations between body sway coupling and subjective ratings of performances across all 24 trials, we correlated the mean of the four performers subjective ratings (one missing easy/difficulty rating on a trial by a performer of quartet 1 was excluded from averaging) with the group causal density (44) of body sways, calculated as the mean of the 12 GCs reflecting all pairwise influences in a quartet, for each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each correlation analysis, we estimated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) on the nonnormally distributed data, using Fisher's z transformation to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) of rs, and used a permutation test (5,000 times) to calculate the P value (Pperm) to adjust for the ties in the ranked data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used 2 tests to check the normality assumption for parametric tests, the Mauchly test to check the sphericity assumption, and the BrownForsythe test to check the homogeneity of variances assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the assumption of normality was violated (P less_than 0.05), nonparametric test equivalents were used (specified in Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every statistical test was performed two-tailed, if applicable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set  = 0.05, and each Bonferroni-adjusted  was used for each post hoc comparison series as a conservative control for type I error; we report the tests with Bonferroni-adjusted  less_than P less_than 0.05 as trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Differences_Between_Quartets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that, because Classical music tends to have one instrument playing the melody and the others accompaniment (3335, 60, 61) whereas, in Baroque music, the parts are more equal in importance, the quartets would adopt somewhat different coordinative strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the extent to which each performer acted as a leader when assigned a follower role, termed Leadership Baseline, we took the mean GCs of body sway coupling of each performer in predicting each of the other three performers [e.g., baseline-GCViolin1 = (GCViolin1Violin2 + GCViolin1Viola + GCViolin1cello)/3], when that performer was assigned as a follower in Single-Leader-Role trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared the baseline-GC among performers in each quartet (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
KruskalWallis H tests (nonparametric alternative of a one-way between-subject ANOVA) showed that the performers had different baseline-GC in both quartets [quartet 1, 2(3) = 7.98, P = 0.046, f2 = 0.13; quartet 2, 2(3) = 18.2, P less_than 0.001, f2 = 0.52].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the quartet playing Baroque music (quartet 1) (Fig S1A), however, post hoc MannWhitney U tests (Bonferroni-adjusted  = 0.05/6) did not show any significant baseline-GC differences between players (P values  0.035), but there were trends for the baseline-GC of violin 1 to be higher than those of violin 2 (z = 2.11, P = 0.035) and the viola (z = 1.99, P = 0.046), and for the baseline-GC of the cello to be higher than that of violin 2 (z = 2.11, P = 0.035).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the quartet playing Classical music (quartet 2) (Fig S1B), on the other hand, the post hoc U tests showed that the baseline-GC of violin 1 was higher than that of the viola (z = 2.97, P = 0.003) and that the baseline-GC of violin 2 was higher than those of the viola (z = 3.20, P = 0.001) and cello (z = 2.86, P = 0.004) although the other comparison failed to reach threshold (P values  0.212).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed our hypothesis that the default leadership was more unequal when playing Classical compared with Baroque music.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses_with_Cross-Correlation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-correlation estimates the similarity between two time series as a function of a shifting time step and has been used for quantifying the preceding-lag relationship between two time series variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To empirically compare Granger causality and cross-correlation, we performed cross-correlation analyses on the same preprocessed data to which we had applied Granger causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If cross-correlation is able to reflect the leadingfollowing relationship between performers in the Single-Leader-Role trials, the cross-correlation analysis on body sway would show the highest similarity in the time step where leader precedes follower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each trial of each quartet, the cross-correlation was estimated between each pair of the four performers anteriorposterior body sway time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To match the Granger causality analyses, the cross-correlation coefficients were calculated for lags up to plus or minus the model order of each quartet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve samples (the random factor) were obtained under each of the Seeing and Nonseeing conditions for each quartet, corresponding to the mean asynchrony by which each performer (violin 1, violin 2, viola, or cello) led each of the other three performers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If cross-correlation reflects leadingfollowing relationships between performers, the maximum unsigned cross-correlation coefficient (highest similarity) would occur at the temporal asynchrony where the leaders time series precedes the followers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cross-correlation results are shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-sample t tests showed that the asynchrony between leader and followers body sways were not significantly different from 0 in either Seeing or Nonseeing conditions of either quartet [unsigned t(11) less_than 1.35, P values  0.205].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paired t tests further showed that the asynchrony was not different between Seeing and Nonseeing conditions of either quartet [unsigned t(11) less_than 0.93, P values  0.375].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, the results showed that the cross-correlational analysis was not powerful enough to reflect the leadingfollowing relationship or the effect of visual information, as was revealed by Granger causality analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
