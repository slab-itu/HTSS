Modern diversification of the amino acid repertoire driven by oxygen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All life uses the same 20 amino acids, but only 713 early amino acids seem to be indispensable to build functional proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, what triggered the introduction of the additional amino acids?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing quantum chemical calculations and biochemical experiments, we find that the additional amino acids have become systematically softer (Ralph G. Pearson) over time, more redox-reactive, and more capable of protecting cells from destruction by oxygen free radicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it appears that molecular oxygen forced life to incorporate novel amino acids with augmented redox properties into the genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study provides a plausible scenario for a more than 80-y-old problem of fundamental biochemistry: Why these 20 amino acids?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All extant life employs the same 20 amino acids for protein biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies on the number of amino acids necessary to produce a foldable and catalytically active polypeptide have shown that a basis set of 713 amino acids is sufficient to build major structural elements of modern proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the reasons for the evolutionary selection of the current 20 amino acids out of a much larger available pool have remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have analyzed the quantum chemistry of all proteinogenic and various prebiotic amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the energetic HOMOLUMO gap, a correlate of chemical reactivity, becomes incrementally closer in modern amino acids, reaching the level of specialized redox cofactors in the late amino acids tryptophan and selenocysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the arising prediction of a higher reactivity of the more recently added amino acids is correct as regards various free radicals, particularly oxygen-derived peroxyl radicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrate an immediate survival benefit conferred by the enhanced redox reactivity of the modern amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan in oxidatively stressed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that in demanding building blocks with more versatile redox chemistry, biospheric molecular oxygen triggered the selective fixation of the last amino acids in the genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, functional rather than structural amino acid properties were decisive during the finalization of the universal genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyzing the orbital energies of the 20 canonical, proteinogenic AAs and selenocysteine we have found that the energetic distance between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the HOMOLUMO gap, exhibited a notable pattern related to the temporal emergence of the AAs in the standard genetic code (Fig 1): Late additions to the genetic code (5, 17) have substantially smaller gaps than all early additions, such as the encoded prebiotic AAs found in the Murchison meteorite (18) or recovered from the UreyMiller experiment (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emanating from frontier molecular orbital theory (20), the HOMOLUMO gap is one of the most widely applicable theoretical predictors of chemical reactivity, particularly reflecting the kinetic stability of a compound toward reactions involving electron transfer or rearrangement (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What type of chemical reactivity may explain the evolutionary trend toward smaller HOMOLUMO gaps?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to find reasonable cues in the modern metabolic descendants of the last standard AAs, Y and W, as those descendants might in part represent refinements of the originally selected advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a representative panel of metabolites originating from the shikimate pathway was assembled (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a rather clear common denominator emerged: The primary function attributable to essentially all examined structures is to catalyze or undergo redox reactions (justified in Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the role of plastoquinol, ubiquinol, tocopherol, or the quinoid cofactors as committed two-electron and one-electron redox shuttles and redox catalysts is beyond doubt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of their HOMOLUMO gaps, though, these compounds are quite similar to the last standard AA, W, and the 21st AA, selenocysteine, even if the quinoid cofactors reach absolute orbital energy levels that are unattained by the proteinogenic AAs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, could the latest AAs indeed be redox cofactors that were integrated into protein structure?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reviewing the biosynthetic origins of the metabolites of Fig S3, we noted that all of them involved molecular oxygen (O2) in at least one step (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, all steps of the shikimate pathway, including W and Y biosynthesis, proceed anaerobically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a framework of Darwinian evolution applied to molecules, W and Y would thus precisely occupy the position of random and initially useless variants of the primordial shikimate pathway (toward phenylalanine), whose permanent presence (and introduction into the genetic code) would have only been selected for after the appearance of oxygen in the biosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With this insight, we were able to experimentally test the conclusion emerging from HOMOLUMO gap analysis that the redox reactivity of the AAs increases with their evolutionary position in the genetic code: We investigated their reactivity toward peroxyl radicals, which are species that must have risen substantially after the cellular emergence of oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that, in fact, late AAs are much more reactive toward peroxyl radicals than early AAs (Fig 3A), with the latest additions W and Y being the most effective (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, reactivity under the employed, plausible conditions (aqueous solvent, 1 mM AA, 37 °C) (23) just begins with histidine, the first of the six presumed codon capture AAs: These AAs have probably required a redefinition of already assigned codons (instead of filling up vacancies) (12), particularly calling for selective mechanisms behind their introduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also tested the reactivity of the proteinogenic AAs toward various other radicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All AAs showing substantial reactivity were newer additions to the genetic code (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, not all of the late AAs showed reactivity, as a small HOMOLUMO gap only indicates basic kinetic accessibility of a compound toward electron-rearranging reactants (20); unfavorable transition state energies or other factors may still preclude reactivity, as exemplified in Fig 3A on the inert AA phenylalanine with its high radicalization enthalpy (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biosynthetic selection of a molecule for a specific property does not necessarily imply its introduction into the genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, such an introduction indicates the deployment of a molecule to a multitude of macromolecular sites rather than a small number of catalytic centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, the noncovalent binding of a soluble new cofactor might usually be the preferred solution (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific case of selenocysteine demonstrates that an intermediate number of sites (35 in humans) can suffice to trigger an incomplete integration into the genetic code, whereas a full integration of this AA was not achieved (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, which topological site of the primordial cell might have demanded the addition of a new, redox-active AA (such as W or Y) as a constituent of proteins in substantial amounts, to fulfill a function that high concentrations of the same AA in soluble form would not have attained?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that AA introduction into proteins residing in the lipid bilayer was crucial, for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in many modern cells the lipid membrane is the prime topological site of the cell to be collectively attacked and destroyed by peroxyl radicals in a process called lipid peroxidation, a free radical chain reaction (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the toxic effects of high oxygen concentrations are thought to be mediated by such free radical chain reactions (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, free AAs are excluded from the lipid bilayer, even those AAs usually classified as lipophilic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, many of the assumedly refined metabolic descendants of W and Y that are found ubiquitously primarily differ from their precursors in terms of their sizeable lipid anchors, for example ubiquinol, tocopherol, or plastoquinol (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their phenolic head groups, however, appear relatively retained, indicating that there was no need for major refinement beyond the original phenolic stage in the three cited examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we hypothesized that integration into transmembrane proteins was decisive for the eventual introduction of W and Y into the genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore this idea we have employed differentially lipophilic AA derivatives, as represented by acetylated and dodecanoylated tryptophan ethyl ester shown in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These AAlipid hybrid molecules were then investigated under modern conditions, in classic lipid peroxidation experiments and cellular survival assays under oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of native lipid membranes to Fe2+ (10 µM, recycled by 200 µM ascorbate), an abundant component of primordial, low-oxygen, and rising-oxygen habitats (29), led to a pronounced induction of lipid peroxidation, as measured by the formation of malondialdehyde and 8-isoprostane (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipophilic derivatives of Y and W (NDo-Y-OEt and NDo-W-OEt) indeed accumulated in membranes (Table S4) and significantly attenuated these radical-mediated reactions, whereas aqueous W and Y derivatives had no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this biochemical activity in whole cells, living neurons and fibroblasts were directly exposed to an organic peroxide initiating cellular lipid peroxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence microscopic images (Fig 3E) and the corresponding quantifications (Fig 3F) demonstrate that supplying cells with lipophilized Y or W prevented peroxide-induced neuronal death, a phenomenon recently discussed in relation to membrane protein oxidation in neurological disease (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similarly robust effect was seen in primary fibroblasts (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to experimentally probe the precision of natures choice of W as the postulated last redox cofactor to be introduced into the standard genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we investigated the two most plausible alternatives to W in classical terms (size and shape, charge, and hydrophobicity), which have not been introduced into the code, namely benzofuranyl alanine (BFA) and benzothienyl alanine (BTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Was the evolutionary choice of W specific for its redox reactivity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4, BFA and BTA were found to be much less reactive toward peroxyl radicals (Fig 4B), and their N-dodecanoyl derivatives were essentially unable to prevent lipid peroxidation (Fig 4C) or cell death (Fig 4D), despite the compelling similarity of their side chains to Ws side chain in classical terms (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In what is a rerun of the situation with phenylalanine, BFAs and BTAs relative inertia was unrelated to their HOMOLUMO gaps but attributable to their very unfavorable radicalization enthalpies (Table S3), which reasserts the role of a small HOMOLUMO gap as a necessary but insufficient condition for reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stepwise increases of oxygen in the biosphere have frequently been cited to represent major, fundamental transitions in the history of life (3134).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, relatively few examples of specific biochemical changes in response to oxygenation have been presented beyond the expectable consequence of directly O2-dependent metabolic transformations (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present theoretical, metabolic, and experimental evidence that the genetic code itself has been changed in answer to early local oxygenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rising oxygen concentrations forced primordial life to deploy increasingly soft molecules [Pearsons absolute chemical hardness  is defined (21) as double of a molecules HOMOLUMO gap], to be able to react flexibly to the new challenges imposed by reactive oxygen species that would otherwise disintegrate expensive cellular components designed only for an anoxic habitat (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the new AAs, chains of redox reactions starting on protein surfaces could be developed, which would deflect and detoxify radicals in a similar way as present-day organisms (30, 3739), culminating in the complex one-electron transfer cascades based on W and Y that characterize many modern, oxygen-adapted enzymes (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, about half of all oxygen-dependent oxidoreductases possess chains of W and Y with three or more members which are stereochemically arranged in such a way as to enable reparative single-electron transfer from the outside (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avenues of W and Y seem to play a particularly important role in the control of reactivity of high-potential metal centers in enzymatic oxidation reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of a prolonged lack of substrate, these activated metal centers are reductively disarmed through chains of Y and W to avoid the looming self-destruction of the enzyme (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, a similar strategy of soft AA enrichment was pursued by animal life during the more recent gain in biospheric molecular oxygen about 550 million y ago, at the outset of the Phanerozoic (31, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, various animal phyla and fungal clades independently changed their mitochondrial genetic code to massively accumulate the soft AA methionine for the purpose of autoprotection (37, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only animal phyla with high metabolic rates and thus high free radical load changed their genetic code assignment (40, 41), and a direct proportionality of aerobic metabolic rate and methionine accumulation (in respiratory chain complex I) has been noted in contemporary animals (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After all, methionine has long been suspected to represent a genuinely antioxidant AA as it has neither been found to function in enzymatic catalytic cycles nor to be structurally indispensable for its characteristic thioether side chain (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Chemical_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantum-chemical properties of Murchison meteorite AAs, proteinogenic AAs, modern metabolic descendants of the aromatic AAs, and synthetic tryptophan analogs were calculated using the academic software packages MOPAC (Molecular Orbital Package, releases 2003 and 2009) (44), embedded in the commercial software suites Chem3D 9.0 and ChemBio3D 13.0, respectively, from CambridgeSoft (PerkinElmer), and GAMESS (US) (General Atomic Molecular and Electronic Structure System, release of January 12, 2009) (45), embedded in ChemBio3D 13.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical structures were assembled, geometry-optimized by energy minimization using a molecular mechanics algorithm (a modified Allingers MM2 as implemented in Chem3D and ChemBio3D 13.0), and manually inspected for plausibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, quantum chemical calculations of electronic energy levels were performed using three different methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heats of formation and radicalization enthalpies of formation were generally calculated by method i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, the standard enthalpy of formation of each structure was calculated before and after the abstraction of a hydrogen radical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference of these enthalpies was defined as radicalization enthalpy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If several chemically plausible sites of potential hydrogen radical abstraction were present in a given molecule, all were explored, and the site yielding the lowest radicalization enthalpy was considered further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dipole moments of the binuclear AA side chains were also calculated using method i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The geometric properties, molecular area, and solvent-excluded volume (in water) as well as molecular hydrophobicity values (logP) were estimated with the ChemPropPro tool set implemented in ChemBio3D 13.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary cerebellar neurons were prepared from P2 Sprague-Dawley rats and cultivated in Neurobasal medium under a 2% oxygen atmosphere as also present in mammalian brain parenchyma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other parameters were set as described (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of neuronal survival was done by immunocytochemical staining for the neuronal marker protein anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) following standard protocols (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal procedures were performed in accordance with federal law and the institutional guidelines of the Central Animal Facility of the University of Mainz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
