Holocene ENSO-related cyclic storms recorded by magnetic minerals in speleothems of central China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution reconstructions of storm history and storms underlying mechanisms in inland areas are critical but limited by a paucity of suitable paleoproxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use soil-derived magnetic minerals preserved in a stalagmite as a new paleohydrological proxy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proxy enables us to rebuild decadal resolution storm records in the eastern Asian monsoon area since 8.6 ky. Variance of storms in central China was found to exhibit close correlation with El NiñoSouthern Oscillation activity at millennial and centennial time scales, and also occur on a significant 500-y cycle related to periodic solar activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings shed light on the forecasting of future floods and improve our understanding of the potential mechanism of strong precipitation in monsoon regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extreme hydrologic events such as storms and floods have the potential to severely impact modern human society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the frequency of storms and their underlying mechanisms are limited by a paucity of suitable proxies, especially in inland areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a record of speleothem magnetic minerals to reconstruct paleoprecipitation, including storms, in the eastern Asian monsoon area over the last 8.6 ky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geophysical parameter IRMsoft-flux represents the flux of soil-derived magnetic minerals preserved in stalagmite HS4, which we correlate with rainfall amount and intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRMsoft-flux exhibits relatively higher values before 6.7 ky and after 3.4 ky and lower values in the intervening period, consistent with regional hydrological changes observed in independent records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abrupt enhancements in the flux of pedogenic magnetite in the stalagmite agree well with the timing of known regional paleofloods and with equatorial El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns, documenting the occurrence of ENSO-related storms in the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral power analyses reveal that the storms occur on a significant 500-y cycle, coincident with periodic solar activity and ENSO variance, showing that reinforced (subdued) storms in central China correspond to reduced (increased) solar activity and amplified (damped) ENSO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the magnetic minerals in speleothem HS4 preserve a record of the cyclic storms controlled by the coupled atmosphereoceanic circulation driven by solar activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Soil-Derived_Magnetic_Minerals_in_Stalagmite_HS4_and_Their_Hydrological_Implication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Magnetite, goethite, and hematite/maghemite were identified in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coercivity unmixing analyses were conducted on specimens from stalagmite HS4 by alternating field (AF) demagnetization of an isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM1.15T) induced by a 1.15-T direct current (dc) field (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, 90% of the IRM1.15T is carried by a mineral population with an 20-mT median destructive field (MDF) and a dispersion parameter (DP) of 0.4 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small proportion (less_than4%) of the total remanence is carried by a lower coercivity, or magnetically very soft, component with an MDF less_than 5 mT (Fig 2), which is likely to be coarse, multidomain magnetic particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic particles were extracted from stalagmite HS4 for more detailed mineralogical analyses, including low-temperature magnetic measurements and electronic microscopy (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of magnetite in HS4 was confirmed in all of the magnetic extracts by observation of an abrupt decrease in magnetization at 120 K, identified as the Verwey transition, during low-temperature cycling of thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-temperature magnetometry also provided evidence for the presence of high-coercivity goethite and hematite/maghemite in the Heshang specimens (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soft magnetic components in our samples were demonstrated to be of soil origin, on the basis of their mineralogy, magnetic coercivity distribution, and morphological characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coercivity distribution of the dominant soft magnetic component (MDF  20 mT and DP  0.4) is characteristic of pedogenic magnetite (13, 14), which is commonly transported into caves via drip water and preserved in stalagmites (9, 11) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pedogenic magnetite and very soft magnetic component that together dominate the HS4 stalagmite samples were also identified in the soil samples collected immediately above the cave, contributing more than 80% and less than 1.5% of the total IRM1.15T, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the remanence held by the very soft component to that held by pedogenic magnetite is the same in both stalagmite HS4 and the soil samples (0.2), supporting a soil origin for the soft magnetic minerals in HS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the remanence properties of the carbonate rock that hosts Heshang cave were dramatically different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less than 20% of the IRM1.15T of the host rock was demagnetized after a 100-mT AF demagnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bedrock is therefore dominated by higher coercivity, magnetically hard magnetic minerals with MDF  greater than  100 mT, such as goethite and/or hematite, and is unlikely to be a primary source of soft magnetic minerals to the speleothems in Heshang cave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most of the extracted magnetite grains show evidence of transport and weathering processes, including partially rounded shapes, and etch pits, with an absence of euhedral magnetic grains (Fig S2), indicating that the magnetite preserved in stalagmite HS4 is likely allochthonous rather than precipitating in situ (9, 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, based on the past 9 y of in situ monitoring, the pH value of the drip water is always lower than 8.5, and the air temperature of the cave is constantly higher than 15 °C, conditions that are unfavorable for the formation of authigenic magnetites (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these lines of evidence strongly suggest that the soft magnetic components (mainly magnetite) preserved in stalagmite HS4 are soil-derived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increased rainfall can enhance the production of pedogenic magnetite in soil (17), and it promotes the transportation of soil magnetite into the cave via drip water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discrete intervals with enhanced concentrations of soil-derived particles, including magnetite, in speleothems can be associated with episodic enhanced rainfall (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore interpret variations in the concentration of soil-derived magnetite identified in the HS4 stalagmite to be indicative of rainfall variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of soil-derived, soft magnetic minerals (i.e., magnetite and its partially oxidized equivalents) in HS4 can be assessed by measuring |IRMsoft| [defined as 0.5 × (|IRM1T|+|IRM-0.3T|); Methods].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement excludes the portion of IRM1T contributed by hard magnetic minerals that originated from the surrounding rocks and authigenic goethite, because hard magnetic minerals such as hematite and goethite are unlikely to be remagnetized by a 300-mT dc field (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the parameter IRMsoft-flux, whereby |IRMsoft| values are normalized by the growth duration of each sample, to trace the variation in the flux of the soft, soil-derived magnetite particles per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although IRMsoft-flux can be a proxy for long-term paleoprecipitation, where higher values are associated with increased rainfall and wetter intervals, it may also record discrete high-intensity precipitation events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to pedogenic processes that slowly increase the amount of pedogenic ferrimagnetic minerals within soils, large storms can dramatically increase the energy of groundwater in karst regions within a very short time, causing an abrupt increase in the transportation of heavy minerals to the cave system and, in turn, an abrupt increase in the amount of allochthonous particles preserved in stalagmites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore relate abrupt enhancements in IRMsoft-flux to increases in magnetite flux resulting from an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events such as storms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Long-Term_Hydrological_Variation_and_Storms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mean IRMsoft-flux is relatively low (5.3 × 1010 Am2y1) between 6.7 ky and 3.4 ky, compared with higher values (14.9 × 1010Am2y1) before 6.7 ky and after 3.4 ky (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This three-interval pattern is in good agreement with local water levels recorded by the accumulation rate of aerobic hopanoids in Dajiuhu peatland, a site about 120 km north of Heshang cave (7) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two wet periods (before 6.7 ky and after 3.4 ky) also agree well with the highest lake water level in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, which occurred between 8.0 ky and 7.0 ky and after 3.0 ky (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon isotope composition of the soil-derived acid-soluble organic matter (13CASOM) in the HS4 stalagmite (Fig 3B and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) also records a pattern comparable to IRMsoft-flux on a millennial scale, with less negative 13CASOM values during the two wet periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These consistencies between the three different records suggest that IRMsoft-flux is a reliable and accurate indicator of regional hydrological changes in central China throughout the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A detailed comparison of the magnetic signals and oxygen compositions of carbonate from the HS4 stalagmite is shown in Fig S3 and does not show any significant correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that 18O in cave sediments is controlled by a variety of factors, including rainfall amount, cave temperature, local evaporation, the 18O of the sources (the Indian Ocean or/and the West Pacific Ocean), and the transport distance from the sources (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models and modern observations have shown that variations in vapor sources rather than in the precipitation amount (1) dominated the speleothems 18O records in the East Asian monsoon (EAM) area (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, converting stalagmite 18O records into a quantitative assessment of past rainfall amount, including that arising from typhoon sources, is very difficult in the EAM region (12), and it is therefore unsurprising that there is no significant correlation between the 18O records and our magnetic signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The IRMsoft-flux record shows pulses of abrupt, centennial-scale enhancement throughout the HS4 stalagmite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These abrupt enhancements are particularly strong during the two wet intervals (after 3.4 ky and before 6.7 ky), and are subdued during the dry interval between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these pulses of enhanced IRMsoft-flux to represent intervals of increased storm frequency/strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we compiled previously published histories of flood deposits preserved in the middle reaches of Yangtze River, and 10 paleoflood events could be recognized during the past 9.0 ky, occurring at 9,0008,400 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23, 24), 75007200 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25), 55005000 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26), 42004000 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23, 27), 32002800 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2325), 26002200 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), 19001700 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23, 27), 1200 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), 1000800 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26, 28), and 590 ± 50 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These paleoflood events are identified in peaks in IRMsoft-flux in Fig 3A and indicate periods of elevated precipitation (23, 25, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme paleofloods became more frequent after 2.2 ky and reached a maximum frequency between 1.0 ky and the present day (29), coincident with the two highest pulses of the IRMsoft-flux value of HS4 stalagmite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the pronounced aridity event induced by the abrupt cooling event in the North Atlantic region at 8.2 ky (30) is coincident with the weak IRMsoft-flux value of HS4 stalagmite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13CASOM exhibits a similar variance to IRMsoft-flux on a millennial scale, but not on a centennial scale; this may be due to the effects of temperature and vegetation on 13CASOM in addition to precipitation (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Close_Correlation_Between_El_NiñoSouthern_Oscillation_and_Storms_in_Central_China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence of modern-day storms in the middle reaches of Yangtze River is related to the strength of El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) (31), especially the El Niño events (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although paleo-ENSO records are difficult to reconstruct, particularly in the early Holocene (3335), our IRMsoft-flux record appears to be consistent with paleo-ENSO proxies available for the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geological data and climate models document a mid-Holocene reduction in ENSO intensity and fewer El Niño-related flood events (33, 34, 3638) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with lower IRMsoft-flux values, which indicates fewer storms between 6.7 ky and 3.4 ky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Holocene ENSO might show different spatial patterns (36), 18O variances of foraminifera (34) (open circles in Fig 3E) and stalagmite BA03 (33) (open squares in Fig 3E) support strong ENSO activity in both the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) and western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) regions during the early and later Holocene, which is broadly consistent with the frequent storms before 6.7 ky and after 3.4 ky indicated by the IRMsoft-flux record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular importance is that, during the relatively strong ENSO periods (the early and later Holocene), IRMsoft-flux shows an increased frequency of enhancement pulses, and the peaks of IRMsoft-flux during those periods broadly correspond to the peaks of the observed and modeled ENSO variances in the EEP region (33, 39) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest that stronger ENSO can increase the frequency of extreme precipitation events, such as storms, in central China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some discrepancies do exist between the two ENSO records (simulated and observed) and the storms inferred by our magnetic record, which might arise from limitations inherent within the simulated and observed ENSO records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated ENSO variability is based on modern observations, which means that the simulation becomes less reliable with increasing age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It might provide a good comparison for variations in frequency, but modeled changes in the amplitude become less reliable with increasing age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tendency explains why our magnetic record shows similar cyclic variation to the simulated ENSO record (39), but shows inconsistent amplitude variation, particularly in the early Holocene (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the previously published data for the observed ENSO record display a comparatively low temporal resolution and a large uncertainty in age (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed ENSO record cannot provide a detailed comparison, but it does show the same three-interval features observed in the magnetic data (i.e., elevated during 96.7 ky, and 3.40 ky, but decreased during 6.73.4 ky) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the compilation of flooding events (2329) in central China confirms the robustness of our magnetic profile as an ENSO record within the age uncertainties denoted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Five-Hundred-Year_Periodicity_of_Storms_and_Its_Forcing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectral analysis of the detrended IRMsoft-flux record and modeled ENSO variance data (from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) reveal that they both exhibit a centennial cycle centered at 500 y with a confidence level of greater than 99% (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 500-y cycle is a significant component of solar activity periodic variations (40, 41) (Fig 4C), which can control Earth surface temperature variability and alter atmospheric and oceanic circulation (4245).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 500-y cycle of storms in central China is generally in an antiphase relationship with solar activity, indicated by the residual atmospheric 14C from global tree ring records (46) during the past 8.6 ky, where higher IRMsoft-flux values (representing storms) are associated with low solar irradiation (larger 14C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between 500-y periodic storms and the ENSO variance is positive in the wet periods (the early and later Holocene), but it changes to a negative correlation in the dry period (the mid-Holocene) when the ENSO is damped and in a more La Niña-like state according to the observed data (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that strong/frequent storms in central China are broadly consistent with weak solar irradiation as well as strong ENSO activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solar activity can modulate the EAM system and thereby affect precipitation in central China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased solar irradiance can weaken the Asian summer monsoon (41, 43), which, in turn, could cause the convergence zone, the Mei-yu Front, where warmmoist, tropicalsubtropical air meets the cooler continental air mass, to move southward toward the Yangtze River valley (47) and hover around this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This southward movement could move preexisting storm centers closer to Heshang cave or, alternatively, increase the frequency of storms regionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are multiple controls on ENSO (39), its long-term variability is closely related to secular solar activity variations, and both the intensity and frequency of El Niño events, which result in flooding in east and central China (32), are high at secular solar minimum and low at secular solar maximum (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, solar radiation, ENSO activity, and coupled atmosphericoceanic variation may therefore control the occurrence of ENSO-related storms in central China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delayed response of storms in central China to the mature ENSO (48), and/or the different age modes of those two data series, could probably result in the small phase shift between ENSO variations and storms shown in Fig 4D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced ENSO activity during the dry mid-Holocene was not strong enough to affect the storms in central China, which might explain their weak relationship during this interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One-hundred-and-fifteen environmental magnetism specimens (2-cm cubes) were cut sequentially from the core of the stalagmite where growth layers accumulated in a nearly horizontal orientation (10) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four soil samples were collected from the B horizon of soil capping Heshang cave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight representative HS4 samples distributed across the whole time series were chosen for more advanced magnetic mineralogy analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_Magnetic_Minerals_from_Stalagmite_HS4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain unambiguous magnetic measurements and conduct morphological analyses on the magnetic particles, we dissolved fragments of stalagmite HS4 and extracted the magnetic minerals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetate buffer solution [4:1 (vol/vol) of 2 M acetic acid and 1 M sodium acetate] recommended by Perkins (16) was used for stalagmite dissolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracting procedure followed that of Strehlau et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IRMsoft-flux  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All specimens were given an IRM using a 1-T dc field, and their remanences were signed as IRM1T; subsequently, the specimens were subjected to a 0.3-T dc field in the opposite direction (backfield) to produce another remanence signed as IRM-0.3T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then |IRMsoft| is defined as 0.5 × (|IRM1T|+|IRM-0.3T|).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate the effect of variation on the stalagmite's growth rate, |IRMsoft| measurements were normalized using the age duration of each sample to give IRMsoft-flux (Table S1), which represents the amount of soil-originated magnetic minerals preserved in stalagmite HS4 per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remanent magnetizations were imparted using a 2G Enterprises 670M long-core pulse magnetizer and were measured using a 2G U-channel cryogenic SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Magnetic_Mineralogy_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IRMs were imparted to eight HS4 samples and four soil samples using a 1.15-T dc field and then progressively degaussed in AFs up to a maximum of 170 mT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first derivatives of the demagnetization data were used to perform coercivity unmixing analyses to identify magnetic mineral components on the basis of their MDF and DP, calculated following the methods described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of the very soft component is represented by the portion of the IRM demagnetized following application of a 5-mT AF, and that of the pedogenic magnetite is indicated by the component of the IRM demagnetized between the application of a 20-mT and 5-mT AF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the two soft components' relative contributions was then calculated, and is 0.2 for almost all of the stalagmites samples and for all of the soil samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The low-temperature magnetic behavior of the samples extracted was examined using a Quantum Designs Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS-5S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the goethite-pretreatment low-temperature measure sequence designed by Guyodo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51) to target weak magnetic minerals such as goethite and hematite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed protocols are provided in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphology of the extracted magnetic particles was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted magnetic particles were deposited onto carbon-coated adhesive tape, and then analyzed with a JSM-35CF SEM (Japanese Electronics Co., Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elemental composition of magnetic minerals was measured using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TEM analysis, magnetic particles were suspended in a solution of collodion and isoamyl acetate [1:4 (vol/vol)] via 10 min of ultrasonic vibrating, and then two to three drops of the suspension were dropped into a bowl of pure water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thin film then formed on the surface of the water, and a portion of this film was then applied to a TEM support grid, dried, and carbon-coated for TEM analyses using a Philips CM12/S TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further elemental analysis was provided by Philips PV9760 Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyzer attached to the Philips CM12/S TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photomicrographs collected from the SEM and TEM were obtained at operating voltages of 1.5 and 1.2 kv, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
