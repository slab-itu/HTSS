Roughness-dependent tribology effects on discontinuous shear thickening  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Shear thickening is a ubiquitous rheological phenomenon whereby dense suspensions of particles in a fluid exhibit a viscosity increase at high shear, which can turn into a viscosity divergence [discontinuous shear thickening (DST)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although macroscopically well characterized, the microscopic origin of DST is still debated, especially in connection to particle surface properties, e.g., roughness and friction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We elucidate here the mechanisms underpinning DST by carrying out nanotribological measurements of the interparticle contacts of model rough colloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that rough particles exhibit DST over a broader range of shear rates and for volume fractions much lower than for smooth colloids, due to interlocking of surface asperities, showing that taking an engineering-tribology approach is a powerful way to tune DST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface roughness affects many properties of colloids, from depletion and capillary interactions to their dispersibility and use as emulsion stabilizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also impacts particleparticle frictional contacts, which have recently emerged as being responsible for the discontinuous shear thickening (DST) of dense suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tribological properties of these contacts have been rarely experimentally accessed, especially for nonspherical particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we systematically tackle the effect of nanoscale surface roughness by producing a library of all-silica, raspberry-like colloids and linking their rheology to their tribology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rougher surfaces lead to a significant anticipation of DST onset, in terms of both shear rate and solid loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, they also eliminate continuous thickening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DST is here due to the interlocking of asperities, which we have identified as stickslip frictional contacts by measuring the sliding of the same particles via lateral force microscopy (LFM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct measurements of particleparticle friction therefore highlight the value of an engineering-tribology approach to tuning the thickening of suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
