GRP78 haploinsufficiency suppresses acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, signaling, and mutant Kras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
KRAS is mutated in more than 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its well-known role in cancer, development of drugs directly targeting KRAS has been unfruitful, underscoring the critical need to identify novel therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides evidence that haploinsufficiency of a single cellular protein, GRP78, although having no harmful effect on the normal pancreas, is sufficient to impede Kras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis in a genetically engineered mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study also establishes a role of GRP78 in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, which is regarded as a precursor to PDAC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a highly lethal disease in critical need of new therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the stress-inducible 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/HSPA5), a key regulator of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and PI3K/AKT signaling, is overexpressed in the acini and PDAC of Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D/+;p53f/+ (PKC) mice as early as 2 mo, suggesting that GRP78 could exert a protective effect on acinar cells under stress, as during PDAC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKC pancreata bearing wild-type Grp78 showed detectable PDAC by 3 mo and rapid subsequent tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the PKC pancreata bearing a Grp78f/+ allele (PKC78f/+ mice) expressing about 50% of GRP78 maintained normal sizes during the early months, with reduced proliferation and suppression of AKT, S6, ERK, and STAT3 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) has been identified as a key tumor initiation mechanism of PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PKC, the PKC78f/+ pancreata showed substantial reduction of ADM as well as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-1 (PanIN-1), PanIN-2, and PanIN-3 and delayed onset of PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADM in response to transforming growth factor  was also suppressed in ex vivo cultures of acinar cell clusters isolated from mouse pancreas bearing targeted heterozygous knockout of Grp78 (c78f/+) and subjected to 3D culture in collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further discovered that GRP78 haploinsufficiency in both the PKC78f/+ and c78f/+ pancreata leads to reduction of epidermal growth factor receptor, which is critical for ADM initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our studies establish a role for GRP78 in ADM and PDAC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Up-Regulation_of_GRP78_in_Pancreatic_Acinar_and_Ductal_Cells_of_PKC_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pancreatic cancer cells could experience a high level of ER stress due to increased proliferation driven by the Kras activation and desmoplasia leading to tissue hypovascularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, we observed general, sustained up-regulation of GRP78 in the acinar cells of the PKC mice compared with control mice, which lack the Pdx1-Cre transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was detected as early as 2 mo (Fig 1A), suggesting that GRP78 could be exerting a protective effect on the acinar cells under stress associated with PDAC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pancreatic cancer lesions, GRP78 expression was highly elevated, in contrast to the low level of GRP78 expression in the ductal structures of control mice (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the impact of GRP78 on pancreatic tumorigenesis, Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D/+; p53f/+;Grp78f/+ mice (referred to as PKC78f/+) were generated to create GRP78 pancreatic haploinsufficiency (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping of pancreatic genomic DNA by PCR confirmed the genotypes of the respective mouse cohorts and further validated the presence of the recombined KrasG12D allele in the PKC and the PKC78f/+ mice harboring the Pdx-1 Cre allele (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Littermates lacking the Pdx1-Cre transgene served as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, the PKC pancreata showed abnormal masses by 3 mo, which rapidly increased in size, whereas the appearance and size of PKC78f/+ pancreata remained normal during the early months, with no tumor being macroscopically detectable before 5 mo (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weight of the pancreata in the three genotypes paralleled their gross morphology (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IHC analysis of the pancreatic sections confirmed a reduced GRP78 level in both acinar and ductal cells in the PKC78f/+ pancreata compared with PKC pancreata that were sustained at least up to 5 mo (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of GRP78 IHC staining in the ductal structures showed that, although staining of GRP78 in the normal ducts of the control mice was minimal, the large increase of GRP78 staining in the malignant lesions of PKC mice was reduced by about 70% in the PKC78f/+ mice (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2), a marker of ER stress-induced translational arrest (10), was also highly elevated in the malignant lesions of the PKC pancreata but not in the PKC78f/+ pancreata (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the expression of another ER chaperone, GRP94, was readily detected in the normal ducts of the control mice (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other tissues where GRP94 was up-regulated to compensate for GRP78 haploinsufficiency (29), the level of GRP94 in the ductal structures was similar in the PKC and PKC78f/+ mice (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), a marker of ER stress-induced onset of apoptosis (10), was not detected in the control, PKC, or PKC78f/+ pancreata (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Suppression_of_Kras-Driven_Pancreatic_Tumorigenesis_by_Grp78_Heterozygosity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological sections of pancreata from 2- to 4-mo-old control, PKC, and PKC78f/+ mice are shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No evidence of malignant or premalignant lesion was found in any of the control mice, from which representative normal ducts are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKC pancreata showed extensive PanIN-1, characterized by mucinous differentiation with no nuclear atypia, as early as 2 mo of age and showed invasive adenocarcinoma at 3 and 4 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of a solid, sarcomatoid pattern of ductal adenocarcinoma is shown from a 3-mo-old PKC mouse whereas the tumor shown from the 4-mo-old mouse with this genotype formed distorted small acini in a dense stroma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarcomatoid elements were identified in only two tumors, both from PKC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PanIN-1 was also seen in 2-mo-old PKC78f/+ mice, ADM, characterized by ducts confined to acinar portions in which at least one cell shows intracellular secretions, was the predominant abnormality in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 3 mo, PKC78f/+ mice exhibited PanIN-1 and an occasional focus of PanIN-2 characterized by some degree of nuclear atypia in at least some epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PanIN-3, characterized by more severe nuclear as well as architectural atypia, was occasionally detected in the PKC78f/+ mice at 3 and 4 mo (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of the ratio of histologically normal pancreatic areas over total pancreatic areas at different ages up to 5 mo showed that all PKC78f/+ pancreata retained 80100% areas of normal acinar tissue up to 4 mo, whereas age-matched PKC pancreata were more aggressively and progressively replaced by metaplasia, PanIN, and PDAC (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 5 mo, whereas half of the PKC78f/+ pancreata were histologically normal in over 80% of their respective total areas, all PKC pancreata showed 4090% replacement with metaplasia, PanIN, or PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the different types of lesions showed that at 3 mo the PKC78f/+ pancreata exhibited significantly lower incidences of ADM (P = 0.003), low-grade neoplasia (PanIN-1) (P = 0.033), and combined high-grade neoplasia (PanIN-2, -3) and PDAC (P = 0.026), compared with the PKC pancreata (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, at 3 mo PDAC was detected only in the PKC mice and PKC78f/+ pancreata showed only minimal PanIN-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the reduced tumor volumes and incidences, PKC78f/+ mice showed a trend toward a prolonged life span compared with PKC mice (P = 0.035, one-sided log-rank test, Fig S3); interestingly, this trend was observed predominantly in the males (P = 0.038, one-sided log-rank test) and not in the females (P = 0.39, one-sided log-rank test, Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Suppression_of_Proliferation_and_Oncogenic_Signaling_in_PKC78f_+_Pancreata  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In agreement with reduced tumor involvement in the PKC78f/+ pancreata as indicated by morphological and histological parameters, IHC of epithelial cell-marker pan-cytokeratin (panCK) (Fig S4A) and activated myofibroblast marker -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), characteristics of pancreatic tumors, showed a decrease of both markers in PKC78f/+ pancreata compared with PKC pancreata (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signaling pathways including PI3K/S6, ERK, STAT3, and -catenin have been reported to be activated in PDAC (3, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, these pathways were prominently up-regulated in the PKC pancreata (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKC78f/+ pancreata displayed reduction in S6 activation in both ductal and acinar cells (Fig 4A and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK activation, STAT3 activation, and -catenin level were also reduced in the PKC78f/+ pancreata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the staining levels of each of the markers in multiple pancreatic sections of each of the three genotypes confirmed a significant reduction of these oncogenic signaling pathways in the PKC78f/+ pancreata (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Western blotting of protein lysates from isolated pancreatic acinar clusters provided biochemical confirmation of a 60% reduction in AKT activation in PKC78f/+ pancreata compared with PKC pancreata (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumor growth is regulated by a balance between proliferation and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation marker Ki67 showed a two- to threefold reduction in PKC78f/+ compared with PKC pancreata in both acinar and ductal cells (Fig 4D and Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IHC showed minimal staining for cleaved caspase-3, a biomarker of apoptosis, in both PKC and PKC78f/+ pancreata (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results imply that the suppression of tumorigenesis by pancreatic GRP78 haploinsufficiency is driven by reduction of mutant Kras-mediated proliferation and oncogenic signaling, rather than by increased apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reduction_of_Transdifferentiation_from_Acinar-to-Ductal_Cells_in_PKC78f_+_Pancreata  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ADM has been identified as a primary mechanism for initiation of PDAC (5, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the elevated GRP78 level in PKC acinar cells, its up-regulation may play a role in pancreatic ADM subjected to oncogenic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADM is characterized by acinar clusters staining positive for both acinar (amylase) and ductal (pan-cytokeratin) markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cellular clusters coexpressing panCK and amylase was substantially reduced in PKC78f/+ pancreata (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification by immunofluorescence indicated a 65% reduction in panCK positivity and an 80% reduction in ADM in PKC78f/+ pancreata compared with PKC (Fig 5B), implying that GRP78 haploinsufficiency could lead to suppression of ADM during the initiation of PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EGFR signaling has been reported to play an important role in ADM in KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As EGFR is a client protein of GRP78 in the ER (34, 35), we examined whether GRP78 haploinsufficiency affected EGFR expression, thus providing an explanation for the reduction of ADM in the PKC78f/+ pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, PKC pancreata expressed about fivefold more EGFR than control pancreata, and this increase was reduced by 60% in the PKC78f/+ pancreata based on Western blot analyses (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cell types, such as human head and neck cancer cells (scc-351) and in human embryonic kidney HEK-293T cells, specific shRNA knockdown of GRP78 also led to substantial reduction in EGFR levels (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Grp78_Heterozygous_Pancreas_Is_Phenotypically_Normal_but_Exhibits_Deficient_ADM_Induced_by_Transforming_Growth_Factor_  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly address whether GRP78 is required for pancreatic ADM, we studied the impact of GRP78 haploinsufficiency on pancreatic ductal formation during normal development or transdifferentiation from acinar cells stimulated by transforming growth factor  (TGF), which binds to its receptor EGFR and activates downstream signals including RAS and AKT (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created the Pdx1-Cre;Grp78f/+ mice (referred to below as c78f/+) with targeted heterozygous knockout of Grp78 in the pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genotypes of c78f/+ and its sibling control mice without the Pdx1-Cre allele were confirmed by PCR of tail genomic DNA (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size and weight of control and c78f/+ pancreata were similar at 29 mo (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analysis of pancreatic sections stained with H&E showed similar morphological features between control and c78f/+ pancreata (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approximate 50% reduction of GRP78 in the c78f/+ pancreata compared with control was confirmed by IHC; staining with ductal marker panCK indicated normal ductal morphology (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the number of ducts in control and c78f/+ pancreata showed no difference between the two genotypes (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we also created c78f/f mice with homozygous deletion of the Grp78 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c78f/f pancreata showed extensive fat infiltration with poorly developed acinar cells (Fig S7F) and were significantly smaller (Fig S7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the c78f/+ mice, which exhibited normal glucose tolerance comparable to control mice, the c78f/f mice showed impaired glucose tolerance (Fig S7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the c78f/+ mice display normal development of both exocrine and endocrine pancreas, this model was chosen to determine the effect of GRP78 haploinsufficiency on growth-factorstimulated ADM. Pancreatic acinar clusters were isolated from control and c78f/+ mice, subjected to 3D explant culture in collagen, and stimulated with TGF (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c78f/+ acinar cells exhibited fewer ductal structures, confirmed by decreased panCK-positive clusters, compared with control on day 3 (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of ducts formed in vitro showed an approximate 50% reduction in ductal structures derived from c78f/+ acinar cells compared with control, and an approximate 35% reduction in panCK-positive cells on day 3 (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acinar clusters undergoing ADM were characterized by coexpression of both acinar (amylase) and ductal (panCK) markers in the same cell cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding to reduced ductal formation, c78f/+ acinar clusters showed reduced ADM compared with control as evidenced by decreased panCK expression and sustained amylase expression (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we isolated acinar clusters from the pancreas and confirmed by Western blot analysis that GRP78 level was reduced by about 50% in c78f/+ acinar clusters compared with control (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical analysis revealed shortly following culture, compared with control, c78f/+ acinar cells showed reduced basal levels of p-AKT and p-ERK but similar levels of p-STAT3 normalized to AKT, ERK, and STAT3, respectively (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting at day 2, TGF induced AKT and ERK activation but not STAT3 in the control acinar cell clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, c78f/+ acinar cells showed some increase in p-AKT on day 2, and, by day 3, the level of p-AKT had reached that of the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, p-ERK was suppressed in the c78f/+ acinar cells from day 0 to day 3, and the ratio of p-STAT3 over total STAT3 level was similar in both genotypes from day 0 to day 3 (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these signaling pathways were differentially regulated in the c78f/+ acinar in these ex vivo settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the status of EGFR expression in these acinar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with suppression of EGFR levels in the PKC78f/+ pancreata, EGFR level in the c78f/+ acinar cells was also reduced compared with control (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in both mouse models, GRP78 haploinsufficiency suppresses EGFR expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
KRAS is commonly mutated in various cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pancreatic cancer, KRAS is mutated in more than 90% of PDAC (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent observation that activating KRAS mutations were present in  greater than 90% of pancreatic PanIN-1 lesions suggests that the acquisition of KRAS mutations likely precedes the formation of these precursor lesions (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its role in tumor initiation, oncogenic KRAS is also required for PDAC maintenance (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its well-known role in cancer, development of drugs targeting KRAS directly has been unfruitful, underscoring the need for alternative approaches (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UPR is an adaptive measure for cells to overcome ER stress, which can be pronounced in cancer cells with limited vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human PDAC tumor resected specimens, expression of the ER stress markers GRP78, GRP94, and spliced XBP-1 has been reported (26, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used the well-established PKC mouse model bearing oncogenic KrasG12D and p53 heterozygosity to interrogate the role of GRP78 in pancreatic tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IHC analysis showed that pancreatic tumors in PKC mice also expressed elevated levels of GRP78 and eIF2 phosphorylation, suggestive of ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GRP78 is an essential chaperone, and we showed that homozygous deletion of both alleles in the pancreas led to abnormal pancreatic development, fat infiltration, and glucose intolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that Grp78 heterozygosity does not affect normal pancreatic function, we created the PKC78f/+ mice so that GRP78 haploinsufficiency could be concomitantly induced with activation of the oncogenic mutant genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative analysis of the PKC, PKC78f/+, and c78f/+ pancreata led to observations that shed insights on GRP78 function in the mouse pancreas subjected to mutant Kras-induced tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, in the PKC mice, GRP78 was highly elevated not only in PDAC but also in acinar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As professional secretory cells, acinar cells are highly dependent on ER functions and are particularly susceptible to ER stress (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, acinar cells respond to stress such as pancreatitis through activation of regenerative mechanisms that initiate ADM, a process that replaces damaged acinar cells with duct-like structures (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the relationship between ER stress and ADM is not well understood, a recent report suggests that ER stress resulting from perturbation of basal autophagy via loss of ATG7 is associated with spontaneous activation of ADM in a mouse model (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADM is critical for the initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis (5, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PKC acinar cells, GRP78 was highly elevated, suggesting that it could play a role in ADM under oncogenic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a genetically engineered mouse model, we report substantial reduction of ADM in the PKC78f/+ pancreata compared with PKC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes histological analysis of pancreatic tumor sections based on morphological parameters and IHC staining of acinar and ductal markers followed by quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide evidence that GRP78 haploinsufficiency could lead to suppression of ADM during the initiation process of PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further support of a role for GRP78 in ADM, we created the c78f/+ mice, which in contrast to c78f/f mice, are phenotypically normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we showed that acinar cell explants isolated from c78f/+ mice and cultured in 3D explant in collagen matrices exhibited lower ADM following stimulation with TGF, compared with similar explants isolated from control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in both PKC78f/+ and c78f/+ models, under either in vivo or ex vivo settings, GRP78 is required for ADM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the search for potential mechanisms whereby GRP78 haploinsufficiency suppresses ADM, we discovered that the level of EGFR was substantially reduced in the PKC78f/+ and c78f/+ mouse pancreatic cells, which also exhibited reduced ADM. Other human cells whereby the level of GRP78 was reduced by genetic knockdown of GRP78 also exhibited reduced EGFR level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observed up-regulation of EGFR in the PKC model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFR activity is essential for metaplastic duct formation and initiation of KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPR78 was reported to directly complex with EGFR in the ER (34, 35) and to cooperate with activated 2-macroglobulin to facilitate the interaction between EGFR and c-Src on the cell surface (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GRP78 could regulate the synthesis, transport, and stability of EGFR, thereby affecting its activation and downstream signaling, which impacts ADM and PDAC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to EGFR, the PKC78f/+ pancreata also displayed reduction in p-AKT, p-S6, p-ERK, p-STAT3, and -catenin compared with PKC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AKT signaling is a critical axis in pancreatic initiation and maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical inhibition of AKT suppressed both human and murine ADM (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of GRP78 and Pten-nullinduced prostate cancer and leukemia revealed that GRP78 haploinsufficiency potently suppressed AKT activation mediated by loss of PTEN in these cancers (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the cell-surface form of GRP78 (scGRP78) complexes with PI3K to promote phosphatidylinositol (35)-trisphosphate formation (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting csGRP78 with a monoclonal antibody led to suppression of AKT signaling and tumor growth (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsGRP78 is also an obligatory binding partner for Cripto, a GPI-anchored cell-surface protein and an upstream regulator of the TGF pathway and of AKT (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GRP78 has been shown to costain with p-AKT in PDAC (26); thus, similar mechanisms may apply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK activation is also critical for ADM induction and PDAC development formation, and ERK inhibitor blocks TGF-induced ADM (33, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing GRP78 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and glioblastoma cells reduced ERK activation, suggesting a causative effect (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of GRP78 may diminish ERK activation via its effect on EGFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also highly possible that GRP78 as a chaperone is needed for processing or stabilizing various client proteins required for AKT, ERK, STAT3, and -catenin signaling, and this warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the acinar cell clusters isolated from c78f/+ mice and cultured in 3D culture, basal levels of p-AKT and p-ERK were reduced compared with control, and the reduced level of p-ERK remained 3 d following TGF stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, in contrast to ERK, induction of p-AKT was observed in the isolated c78f/+ cells 2 d after treatment with TGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation is that, as AKT and ERK can be stimulated by multiple pathways, in these ex vivo settings, ERK stimulation by TGF is highly dependent on GRP78 levels in the isolated acinar clusters, whereas other mechanisms could compensate for GRP78 haploinsufficiency to activate AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with a published report that GRP78 induced a strong activation of ERK in endothelial cells and a weak activation of AKT (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these ex vivo cultures, TGF did not stimulate p-STAT3 activation, and the ratio of p-STAT3 to total STAT3 level remained unchanged between c78f/+ and control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GRP78 haploinsufficiency in the PKC model, although having no effect on apoptosis, slowed tumor proliferation, correlating with lower levels of ADM, PanIN-1, -2, and -3 and delaying the onset of PDAC compared with PKC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In following the survival of these mouse cohorts, we noted a trend toward a prolonged life span of the PKC78f/+ mice compared with the PKC mice, and interestingly, the prolonged survival was observed predominantly in the male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, in our limited analysis, we noted that the male PKC78f/+ mice showed a trend toward smaller tumor volumes compared with female mice at 5 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger cohort sizes in future studies are needed to clarify the significance of these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the reasons for the gender difference remain to be determined, we also observed a differential survival response between the Grp78+/ male and female mice following chemotherapy (53), and others have also reported gender differences in tumor severity and survival in other mouse cancer models (5456).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our studies uncovered previously unidentified roles of GRP78 in acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation and provide proof-of-principle that GRP78 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to suppress PDAC development and oncogenic signaling in Kras-driven pancreatic cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in human PDAC cell lines, GRP78 has been reported to promote proliferation, migration, invasion, viability, and chemoresistance (14, 25, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the utility of inhibitors of GRP78 expression in combating PDAC and chemoresistance merits further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The c78f/+ mice were generated by breeding the Pdx1-Cre mice with the Grp78f/f mice (20) (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKC and the PKC78f/+ mice were generated by breeding the KrasG12D/+;p53f/f mice with Pdx1-Cre;Grp78f/+ mice (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping of DNA from the mouse tail or pancreas was performed by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers for detection of the Pdx1-Cre and floxed or knockout alleles for Grp78 and p53 were described previously (21, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if recombination of the KrasG12D lox-stop-lox cassette occurred, DNA was extracted from pancreas and PCR was performed following the protocol described from the Jacks Lab (https://jacks-lab.mit.edu/protocols/genotyping/kras_cond).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer 1, 5-GTCTTTCCCCAGCACAGTGC-3, and primer 2, 5-CTCTTGCCTACGCCACCAGCTC-3, were used to detect the recombined or the wild-type alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All protocols for animal use and euthanasia were reviewed and approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Processing_and_Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both male and female mice were euthanized and the pancreata were isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collected samples were either frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis or fixed in 10% zinc formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for tissue analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 4 m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Immunostaining of the paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed as described previously (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IHC, the following antibodies were used: GRP78 (1:500, Abcam #ab108613), pan-cytokeratin (1:50, Abcam #ab9377), p-eIF2 (1:50, Cell Signaling #3398), p-S6 (Ser235/236, 1:200, Cell Signaling #4856), p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204, 1:200, Cell Signaling #4370), p-STAT3 (Tyr705, 1:50, Cell Signaling #9145), Ki67 (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific #RM-9106), -catenin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-7199) and -SMA (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich #A2547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunofluorescence (IF) staining, the following antibodies were used: Amylase (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-12821) and pan-cytokeratin (1:50, Abcam #ab9377).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with LSM 510 Version 4.2 SP1 acquisition software, and the images were analyzed with ZEN lite imaging software (Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop CS5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Immunohistochemical_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All slides evaluated for IHC 3,3-diaminobenzidine staining of the pancreas were performed using the histogram function of the Adobe Photoshop CS5 Imaging software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This software function can specifically mine for staining intensities in various cell compartments such as the nucleus and cytoplasm as well as in the ductal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the sampled images that were randomly selected and analyzed were of a fixed size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_Acinar_Cell_Explant_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary acinar cell clusters were prepared as described (58) and were seeded in collagen into 48-well plates, cultured, and treated with recombinant human TGF (50 ng/mL, Novoprotein) and immunostained as described (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glucose_Tolerance_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glucose tolerance was tested as previously described (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse tail blood was measured for glucose by the OneTouch Ultra System (Lifescan) at indicated time points after i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of glucose (1 mg/g body weight) in 2-mo-old mice that had fasted overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Extraction_and_Immunoblot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cell lysates were prepared and subjected to 10% or 12% SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis as described (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primary antibodies were used: GRP78 (1:1,000, BD Biosciences #610978), EGFR (1:1,000, Cell Signaling #4267), STAT3 (1:1,000, BD Biosciences #610190), -actin (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich #A5316), p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling #9106), ERK (1:1,000, Cell Signaling #9102), p-STAT3 (Tyr705, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling #9145), p-AKT (Ser473, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling #9271), and AKT (1:1,000, Cell Signaling #9272).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary antibodies were as follows: horseradish peroxidase conjugate goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-rat antibodies (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-2005, #sc-2004, #sc-2006); goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (1:7,500, LI-COR Biosciences); and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD (1:7,500, LI-COR Biosciences) secondary antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein levels were visualized and quantitated by either ChemiDoc XRS+ Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories) or LICOR Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis was performed with either two-tailed Students t test or a log-rank (MantelCox) test for survival data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparing the numbers of ducts with various features, the log transformation was used before analysis, and the Satterwaite correction was used to adjust for unequal variances due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of the PKC model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the survival and the ductal analyses, our a priori hypothesis was that PKC78f/+ mice would survive longer and have fewer ducts with abnormal features, and hence the P values are one-sided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
