Cell-autonomous adiposity through increased cell surface GLUT4 due to ankyrin-B deficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calorie intake exceeding energy requirements is the chief culprit in the obesity epidemic affecting the United States and other countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, genetic factors may also contribute to the etiology of obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that ankyrin-B (AnkB) deficiency in adipose tissue (AT) causes cell-autonomous adiposity, rendering mice more susceptible to becoming obese with age or when fed a high-fat diet and causing other metabolic complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of AnkB in AT increases glucose uptake and lipogenesis as a result of deficient clathrin-mediated GLUT4 endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that AnkB mutations present in millions of Americans cause similar cellular metabolic impairments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Obesity typically is linked to caloric imbalance as a result of overnutrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose a cell-autonomous mechanism for adiposity as a result of persistent cell surface glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes resulting from impaired function of ankyrin-B (AnkB) in coupling GLUT4 to clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adipose tissue-specific AnkB-KO mice develop obesity and progressive pancreatic islet dysfunction with age or high-fat diet (HFD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB-deficient adipocytes exhibit increased lipid accumulation associated with increased glucose uptake and impaired endocytosis of GLUT4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB binds directly to GLUT4 and clathrin and promotes their association in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB variants that fail to restore normal lipid accumulation and GLUT4 localization in adipocytes are present in 1.3% of European Americans and 8.4% of African Americans, and are candidates to contribute to obesity susceptibility in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conditional_KO_of_AnkB_in_AT_Results_in_Age-Dependent_Obesity_and_Metabolic_Dysregulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AnkBR1788W/R1788W mice exhibit a complex metabolic syndrome (MS) with age- and diet-dependent obesity and IR combined with impaired insulin secretion caused by loss of IP3 receptor function in pancreatic -cells (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced insulin secretion is partially compensated in young animals by increased basal glucose uptake by SKM and WAT, but IR emerges as animals age and gain weight (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this complexity, AnkB is expressed in multiple tissues involved in metabolism, including pancreatic -cells, SKM, WAT, liver parenchymal cells, and the nervous system (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish the specific contribution of AT to AnkB MS, we selectively eliminated AnkB expression in AT by crossing AnkB floxed mice with mice expressing adiponectin-Cre in AT (ADIPOQ-Cre; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four-month-old AnkB KO (AnkBflox/flox;ADIPOQ-Cre) mice exhibited increased body weight, fat pad mass, and epididymal WAT (eWAT) size (Fig 1 BE), which was exacerbated with age (Fig 1 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased adiposity correlated with up-regulation of adipogenic and de novo lipogenesis genes in WAT of AnkB KO mice (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in body composition were not caused by changes in motor activity (Fig S2A) or food consumption (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AnkB KO mice had lower energy expenditure (EE) relative to total body weight and lower respiration quotient (Fig S2 DG), accompanied by whitening of brown AT (BAT; Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB and uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) levels were reduced in BAT of AnkB KO mice (Fig S3 BD), although the amount of BAT did not change relative to controls (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potentially reduced thermogenic activity resulting from impaired BAT function might contribute to the lower levels of EE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice also exhibited other signs of increased fat mass, including elevation in circulating levels of leptin and reduced adiponectin (Fig S4 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with increased adipose mass, AnkB KO mice showed secondary age-dependent signs of IR and increased inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB KO mice developed mild hyperglycemia and oral glucose intolerance during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with age (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S4 F and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older AnkB KO mice also developed IR, as demonstrated by reduced response to insulin stimulation during an insulin tolerance test (ITT; Fig 2C and Fig S4 G and I), reduced suppression of gluconeogenic genes by the liver in response to insulin (Fig S5A), and impaired activation of the insulin signaling pathway in WAT, SKM, and liver (Fig 3 CF and H and Fig S5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice also acquired pancreatic dysfunction, including enlarged pancreatic islets (Fig 2D) and hyperinsulinemia (Fig 2E), likely reflecting the acute expansion of -cells associated with the onset of IR (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, 4-mo-old AnkB KO mice showed increases in basal lipolysis (Fig 2F) and circulating levels of nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFAs; Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated serum NEFA led to ectopic lipid infiltration in SKM and liver (Fig 1 F and G) and contributed to systemic inflammation, as shown by significant macrophage infiltration in WAT (Fig S4 D and E) and elevations in proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6 (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knock-in mice carrying the human disease-linked R1788W and L1622I AnkB variants develop early-onset obesity and MS under HFD conditions (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB KO mice challenged with an eucaloric HFD were more prone to increases in body weight (Fig S6A) and eWAT size (Fig S6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HFD-fed AnkB KO mice also showed higher fasting glucose levels and significant oral glucose intolerance (Fig S6 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, systemic inflammation and IR phenotypes were more severe in AnkB KO animals than in controls (Fig S6 FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that specific loss of AnkB in AT is sufficient to recapitulate metabolic consequences of global AnkB mutation, including obesity, susceptibility to HFD, increased lipid infiltration in peripheral tissues, and systemic metabolic dysregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these effects occur in the absence of increased food consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations support the interpretation that adiposity in AnkB mutant mice results from cell-autonomous changes in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age-Dependent_Changes_in_Cell_Surface_GLUT4_in_WAT_and_SKM_from_AnkB-Deficient_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AnkBR1788W/R1788W mice exhibit increased glucose uptake by SKM and WAT as well as elevated levels of GLUT4 in the PM fractions in these tissues (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we evaluated the levels of GLUT4 in PM fractions of SKM and WAT before and after insulin stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total GLUT4 levels were similar in WAT and SKM of 4-mo-old control (AnkBflox/flox) and AnkB KO mice (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GLUT4 was robustly associated with WAT PM from 4-mo-old AnkB KO mice (fourfold higher than in controls) under basal conditions, and it maintained its PM localization after insulin treatment (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected no changes in cell surface GLUT4 in SKM at baseline or following activation of insulin signaling between the two groups of 4-mo-old mice (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of phosphorylated IRS-1 (Ser307) and AS160 (Thr642) were similar in WAT and in SKM of young control and AnkB KO mice under basal and insulin-stimulated (IS) conditions (Fig 3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, increased basal PM GLUT4 in 4-mo-old AnkB KO mice is restricted to WAT and is not a result of increased activation of insulin signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the development of age-dependent obesity and systemic IR, GLUT4 was no longer significantly elevated at the basal state in WAT PM fractions of 10-mo-old AnkB KO mice (Fig 3 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten-month-old AnkB KO mice had a 37% reduction in total GLUT4 levels in WAT (Fig 3 A and B), consistent with IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed impaired response to insulin in WAT and SKM of older AnkB KO mice, as measured by decreased GLUT4 translocation to the PM (Fig 3 D and F) and decreased pAS160Thr642 levels (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increased_PM_GLUT4_and_Glucose_Uptake_in_AnkB_KO_Differentiated_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study increased PM GLUT4 and lipogenesis in AnkB-deficient WAT under controlled conditions, we differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into adipocytes (3) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB KO MEFs (AnkB/) exhibited enlarged lipid droplets and increased glucose uptake (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed GLUT4 localization in AnkB KO (AnkB/) adipocytes by using a GLUT4-GFP construct containing an exofacial Myc epitope (3, 11) (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At steady state, most GLUT4 molecules were intracellular in control (AnkB+/+) adipocytes, as measured by the ratio of PM myc-GLUT4 to total GLUT4-GFP signal (Fig 4D, basal, and Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PM GLUT4 was threefold higher in AnkB/ adipocytes at rest (Fig 4D and Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular adiposity and GLUT4 localization phenotypes can be rescued by WT 220-kDa AnkB, but not by expression of R1788W or L1622I AnkB variants, which lead to increased adiposity in knock-in mice and differentiated adipocytes (3) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 A and C and 5 and Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the in vivo findings (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 C and E and 3 C and E), and support the idea that AnkB deficiency causes adiposity on a cell-autonomous basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AnkB_Is_a_Clathrin_Adaptor_Required_for_GLUT4_Endocytosis_in_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Low levels of PM GLUT4 under basal conditions are maintained by a faster rate of GLUT4 endocytosis relative to reexocytosis (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported that AnkB R1788W and L1622I mutant adipocytes exhibit reduced rates of GLUT4 internalization (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether a slower GLUT4 internalization rate was responsible for the elevation in PM GLUT4 in AnkB KO adipocytes, we monitored GLUT4 internalization in differentiated adipocytes stably expressing myc-GLUT4-GFP (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control adipocytes, insulin stimulation markedly increased GLUT4 PM localization (100 nM insulin; Fig 4D and Fig S7B), which decreased to nonstimulated values 30 min after insulin treatment (Fig S7B, insulin + 30 min int, and Fig S7D), corresponding to a t1/2 of GLUT4 internalization of 9 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the internalization rate of myc-GLUT4-GFP was substantially slower in AnkB/ adipocytes (t1/2 of 25 min; Fig S7 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of WT 220-kDa AnkB-BFP in AnkB/ adipocytes rescued the deficits in internalization of GLUT4 (t1/2 = 11 min; Fig S7 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AnkB may directly couple GLUT4 to clathrin, which promotes GLUT4 endocytosis (12, 13), based on two observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, AnkB coimmunoprecipitates with GLUT4 in vivo (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain (CHC17) binds with high affinity to the highly conserved ANK repeat domain, also referred to as the membrane binding domain (MBD), of ankyrin-R (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have directly demonstrated an interaction between full-length (FL) AnkB and CHC17 through coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments from COS7 cell homogenates expressing HA-CHC17 and GFP-tagged AnkB (Fig 5A and Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, AnkB associates with CHC17 through its MBD (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, GLUT4 and CHC17 individually coimmunoprecipitate (Fig S9 A and B) and colocalize (Fig S9 C and D) with AnkB and coimmunoprecipitate in a ternary complex with AnkB when all three proteins are coexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that AnkB facilitates GLUT4 retrieval from the PM through coupling GLUT4 to CHC17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate an AnkB-dependent interaction between GLUT4 and CHC17 in adipocytes, we conducted proximity ligation essays (PLAs) for GLUT4 and CHC17, GLUT4 and AnkB, and CHC17 and AnkB in WT and AnkB/ adipocytes (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLA revealed in situ nanoscale interactions (40 nm) between GLUT4 and CHC17, GLUT4 and AnkB, and AnkB and CHC17 in WT adipocytes (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, PLA signals for all three pairs of proteins were markedly reduced in AnkB/ cells (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AnkB is therefore required for GLUT4 localization to clathrin-enriched zones in adipocytes (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the PLA results, endogenous CHC17 and GLUT4 strongly colocalize in immunofluorescence images in WT but not in AnkB/ adipocytes (Fig S9 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to identify sites of AnkB interaction with GLUT4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-IP experiments revealed that GLUT4 associates with FL AnkB and its ZU5-DD supermodule, but not the AnkB MBD (Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLUT4 contains an N-terminal F5QQI8 motif that regulates its localization by facilitating GLUT4 interaction with the endocytic machinery located at the cell surface and by promoting GLUT4 intracellular sequestration (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, GLUT4 requires its F5QQI8 motif to interact with AnkB in immunoprecipitation assays (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assessed whether the N-terminal GLUT4 peptide interacts with AnkB by using purified histidine-tagged AnkB proteins and biotinylated GLUT4 peptides containing the first 24 aa, including the WT F5QQI8 sequence or a mutant A5RRA8 version (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the WT N-terminal GLUT4 peptide associated with FL WT 220-kDa AnkB-His with high affinity (Kd = 137 ± 18 nM; Fig 5D) and with the AnkB ZU5-DD supermodule with a lower Kd of 344 ± 39 nM (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the A5RRA8 mutant GLUT4 peptide exhibited negligible binding to FL AnkB or its ZU5-DD supermodule (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates AnkB interaction with a membrane-spanning protein independent of its MBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower Kd of the ZU5-DD supermodule compared with FL AnkB indicates that additional contacts, possibly with the MBD, are required for full affinity (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important in future studies to fine-map the GLUT4 binding site of the ZU5-DD supermodule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we asked whether AnkB deficiency perturbs global clathrin-mediated endocytosis in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a biotinylation assay, we found that the rate and extent of internalization of biotinylated cell surface proteins were similar between control and AnkB/ adipocytes (Fig S9 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our findings identify AnkB as a specialized adaptor that specifically promotes GLUT4 interaction with clathrin and is required for efficient retrieval of GLUT4 from the PM in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AnkB_Promotes_GLUT4_Internalization_in_Adipocytes_Through_Interaction_with_Dynactin_and_Phosphatidylinositol_3-Phosphate_Lipids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AnkB promotes intracellular transport through coupling dynactin to organelles containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] lipids (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using rescue experiments in AnkB/ adipocytes, we tested whether perturbations of the interactions between AnkB and the retrograde transport machinery or endocytic cargos affected GLUT4 internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal intracellular distribution of GLUT4 in differentiated AnkB+/+ adipocytes under basal conditions is dramatically shifted to favor GLUT4 association with the PM in AnkB/ cells (Fig S10 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although rescue experiments with WT 220-kDa AnkB restored normal basal GLUT4 distribution (Fig S10 A and B), neither the DD1320AA AnkB mutant (Fig S10C), which is unable to bind to the dynactin-4 subunit of the dynactin complex (15, 16), nor the R1194E AnkB mutant (Fig S10C), which eliminates binding of AnkB to PtdIns(3)P lipids/cargo (15, 17), could rescue normal partitioning of PM to cytosolic GLUT4 (Fig S10 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that AnkB is an essential facilitator of GLUT4 microtubule-based endocytic transport in addition to functioning as a clathrin adaptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Subset_of_AnkB_Cardiac_Arrhythmia_Variants_Exhibit_a_Metabolic_Phenotype_in_Differentiated_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple human variants of AnkB are associated with cardiac arrhythmia and result in loss of function in restoring normal calcium dynamics and rhythmic beating in AnkB KO neonatal cardiomyocytes (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the effect of these mutations on the ability of AnkB to rescue metabolic abnormalities of AnkB/ differentiated adipocytes (Fig 6 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 BD and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we found that a subset of AnkB variants, all located within the C-terminal unstructured regulatory domain (Fig 6A), failed to restore lipid levels as well as reduce glucose uptake and lower PM GLUT4 (Fig 6 B and C and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 BD and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, AnkB variants with impaired function in adipocytes, cumulatively present in 1.3% of European Americans and 8.4% of African Americans, are candidates to contribute to obesity susceptibility in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we identify a cell-autonomous mechanism that causes obesity in mice with KO of AnkB targeted to AT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutant mice developed age- and diet-dependent obesity and IR associated with progressive systemic lipotoxicity and inflammation, which affected the pancreas, SKM, liver, and BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the WAT-autonomous mechanism described here, BAT dysfunction may also contribute to the observed metabolic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not possible from our present data to distinguish the relative contributions of WAT hypertrophy vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT disfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that AnkB deficiency in WAT resulted in increased glucose uptake as a result of persistent association of GLUT4 with the PM, which is associated with increased lipid accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that AnkB binds directly to GLUT4 and CHC17 and promotes their association in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose that AnkB is a clathrin adaptor, and that impaired function of AnkB in coupling GLUT4 to CHC17 causes inefficient retrieval of GLUT4 from the cell surface and associated elevated glucose uptake and lipogenesis (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found that AnkB mutations that prevent its interaction with dynactin and PtdIns(3)P also abolish the ability of AnkB to rescue GLUT4 trafficking (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results revealed that AnkB, through its interactions with GLUT4, CHC17, the dynactin complex, and PtdIns(3)P, is essential for normal GLUT4 distribution and glucose uptake in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we highlighted the potential public health relevance of this role of AnkB in AT biology with the finding that multiple AnkB human variants, cumulatively present in millions of Americans, failed to restore normal lipid accumulation and GLUT4 localization in adipocytes (Fig 6 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings, considered together with reports that overexpression of GLUT4 in AT promotes lipogenesis (6, 7), highlight the importance of retrieval of GLUT4 from the PM in maintaining metabolic balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP-2 complex is a clathrin adaptor known to coordinate GLUT4s packaging into endocytic vesicles in adipocytes (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of AP-2 in adipocytes reduced GLUT4 internalization only in IS cells, but GLUT4 still colocalized with clathrin puncta and was internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the basal state (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adipocytes, GLUT4 internalization occurs through a clathrin-dependent mechanism during the IS state (13) or independently of clathrin (23) during basal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How these mechanisms are interchanged and how each route sorts GLUT4 in the endosomal system is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humans, but not mice, express another clathrin heavy-chain isoform, CHC22, which is 85% homologous with CHC17, including conservation of the N-terminal portion known to mediate the interaction of CHC17 with ankyrins (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these two clathrin isoforms are expressed in human SKM and adipocytes (24), they bind to different adaptors and cargo involved in GLUT4 transport, and have been suggested to mediate different steps of GLUT4 membrane traffic (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it will be important to assess whether AnkB associates with CHC22 to regulate of CHC22-mediated formation of GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) and GLUT4 endosomal sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A mouse model overexpressing GLUT4 in AT (AG4OX) showed increased localization of GLUT4 at the PM with resulting elevation in glucose uptake and increased adiposity (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the AnkB KO mice we described here earlier, AG4OX mice do not develop IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas persistent GLUT4 at PM without elevation of total GLUT4 in WAT in AnkB KO mice results in hypertrophic obesity, overexpression of GLUT4 in AG4OX mice leads to hyperplastic obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we showed here earlier, persistent AT hypertrophy and increased lipolysis can result in lipid infiltration in other metabolic organs and triggers a systemic inflammatory response that eventually leads to IR (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, obesity caused by hyperplastic AT expansion has milder metabolic consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AG4OX mice are not protected from glucose intolerance when fed an HFD (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, regulation of GLUT4 expression and dynamics may offer therapeutic benefits, provided the effects on lipogenesis are controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We had previously reported that knock-in mice carrying the human cardiac disease-linked R1788W or L1622I AnkB variants have reduced expression of AnkB in WAT and develop obesity and MS under age and HFD conditions (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study suggests that the metabolic dysregulation developed by these animals is partly caused by a cell-autonomous increase in adiposity that develops with age or HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using cellular essays, we reproduced the impaired GLUT4 dynamics, high glucose uptake, high lipid accumulation, and adipocyte hypertrophy observed in those animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, by using these in vitro essays, we identified four additional human cardiac disease-linked variants exhibiting similar cellular metabolism impairments that are therefore likely to also result in MS in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that AnkB is expressed in all metabolic organs, and AnkB deficiency can also cause intrinsic defects in pancreatic -cells (3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it will be important to understand the individual metabolic roles of AnkB in these other tissues, along with the resulting inherent effects of AnkB deficiencies and how they affect the metabolic organ cross-talk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, can be directly relevant to the 6.5 million Americans bearing potentially deleterious AnkB variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
