Assembly and ecological function of the root microbiome across angiosperm plant species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microbial communities living on and within plants and animals contribute to host function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How host evolution shapes associated microbial communities, and in turn, how these microbes affect the ecology of their hosts is relatively unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that evolution occurring across plant species affects root microbial diversity and composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater similarity in root microbiota among host plant species leads to reduced plant performance through negative soil feedbacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, drought shifts the composition of root microbiomes, where changes in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa are associated with increased drought tolerance of plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work highlights the potential role of host-associated microbial communities in mediating interactions between hosts and their biotic and abiotic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across plants and animals, host-associated microbial communities play fundamental roles in host nutrition, development, and immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The factors that shape hostmicrobiome interactions are poorly understood, yet essential for understanding the evolution and ecology of these symbioses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant roots assemble two distinct microbial compartments from surrounding soil: the rhizosphere (microbes surrounding roots) and the endosphere (microbes within roots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root-associated microbes were key for the evolution of land plants and underlie fundamental ecosystem processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is largely unknown how plant evolution has shaped root microbial communities, and in turn, how these microbes affect plant ecology, such as the ability to mitigate biotic and abiotic stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that variation among 30 angiosperm species, which have diverged for up to 140 million years, affects root bacterial diversity and composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater similarity in root microbiomes between hosts leads to negative effects on plant performance through soil feedback, with specific microbial taxa in the endosphere and rhizosphere potentially affecting competitive interactions among plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drought also shifts the composition of root microbiomes, most notably by increasing the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this drought response varies across host plant species, and host-specific changes in the relative abundance of endosphere Streptomyces are associated with host drought tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results emphasize the causes of variation in root microbiomes and their ecological importance for plant performance in response to biotic and abiotic stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Endosphere_and_Rhizosphere_Microbiomes_Differ_in_Diversity_and_Composition_Across_Host_Plant_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We grew 30 plant species that have diverged for up to 140 My (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown from surface-sterile seeds in a live soil inoculum collected from a naturalized field site where all species cooccur (Koffler Scientific Reserve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured a suite of morphological, physiological and performance traits from every plant (n = 10 per species) (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 16 wk, we partitioned root samples from each plant into endosphere and rhizosphere compartments (8, 9), extracted total DNA, and characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assembled quality-filtered reads into error-corrected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using DADA2 v1.4.0 (33), which represent unique bacterial taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the effects of host plant species and root compartment on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities, as well as the abundance of individual bacterial taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across plant species, the rhizosphere exhibited higher diversity and greater evenness in abundance than the endosphere [Simpsons D1 mean ± SE: rhizosphere, 202 ± 1.8, endosphere, 38 ± 8.2, F(1, 56) = 64.62, P less_than 0.001; evenness: rhizosphere, 0.32 ± 0.01, endosphere, 0.13 ± 0.01, F(1, 56) = 73.89, P less_than 0.001] (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S2 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified microbiome community composition using weighted UniFrac distances with principal coordinates analysis and found clear differences in the composition of endosphere and rhizosphere compartments (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly 90% of bacterial phyla and 55% of bacterial ASVs exhibited significant differential abundance between endosphere and rhizosphere compartments [generalized linear model (GLM): PFDR less_than 0.05 after false-discovery rate (FDR) correction] (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the endosphere, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes exhibited higher relative abundance, while Acidobacteria were significantly reduced (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found a higher number of ASVs that were unique to the endosphere (65 ASVs) versus those that were only found in the rhizosphere (46 ASVs) or live bulk soil (8 ASVs) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our comparative framework uncovered larger effects of host plant species on endosphere than rhizosphere compartments (Fig 1 C and D and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7 and Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host species varied much more in their endosphere (Simpsons D1 range: 687; SE: 8.2) than rhizosphere diversity [range: 111315; SE: 1.8; Levenes test: F(1, 58) = 18.55, P less_than 0.001] (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, host plant species explained 40% of the total variation in endosphere composition [PERMANOVA: pseudoF(1, 29) = 7.57, P less_than 0.001], but only 17% in rhizosphere composition [PERMANOVA: pseudoF(1, 29) = 1.90, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, large proportions of bacterial taxa at all taxonomic ranks in the endosphere varied significantly in abundance among host plant species (bacterial phyla: 65%; ASVs: 12%), whereas far fewer taxa in the rhizosphere were affected (bacterial phyla: 19%; ASVs: 1%; GLM: PFDR less_than 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, only a fraction of the responsive bacterial taxa in the endosphere were also influenced by host plant species in the rhizosphere (bacterial phyla: 36%; ASVs: 17%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several phyla in particular were strongly affected by variation among host plant species, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (GLM: PFDR less_than 0.05) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across host plant species, we found little correlation between endosphere and rhizosphere diversity (Simpsons D1: r = 0.06, P = 0.09), despite a significant correlation between endosphere and rhizosphere community composition (weighted UniFrac distances: rMantel = 0.26, P = 0.04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we identified 133 endosphere and 334 rhizosphere ASVs found in all host plant species (Dataset S1), suggesting the existence of a prevalent core microbial assemblage despite tremendous variability occurring among host plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these ASVs, 59% in the endosphere and 40% in the rhizosphere that make up the core microbiome were found at intermediate (two to three individuals per host species) or high prevalence (five individuals per host species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolutionary_Divergence_Among_Host_Plant_Species_Affects_the_Assembly_of_the_Endosphere_and_Rhizosphere_Microbiome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how plant evolution has shaped root microbial communities, we tested whether close relatives share similar endosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial diversity in the endosphere (Blombergs K = 1.08, P = 0.001), but not the rhizosphere (Blombergs K = 0.67, P = 0.94), exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Mantel tests of phylogenetic relatedness versus root microbial community similarity among plant species to understand whether plant evolution shapes the community composition of the root microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, endosphere similarity (rMantel = 0.15, P = 0.004), but not rhizosphere (rMantel = 0.05, P = 0.15), was positively correlated with phylogenetic relatedness between plant species (Fig 1D and SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression (PGLS) to investigate the relationship between experimentally measured plant traits and root microbial diversity and composition (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root microbial diversity was associated with numerous host plant traits; however, the importance of individual traits varied between endosphere and rhizosphere compartments (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endosphere diversity was positively associated with increasing root hair density, while rhizosphere diversity was positively associated with host plant productivity and negatively associated with root length (PGLS: PFDR less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endosphere and rhizosphere composition were also associated with numerous plant traits, including host plant productivity, physiology, and root architectural traits (SI Appendix, Table S8) (PGLS: PFDR less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Variation_in_the_Root_Microbiome_Between_Host_Plant_Species_Affects_Indirect_Competitive_Interactions_via_PSFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a multigeneration PSF experiment, we investigated how patterns of root microbial recruitment among host plant species can feed back to affect competitive interactions (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first generation, we grew each of the 30 plant species in a homogenous soil mixture collected from the same field site as our comparative microbiome study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second generation, we grew replicate individuals of five focal species, representative of our host plant phylogenetic diversity, in bulk and rhizosphere soil collected and preserved from each of the 30 plant species from the previous generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net effect of soil conditioning in the first generation on plant performance in the second generation is the PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSF can be caused by modification to both biotic and abiotic soil properties, including the alteration of soil bacterial communities, as well as the depletion of soil nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the PSF as: loge [(focal species biomass in heterospecific soil)/(focal species biomass in conspecific soil)]; positive values indicate that a focal species performed better in soil conditioned by a different species from the focal plant relative to soil conditioned by the same species as the focal plant, whereas negative values indicate the opposite (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed strong positive and negative soil feedback occurring among pairs of plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to understand how root microbiota assembled by different plant species contributes to their experimentally measured PSF (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated the root microbiome similarity (weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances) between host plant species with their PSF measured in our multigeneration experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the effect of inoculation with soil conditioned by heterospecific plants depended on the degree of similarity between the root microbiomes assembled by the focal and soil-conditioning plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, highly dissimilar microbiomes had more positive effects on focal plant growth than highly similar ones (Fig 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was consistent for both the endosphere and rhizosphere, although it depended on the particular measure of community similarity used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated how specific bacterial taxa contributed to the effect of the root microbiome on PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used GLMs to calculate the log2 fold-change (i.e., doublings) of each taxon abundance between all pairs of focal and soil-conditioning host plant species (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified bacterial taxa across all taxonomic ranks that exhibited significant differential abundance across host plant species in either the endosphere or rhizosphere (e.g., Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated the differential abundance between host plant species of each bacterial taxon with the experimentally measured host plant pairs PSF (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous bacterial taxa were strongly associated with positive and negative PSF occurring between plant species (hereafter, PSF-related taxa), including a number of endosphere and rhizosphere ASVs found across all host species (representative taxa shown in Fig 3 C and D; for full list, see Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential abundance of particular ASVs explained up to 15% of the total variation in the measured PSF between host plant species (e.g., Fig 3C and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although bacterial phylasuch as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteriaare well represented in the list of PSF-related taxa in both the endosphere and rhizosphere, we found little overlap at lower taxonomic ranks (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, when the abundance of a bacterial taxon in the focal host species was less than the soil-conditioner host species, we observed enhanced growth of the focal plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when the abundance of the bacterial taxon was greater in the focal host species than the soil-conditioner plant species, we observed reduced growth of the focal plant (e.g., Fig 3D and Dataset S2, r values less_than 0, unshaded rows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we noticed that for some microbial taxa the association was reversed (e.g., Fig 3C and Dataset S2, r values  0, blue-shaded rows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, of the microbial taxa significantly related to PSF, a greater proportion in the endosphere (35% of taxa) versus the rhizosphere (12% of taxa) exhibited this opposite association (Fig 3 E and F) (Fishers exact test for the difference in proportion: P = 0.01) (Dataset S2, r values  0, blue-shaded rows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Root_Microbiome_Is_Associated_with_Drought_Tolerance_Across_Host_Plant_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During our comparative root microbiome study, we imposed a chronic drought treatment on replicate individuals from each host plant species, which resulted in a fourfold difference in soil moisture compared with well-watered control plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated how this abiotic stressor affects the diversity and composition of the root microbiome across 30 host plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included pots without plants that were filled with the same soil mixture in each watering treatment and identically treated, nonliving structures (bamboo toothpicks) that were analogous to plant roots (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the bacterial communities in living roots to nonliving root analogs allowed us to understand the host-mediated effects of drought on the root microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Drought reduced microbial diversity in the endosphere and rhizosphere by 15% and 27%, respectively [F(1, 53) = 5.56, PFDR = 0.06] (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drought also caused large changes in bacterial community composition (Fig 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the effect of drought was stronger on the endosphere than the rhizosphere microbiome, suggesting large indirect effects of drought through changes in host plant physiology or immune status (26, 27, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this result, drought caused changes in the relative abundance of 65% of bacterial phyla in the endosphere versus only 43% in the rhizosphere (GLM: PFDR less_than 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the abundance of Actinobacteria in the drought endosphere increased over twofold, whereas the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased nearly 2.5-fold (GLM: PFDR less_than 0.05) (Fig 4B, SI Appendix, Fig S9 and Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, host plants varied in the magnitude of the shift in their endosphere microbiome during drought (drought × host species: 2 = 7.15, PFDR = 0.03) (SI Appendix, Table S4), which included the enrichment/depletion of bacteria found in well-watered plants and the recruitment of new taxa into their roots (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drought-induced changes in the microbiota of living plant roots were distinct from those occurring in the microbiota of root analogs and soil (SI Appendix, Fig S15 and Table S9 and Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to understand whether drought-induced shifts in the root microbiome were related to drought tolerance across plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This question was motivated by the prediction that plastic responses in the root microbiome may maintain host functions and ultimately plant fitness in response to stress (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured drought tolerance as the proportional difference in total biomass between drought and well-watered conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, plants exhibited a 35% reduction in total biomass in response to drought; however, species varied between an 80% reduction to a 127% increase in biomass in response to drought (Fig 5A and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no evidence of phylogenetic signal in drought tolerance across the plant phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in overall root microbiome composition or diversity under drought were not associated with drought tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, coarse estimates of overall composition have a poor ability to detect the ecological effects of particular bacterial clades or ASVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine whether the root microbiome affects drought tolerance, we investigated how individual bacterial taxa were related to drought tolerance across plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, for each host plant species, we used GLMs to calculate the log2 fold-change of each drought-responsive taxon between watering treatments (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified bacterial taxa at all taxonomic ranks in the endosphere and rhizosphere that were differentially abundant between well-watered and drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we correlated patterns of differential abundance for each bacterial taxon with drought tolerance across host plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected two striking results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the Streptomycetaceae (all ASVs combined, three of which were found in the endosphere of every host plant species), exhibited a threefold increase abundance within the endosphere, but not rhizosphere, under drought (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitude of Streptomycetaceae enrichment varied between 0 to fourfold across plant species (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the relative enrichment of one Streptomyces ASV, found in the endosphere of every host plant species in the experiment, explained nearly 40% of the variation in drought tolerance among host plant species (Fig 5C and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of other endosphere taxa exhibited strong correlations (r  0.4) with host drought tolerance, including another Streptomyces ASV at high host prevalence (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the exception of the Streptomyces ASV depicted in Fig 5C, these correlations were nonsignificant after multiple test correction (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, after examination of the nonliving wood samples, all of the endosphere ASVs related to drought tolerance in living roots were not enriched in the endosphere of these root analogs under drought (Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate that plant evolution over long timescales shapes root microbiome assembly, which in turn influences how host plants respond to biotic and abiotic environmental stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results successfully address our four research questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the diversity and composition of the root microbiome was markedly different between the endosphere and rhizosphere compartments across host species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, host plant species explained much of the variation in the diversity and composition of the root microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in the endosphere microbiome exhibited strong correspondence with the underlying host plant phylogeny, although this was not the case for the rhizosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, patterns of root microbial recruitment among host plants in both the endosphere and rhizosphere influence indirect competitive interactions among plant species through PSFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, under drought stress the root endosphere dynamically responds, and these changes correspond to variation in host plant tolerance to drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we discuss how these results inform our understanding of the factors that shape root microbiomes and their ecological importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Root_Microbiome_Assembly_Across_Angiosperm_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide clear insight into how host plants affect the assembly of root microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large differences in endosphere and rhizosphere diversity and composition (Fig 1 A and B) are likely a conserved feature in plants, reflecting general rules for the assembly of root microbiomes across angiosperm species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found a significant correlation between endosphere and rhizosphere community composition, indicating that the host-specific factors shaping composition, but not diversity, are at least partly shared between endosphere and rhizosphere compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a broad conservation of root microbiome assembly, we also uncovered tremendous variation in microbiome communities occurring across host plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant species varied much more in their endosphere diversity (Fig 1C) and composition (Fig 1D) than in their rhizosphere microbiome compartment, which supports the idea of greater host plant importance in the assembly of the endosphere microbiome (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several plant lineages exhibited pronounced differences in their endosphere microbiota, including the Fabaceae, which have an elevated proportion of Proteobacteria, and the Poaceae, which are enriched in Actinobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find support for the emerging view that plant evolution influences the root microbiome (12, 31, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronounced effects of host plant species in the face of recruitment of microbiota from the surrounding environment suggest that plants have evolved traits that govern root microbiome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a particularly strong association between host plant evolutionary relatedness and endosphere diversity and composition, which indicates that host traits underlying endosphere assembly covary with phylogenetic relatedness among hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, rhizosphere assembly exhibited no clear relationship with host plant phylogeny (Fig 1 C and D and SI Appendix, Tables S6 and S7), despite host plant species having a strong effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (SI Appendix, Tables S3S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the plant traits, which shape the rhizosphere compartment, are themselves uncorrelated with host plant phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of plant traits revealed that plant productivity and physiology are associated with variation in root microbiome diversity and composition, similar to a recent study of leaf bacterial communities in tropical tree species (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These physiological traits are often correlated with broad resource acquisition strategies employed across plant species (41), suggesting that plant resource consumption and turnover are correlated with root microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several host traits were associated with microbial composition in both the endosphere and rhizosphere; however, this was not the case for microbial diversity (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support our previous finding that host plant factors associated with root microbial composition, but not diversity, are partially shared between endosphere and rhizosphere compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that finer insight into how host plant variation and evolution affects root microbiome assembly, particularly the endosphere compartment, will require characterization of root metabolites and exudates as well as the microbial-triggered immune responses across plant species (4, 4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Ecological_Importance_of_the_Plant_Root_Microbiome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plants evolved the ability to colonize land at a time when the terrestrial environment already contained microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions between plants and soil microbes were key to the colonization and persistence of land plants (5), and they continue to play essential roles in host plant evolution and ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How assemblages of root microbiota contribute to the interaction between host plants and their biotic and abiotic environment is poorly understood and was a central focus of our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Caveats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Linking ecological functions across host plant species with root microbial diversity and composition derived from deep-amplicon sequencing data has several important limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, although strongly suggestive of an important role for root bacterial communities in mitigating interactions between host plants and their biotic and abiotic environment, our results are correlative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research requires controlled experiments using synthetic communities or single inoculations to understand the mechanisms underlying the patterns uncovered here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, measures of relative abundance are unable to detect absolute increases in bacterial abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using qPCR, Naylor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) recently confirmed that relative increases in Actinobacteria abundance in plant roots reflect absolute increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the results from our drought study likely reflect absolute changes in the abundance of Streptomycetaceae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, characterization based on the 16S rRNA gene yields little functional information about microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic analyses of root microbiota in addition to ecological assays of individual taxa or synthetic communities will elucidate the functional importance of root microbiota (5759).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these limitations, our results reveal important effects of plant evolution and stress on root microbiota, and how the root microbiome is tightly related to the ecological response of plants to environmental stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Host-associated microbiota are essential for nutrition, development, and immunity across plant and animal hosts (2), yet our understanding of their broader ecological importance remains limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides evidence of the causes of variation in the host microbiome across a wide range of host plant species, as well as the general ecological importance of this variation for biotic and abiotic stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study may also inform future efforts to engineer the root microbiome in diverse agricultural systems to increase plant performance in the face of competition and drought stress (60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the assembly and ecological function of the angiosperm root bacterial microbiome, we combined a comparative study of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species with manipulative experiments (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we characterized the endosphere and rhizosphere microbiome of replicate individuals grown from surface-sterile seeds in a common environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeds were planted in a live soil inoculum collected from a naturalized field site where all species cooccur (Koffler Scientific Reserve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured a suite of morphological, physiological, and performance traits from every plant (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 16 wk, we partitioned standard root samples from each plant into endosphere and rhizosphere compartments (8, 9) and extracted total DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing amplicons of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce host contamination, we used peptide nucleic acids designed to block amplification of host plant plastid and mitochondrial sequences (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assembled quality-filtered reads into error-corrected ASVs using DADA2 v1.4.0 (33), which represent unique bacterial taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASVs exhibit fewer false-positive taxa and reveal cryptic diversity, otherwise undetected by traditional OTU approaches (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we profiled 271 endosphere communities, 255 rhizosphere communities, and 58 soil and control samples (SI Appendix, Table S1), and assembled 56,063 ASVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assembled ASVs were assigned taxonomy (phylum to genus) using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) naïve Bayesian classifier (implemented in DADA2) and the RDP training set 14 (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used PASTA to align ASV sequences and build a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, using the R package phyloseq (65), we removed any ASVs without a bacterial phylum assignment, assigned to Archaea, chloroplast, or mitochondrial origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify downstream analyses, we applied a prevalence and abundance threshold for bacterial ASVs, where taxa were kept only if they were found in 1% of samples (seven samples) and at a frequency of 25 reads per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded 2,799 ASVs, which accounted for 94% of the total number of sequences in the dataset (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For downstream composition analyses, we performed proportional abundance normalization (relative abundance) on this common set of ASVs, where the sequencing reads for an ASV in a given sample were divided by the total number of sequencing reads in that sample (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an additional set of analyses, we used the traditional approach of rarefaction (to 800 reads) to normalize our full dataset before any threshold, which yielded 13,000 ASVs and accounted for less than 2% of the total read count (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both methods (rarefaction on the full dataset and relative abundance normalization on the simplified dataset) yielded qualitatively identical results; we therefore present the nonrarefied data because it retained a larger portion of our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the ecological importance of root microbiota for both biotic and abiotic stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a biotic stressor, we measured how patterns of root microbial recruitment among host plant species can feed back to affect indirect competitive interactions via PSFs (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first generation of our PSF experiment, we grew each of our 30 plant species in a homogenous soil mixture collected from the same field site as our comparative microbiome study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pots were filled with 800 mL of sterilized soil [mixture of potting soil and sand (2:3 v/v) and 200 mL of live inoculum collected from KSR].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We preserved bulk and rhizosphere soil collected and pooled from five individuals from each of the 30 plant species and used it to inoculate replicate individuals of five focal species, representative of our host plant phylogenetic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this second generation, we mixed live soil inoculum preserved from the previous generation with the same sterile soil mix in the same ratio as the first generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of soil conditioning in the first generation on plant performance in the second generation is the PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operationally, we measured the PSF as: loge [(focal species biomass in heterospecific soil)/(focal species biomass in conspecific soil)]; positive values indicate that a focal species performed better in soil conditioned by a different species from the focal plant relative to soil conditioned by the same species as the focal plant, whereas negative values indicate the opposite (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an abiotic stressor, we manipulated drought and measured how water limitation affected patterns of root microbial recruitment among host plant species and host plant drought tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a drip irrigation system to impose a chronic drought stress on replicate individuals from each host plant species during the comparative root microbiome study, as well as an equal number of well-watered control plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our manipulation resulted in a fourfold difference in soil moisture and a mean biomass reduction of 35% across host plant species in the drought treatment compared with the control, although host plant species varied widely in their tolerance to drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alongside living plants we also included bare soil pots and pots planted with structurally similar root analogs (toothpicks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in drought responses between living root microbial communities and root analogs or soil indicate the effects of living host plants on microbial dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the effects of host plant species, root compartment, and watering treatment on the diversity [observed ASV richness, Simpsons D1, and evenness (Simpsons D1/observed ASV richness)], and composition [weighted UniFrac dissimilarity (67)] of bacterial communities using linear mixed models (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analyzed the effects of host plant species, root compartment, and watering treatment on the differential abundance of bacterial taxa using DESeq2 (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DESeq2 uses negative binomial models and ASV read counts to test whether individual bacterial taxa are differentially abundant across experimental factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand how plant evolution has shaped root microbial communities, we calculated phylogenetic signal (Blombergs K and Pagels ) present in diversity estimates and used Mantel tests to determine the correlation between host plant evolutionary relatedness and root microbial compositional similarity (SI Appendix, Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we used PGLS to determine the relationship between plant traits and root microbial diversity and composition (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the ecological importance of root microbiota by correlating patterns of root microbial composition and differential abundance among host plant species with experimentally measured PSF and drought tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlations between root microbial composition and ecological processes indicate an importance of broad patterns of root microbiome assembly, whereas correlations with individual taxa indicate particular individual bacterial taxa are associated with host plant performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we analyzed how endosphere and rhizosphere compositional differences (weighted and unweighted UniFrac dissimilarity) among pairs of host plant species was correlated with PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we identified those bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant among host plant species and correlated their log2 fold-change between focal and soil-conditioning plant species with the experimentally measured PSF (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the drought experiment, we correlated endosphere and rhizosphere compositional differences (weighted and unweighted UniFrac dissimilarity) between watering treatments within a host plant species with their measured drought tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the potential role of individual taxa, we first identified drought-responsive bacterial taxa and correlated their log2 fold-change between watering treatments within a host plant species with host species drought tolerance (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were carried out in R v3.3.3 (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detailed materials and methods, see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence files associated with individual samples are available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRP128025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data and R code used in the analyses are available on the Dryad digital repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5p414).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
