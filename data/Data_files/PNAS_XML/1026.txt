Combining disparate data sources for improved poverty prediction and mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatially finest poverty maps are essential for improved diagnosis and policy planning, especially keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Big Data sources like call data records and satellite imagery have shown promise in providing intercensal statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study outlines a computational framework to efficiently combine disparate data sources, like environmental data, and mobile data, to provide more accurate predictions of poverty and its individual dimensions for finest spatial microregions in Senegal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are validated using the concurrent census data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More than 330 million people are still living in extreme poverty in Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timely, accurate, and spatially fine-grained baseline data are essential to determining policy in favor of reducing poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential of Big Data to estimate socioeconomic factors in Africa has been proven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most current studies are limited to using a single data source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a computational framework to accurately predict the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at a finest spatial granularity and coverage of 552 communes in Senegal using environmental data (related to food security, economic activity, and accessibility to facilities) and call data records (capturing individualistic, spatial, and temporal aspects of people).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our framework is based on Gaussian Process regression, a Bayesian learning technique, providing uncertainty associated with predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform model selection using elastic net regularization to prevent overfitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results empirically prove the superior accuracy when using disparate data (Pearson correlation of 0.91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is used to accurately predict important dimensions of poverty: health, education, and standard of living (Pearson correlation of 0.840.86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All predictions are validated using deprivations calculated from census.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach can be used to generate poverty maps frequently, and its diagnostic nature is, likely, to assist policy makers in designing better interventions for poverty eradication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Global_MPI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poverty has traditionally been measured in one dimension, usually income (or consumption)also known as income poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another internationally comparable measure is the Global MPI, which complements income poverty and is created from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (DHS-MICS) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was developed by OPHI and the United Nations Development Program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a composite of 10 indicators across three critical dimensionseducation (years of schooling, school enrollment), health (malnutrition, child mortality), and living conditions (cooking fuel, sanitation, access to drinking water, electricity, floor, asset ownership).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MPI is defined as the percentage of people who are MPI poor (H, headcount of poverty) multiplied by the average intensity of MPI poverty across the poor (A, intensity of poverty).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MPI data for Senegal, used in this study, were downloaded from www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Senegal-2013.pdf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MPI is robust to decomposition within relevant subgroups of populations, like urban vs. rural, geographic regions (districts/provinces/states), and gender, so that targeted policies can be planned for specific demographics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Countries can also adapt the multidimensional poverty approach to select different indicators and/or update weights that align better with their nations poverty measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Countries, like Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, have implemented their own version of national MPI using additional dimensions than MPI, such as employment and social protection, when data are available (www.mppn.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MPI has some limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though it has been defined from available variables in global surveys (DHS-MICS), some of the potential dimensions of poverty (like gender, income, employment) are not directly incorporated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the wide availability of these surveys, Global MPI can easily be estimated in more than 100 countries covering 5.2 billion people (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, it represents a benchmark index, more interesting than the single dimension poverty line, for replication of this study in another country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GP_Model_for_Predicting_Poverty_from_a_Single_Data_Source  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To predict poverty for a commune from a single data source (CDR or environment), the following model is assumed:yi=i+f(i)+[1]where yi is the target poverty value and i is a vector of independent variables derived from the particular data source for the ith commune.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term is a linear combination of the independent variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function f() models the nonlinear relationship between yi and i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual term, , models the remaining unexplained noise and is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variablethat is, N(0,n2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Without the nonlinear term, f() in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the model is equivalent to ordinary linear regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a linear model is not rich enough to capture the relationships between the target and the independent variables (see Fig S6), thus motivating the need for a nonlinear term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Instead of assuming a fixed parametric form for f(), we adopt a nonparametric approach, by assuming a GP prior on f().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generative process thus becomes:f()GP(m(),k(,))[2]yiN(i+f(i),n2),i[3]A GP is a stochastic process, indexed by d. Any finite sample generated from it is jointly multivariate normal (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  m() is the mean of f() and k(,x) is a kernel function that defines the covariance between any two evaluations of f()that is, m()=[f()], and k(,)=[(f()m())(f()m())].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For model simplicity, we assume that m()=0, which is a standard practice in GP-based methods (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given a training set of examples, D={i,yi}i=1N, the GP prior on f(), and other terms in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the posterior distribution of y (for an unseen input vector, ) is a Gaussian distribution, with the following mean and variance (see GP Regression Model for details):y¯:=[y]=+(K+n2I)1[4]2:=var[y]=k(K+n2I)1+n2[5]Here, =[y1,y2,], and K is a matrix that contains the kernel function evaluation on each pair of training inputsthat is, K[i,j]=k(i,j)and k is a vector of the kernel computation between each training input and the test inputthat is, [i]=k(,i), k=k(,)and I is an identity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Choice_of_Kernel_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of the kernel function is to specify how the function values f() and f() vary as the function of their corresponding inputs x and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the following kernel function:k(,)=f2exp(222)exp(ss22s2)[6]where s and s are the spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the commune centers corresponding to x and , respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first exponent term captures nonlinear dependencies in the feature space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second exponent term plays the same role, but in the geographic space and models, the spatial autocorrelation is a continuous function, which is same as Kriging, a widely used method in geostatistics (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter f2 is the variance of the stochastic process f, l is the process length scale for the feature space part, and ls is the process length scale for the spatial part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quantities ,,s,n2, and f2 are estimated by maximizing the marginalized log-likelihood of the training data, as discussed in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove the effect of spurious features, we couple the GP model with elastic net regularization (17) during the model learning phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for automatic relevant feature selection and learning a parsimonious model that improves interpretability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Combining_Source-Specific_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To predict poverty for a commune, we use two independently trained models specified in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, corresponding to the two data sources of CDRs and environmental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each model produces a posterior Gaussian distribution, denoted by yicN(y¯ic,ic2) and yieN(y¯ie,ie2) for the CDR and environmental data, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined poverty estimate, yi, is assumed to be a mixture distribution consisting of two Gaussians, defined above, and the mixing weights defined as:wic=1ic21ic2+1ie2,wie=1ie21ic2+1ie2[7]The weights assign greater importance to the source that provides a smaller predictive variance, signifying higher confidence in the prediction for the particular commune.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean and the variance for the combined poverty estimate are (see Estimating Moments of a Mixture Distribution):[yi]=wicy¯ic+wiey¯ievar[yi]=wicic2+wieie2+wicwie(y¯icy¯ie)2[8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predicted_MPI_Poverty_Values  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predicted map of MPI for microregionsthat is, 552 communes of Senegalis depicted in Fig 2, Left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the current poverty map in Fig 1, our map highlights heterogeneity in the existence of poverty within each macroregion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The communes toward the interior of the country have more poverty compared with the rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The west regions, containing the capital city Dakar, and communes neighboring the coastal boundary are less poor than the rest of the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of special interest is the spatially large division in the south, consisting of the regions of Tambacounda, Kedougou, and Kolda, which are depicted as one color on the current map in Fig 1 but have communes of varying poverty values spread throughout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the communes in the Kedougou region in the extreme southeast corner of Senegal are predicted as wealthier than other communes within the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The communes in the region of Ziguinchor, in the southwest corner, are wealthier compared with other communes in the south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is attributed to the fact that Ziguinchor is the second largest city in Senegal, with the economic advantage of being a port and a tourist center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 121 urban centers are shown as small circles on the map and, in general, have less poverty values compared with rural communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population in urban centers is generally richer than the population living in adjacent rural communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is true even for very poor communes of Senegal in the regions of Kaffrine and Tambacounda in the center, for which the contrast is even higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The urban centers bordering with the neighboring country Mauritania, in the northeast, are wealthier; this could be attributed to the economy of the Senegal river basin and to cross-border trade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominantly urban areas in Dakar are shown enlarged in the map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All communes in Dakar are more well-off than the rest of Senegal because of the concentration of economic activity over the years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A quantitative validation of the predictions is provided against commune-level poverty values estimated from census data (see Fig 2, Right) using cross-validation (CV) procedures (details in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard CV is often performed to ensure that the model generalizes to out-of-sample data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a standard 10-fold CV, where the data are randomly split into 10-folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each time, ninefolds are used for training, and singlefold is used for evaluation, meaning we randomly assign 90% of communes to the training set and evaluate the remaining 10% of communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure is repeated 250 times to provide a robust assessment of the variability of model parameters and prediction statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using standard CV, the model gives a Pearsons correlation of 0.94, with a P value of less_than0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though training and evaluation data are selected randomly, the above-described method of validation may prove to be insufficient, as the poverty deprivations tend to be spatially correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a model may appear to perform well when evaluated this way, even though it may have poor extrapolation power in the spatial sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above results are provided for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the extrapolation ability of the model to spatial areas that were not represented in the training data, we use a spatial CV procedure (18) (details in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the training and evaluation sets are sampled from geographically distinct regions ensuring that the model is tested rigorously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were repeated 250 times with random samples of training and evaluation sets, while ensuring that all communes are represented in the evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report Pearsons and Spearmans correlations, and rms error (RMSE), averaged over the multiple CV runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictions in Fig 2, Left have a spatially cross-validated Pearsons correlation of 0.91 and rank correlation of 0.87, with P values less than 1020 for both tests, indicating strong significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes the efficacy of our model in predicting poverty values accurately at the finest spatial granularity, using multisource data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a comparative study of how our model performs using multisource and single-source data, we experimented with three datasetsMultisource, CDR, and Environmentto predict H, A, and MPI at the commune level (see Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report highly accurate results for all three targets (H, A, and MPI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rank correlations are preserved, as we report a Spearmans correlation of 0.85 for both H and A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of Pearsons r correlation are much higher than rank correlation, across all prediction tasks, indicating the linear correspondence of the poverty values with the predicted ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report significantly low P values (less_than1034) for spatial CV compared with standard CV, signifying more stable performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detailed results, see Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 shows that combining multiple data sources (CDRs and environmental data) results in a consistent improvement of accuracy over using the individual data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improvement is more pronounced in detailed results for all of the indicators of poverty and given in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3, Left plots the relationship between MPI values predicted by our model and those estimated from census.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a linear relationship, in general, for MPI, with lower values for urban areas (shown in red) and higher values for rural areas (shown in blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predominantly urban communes of Dakar and a few urban centers are underestimated for poverty (i.e., they are predicted richer than they are).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, there are very few rural communes, where poverty is overestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe that for communes with lower population densities, the predicted variance is comparatively higher than it is for communes with higher densities, signifying that lesser numbers of data points in the vicinity of a given commune contribute to its higher variance (see Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predicted_Values_for_the_Dimensions_of_Poverty  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global MPI consists of 10 individual deprivation indicators grouped along three dimensions: (i) education (indicatorsyears of schooling and school attendance), (ii) health (indicatorschild mortality and nutrition), and (iii) standard of living (indicatorscooking fuel, sanitation, access to drinking water, electricity, and floor and asset ownership).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each individual deprivation indicator is taken as the target of our model, and the averaged spatially cross-validated results, along the three dimensions, are reported in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed results for each of the 10 indicators are given in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Referring to Table S5, we note that the accuracy of the model is high for some deprivations and good for most deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All deprivations are better predicted using CDR data, probably because they characterize the individual behavior while environmental data depict conditions that might have an influence on poverty (see Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3, Top Right compares our predictions for asset ownership with those estimated from the census.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rural communes depicted (by blue) are clustered closely toward high deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The urban areas have, generally, lower deprivation than rural areas, though it is spread out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indicators related to educationyears of schooling and school attendanceare predicted well, because use of short message service (SMS) is indicative of literacy (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The environmental data also perform well, because they capture the distance to schools, main roads, and urban centers, all of which facilitate access to educational attainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3, Bottom Right shows that all areas of Senegal are deprived in education, as the rural (in blue) and urban (in red) points are spread evenly on the plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rural areas tend to dominate at the very high deprivation index, while very low deprivation areas are urban.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model performs poorly for the indicators within the health dimensionthat is, child mortality and nutrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is attributed to the fact that our data are not representative of the children population, and thus, the features extracted from CDR data do not capture this deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar inference can be drawn for poorer correlations for nutrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the validation of deprivation values computed from the census for nutrition indicators are based on two hunger-related questions, as detailed nutritional information is not available to us (see Table S7 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dimensions_of_PovertyInterpretation_of_Weights  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3 display the features deemed important by our model for the environment and CDR data, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The important features are those for which the corresponding entries in the coefficient vector, , are high in magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ignore child mortality and nutrition, as our model does not perform very accurately for these two indicators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following interpretations are given for information purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are, by no means, indicators of causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Referring to Fig S2, nighttime lights appear to be the most important feature regardless of the predicted dimensions, conforming to the current research (8, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nighttime lights show a strong correlation with MPI (Spearman correlation of 0.66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urban areas and road density, two other important indicators of economic activity, are relevant but to a lesser extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the coefficient values of each dimension are not directly comparable, since each dimension was taken as a separate target, it is interesting to note that the weights of nighttime lights intensity for electricity and asset ownership deprivation are the highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result confirms previous findings (21) that access to electricity is correlated with nighttime lights (Spearman correlation of 0.67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional observations regarding water deprivation, food security (access component), and climate are given in Interpretation of WeightsAlong the Dimensions of Poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A similar analysis for the CDR features reveals several interesting insights regarding the relationship between poverty and the individual characteristics captured in CDR features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we considered CDR features for each month individually, for the ease of visualization (see Fig S3), we average the monthly values of the weights associated with each feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we discuss the CDR features that were selected by the model as the strongest predictors for the various targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features are listed in Table S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the strongest negative predictors for most of the targets is the number of active days (for call and text), which characterizes that individuals in wealthier communes have monetary resources to recharge their phone and make/receive calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of calls vs. text shows the preference for calls and emerges as an important factor to predict education-based deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feature interevent time call measures the irregularity in responding to calls/text and emerges as a positive predictor for deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features that indicate diversity in communication, such as entropy of contacts and interactions per contact (call and text), report a negative relationship to poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm previous findings (7, 22, 23) that diversity of an individuals relationships is positively correlated with his or her economic wellbeing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for features such as percent pareto interactions and balance of contacts, which are proportional to an individuals diversity in communication, we report a positive relationship with poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This counterintuitive relationship needs to be further studied in the context of telecommunication patterns in Senegal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observe a negative relationship between the activeness of an individual in his or her mobile interactions and poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the delay in responding to text has a positive relationship to poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the feature of percent initiated interactions (calls) has, again, a positive relationship to poverty, signifying that in Senegal individuals living in more deprived communes are more likely to initiate calls (for request of resources, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than those living in less deprived communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobility patterns of individuals, captured using spatial features such as number of frequent antennas, entropy of antennas, and total number of antennas used by an individual, indicate a negative relationship to poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, individuals living in more deprived communes tend to move fewer antennas than those living in less deprived communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation should be viewed cautiously because of sparse antenna density in rural communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


GP_Regression_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following model is assumed to predict poverty for a commune from a single data source (CDR or environment):yi=i+f(i)+[S1]where yi is the target poverty value and i is a vector of independent variables derived from the particular view for the ith commune.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of assuming a fixed parametric form for f(), we adopt a nonparametric approach, by assuming a GP prior on f(), with zero mean function, and kernel function k().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generative process thus becomes:f()GP(0,k(,))yiN(i+f(i),n2),iA GP is a stochastic process, such that any finite sample generated from this stochastic process is jointly multivariate normal (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The posterior distribution of f() at a test input, , can be computed given a training set of examples, {i,f(i)}i=1N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The joint distribution of the training outputs, f(1),f(2),, and the test output, f(), according to the GP prior is:[f(1)f(2)f(N)f()]N(,[k(1,)k(1,)k(1,)k(2,)k(2,)k(2,)k(N,)k(N,)k(N,)k(,)k(,)k(,)])For notational simplicity, let K denote a N×N matrix that contains the kernel computation on each pair of training inputsthat is, K[i,j]=k(i,j)k be a vector of the kernel computation between each training input and the test inputthat is, [i]=k(i,)and k be the self-covariance for xthat is, k=k(,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, let f be a N×1 vector, such that [i]=f(i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above equation can be written as:[f()]N(,[Kk])Since f and f() are jointly Gaussian, one can make use of the well-known Gaussian identity (43) for the conditional distribution of f()that is:f()|N(K1,kK1)[S2]We assume that the observed poverty for the ith commune, yi, is equal to the sum of the linear term, the latent function value, with zero mean GP prior, and an independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise (N(0,n2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the prior on the observed data will be:[yi]=icov[yi,yj]=k(i,j)+ijn2where ij is the Kronecker delta, such that ij=1, if (i=j), and 0 otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the entire training dataset:[]=cov[]=K+n2Iwhere b is a N length vector, such that [i]=i, and I is the N×N identity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The joint distribution of y and f() can be written as:[f()]N([],[K+N2Ikkk])Using the conditional Gaussian result, similar to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, and noting the relation between y and f() from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the conditional distribution for the prediction y becomes:[y]=+(K+n2I)1()var[y]=k(K+n2I)1+n2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimating_Moments_of_a_Mixture_Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let random variable y represent a mixture of two unimodal normal distributions, y1N(1,12) and y2N(2,22) and mixing probabilities w1 and w2, such that w1+w2=1that is:y=w1y1+w2y2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Any moment of y can be computed as (44):[yk]=w1[y1k]+w2[y2k]which directly gives:[y]=w11+w22The expression for the variance of y can be derived as follows:var[y]=[y2]([y])2=w1[y12]+w2[y22](w11+w22)2=w1(var[y1]+12)+w2(var[y1]+12)(w11+w22)2=w112+w222+w112+w222w1212w22222w1w212=w112+w222+w1w212+w1w2122w1w212=w112+w222+w1w2(12)2The last result makes use of the fact that w1+w2=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interpretation_of_WeightsAlong_the_Dimensions_of_Poverty  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This section complements Dimensions of PovertyInterpretation of Weights and refers to Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interpretations are given for information purposes and are by no means indicators of causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several features related to the presence of water in the commune (water bodies, water, mudflat soil, hydro-morphic soil, and elevation) are positively correlated with water deprivation, although the opposite is observed for the other dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One interpretation is that natural nonportable water would be used for drinking in these areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, access to water is needed for irrigated agriculture, watering livestock, or fishing, all of which can increase income and life quality, which explains the negative relationship for the other dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the distance to a water tower is not quite correlated with this deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the proximity to a water forage would have probably been a more interesting feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The food security (access) features (like distance to main roads and urban centers) are also prominent, stressing their importance for development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Millet price has a mixed behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the dimensions, its coefficient is sometimes positive and sometimes negative, without any evident explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of temperature is clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher the maximum temperature and the range, the higher the poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature plays a role in crop growth, but it also impacts the environment quality of the people who live in warm (and cold during the night) areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of precipitation is less obvious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount and the period of rainfall affects the availability of water, which is the main limiting factor in Sahel for crop and forage production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitation seasonality, described by the period during which the water is available, and the precipitation of the warmest quarter (critical period) are logically negatively correlated with poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the annual precipitation and the precipitation of the wettest month and quarter have a positive coefficient (except for education deprivation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the more it rains in an area, the poorer it is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intuition would have been that it was the opposite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But looking more closely, it appears that several features related to agriculture (groundnut production, cassava production, rain-fed croplands) show the same patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret that these features define a suitable environment for agricultural areas, which itself is linked to the presence of a rural community tending more to poverty than the urban population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The technological advances over the past decade have led to building of communication devices (like phones) and sensors (like satellites and weather and ground sensors) that produce and store a myriad of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we show how these novel sources of data, which are characterized by their volume, variety, and associated uncertainty, can be used to generate accurate poverty maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We outline several challenges that lie in establishing relationships between auxiliary data sources (that are not collected to directly measure socioeconomic deprivations) and poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first challenge occurs due to the varying spatial granularity at which the different datasets are available; this requires an aggregation mechanism to link them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDR data are available for each subscriber, while environmental data have mixed spatial resolution, from very accurate vector data to low-resolution satellite imagery (1 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, census data are available for individuals or households, depending on the response variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that the individual information is anonymized for both CDRs and census data, there is no obvious way to link the records across these two datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we localize the individuals and/or households to their respective communes, or urban centers, by using their census information (details in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lets us calculate the commune-level deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CDRs, the individuals are localized to their home antennas based on their most frequent night location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CDR and environmental data are aggregated to commune levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though we have taken a commune as the level of aggregation, the framework allows for the same analysis at even finer spatial resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key concern associated with using CDR data for population-level analyses is the selection bias arising from mobile phone ownership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Senegal, however, there were 92.93 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2013, which implies that most of the population owns cell phones (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second challenge is the bias arising when using data from only one provider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the provider of the data used here, Sonatel, had nearly 62% of the cell phone market in 2013 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third concern is that some demographic subgroups like children and the ultra poor are left out by the analysis while only using CDR data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, results may be biased toward urban regions, rather than rural regions, because of factors like lack of electricity in rural areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we used two distinct types of environment data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first type includes static natural/physical environment variables (like elevation, soil types, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or long-term dynamic phenomena (like climate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second type includes human-induced aspects, like urban areas, roads, access to facilities, and so forth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though the natural environment acts as a constraint in designing poverty eradication plans, effective policies and sustainable approaches should be made an integral part of policy planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental features derived from satellite images (nighttime lights, NDVI, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have the potential to be computed in near real-time to monitor the impact of shocks such as natural hazards, armed conflicts, or crop pests that can rapidly cause serious deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for reliability, these variables need to be aggregated for a longer period, typically at an annual level for nighttime lights and for the growing season for NDVI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, which are used to map facilities and roads, are crowd-sourced and therefore have the (theoretical) potential to be updated in near real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This capability could be limited in African countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the above constraints, 1 y is probably the relevant period for consistent monitoring of poverty with our method (compare with 35 y for a detailed and costly census).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another challenge is the ease of availability of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental datasets are available to researchers for free and typically have no privacy constraints, especially at the resolution at which it is analyzed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDR data are collected by commercial telecommunication entities and might suffer from lack of accessibility to researchers due to sharing constraints between different organizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our methodology requires no raw data to be shared between different data-owning entities; only the output predictions from each individual model and the associated uncertainties are combined at the final step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important consideration is the number of features extracted from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work (20) has used four featuresnamely, call volume and mobile ownership per capita, nightlights, and population densityto estimate the MPI of sectors in Rwanda using a linear regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a baseline for our model, we used the same features and model to predict MPI values at the commune level in Senegal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spatially cross-validated Pearsons correlation of 0.84 was achieved with a significant P value (less_than0.0001) (see Table S8 for comparison).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although less features provide computational tractability of analysis, they offer no insight into other features that could be useful in understanding poverty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, linear models are limited in their ability by the linearity assumption and sensitivity to outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important advantage of our GPR model is that each predicted poverty value is associated with an uncertainty (generated by the model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the strength of confidence in the predictions and can be used as guidance by policy makers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing these source-specific uncertainties can reveal which data hold a better signal for a specific prediction (see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that for predicting A, the predictions of CDRs and environment data are comparable for most of the communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For predicting H, CDRs perform with lower uncertainties than environmental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variations may be attributed to multiple reasons, including resolution and concurrency of data, demographics and mobile penetration of the cellular provider, and spatial heterogeneity of poverty deprivations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Though we have discussed the methodology for predictions at the commune level, our predictions of MPI and associated dimensions can be successfully aggregated to coarser administrative units, if needed, for policy planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we use global MPI as the poverty index, its limitations, as noted by global MPI researchers (26), are applicable to our study as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, global MPI does not include characteristics such as parents education, social norms and beliefs, empowerment, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, it will be interesting to see how well this methodology can be used to predict other indicators of deprivation and inequality, like the GINI index, at the microregional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from being useful in producing interim statistics in between long cycles of census and surveys, such methodology can also be extended to places of conflict or remote areas that are difficult to reach by census takers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in the results, the interpretation of the model coefficients provides some insights on the dimensions of MPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the number of variables, this interpretation is still complex and not necessarily straightforward for policy intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the MPI dimensions are well-known factors for which policy planning is feasible (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an illustration, Fig S4 shows the highest predicted deprivation for each commune within each dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, though GPR model uncertainty is impacted by the bias and inaccuracy of each data source (quality of soil type map, interpolation of climatic data, missing facilities, mobile operators market share), a higher resolution and accuracy of the input data should benefit the modeling relevance and quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Target_Country  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Senegal is a sub-Saharan country that ranks 170 on the Human Development Index with a score of 0.466 and a population of 14.5 million (with 43.5% urban population) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As one of the poorest countries in the world, it has 52% of the population living in multidimensional poverty (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, there are 98.8 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senegal is composed of 14 coarsest administrative units called regions, which are further divided into 45 administrative units called departments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finest level of administrative units is called a commune.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 552 communes (121 as urban centers and 431 rural) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Model_Training  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unknown parameters of each source-specific model in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 are as follows: the parameter  of the linear component, the hyperparameters of the kernel function ,s,f2, and the variance of the error term n2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are estimated by maximizing the marginalized likelihood of the target poverty values in the training data y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marginalized likelihood is obtained by taking the integral of the likelihood times the prior:p(|)=p(|f,X)p(|)d[11]where the matrix X contains the training input vectors as rows and f is a vector containing the latent function values for the inputs in X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GP prior means that p(|)N(,K) and the likelihood is a Gaussianthat is, p(|,)N(+,n2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 yields the following marginalized log likelihood (15) of the training data:logp(|)=12()(K+n2I)1()12log|K+n2I|N2log2[12]where N is the number of training examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To regularize the coefficients in , we apply elastic net regularization on the marginalized log likelihood to obtain the following objective function:J(,,s,n2,f2)=logp(|)(22+(1)||)[13]The function J is maximized to estimate the hyperparameters using conjugate gradient descent (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Regularization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regularization techniques, such as those used in Lasso (38) or Ridge regression (39), are often used to improve model performance, especially when the data contain several irrelevant features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The L2 penalty, imposed by Ridge regression, ensures shrinkage of regression coefficients to avoid overfitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the L1 penalty imposed by Lasso forces the coefficients to be sparse, thereby providing feature selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither of the two regularization methods have been found to universally dominate the other (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, in the presence of groups of correlated features, Lasso tends to select only one feature within each group, which leads to poor interpretability of the estimated coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elastic net regularization (17) is a weighted addition of L1 and L2 penalties and combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known to select a greater number of influential features than Lasso and has a lower false-positive rate than ridge regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used elastic net regularization to penalize complexity of the solution and to avoid overfitting on the limited training dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic net penalty is computed as:22+(1)||[14]Our empirical results show that elastic net regularization results in better prediction accuracy, compared with ordinary least squares, Ridge, and Lasso regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This section details the steps followed to validate our model, namely creating commune-level poverty statistics from census data and methodology for spatial CV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Understanding_Model_Uncertainty  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predictive variance associated with the GP model, as calculated using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, indicates the model uncertainty for a test target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance does not depend on the observed target values, only on the inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance at a given test commune is directly related to how many similar communes (in terms of the CDR, environmental, and spatial features) are available in the training data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, if the predictive variance is high for a given test commune, it would mean that the relative density of the training feature vectors in proximity of the feature vector corresponding to the test commune is low, and hence the GP model will yield a higher predictive variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain the higher variance for MPI predictions observed for rural communes compared with urban communes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
