Superresolved multiphoton microscopy with spatial frequency-modulated imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superresolution microscopy is indispensable in biological sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of superresolution imaging techniques exploit real energetic states of fluorescent molecules to break the diffraction limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, superresolved imaging of second- and third-harmonic generation has been limited to specific sample preparations where the polarization state of the excitation laser can be manipulated to overcome the diffraction limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a method for multiphoton superresolved imaging that does not place such restrictions on the sample and allows for simultaneous superresolved imaging of both coherent and incoherent signal light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with single-element detection, this technique may allow for significant advances in multimodal multiphoton imaging of highly scattering biological tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superresolved far-field microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the structure of objects with resolution well below the diffraction limit of light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all superresolution imaging techniques reported to date rely on real energy states of fluorescent molecules to circumvent the diffraction limit, preventing superresolved imaging with contrast mechanisms that occur via virtual energy states, including harmonic generation (HG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a superresolution technique based on spatial frequency-modulated imaging (SPIFI) that permits superresolved nonlinear microscopy with any contrast mechanism and with single-pixel detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show multimodal superresolved images with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) from biological and inorganic media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiphoton SPIFI (MP-SPIFI) provides spatial resolution up to 2 below the diffraction limit, where  is the highest power of the nonlinear intensity response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MP-SPIFI can be used to provide enhanced resolution in optically thin media and may provide a solution for superresolved imaging deep in scattering media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The intensity in the (x,y) plane at the focus of the light sheet for linear (A) and second-order nonlinear (B) excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-dimensional line-outs of the intensity at y=0 are shown in C and D, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier transforms of the 1D intensities in C and D are shown in E and F, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Fourier transform of the 1D intensity for =2 reveals harmonics up to 4fx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded gray areas represent the spatial frequency region for conventional imaging with coherent illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MP-SPIFI system configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) System schematics in the (x,z) (A) and (y,z) (B) planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-dependent angle in the mask region, 1,2(t), depends on the instantaneous lateral frequency experienced by the line focus 1,2(t)=sin1[fx(t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The SPIFI modulation mask with k = 2/mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) The spatial distribution of diffracted beams in the pupil plane, computed using the parameters of the imaging system used in this work ( = 1,064 nm, NA = 0.8, tube lens focal length of 150 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back aperture diameter was computed using the magnification of the objective lens, Mo, and the design tube lens focal length Ft = 164.5 mm (Zeiss UIS series) with the expression d=2FtNA/Mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color gradients on each beam indicate the relative intensity of each beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the beam is Gaussian in intensity profile on the mask, the line cursors scanning in the pupil plane are Gaussian in intensity profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MP-SPIFI provides increased lateral spatial frequency support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The average of 1,000 temporal measurements of SHG from a 200-nm-diameter BTO particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each temporal scan was collected at 31.6 Hz for a total acquisition time of 31.6 s. Note that there is no DC offset S0 (t) because the amplifier was set to AC coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) A Fourier transform of the mean signal with respect to scan time reveals each MP-SPIFI image encoded at a different carrier frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The complex temporal trace, Sq+(t), was recovered for each SPIFI order by digitally filtering each harmonic in the modulation frequency domain with a square window, as shown in B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain S+(t), the digital filter was set to retain all four image orders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All five complex traces were demodulated such that the fundamental carrier frequency is 2 kHz as opposed to 52 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Experimental MTFs for each MP-SPIFI image measured from a 100-nm-diameter FND.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qth-order image spans the spatial frequency range [qfx,c,qfx,c].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) PSFs for each MP-SPIFI order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial resolution computed from each PSF are listed in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FND data were collected with the same temporal acquisition parameters as the SHG measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Raleigh resolution criterion was used to benchmark the spatial resolution from the PSFs shown in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left graph shows two copies of the simulated PSF for the first-order (q=1) MP-SPIFI image, computed with the vector-focusing model described in the Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raleigh resolution is defined as the distance that a copy of the PSF must be shifted in order for its peak to coincide with a zero in the unshifted PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the measured PSFs data, the shot noise background makes it difficult to interpret where the first zero of the PSF is located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of directly detecting this zero, we fit a Gaussian profile to the measured PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ideal case of a uniform MTF, the measured PSF would be proportional to |sinc(x)|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the MTF is neither uniform, nor is it a Gaussian, so fitting a sinc(x) or a Gaussian to the PSF results in deviations from the measured PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fit is shown explicitly in the right graph, where we have fit both a Gaussian and a |sinc(x)| to the simulated PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that for the numerically simulated PSF, the half-width at 10.4% of the maximum of the Gaussian profile corresponds to the first zero in the computed PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this metric to compute the spatial resolution of our experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TPEF and SHG images collected from biological media with MP-SPIFI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) First-order (A) and second-order (B) MP-SPIFI images of TPEF from a mitotic HeLa cell immunostained with primary antibodies against alpha tubulin and secondary antibodies tagged with Alexa 546.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar: 3 m.) (CF) First- through fourth-order images of SHG from fixed, 16-m-thick rabbit tendon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar: 10 m.) All images were collected at 0.8 NA with laser pulses centered at 1,065 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPEF was collected in the epidirection and SHG was collected in the forward-scattered direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both datasets were captured at 31.6 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HeLa image is the average of 41 images for a total collection time of 58.4 s, whereas the images of rabbit tendon are averages formed from 1,000 images for a total collection time of 665 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multimodal superresolved images of SHG and PL from CdTe solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (AD) First- through fourth-order SHG images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (EH) Corresponding PL images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images presented here are averages of 500 images acquired at 31.6 Hz for a total acquisition time of 1,282 s. (Scale bar: 10 m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The illumination intensity pattern at two snapshots in time, t1 (A) and t2 (B), during a single temporal scan of the MP-SPIFI signal, S(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left column shows the intensity at the rear pupil of the objective lens, where the white circle represents the pupil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second column displays the illumination intensity in the focal plane of the objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The illumination intensity for both linear and second-order nonlinear contrast generation are shown for each snapshot in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third column displays the intensity along the x axis in the object plane, as indicated by the dashed lines in the second column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the fourth column shows the FFT of the 1D intensity line-outs, where the gray boxes represent the passband of the illumination objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the amplitude information in the frequency domain is symmetric about fx=0, but we display only the positive spatial frequencies to save space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spacing between the j=±1 beams and the j=0 beam dictates the fundamental spatial frequency of the illumination intensity in the object plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time t1, the j=±1 beams are relatively close to the j=0 beam in the pupil plane, and the resulting intensity in the object plane has a low spatial frequency, fx(t1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time t2, the j=±1 beams are separated from the j=0 beam by twice the distance as at time t1, thereby producing an intensity pattern with twice the spatial frequency, fx(t2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The illumination intensities in the focal plane (second column) were computed using the Debye formalism outlined in the Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulated energy transmission of the diffracted orders through the objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative energies are normalized by the total transmitted energy at scan time t = 0, when both diffracted orders are overlaid in the lateral dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vertical spatial frequency support vs. scan time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) At zero scan time, the diffracted beams and the undiffracted beam fill the objective lens pupil in the vertical dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the focal plane, the width of the light sheet in the vertical dimension is diffraction limited for both the diffracted and undiffracted beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) At higher scan times, when the diffracted order approaches the maximum spatial frequency supported by the lens in the horizontal dimension, the vertical spatial frequency content is significantly reduced by the circular pupil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the j=1 light sheet does not focus as tightly in the vertical dimension as the j = 0 light sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apodization reduces the intensity of the diffracted beam in the focal plane, thus reducing the contrast of the illumination intensity fringes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width of the light sheet changes with scan time and varies slightly for x-polarized (C) and y-polarized (D) input light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depolarization of linearly polarized input electric fields vs. scan time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polarization state in the pupil plane was aligned in the x direction (A) and y direction (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization of the first diffracted order (j=1) is shown by plotting the ratio of the intensities in each spatial dimension to the intensity of the input polarization state for the zero order beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization at high spatial frequencies causes a reduction in the contrast of the illumination intensity, which can reduce the SNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the MTF in multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy and 2P-SPIFI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded gray regions indicate the frequency support for two- and three-photon laser-scanning microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines indicate the frequency support in 2P-SPIFI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All OTFs were computed with the Debye integral using =1,065nm and 0.8 NA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SPIFI_Microscope  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The microscope system was illuminated by pulses from a nonlinear fiber amplifier centered at 1,065 nm (36), seeded by an all-normal dispersion fiber oscillator using Yb-doped gain fiber (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal compression in a folded Martinez compressor resulted in near transform-limited durations of 150 fs at an average power ranging from 900 mW to 1.3 W and a repetition rate of 52.5 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam from the laser was collimated and expanded to a beam size of 8.85 mm (full-width at half-maximum of the intensity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam was brought to a line focus on the modulation mask with an achromatic cylindrical lens (ACY-254-150-B; ThorLabs) oriented such that the beam is focused in the vertical (y) direction only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mask plane was reimaged to the object plane in two stages, first with a 1:1 image relay system composed of two achromatic lenses (AC254-100-C-ML; ThorLabs) in a 4-f configuration and again with an image relay system consisting of a tube lens (AC254-150-C-ML; ThorLabs) and an infinity-corrected objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented in this work were collected with a 0.8-NA objective lens (N-Achroplan 50×/0.8 NA Pol; Zeiss), such that the mask is imaged to the object region with de-magnification of 46.5×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPIFI modulation mask was described in previous work (25, 26) and consists of a pattern defined in polar coordinates by the expression m(r,)=1/2+1/2sgn[cos(kr)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation mask used in this work had a density parameter k = 70/mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imperfections in disk mounting lead to an additional phase accumulated in S(t) as a function of mask rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process used to remove disk aberration phase has been discussed at length in a previous study (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All images collected in the epidirection used a long-pass dichroic beam-splitter placed between the tube lens and the objective lens (FF875-Di01; Semrock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent light from the HeLa specimen was collected in the epidirection through a short-pass filter (FF720/SP; Semrock) and a 500-nm long-pass filter (ET500lp; Chroma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples used for point spread function measurements were 200-nm BaTi03 particles (1148DY; Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials) for SHG and 100-nm FNDs (ND-400NV-100nm-10mL; Adamas Nanotechnologies) for TPEF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases the insoluble nanoparticles, suspended in water, were diluted, disaggregated in an ultrasonic bath, drop cast onto a microscope slide, and cover-slipped after the water had evaporated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and fixed when they reached 70% confluency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were rinsed rapidly with 37 °C 1× PHEM buffer (60 mM Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0), followed by lysis at 37 °C for 5 min in freshly prepared lysis buffer (1× PHEM plus 0.5% Triton X-100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then fixed on the bench top for 3 min using ice-cold methanol (95% methanol plus 5 mM EGTA), followed by an additional 20 min of methanol fixation at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At room temperature, cells were then rehydrated with 1× PHEM, then rinsed 3× 5 min in PHEM-T (1× PHEM plus 0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked in 10% (vol/vol) boiled donkey serum (BDS) in PHEM for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microtubules were labeled with anti-alpha tubulin primary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 5% (vol/vol) BDS for 12 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following primary antibody incubation, cells were rinsed 3× 5 min in PHEM-T and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 546 (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then rinsed 3× 5 min in PHEM-T, incubated in a solution of 2 ng/mL 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) diluted in PHEM, rinsed again (3× 5 min), and then mounted onto microscope slides in an anti-fade solution containing 90% (vol/vol) glycerol and 0.5% N-propyl gallate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coverslips were sealed with nail polish to affix them to the slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polycrystalline, large-grained CdTe sample was grown by close-spaced sublimation (CSS), treated with CdCl2, and polished, effectively sealing small grains (2 m) after growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was polished using an ion beam technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data analysis was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each 1D line image was reconstructed by computing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the measured temporal data S(t) to obtain the MP-SPIFI images in the modulation frequency domain, i.e., S(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each MP-SPIFI order was recovered by numerically filtering at the positive carrier frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filtered data, Sq(t), was inverse transformed to obtain Sq+(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex temporal trace was then demodulated by the relative carrier frequency, qc, and the temporal axis was calibrated according to the relation fx,2(t)=qt to obtain Sq+(fx,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling coefficient  between modulation frequency and space was calibrated by measuring light transmitted through a 2-m slit in the object plane as a function of lateral position (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centroid of the measured distribution was computed as a function of lateral position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement allowed the quantity describing the relationship between lateral position and carrier frequency to be recovered empirically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


I_MP-SPIFI_in_One_Spatial_Dimension  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed in the main text, images are formed in the SPIFI microscope by projecting illumination intensity patterns into the specimen and collecting signal light emitted from the object on a single-element detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The illumination intensity is formed by the spatial interference of multiple light sheets propagating at varied angles with respect to the optic axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density (spatial frequency) of the interference fringes in the illumination intensity is precisely controlled by use of a circular glass disk on which is printed an amplitude modulation mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spatially coherent illumination beam is brought to a line focus on the modulation mask, and the mask plane is then imaged to the object region with a tube lens and an objective lens (compare Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During a single rotation of the disk, the fundamental spatial frequency of the interference fringes is varied through the entire range of spatial frequencies supported by the image relay system (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the disk rotates, the signal light, which is generated by the interaction of the illumination intensity and the distribution of molecules in the object, is collected on a single-element detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal signal measured from the photodetector is expressed by integrating the contrast light over all space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in the main text, we only consider the case where the contrast intensity depends on an integer power of the illumination intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast signal, (x,t), is then the product of the illumination intensity pattern raised to the power of the nonlinearity, , and the contrast distribution function, C(x,t), which describes how the contrast-producing molecules within the object are spatially distributed as a function of time:S(t)=dx(x,t)=[I(x,t)]C(x,t)x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The signal measured from the photodetector, S(t), represents the projection of the object spatial frequency content onto the spatial frequencies of the illumination structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a given scan time, ts, the principle spatial frequency projected onto the object is fx(ts), and S(ts) encodes the relative amplitude of fx(ts) in the object.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole temporal signal S(t) thereby encodes a 1D image of the object in the spatial frequency domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we wish to derive the form of the signal from the photodetector, S(t), for a second-order multiphoton process, such as SHG and TPEF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ignoring polarization effects and assuming a static contrast function, the signal light is then (x,t)=I2(x,t)C(x), where C(x)=|(2)(x)|2 for SHG and where (2)(x) is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor for the molecules in the specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TPEF, C(x) describes the spatial distribution of fluorescent molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases we have absorbed proportionality constants such as two-photon cross-section into C(x) for simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the illumination beam is spatially coherent, the modulation mask causes the incident light beam to be diffracted into multiple beams propagating at differing angles with respect to the optic axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the amplitude modulation masks used in this work are binary, and thus have numerous diffracted orders occurring at odd-order harmonics, we analyze a system in which only first-order diffraction occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formally, this approximation is equivalent to considering an amplitude modulation mask for which the printing process is not binary but instead can faithfully produce sinusoidal amplitude modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the results of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39 to compute the electric field of each beam in the object region, we computed the 1D spatiotemporal illumination intensity at the focal plane of the illumination light sheet for a second-order nonlinear process:I2(x,t)=[116+32w2(t)+64w4(t)]+[1w(t)+123w3(t)]cos[2fx(t)x+2ct]+[32w2(t)+84w4(t)]cos[4fx(t)x+4ct]+43w3(t)cos[6fx(t)x+6ct]+24w4(t)cos[8fx(t)x+8ct],[S2]where w(t) is the so-called temporal window function, which describes the amplitude of the diffracted beams in the object plane as a function of scan time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, this temporal window function can vary for each of the diffracted beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for a well-aligned system, the temporal window function is identical for both diffracted beams, as we have assumed in the preceding expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assume an imaging system with no aberrations, causing w(t) to be a real-valued function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical prefactors were determined using the diffraction efficiency from a perfect square grating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can write the intensity compactly asI2(x,t)=q=04Hq(t)cos[2qfx(t)x+2qct],[S3]where Hq(t) is determined by the temporal window function and the image order, q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have explicitly written in the carrier frequency, c, which results from the optic axis being aligned at a lateral position xc0, as shown in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral position relative to the center of the modulation mask can be written as x=xc+x, where x is the lateral position relative to the optic axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carrier frequency can then be written as c=(n2/n1)Mkrxc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This analysis can be generalized for an arbitrary integer nonlinearity to find[I(x,t)]=q=02Hq(t)cos[2qfx(t)x+2qct].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]Inserting this expression of the nonlinear illumination intensity into the general form of the MP-SPIFI signal in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, we findS(t)=dxq=02Hq(t)cos[2qfx(t)x+2qvct]C(x)=H0(t)C(0)+12q=12ei2qvctHq(t)C[qfx(t)]+12q=12ei2qvctHq(t)C*[qfx(t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]The contrast function C(x) is real, so it follows that the Fourier transform of the contrast function displays conjugate symmetry in the spatial frequency domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 illustrates how 2 unique images of the object are encoded in the spatial frequency domain with a single rotation of the modulation mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial frequency support of each image varies with harmonic order q, allowing spatial frequency information up to q times the conventional limit to be encoded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, single-shot collection of all images is possible thanks to the carrier frequency that allows for each image to be isolated in the modulation frequency domain by standard Fourier methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can also express the signal measured in time as a function of spatial frequency by noting that spatial frequency is directly proportional to time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we can express the measured image in spatial frequency space for a given order q asSq+(fx)=ei2qctHq(fx)C[qfx]=ei2qfxxcHq(fx)C[qfx].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the illumination fringes shift across the line focus with scan time, a given point in the focal region will experience a modulation frequency that increases with the density of the fringe pattern (Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spatial frequency domain, the carrier frequency simply imparts a linear phase ramp, i.e., qfxxc=qct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, in the spatial domain, which is directly proportional to the modulation frequency domain, all 2 images are separated by a linear shift in x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, we extract the image that is shifted to 2qfxxc:Sq+(fx)=ei2qfxxcHq(fx)C(qfx),[S7]By removing the residual linear phase, which is equivalent to demodulation by the carrier frequency, we can express the qth order image in the spatial domain asSq+(x)=1qhq(qx)C(x).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

II_Limitations_of_Resolution_Enhancement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The circular pupil of the objective lens imposes limitations on the resolution enhancement attainable by apodizing the OTFs for each SPIFI order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apodization is intuitively understood by observing that the shape of each diffracted beam in the pupil plane is highly elliptical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each of the diffracted beams scans laterally across the x dimension of the pupil (Movie S2), the vertical spatial frequency support and the throughput energy of the diffracted beams varies with scan time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these effects cause a reduction in the peak intensity in the object plane and impose strict limitations on the spatial frequency support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a time-dependent depolarization of the diffracted beams leads to further reductions in the contrast of the illumination fringes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following sections, we describe the numerical models we used to compute the theoretical MTFs for each MP-SPIFI order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Energy_Transmission_vs_Scan_Time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We computed the energy transmission as a function of scan time by numerically integrating the amplitude of the diffracted fields over the circular pupil of the objective lens:ej(t)=02d0dsinPj(,,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]Here, Pj(,,t) is the time-dependent pupil function, describing the distribution of the electric field amplitude in the pupil plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative energy transmission curves are shown in Fig S4, where it is clear that the diffracted modes (j = 1) contribute less to the overall energy of the illumination intensity as the beam traverses the pupil of the objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B_Vignetting_of_Diffracted_Illumination_Beams  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The circular pupil of the objective lens reduces the amplitude of high spatial frequencies in measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the fourth-order MP-SPIFI image is formed by the second-order nonlinear response of the intensity pattern created by interference between the two diffracted beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the notation of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39, we can write the fourth-order component of the illumination intensity as a product of the electric fields, v±1(x,t), and their conjugates, u±1(x,t):S4(t)=I4(x,t)C(x,t)r=[v1(x,t)u1(x,t)]2C(x,t)x+[v1(x,t)u1(x,t)]2C(x,t)x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]As the two diffracted beams scan off the optic axis of the imaging system, vignetting by the circular pupil of the objective lens causes a loss of the vertical spatial frequency support, fy, which is responsible for a further decrease in the peak intensity in the object region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied the effect of vignetting on lateral spatial frequency support by computing the illumination intensity in the object region with the angular spectrum representation (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute S(t), we must compute the illumination intensity in the object region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vectorial electric field of each diffracted beam in the object region isvj,2(r,t)=vx,j,2(r,t)x+vy,j,2(r,t)y+vz,j,2(r,t)z,[S11]and the illumination intensity becomesIill(r,t)=k=NNj=NNvj,2(r,t)uk,2(r,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]The measured MP-SPIFI signal is thenS(t)=[k=NNj=NNvj,2(r,t)uk,2(r,t)]C(r,t)r.[S13]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain the illumination intensity at the focal plane, the Debye integral must be solved numerically for each diffracted order:(vx,j,2(r,t)vy,j,2(r,t)vz,j,2(r,t))=02d0dsinPj(,,t)(coscoscos()+sinsin()sincoscos()cossin()sincos())×n1n2cosexp(ik2zcos)exp[ik2sincos()].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S14]We assume linearly polarized light, with the angle  representing the angle of the polarization vector with respect to x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variable  is the azimuthal angle in the pupil plane of the objective lens, measured with respect to x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Cartesian coordinates, the pupil function has the form of a 2D Gaussian distribution:Pj(xp,yp,t)=ajexp{[xpx0,j(t)wx]2}exp{[ypy0,j(t)wy]2},[S15]where (xp,yp) are coordinates in the pupil plane, x0,j(t) and y0,j(t) are the lateral and vertical shifts of the jth diffracted order in the pupil plane, and wx and wy are the widths of the Gaussian distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To solve the integral equation in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S14, the pupil function must be converted to spherical polar coordinates, (Fo,,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the radial coordinate is equivalent to the focal length of the objective lens because the pupil function is to be described on the surface of an aplanatic focal sphere (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the coordinate change, we findxp=F0sincos[S16]yp=F0sinsin,[S17]and the pupil function in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S15 becomesPj(,,t)=ajexp{[Fosincosx0,j(t)wx]2}exp{[Fosinsiny0,j(t)wy]2}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S18]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lateral shifts of the diffracted orders in the pupil plane are determined by the spatial frequency of the modulation mask as a function of scan time, the wavelength of the illumination light, and the focal length of the tube lens (39):x0,j(t)=Ftjn1fx,1(t)=Ftjn1krt=jx0,1(t)[S19]y0,j=Ftjn1fy,1=Ftjkk1=jy0,1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S20]The widths of the distributions are set by the focal lengths of the cylindrical and tube lenses, as well as the input beam size, win, and the illumination wavelength:wx=Ftwin[S21]wy=FtFcwin,[S22]where Fc is the focal length of the cylindrical lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We computed the illumination intensity in the transverse plane located in the focus of the illumination objective (z=0) for several scan times, considering only the j=0 and j=±1 beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig S5, it is clear that as the first-order diffracted beams scan away from the optic axis in the lateral (x) dimension, the vertical spatial frequency support decreases and causes a corresponding broadening of the illumination beams in the vertical dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the vector-focusing formalism was used to compute the OTF of each MP-SPIFI order using the parameters of the microscope described in Materials and Methods ( = 1,064 nm; k= 70/mm; 150-mm focal length tube lens; 50×/0.8 NA Zeiss air-immersion UIS series objective lens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute the MP-SPIFI signal, we assumed a point emitter located at the focal point of the objective lens, r0=(0,0,0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The point emitter was modeled by a Dirac- distribution, (rr0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the contrast distribution we consider is a delta function, we need only compute the intensity at r0 to obtain the MP-SPIFI signal:S(t)=[Iill(r,t)]2(rr0)r=[Iill(r0,t)]2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S23]For the simulated TP-SPIFI data presented in Fig 5, we considered a second-order nonlinearity (=2) and included only first-order diffraction from the modulation mask, where a0=1/2 and a1=1/ were set by the diffraction efficiency of a square grating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
