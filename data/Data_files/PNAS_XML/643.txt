Molecular interactions and inhibition of the staphylococcal biofilm-forming protein SdrC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus shows a remarkable ability to aggregate, thereby contributing to the formation of cellular communities that are difficult to eradicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we dissect the homophilic interactions at play during S. aureus cellcell adhesion, focusing on the key surface protein SdrC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that SdrC is engaged in low-affinity homophilic bonds that promote intercellular adhesion, and that it also favors strong hydrophobic interactions with surfaces, emphasizing that this protein is a multifunctional adhesin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that SdrC-dependent cell-surface attachment, cellcell adhesion, and biofilm formation can be efficiently blocked by a peptide, thus suggesting this approach could be used for antibiofilm therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Staphylococcus aureus forms biofilms on indwelling medical devices using a variety of cell-surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is growing evidence that specific homophilic interactions between these proteins represent an important mechanism of cell accumulation during biofilm formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well-understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the direct measurement of homophilic binding forces by the serine-aspartate repeat protein SdrC and their inhibition by a peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using single-cell and single-molecule force measurements, we find that SdrC is engaged in low-affinity homophilic bonds that promote cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-affinity intercellular adhesion may play a role in favoring biofilm dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that SdrC also mediates strong cellular interactions with hydrophobic surfaces, which are likely to be involved in the initial attachment to biomaterials, the first stage of biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate that a peptide derived from -neurexin is a powerful competitive inhibitor capable of efficiently blocking surface attachment, homophilic adhesion, and biofilm accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular modeling suggests that this blocking activity may originate from binding of the peptide to a sequence of SdrC involved in homophilic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study opens up avenues for understanding the role of homophilic interactions in staphylococcal adhesion, and for the design of new molecules to prevent biofilm formation during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forces_in_SdrC-Mediated_Intercellular_Adhesion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before AFM analysis, we confirmed the involvement of SdrC in intercellular adhesion using a microscale assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical microscopy images showed that L. lactis SdrC(+) cells suspended in buffer formed aggregates, unlike L. lactis SdrC() cells, which were mainly isolated (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that SdrC induces intercellular adhesion (24), and that the protein is properly exposed on the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first investigated the strength of cellcell adhesion by measuring the forces between individual L. lactis SdrC(+) cells using single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) (Fig 1C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2 A and B, most force curves (70%, average from six cell pairs) obtained at short contact time (100 ms) between SdrC(+) cells showed adhesion events with a maximum adhesion force of 98 ± 26 pN and a rupture length of 160 ± 86 nm (n = 2,400 curves from six cell pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mostly single well-defined adhesion events were observed, which suggests they involve the rupture of a small number of molecular bonds that rupture in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion forces increased with increasing the contact time to 1 s (280 ± 113 pN; Fig 2 C and D), indicating that cellcell bonds strengthen with the duration of adhesion (19, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force profiles showed multiple ruptures, unlike the 100-ms curves, which we believe result from the sequential rupture of multiple bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesive interactions were not seen between SdrC() cells (Fig 2 E and F) or between SdrC(+) and SdrC() cells (Fig 2 G and H), thus demonstrating that intercellular adhesion involves SdrC homophilic bonds, that is, bonds formed between adhesins located on opposing cells, rather than proteinligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cellcell separation did not lead to the complete unfolding of the SdrC protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that each amino acid contributes 0.36 nm to the contour length of a fully extended polypeptide chain (27) and that full-length SdrC is 995 amino acids in length (24, 25), the length of two fully extended proteins is expected to be 716 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is much longer than the rupture lengths we observed (160 nm at 100 ms), thus implying that intercellular bonds rupture before complete unfolding of the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the same line, the structurally similar serine-aspartate repeat protein G (SdrG) and fibronectin binding protein A (FnBPA) were not completely unfolded under force, reflecting a high mechanical stability (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Occasionally, some cell pairs displayed sawtooth patterns with periodic peaks and long extensions (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak-to-peak distance was 25 ± 3 nm (n = 74 curves, 900 peaks) in most profiles (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the number of domains nor their lengths match the structure of SdrC, which is made of five larger domains, namely three N subdomains comprising 132, 153, and 162 residues and two B domains of 104 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 25-nm-length increment may result from the unfolding of the homophilic binding region of the N2 subdomain [amino acid sequences RPGSV247251 and VDQYT288292 (24)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the periodic force peaks reflect the rupture of multiple homophilic interactions one by one, in a zipper-like fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral assembly of SdrC on the cell surface may lead to cooperative interactions that enhance cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism is reminiscent of the homophilic cadherincadherin interaction in mammalian cells, where multiple binding contacts between opposing surfaces allow for a greater stability in cellcell interactions (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SdrC-Dependent_Adhesion_Forces_in_a_Methicillin-Resistant_S_aureus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Throughout this study, SdrC interactions were investigated in a model L. lactis strain to avoid any interference from other surface components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pertinent question is whether these forces also contribute to biofilm accumulation by S. aureus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore analyzed cellcell adhesion forces in the clinically relevant MRSA252 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S2 A and B, MRSA252 cells at short contact time (n = 2,400 curves from six cell pairs) featured single well-defined adhesion peaks in about 8% of the curves, with a shape similar to that observed for L. lactis SdrC(+) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intercellular adhesion forces were strongly reduced in MRSA252sdrC mutant cells deficient in SdrC (Fig S2 E and F), indicating they involve SdrC-dependent interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further confirmed by showing that biofilm formation was reduced in the MRSA252sdrC mutant compared with the wild type (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, forces between MRSA252 and MRSA252sdrC cells were also much weaker (Fig S2 G and H), implying that cellcell adhesion in the MRSA252 strain is primarily mediated by homophilic bonds and thus that SdrC hardly binds to other staphylococcal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the contact time increased the adhesion probability to 29% and the adhesion force to 42 ± 16 pN (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesion force and adhesion probability were always much lower for MRSA cells than for L. lactis cells, consistent with the fact that L. lactis can accumulate more SdrC molecules on the cell surface and that there is less interference from other CWA proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, single-molecule experiments, discussed below, reveal that, on average, the adhesion force between MRSA252 cells corresponds to the strength of a single SdrCSdrC bond, whereas the force between L. lactis cells involves two (or three) bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the similar SdrC-dependent forces in the MRSA and L. lactis strains support the validity of our model system and the biological relevance of the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MRSA252 cells did not show the sawtooth force profiles sometimes observed with L. lactis cells, which is likely to result from the lower surface density of SdrC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this observation does not exclude the possibility that zipper-like adhesion will occur in real S. aureus biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it should be kept in mind that AFM measures the forces on localized cellcell contacts, meaning that the probability of detecting zipper interactions will depend on the local protein density and on the complex macromolecular organization of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cellcell interaction times in biofilms can be much longer than in our setup (1 s), thus favoring the formation of zipper-like bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, expression of SdrC can greatly vary depending on the strain and on environmental conditions (stage of infection, growth phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barbu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) found that SdrC expression is stronger during late exponential to stationary phase, and that the ability to block biofilm formation by interfering with SdrC dimerization is strain-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SdrC_Mediates_Strong_Bacterial_Attachment_to_Hydrophobic_Surfaces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SdrC has been shown to promote bacterial adherence to plastic surfaces (24), but whether this is related to the hydrophobicity of the protein is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis that SdrC contributes to hydrophobic interactions with inert surfaces, we measured the forces between L. lactis SdrC(+) cells and hydrophobic, methyl-terminated substrates (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All curves displayed adhesion force events that were remarkably strong, ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 pN depending on the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SdrC largely contributed to these forces, as they were strongly reduced in L. lactis SdrC() cells (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, rupture lengths (412 ± 12 nm, mean and SD of three cells) were close to the length of fully extended SdrC proteins (360 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads us to believe that unlike the weak cellcell interaction, the strong cellsubstrate interaction leads to the complete unfolding of SdrC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that protein unfolding will expose hydrophobic residues [SdrC contains 21% hydrophobic amino acids (24)], thereby strengthening hydrophobic attachment to surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the unfolding force of cellular proteins is typically 200 to 250 pN (27), the large adhesion forces may involve up to 100 adhesins, consistent with their high surface concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also studied bacterial interactions with hydrophilic, hydroxyl-terminated surfaces (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much weaker forces were measured, showing that the strong adhesion forces mostly originate from hydrophobic bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shorter extensions were also observed, which implies that the proteins were not (or only partially) unfolded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SdrC enables strong hydrophobic interactions with abiotic surfaces, which are of biological relevance, as we expect them to play a role in the colonization of inert materials, the first stage of biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes the idea that the protein is a multifunctional adhesin implicated in bacterial adherence to inert surfaces and in cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Details_of_the_SdrC_Homophilic_Bond  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then studied the strength and affinity of single SdrCSdrC bonds, by measuring the forces between recombinant SdrCN2N3 attached to AFM tips and full-length SdrC proteins on SdrC(+) cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantial fraction (28%, from 13 cells) of the force curves recorded across the cell surface featured single well-defined adhesion peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These forces were not detected on SdrC() cells (Fig 4B), thus showing that they reflect specific SdrCSdrC bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesion force histogram revealed a multimodal distribution with a main maximum at 36 ± 16 pN (from 13 cells from 10 independent cultures) followed by smaller maxima at 80, 120, and 160 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This force distribution strongly suggests that the 40-pN binding force corresponds to the interaction strength quantum between two SdrC N2N3 domains, whereas the larger forces would reflect the rupture of multiple interactions in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is directly supported by the fact that the 40-pN unit force matches the mean interaction force measured between two S. aureus MRSA252 cells (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, the 100-pN forces measured between L. lactis SdrC(+) cells involve two or three interacting pairs of SdrC proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our 40-pN force is much weaker than the 2-nN force measured for SdrGfibrinogen bonds (19), indicating that SdrC homophilic adhesion does not involve a high-affinity binding mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such moderate binding strength is in the range of that measured by AFM for cadherin homophilic bonds (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied the affinity of the homophilic bond by measuring the dynamics of the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the dissociation rate, we recorded force curves at various loading rates on six cells from four independent cultures (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the contribution of cell elasticity, the effective loading rate was estimated from the force-versus-time curves (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4C shows that the mean adhesion force (F) increased linearly with the logarithm of the loading rate (r), as observed earlier for homophilic complexes (20, 30, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the slope (f) of the F-versus-ln(r) plot, we estimated the length scale of the energy barrier, x = 0.5 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetic off-rate constant of dissociation at zero force was obtained by extrapolation to zero force, koff = rF=0x/kT = 0.4 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fast off-rate, close to that of homophilic cadherin and FnBPA bonds (20, 30), means that the bond dissociates rapidly, and thus that homophilic adhesion is a dynamic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also estimated the association rate by varying the interaction time while keeping the loading rate constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesion frequency (i.e., number of curves with adhesion events) increased quickly to reach a plateau corresponding to almost 100% after 1 s (Fig 4D; data from five cells from five independent cultures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a fast bond formation was also reported for cadherins (20, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the interaction time needed for half-maximal probability of binding, t0.5 = 240 ms, the association rate constant can be estimated: kon = t0.51NAVeff = 2,690 M1s1, where Veff is the effective volume explored by the tip-tethered protein (approximated here to a half-sphere of radius reff = 8 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this, we deduced the equilibrium dissociation constant: KD = koff/kon = 160 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this value should be taken as an estimate, as the volume explored by the probing tip is not precisely known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our calculation, we considered that this volume is defined by the length of the N2N3 domain, 8 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If extreme values for reff are considered (6 and 10 nm), the resulting KD lies within the limits of 80 to 390 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are clearly higher than that for high-affinity bonds such as the SdrGfibrinogen interaction [0.3 µM (19, 34)], and thus mean that the homophilic SdrC bond has a much lower affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, our dissociation constant is also greater than that estimated recently for SdrC dimerization using a solid-phase binding assay [0.3 M (24)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may reflect limitations of in vitro methods, namely that they require protein expression and purification, and involve protein labeling with biotin and further reaction with avidin probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, AFM directly analyzes fully functional proteins on live cells, thus without purification or labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Peptide_That_Strongly_Blocks_SdrC-Dependent_Adhesion_and_Biofilm_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phage display screening combined with biochemical and cell biology experiments showed that a peptide derived from the host protein -neurexin is a ligand for SdrC and that ligand binding involves the N2N3 subdomains of SdrC (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used in silico methods to generate a molecular model of SdrC N2N3 subdomains based on the crystal structure of the closely related CWA protein Clumping factor A (ClfA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ClfA and SdrC are members of the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) family of CWA proteins of staphylococci, and the crystal structures of six MSCRAMM N2N3 domains solved to date have shown that all adopt a highly similar, characteristic 3D fold (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular docking experiments were carried out to determine a likely binding site for the -neurexinderived peptide (SLGAHHIHHFHGSSKHHS) on the structural model of SdrC (Fig 5A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model suggests that the peptide binds at a site overlapping RPGSV247251, making contact with residues R247, G249, S250, and V251, leading us to postulate that it may interfere with homophilic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of the peptide to interfere with cellcell adhesion forces, using SCFS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5B, we present the probability of cellcell adhesion forces measured upon addition of peptide at increasing concentrations for several cell pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these concentration-dependent plots, we estimate that the concentration required to inhibit 50% of maximum binding, IC50, is in the range of 0.5 to 1 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesion probability was not altered by addition of a scrambled peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our analyses show that the -neurexin peptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of the SdrC homophilic interaction, a behavior that is due to its ability to bind the N2N3 domain of SdrC with high affinity (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also found that addition of the peptide at 2 µM dramatically reduced the mean adhesion force between the cells and hydrophobic surfaces (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we tested whether the peptide inhibitor could prevent SdrC-dependent biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biofilms formed by SdrC(+) bacteria were abolished in the presence of the peptide (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect on biofilm formation was not due to inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the concentration required to inhibit 50% of maximal biofilm formation, IC50, as 0.9 µM (Fig 5D), which is remarkably close to the value estimated for single cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the peptide is capable of inhibiting SdrC-dependent biofilm formation in the MRSA252 strain (Fig S3), thus supporting the biological relevance of our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that a peptide derived from -neurexin is a powerful competitive inhibitor capable of efficiently blocking SdrC-mediated adhesion and biofilm formation raises the possibility that this peptide could be used to prevent biofilm infections by S. aureus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent reports have shown that protein-mediated homophilic interactions are involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm formation by S. aureus, but the molecular details (i.e., strength and affinity) are not well-understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have studied the force and dynamics of single SdrC homophilic interactions in live cells, revealing the important role these bonds play in regulating intercellular adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L. lactis and MRSA252 cells engage in biofilm accumulation through similar SdrC-dependent adhesion forces, supporting a major contribution of SdrC to biofilm formation by S. aureus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our single-cell and single-molecule experiments are unique in that they allow us to study the binding strength and affinity of CWA proteins in their biologically relevant environment and conformation, whereas traditional methods study protein interactions after purification, and often labeling, which can alter protein functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SdrCSdrC bond features a weak binding force (40 pN) and low affinity (160 µM), and involves the SdrC N2N3 subdomains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is very likely that the N2 subdomain plays a central role, as two amino acid sequences located within N2 were previously shown to act cooperatively to promote protein dimerization (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast dynamics of the SdrC interaction could be of biological significance, as it may favor cell detachment and help bacteria to disseminate and colonize new sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between the occurrence of homophilic bonds and the level of microscale cellcell adhesion suggests that these interactions play an important functional role in biofilm accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations are reminiscent of the behavior of another CWA protein, FnBPA, which promotes cell accumulation through low-affinity homophilic interactions between N2N3 domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biofilm formation was not fully inhibited when the sdrC gene was disrupted in MRSA252, which is likely due to the fact that biofilm formation in S. aureus is often a multifactorial process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, SdrC is also engaged in hydrophobic interactions with abiotic surfaces, which result from the high percentage (21%) of hydrophobic residues of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SdrC-dependent hydrophobic forces are much stronger than homophilic forces, and lead to the complete unfolding of the protein upon cell-surface separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, buried hydrophobic amino acids become exposed upon unfolding and strengthen tight attachment to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that, unlike the SdrC homophilic interaction, which is weak and dissociates quickly, the strong hydrophobic interaction will favor irreversible bacterial attachment to biomaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors contribute to the colonization of abiotic surfaces by S. aureus, such as teichoic acids, the autolysin Atl, and surface protein SasC (3537).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the relative contributions of the different cell-wall components in bacterial attachment to surfaces should be revisited, paying more attention to the role of CWA proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results contribute to the accumulating evidence that SdrC is a multifunctional adhesin featuring a variety of molecular interactions that are important for regulating biofilm formation, that is, surface attachment via strong hydrophobic interactions, and cellcell adhesion through weak homophilic bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the medical context, we expect that the contribution of SdrC to biofilm formation will vary, as expression of SdrC depends on the strain and on environmental conditions (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another remarkable finding of this study is a peptide that strongly inhibits SdrC-mediated cellcell adhesion and biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell analyses revealed that it is a powerful competitive inhibitor capable of efficiently blocking SdrC-dependent homophilic adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this view, our molecular docking experiments predicted that the peptide binds to a sequence involved in homophilic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide used here has a sequence corresponding to a SdrC binding site at the N terminus of human neurexin 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed the ability of the peptide to block bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces, suggesting that the N2N3 domain of SdrC is engaged in hydrophobic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological significance of the interaction between SdrC and neurexin 1 is unclear (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the protein is only detected in neuronal tissues, it is unlikely that it acts as a ligand or inhibitor of homophilic SdrC interactions during staphylococcal biofilm infection in the bloodstream or joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SdrC appears to be a potential target for the design of antibiofilm molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live-cell nanoscopy offers promising prospects for screening peptides and small molecules capable of preventing or treating staphylococcal infections by inhibiting protein-dependent intercellular interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L. lactis strain MG1363 carrying the empty plasmid pKS80 [L. lactis SdrC()] or pKS80 with sdrC [L. lactis SdrC(+)] (38) was grown in M17 broth supplemented with d-glucose (5 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich) and erythromycin (10 µg/mL) statically at 30 °C until stationary phase was reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before AFM experiments, cells were harvested by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 3 min) and washed two times in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA cloning and strain construction, production of recombinant proteins, molecular modeling, aggregation and biofilm assays, and AFM methods are described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

DNA encoding the N2 and N3 subdomains of SdrC was amplified by PCR using the primers 5-GGATCGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGATCCGGAACAAATGTTAATGATAAAG-3 and 5-ACAGGAGTCCAAGCTCAGCTAATTAAGCTTTTATTTCTTTTGGTCGCCATTAG-3 and genomic DNA from S. aureus strain Newman as template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR product was cloned into the vector pQE30 using sequence- and ligation-independent cloning as described by Li and Elledge (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting plasmid pQE30::sdrCN2N3 was transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli XL-1 blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid was isolated from XL-1 blue and verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins) before transformation into E. coli Topp3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the sdrC gene in the EMRSA-16 strain MRSA252 (40) to generate MRSA252sdrC was achieved by allelic exchange using the plasmid pIMAY (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA encoding 486 nt of sequence upstream of the sdrC gene was amplified from MRSA252 genomic DNA using the primers A (5-CCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCTCGATCAAATTGTATCTTTTGTG-3) and B (5-CATTTAATAATACTCCTTTAAAATATC-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA encoding 72 nt of the 3 sequence of sdrC and 359 nt of sequence downstream was amplified using the primers C (5-TATTTTAAAGGAGTATTATTAAATGACGTTATTTGGCGGATTATTC-3) and D (5-CGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGAGCTCTATTTTTACATATAAAAATTTGTATTC-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upstream and downstream fragments were joined using splicing by overlap-extension PCR and cloned into pIMAY using sequence- and ligation-independent cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli DC10B and verified by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent MRSA252 cells, and deletion of the sdrC gene was then achieved by allelic replacement as previously described (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRSA252sdrC had an identical growth rate and pattern of hemolysis on sheep blood agar to its parent strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Aggregation phenotypes were directly observed after resuspending the cells in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some experiments, the buffer was supplemented with peptide (SLGAHHIHHFHGSSKHHS) or a scrambled version (IFGHSKHSLASHHGHHSH) (GenScript).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregation levels were observed by optical microscopy at high magnification using an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

L. lactis strains were grown for 16 h in brain-heart infusion broth supplemented with erythromycin (10 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted 1:200 in M17 with d-glucose (5 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diluted cultures of L. lactis SdrC(+) or L. lactis SdrC() (275 L) were added to sterile tissue culture-treated, 96-well polystyrene plates (Nunclon Delta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were incubated statically at 28 °C for 24 h. S. aureus MRSA252 and MRSA252sdrC were grown for 16 h in tryptic soy broth and diluted 1:200 in tryptic soy broth supplemented with d-glucose (10 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diluted cultures (200 L) were added to sterile tissue culture-treated 96-well polystyrene plates (Nunclon Delta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were incubated statically at 37 °C for 24 h. For inhibition experiments, peptide was added to inoculated wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wells were washed three times with PBS and dried by inversion for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biofilm was stained with crystal violet, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Cell_Force_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Colloidal probes were obtained by attaching a single silica microsphere (6.1 µm in diameter; Bangs Laboratories) with a thin layer of UV-curable glue (NOA 63; Norland Edmund Optics) onto triangular tipless cantilevers (NP-O10; Bruker) and using a NanoWizard III AFM System (JPK Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cantilevers were then immersed for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.5) containing 4 mg/mL dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed in tris-buffered saline (pH 8.5), and used directly for cell-probe preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nominal spring constant of the colloidal probe cantilever was 0.06 N/m, as determined by the thermal noise method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 50 µL of a diluted cell suspension was deposited into a Petri dish and 3 mL of PBS was added to the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colloidal probe was brought into contact with an isolated bacterium and retracted to attach the bacterial cell; proper attachment of the cell on the colloidal probe was checked using optical microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure cellcell interaction forces, the cell probe was approached toward a single cell lying on the bottom of the Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cell-substrate measurements, the cell probe was brought into contact with hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates prepared by immersing gold-coated substrates in ethanol solutions containing 1 mM 1-dodecanethiol (Sigma-Aldrich; 98%) or 1 mM 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (Sigma-Aldrich; 97%) overnight, rinsing them with ethanol, and drying them under N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stiffer cantilevers (0.12 N/m) had to be used on hydrophobic surfaces because of the high forces involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force curves were recorded at room temperature using an applied force of 0.25 nN, a constant approachretraction speed of 1.0 µm/s, and a contact time of 100 ms or 1 s. For inhibition experiments, the peptides were added either at 2 µM or at increasing concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using the Data Processing software from JPK Instruments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion force and distance rupture histograms were obtained by calculating the maximum adhesion force and rupture distance of the last peak for each curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Molecule_Force_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant SdrCN2N3 proteins were immobilized onto AFM tips covered with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)terminated self-assembled monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AFM gold-coated cantilevers (OMLC-TR4; Olympus; nominal spring constant of  0.02 N/m) were rinsed in ethanol, cleaned for 15 min by UV-ozone treatment, rinsed in ethanol, and dried with N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clean AFM cantilevers were immersed overnight in a 0.1 mM solution of 90% HS-C11-(EG)3-OH thiols (ProChimia) and 10% HS-C11-(EG)3-NTA thiols (ProChimia) and then rinsed with ethanol, dried with N2, and immersed in a 50 mM aqueous solution of NiSO4 (pH 7.2) for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cantilevers and substrates were then incubated in a 200-L droplet of a solution of SdrCN2N3 protein (100 g/mL) for 1 h, rinsed, and stored in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments were performed at room temperature (20 °C) in PBS buffer using a NanoWizard III AFM System (JPK Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cells were immobilized on polystyrene substrates, and adhesion measurements were obtained by recording 16 × 16 forcedistance curves on areas of 300 by 300 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force curves were recorded at a contact time of either 100 ms or 1 s, with an applied force of 250 pN, and using a constant approach and retraction speed of 1.0 µm/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
