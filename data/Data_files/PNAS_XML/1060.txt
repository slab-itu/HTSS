Modular origins of biological electron transfer chains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are no physical fossils of the original proteins at the beginning of life on Earth and phylogenetic approaches that infer the nature of the ancestral proteins from sequences and/or structures of extant molecules are of limited use over long time scales (e.g., billions of years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the structures of proteins containing transition-metal cofactors, and identified four structural modules that comprise the diverse family of oxidoreductases, molecular nanomachines that are critical for electron transfer reactions that form the energetic basis of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural modules are, in effect, relict building blocks of life that have descended through time with only minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxidoreductases catalyze electron transfer reactions that ultimately provide the energy for life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limited set of ancestral protein-metal modules are presumably the building blocks that evolved into this diverse protein family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the identity of these modules and their path to modern oxidoreductases is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a comparative structural analysis approach, we identify a set of fundamental electron transfer modules that have evolved to form the extant oxidoreductases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using transition metal-containing cofactors as fiducial markers, it is possible to cluster cofactor microenvironments into as few as four major modules: bacterial ferredoxin, cytochrome c, symerythrin, and plastocyanin-type folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From structural alignments, it is challenging to ascertain whether modules evolved from a single common ancestor (homology) or arose by independent convergence on a limited set of structural forms (analogy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional insight into common origins is contained in the spatial adjacency network (SPAN), which is based on proximity of modules in oxidoreductases containing multiple cofactor electron transfer chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron transfer chains within complex modern oxidoreductases likely evolved through repeated duplication and diversification of ancient modular units that arose in the Archean eon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General strategy for probing the modular structure of ETCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metalloprotein structures are decomposed into microenvironments and clustered into a set of modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modules with microenvironments that are close enough to allow electron transfer are connected in the SPAN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPAN provides unique insight into ETC topology and pathways for ETC emergence and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural example comes from nitrate reductase (PDB ID code 1q16) (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identifying_Cofactor_Modules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From 9,500 high-resolution metalloprotein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), 32,000 microenvironments were defined by a 15-Å radius from the metal center, including surrounding amino acids (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term microenvironment is used instead of fold or domain as these units often contain discontinuous elements of sequence and structure, sometimes from multiple chains (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative structural alignments of microenvironments were scored according to a weighted combination of rmsd and alignment length, and subsequently filtered by distance between the centroids of the cofactors defining the microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metal centers serve as fiducial markers to evaluate the quality of the alignment (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of alignment scores versus metal center distances of the alignments show two clearly distinguished populations of structures (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a threshold similarity score of 1.4 as a conservative cutoff to minimize potential false-positive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After clustering, a minimal set of 1,017 unique modules was identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modules may include microenvironments with different types of cofactors or even different metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of cluster sizes followed a power-law dependence (Fig 2B), with half of all microenvironments contained within the 10 most populated modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a power-law distribution is generally observed for protein domain family frequencies across genomes (2123), supporting the premise that a 15-Å cofactor microenvironment captures an evolutionarily relevant functional domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most populous modules are those associated with oxidoreductase functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include bacterial ferredoxin, cytochrome c, symerythrin, and plastocyanin-like folds (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centrality of these four modules to the evolution of ETCs is described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each module is a component within the network of microenvironments connected by structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not imply that every pair of microenvironments within a given module has similarities below the selection threshold; instead, some are connected via a series of intermediate alignments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the module containing the 4Fe4S-binding bacterial ferredoxin motif contains both mixed / and all-helical folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard ()2 topology (24) consists of two microenvironments, one for each iron-sulfur cluster, that form two major subgroups related to their proximity to the N and C termini (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct alignment of these two topologies shows only a minimal two-helix overlapping region that contains six of the eight cysteines required to coordinate clusters (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we identified intermediate forms between the all-helical and ()2 topologies, suggesting these may be evolutionarily related (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although intermediate forms are identified, this analysis alone does not prove a common ancestor for the ferredoxin module; evolutionary relationships based on local structural alignments can be misleading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The all-helical ferredoxin also shows strong similarity to a heme-binding globin fold (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional information beyond structural similarity would be required to determine whether structures are related by homology or analogy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The challenge of identifying evolutionary relationships is evident in the most populated module of the cytochrome c-like fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That module includes structures from small, single-heme proteins to large, multiple cofactor complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network of microenvironments within this component contains three major subgroups interconnected by a small number of edges (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a CXXCH motif-bound heme is common to all microenvironments, the secondary structure elements around the heme vary significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, two very different microenvironments at opposite ends of this module require a minimum of 12 intermediates to be connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intermediates represent significant structural changes that cannot be ascribed to conservative changes in sequence (e.g., point mutations), and might not be detected by sequence-based alignment methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with ferredoxins, intermediates cannot be conclusively interpreted as homologous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such connections may reflect fundamental constraints of metal coordination on local protein structure (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar properties are observed in the plastocyanin and symerythrin network components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modules represent the minimal structural elements required for metal cofactor binding, but vectoral electron transfer requires multiple cofactors, and therefore multiple modules (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand how modules are combined to produce ETCs, we next examined the spatial organization of cofactors in the structural dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SPAN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All proteins containing multiple metallocofactors in the PDB were analyzed to identify pairs of modules where the edge-to-edge distance of the central cofactors was within the 14-Å limit specified by the MoserDutton ruler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produced 8,978 pairs of microenvironments, which were used to construct a spatial adjacency network (SPAN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPAN is essentially a network of networks, where each node is a module containing a network of structurally similar microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPAN contained 93 connected components, with most consisting of two to five modules (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the largest connected component contained 105 modules consisting primarily of microenvironments extracted from oxidoreductases (Fig 4 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Connections between modules in the SPAN are unevenly distributed and deviate significantly from what would be expected for a random graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four major modules (bacterial ferredoxin, cytochrome c, plastocyanin, and symerythrin) comprise the vast majority of connections, consistent with these being from the most populous modules in the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modules are repeatedly utilized across oxidoreductases of diverse function, suggesting their high functional utility in constructing ETCs, reinforcing a model in which modern oxidoreductases arose from modular assembly of reusable cofactor microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately one in five modules in the oxidoreductase SPAN has self-connections, where multiple instances of the same module are adjacent in structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are distributed between microenvironments in either the same or adjacent chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-connections are expected for modules with internal symmetry, such as found in bacterial ferredoxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ferredoxin module consists of a symmetrical pair of microenvironments (24) thought to have arisen through gene duplication (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dramatic examples of this include extended polyferredoxins seen in methanogen carbon fixation enzymes (29) or in the multiheme cytochrome c nanowires capable of long-distance electron transfer (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other self-connections arise from oligomeric self-assembly as in the case of ferritin and multidomain cupredoxins (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of self-connections across the SPAN indicates that duplication is a common strategy for the assembly of multiple cofactor ETCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clustering_of_Cofactor_Type_in_the_SPAN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another feature of the SPAN is the notable clustering of modules with the same metal type: 82% of all edges connect similar cofactor classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is highly unlikely for a random network (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe-Scontaining modules, whether Fe4S4, FeS4, or Fe2S2, are commonly found in spatial proximity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar clustering is seen for porphyrin, copper, mono-iron, and di-iron sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several potential explanations for this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is that spatial proximity is constrained by functional properties of the modules (i.e., redox potential).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redox potential differences across adjacent modules should be energetically compatible to minimize the back-reactions and/or inversions (19, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for Fe-S and hemes, observed redox potentials can span a range of 1 V by changes in first- and second-shell amino acids in the cofactor microenvironment (14, 16, 17, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plausible alternative is that cofactor type is constrained by the complexity associated with the incorporation of different cofactors into a single protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In modern proteomes, metal incorporation is tightly regulated (33, 34), but in early stages of protein evolution, it is highly likely that metal selection was promiscuous (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is also possible that all of the modules containing a similar cofactor originated from a common ancestor, despite having no detectable structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial proximity in the SPAN may be a relic of evolutionary homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the wide variety of Fe-S modules from bacterial and plant-type ferredoxins to rubredoxins may have arisen through duplication and diversification of an Ur-bacterial ferredoxin ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly connected modules in the SPAN may represent ancient cofactor-specific domains that served as last universal common ancestors for the modern family of oxidoreductases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discriminating_Homology_and_Analogy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If spatial proximity in the SPAN is a signal for deep evolutionary homology, then the SPAN may provide useful information in discriminating structural homology from analogy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown earlier, all-helical ferredoxins share only scant structural similarity with the classic ()2 structure (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these two folds are structurally adjacent in the same protein (Fig 6A), supporting a model of duplication and divergence rather than convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, within the cytochrome c module, we identify eight submodules using the Louvain method for community detection in the network (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the SPAN is recalculated for these submodules, two connected components (submodules 1,2 and 38) are observed, suggesting, at minimum, two classes of homologous cytochrome c-type folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining structural similarity and spatial adjacency provides a tool for proposing modes of deep-time evolutionary connections across protein structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that not all connections in the SPAN represent common ancestry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible mechanism for the assembly of ETCs is independent evolution of distinct modules containing multiple cofactor types that subsequently were fused into a single protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modules that bridge well-connected subnetworks within the SPAN are both independent soluble electron carriers and domains fused to ETCs; for example, the rubredoxin and rubredoxin-like modules bridge the major ferredoxin and symerythrin subnetworks (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the connections between ferredoxin and cytochrome c in the SPAN are unlikely due to a common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age_of_the_Core_Modules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The four major modules identified here have also been proposed to be ancient folds by other structural informatics methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ferredoxin-like and cupredoxin-like fold superfamilies were estimated by Dupont et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) to have emerged early in protein evolution, before the Great Oxidation Event ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.42.3 billion y ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edwards and Deane (36) determined ferredoxin to be a pivotal fold at the base of a phylogenetic tree of global structure space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ferredoxin ()2 topology, or plaitfold, is one of 10 superfold structural classes that was proposed to give rise to extant proteins in general (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the age of emergence of ETC modules by combining functional annotations of oxidoreductases with the ages of metabolic pathways inferred from the geological record (4) (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earliest posited metabolisms (hydrogen, sulfur and sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, and anoxygenic photosynthesis) are overwhelmingly dominated by ferredoxin-like folds and other FeS-containing modules (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferredoxin and cytochrome c are the most functionally diverse, found in metabolic pathways present in all stages of the Archean eon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent metabolisms, nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis, use ferredoxin, cytochrome c, and plastocyanin modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symerythrin and plastocyanin modules are largely associated with later Archean metabolisms, which include oxidation or aerobic pathways (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the latter period, the emergence of molecular oxygen depleted soluble Fe in the ocean, necessitating the emergence of iron-storage proteins like ferritin, which belongs to the symerythrin module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metal distribution shows FeS dominating the earliest metabolisms with heme and Cu increasing in prevalence with time (Fig 7B), consistent with the availability of metals as a result of oxygen fugacity (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPAN contains the earliest and most functionally diverse modules at the center, with the peripheral modules evolving later and becoming more specialized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the SPAN recapitulates the expansion of metabolic pathways in the Archean eon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed deep-time evolutionary connections within the oxidoreductase class of enzymes, extending previous sequence-based approaches (6), by considering protein structure similarities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of structure has its own challenges; protein folds do not change linearly with accumulating amino acid substitutions, precluding quantitative estimates of evolutionary distance based on structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In metalloproteins, evolutionary inference is further confounded by strong chemical constraints of metal coordination on the local protein environment, where observed structural similarity between proteins may be a result of convergence on a limited repertoire of metal-binding protein topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with evidence of spatial coincidence in the SPAN, it would be challenging to prove that microenvironments with disparate structure arose from a common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be possible where pathways of intermediate sequences are found in observed genomic and metagenomic data (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite these caveats, a clear pattern emerges in the aggregate analysis of metal environments, where modules of similar metal cofactor types cluster in the SPAN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strongly indicates a small contingent of modular structures were incorporated repeatedly in oxidoreductases across the tree of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergence of complexity derives from two main modes of evolution: (i) gene duplication and diversification and (ii) recruitment and fusion of independent structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basic idea has been proposed for many other systems in biology (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the example of metabolic pathways, two fundamental mechanisms of evolution were proposed: (i) stepwise retrograde evolution (40), where enzymes diversified from a single substrate-product reaction, and (ii) the patchwork model (41, 42), where primordial catalytic functions were fused into specific pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first likely module was ferredoxin, which gave rise to a number of specialized FeS-containing proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independently, cytochrome c, plastocyanin, and symerythrin evolved, giving access to an increased variety of metabolic substrates and redox potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, these electron transfer modules gave rise to a global electrical circuit that is a hallmark of life on Earth (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural_Alignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We generated PDB files of a 15-Å sphere around each transition metal-containing cofactor region (Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Mo, Co, V, and W) from the PDB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 36,787 spheres (i.e., microenvironments) with 46 cofactors (PDB ID codes) that contain one of the above-mentioned transition metals, and have 20 or more entries in the PDB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We filtered out microenvironments from PDB files of de novo designed proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7; Schrödinger, LLC) to perform pairwise alignments of the protein backbone in all of the microenvironments of each cofactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the structural similarities between the microenvironments of different cofactors, we also performed pairwise microenvironment alignments of all of the cofactors from a nonredundant set of protein chains, containing 6,924 microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonredundant set contained only chains with less than 90% sequence similarity generated by PISCES (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dataset S1 is a Microsoft Excel-formatted spreadsheet that provides an annotated list of all microenvironments used in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entries are indexed as follows:(PDB ID).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (cofactor name)_(cofactor chain)_(cofactor residue number)_(functional annotation),(e.g., 4rvy.HEM_f_101_oxidoreductase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Similarity_Score  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the similarity of pairs of microenvironments based on the rmsd of the alignments and the number of C atoms successfully aligned, together with the calculated structural distance (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included the distance between the centroids of the cofactors in the microenvironment alignment (18) in our similarity score calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centroids for cofactors containing multiple ions or organic ligands not contributed by the protein are determined using only the metal ions, excluding auxiliary atoms in the cofactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formula for similarity score is as follows:similarity score=rmsdmaxrmsd+CAmaxCA+cdmaxcd+sdmaxsd,where CA is the number of backbone C atoms successfully aligned, cd is the distance between the centroids of the cofactors, and sd is the structural distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In meaningful alignments, the cofactors were expected to be located at equivalent structural positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distribution of similarity scores versus cofactor distances of the alignments (cd) exhibit a distinct shape, with two clearly distinguished populations of structures (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarity scores between 1.4 and 1.6 were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a more conservative similarity score of 1.4 as the optimal threshold to minimize potential false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold is 2 from the mean similarity score (mean = 4.48, SD = 1.46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clustering_of_Microenvironments_into_Modules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We initially clustered 44,614 microenvironments from all metalloproteins in the PDB as of January 2016 into 1,626 modules based on a similarity score threshold of 1.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each module was a connected component in the network, and represented one consensus structure (i.e., module).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of microenvironments in each module varied between 2 and 2,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we removed modules where all microenvironments were from a single PDB file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final dataset included 31,927 microenvironments from 9,531 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were clustered into 1,017 modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the microenvironments contained Fe [Fe (5,978), heme (9,237), and FeS (3,277)], followed in order of abundance by Mn (6,362), Cu (3,732), Ni (1,462), Co (1,321), Mo (216), W (210), and V (134).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generating_the_SPAN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SPAN constructed by assigning the modules as nodes in this network were connected by edges if at least one microenvironment from each module was located in the same protein (PDB file), where the cofactors are in electron transfer distance range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every additional occurrence was counted to create the weight of that edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used edge-to-edge cofactor distances between 4.5 Å and 14 Å as relevant electron transfer ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum distance of this range was determined to ignore self-connections in multi-ion microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum distance of this range was determined by the observed maximum possible distance for electron tunneling in natural proteins (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2 test was performed to show the statistical significance of the clustering of modules with the same metal type compared with random distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Diversity_of_Modules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We counted how many different EC numbers each module (clusters of microenvironments) contains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial EC numbers were counted only when no other protein from the same class (e.g., 1.7.x.x or 1.x.x.x) was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Core_Microbial_Metabolic_Pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the list of the 392 EC1 homologs identified through a manually refined search of all Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathways directly involved in redox reactions of biogeochemical interest (3) to assign a list of EC numbers of enzymes involved in the core microbial metabolic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then assigned a metabolic pathway to all of the microenvironments of a protein according to its EC number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we assigned a list of pathways that each module was composed of.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further improved this list with a manually refined search of PDBs that are known to be involved in any of the metabolic pathways, and assigned it to the relevant modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Network analysis was performed using the NetworkX library for Python (45) and Gephi 0.9.1 (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Gephi and Cytoscape 3.4.0 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
