Discontinuity of cortical gradients reflects sensory impairment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topographic organization is a key feature of human brain function, from visual, auditory, and somatosensory processing to numerosity and attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How is topography affected in pathological states?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To unravel this mystery, we scanned whole-body topographic representations under functional MRI in two unique patient populations and quantified continuity and signal power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with sensory Brown-Séquard syndrome, only half of the body is impaired, enabling comparison of disturbed and nondisturbed body sides; in patients undergoing surgical repair, we compared topographies before and after intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each individual patient, pathological processing was reflected by discontinuity of topographic maps rather than signal reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight the importance of continuity in topographic organization and may serve as a biomarker for somatosensory pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topographic maps and their continuity constitute a fundamental principle of brain organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the somatosensory system, whole-body sensory impairment may be reflected either in cortical signal reduction or disorganization of the somatotopic map, such as disturbed continuity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigated the role of continuity in pathological states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied whole-body cortical representations in response to continuous sensory stimulation under functional MRI (fMRI) in two unique patient populationspatients with cervical sensory Brown-Séquard syndrome (injury to one side of the spinal cord) and patients before and after surgical repair of cervical disk protrusionenabling us to compare whole-body representations in the same study subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified the spatial gradient of cortical activation and evaluated the divergence from a continuous pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradient continuity was found to be disturbed at the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), in both patient populations: contralateral to the disturbed body side in the Brown-Séquard group and before repair in the surgical group, which was further improved after intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results corresponding to the nondisturbed body side and after surgical repair were comparable with control subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference was found in the fMRI signal power between the different conditions in the two groups, as well as with respect to control subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that decreased sensation in our patients is related to gradient discontinuity rather than signal reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradient continuity may be crucial for somatotopic and other topographical organization, and its disruption may characterize pathological processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five patients with partial Brown-Séquard syndrome due to disk protrusion, manifested as hemihypoesthesia, and four patients with hypoesthesia due to cervical disk protrusion pending surgical repair (Fig S1), as well as age-matched healthy controls, were stimulated with a continuous somatosensory stimulation of their right and left body sides under fMRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We looked for quantitative changes in gradient continuity and signal power between the two hemispheres (in the Brown-Séquard group), before and after surgical repair (in the surgical group) and relative to healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize somatotopic gradients in the S1 and SMA cortices, we first analyzed the continuous stimulation fMRI data using cross-correlation analysis over 12 different lag-values, corresponding to different body parts sequentially organized from head to toe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure yielded gradient representations of S1 and SMA homunculi in the contralateral hemisphere for the stimulated body side, corroborating previous studies (22, 23) (Fig 1 and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact locations of the gradients were further verified using a block design paradigm (repeated stimulation of cheek, palm, and toes) and a general linear model (GLM) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To objectively quantify gradient continuity, we developed the following analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different lag-values of each gradient were first segmented into clusters (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geometric centroids were projected on a linear-fit, and lag-values were then organized according to their projection on this fit (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance of the difference series was defined as the gradient dispersion value (GDV), characterizing the continuity of the gradient (better continuity is reflected by lower variance and therefore lower GDV) (for details, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To best capture the main axis of the gradient, the linear fit was rotated (±35°) and translated (within four intervals between the extrema of vertical axis components) to obtain minimal GDV (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brown-Séquard_Syndrome_Results__Higher_GDV_Characterizes_the_Representation_of_the_Disturbed_Body_Side  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative examination of both S1 and SMA homunculi revealed differences in each individual patient between the contralateral response to the disturbed and to the nondisturbed body side (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is reflected in the topographical pattern when gradients contralateral to the disturbed body side are less continuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each individual patient, gradients contralateral to the disturbed body side showed higher GDV than gradients contralateral to the nondisturbed body side, in both the S1 and the SMA (Fig 3A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis at the group level confirmed these results (Wilcoxon rank sum, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant differences were found also when gradients reflecting the disturbed body side were compared with those of control subjects (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference was found when gradients corresponding to the nondisturbed body side were compared with control subjects, as well as between the right and left sides of the control subjects (all Ps  greater than  0.05) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that hypoesthesia is reflected in a discontinuity of the corresponding somatosensory cortical gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further inquired whether this disturbance was also reflected in the power of the fMRI signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we analyzed the percent change of the fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal, averaged separately over the different body parts for S1 and SMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the disturbed and nondisturbed body sides or between the different sides compared with the healthy controls (all Ps  greater than  0.05) (Fig 3B and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surgical_Repair_Results__Lower_GDV_Characterizes_Whole-Body_Representation_After_Surgical_Repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further support our results in the Brown-Séquard model, we examined gradient continuity (as reflected in the GDV) and signal power in patients undergoing surgical repair of cervical disk protrusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improvement of both GDVs and patients subjective reports after surgical repair will add more causal support for the role of gradient continuity in somatosensory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative examination of both S1 and SMA homunculi revealed differences between cortical response to sensory stimulation before and after surgery (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis showed improvement in gradient continuity (lower GDV) after surgical repair in all patients in S1, and in three out of four patients in the SMA (Fig 3C and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, statistical analysis at the group level showed significant difference between the two conditions at S1, and between patients and controls in both S1 and the SMA (Wilcoxon rank sum, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to our findings in patients with Brown-Séquard syndrome, analysis of the percent change in the BOLD signal, averaged separately over the different body parts for S1 and SMA, did not reveal any significant difference before and after surgical repair, as well as between patients and healthy controls (all Ps  greater than  0.05) (Fig 3D and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional quantification of the somatosensory gradients in two unique modelspatients with partial Brown-Séquard syndrome and patients before and after surgical repair of cervical disk protrusionrevealed several novel findings: For the Brown-Séquard group, gradient continuity was disturbed in the hemisphere contralateral to the disturbed body side at the S1 and SMA cortices, whereas gradients at patients hemispheres contralateral to the nondisturbed body side were similar to those of healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the surgical group, gradient continuity was disturbed before, but not after, surgical repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent signal change of the BOLD signal did not show any significant and consistent power difference in both patient groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The underlying pathology in both patient populations involves a disruption of signal conduction from the peripheral sensors to the brain due to spinal cord lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our patients, this disruption led to decreased sensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results relate this disturbance to a discontinuity of cortical gradients rather than signal reduction and stress the central role of gradient continuity in whole-body somatosensory sensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradient discontinuity may further explain nonsomatotopic organization in the context of a whole-body representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reorganization of the homunculi in response to pathologies along the somatosensory pathway has been reported in both animals and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in nonhuman primates have reported an expansion of adjacent body parts' representations after spinal cord injuries and amputations (2428).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using fMRI, similar results were found in human patients with spinal injuries and amputations (2932).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it was suggested that perceptual changes go beyond what can be explained by shifts in neighboring cortical representational zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, fMRI in nonhuman primates after partial section of the dorsal column of the spinal cord at the cervical level showed dispersion of representations of each finger, which were further assembled later (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coactivation of nonadjacent representations was found as well, suggesting that cortical reorganization is dispersed over the somatosensory cortex (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these studies explained much about somatotopic reorganization, the significance of adjacency is still to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathologies we used here enabled an extension of these findings in humans by comparing whole-body representation in each patient and characterizing reorganization as large scale topographical changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our quantitative analysis pointed out gradient continuity as the feature being modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradients enable computation with respect to neighboring values rather than absolute values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gradient approach may facilitate computational processes because neighboring units will present similar values (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such computations are therefore of importance with respect to whole-body representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsal column partial lesion in nonhuman primates showed that the extent of cortical plasticity is positively correlated with the severity of the lesion and behavioral deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plastic changes were characterized by shifted, scattered, and weakened BOLD responses at 4 wk postlesion, and then a return and recovery of BOLD responses toward the prelesion state at 8 wk postlesion (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such dynamical changes suggest that topographic representations are maintained dynamically, manifesting a self-organizing capacity to restore somatotopic representation (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies investigated mostly hand representation, whole-body representation may better capture such changes and their correlation to behavioral changes and patients subjective reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A unique feature of animal studies is the ability to compare test and retest after lesion induction (11, 13, 24, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we suggest a comparable model in humans: patients before and after surgical repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is evidently limited due to chronic changes in patients, quality of repair, or heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, patients reliably report changes in subjective sensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All our patients reported significant subjective improvement in sensation after surgical intervention, which was further reflected in the GDVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research in a larger cohort of patients may enable the testing of not only a general improvement but also a precise correlation of subjective report and objective measurements of cortical response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topographic representations are ubiquitous in the primary cortices: Visual retinotopic maps represent projections of the visual field on the retina; auditory cortex contains tonotopic maps, reflecting the representation of sound frequencies; motor and somatosensory cortices contain homunculus maps corresponding to the representation of body parts (1, 23, 3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies show that topographic organization characterizes not only the primary cortices but also higher order cortices, processing functions such as spatial attention and numerosity (4043).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradient continuity may therefore be of importance not only to somatotopic organization but also to topographic organization in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of quantitative measurements and neurological pathologies is of much importance for both the scientific study of brain processes as well as clinical implication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study of unique pathologies such as Brown-Séquard Syndrome (for somatosensory) or nondecussating retinal-fugal fiber syndrome (for vision) (44) presents a most valuable contribution to the neurosciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most systems, an early decussation makes distinction of the unilateral external stimulus difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These syndromes are therefore a unique model that may distinguish lateralization of the stimuli, enabling comparisons of disrupted and nondisrupted conduction in the same study subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in patients undergoing surgical intervention enable experimental examination in lesional and nonlesional states in the same study subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be sure, such disorders correspond with most rigorous experimental animal models, yet enable subjective reports of deficits and effects of experimental manipulations in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative measurements of visual, auditory, and somatosensory gradients can be used for in-depth analyses of respective pathologies (4548), enabling objective evaluation and better understanding of pathological processes and recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study included five patients with Brown-Séquard syndrome and four patients undergoing surgical repair of cervical disk protrusion, encompassing all patients with the corresponding pathologies who were treated at our institute over a period of 24 mo and who agreed to participate in the study, met inclusion criteria, and were MRI-compatible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the small number of patients in each group, the ability to compare disturbed and nondisturbed conditions in the same study subject strengthens the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, differences were found not only at the group level but also in each individual patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such patients may further serve as a powerful model to study somatosensory deficits in humans where the subjective experience of sensory deficit is crucial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown-Séquard syndrome in our patients was partial, unlike lesion induction in animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, patients reported a significant difference between body sides, as reflected in our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was also confronted with a few other limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, light touch stimulation was conducted manually; however, the protocol was preplanned and the experimenter followed precise stimulus-locked instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, brushing was proved to be superior on other, better-controlled techniques, such as air puff (49), as was also found in our previous experience (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the substantial variation among different subjects yielded differences in the extracted gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for these differences, extraction was verified in three anatomical representations (3D, inflate, flattened), including signal evaluation, and was verified by an additional GLM analysis over a standard block design paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all potential trend lines to the extracted gradients in a range of ±35 degrees from the linear fit were examined to identify an optimal gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, homunculi differ in size; thus, segmentation to clusters with the same lag had various threshold values for minimum pixels per cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the threshold settings were always identical for each individual subject in the compared homunculi (left and right for the Brown-Séquard group, before and after surgery for the surgical repair group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we conducted an additional analysis that did not imply thresholding for all gradients, which yielded similar results (SI Methods and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, here, we showed that a sensory deficit due to spinal cord injury is reflected in cortical gradient discontinuity, rather than signal power reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that gradient continuity is a crucial property of brain function and that its disruption is a main character of pathological signal processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is needed to investigate gradient organization in other sensory modalities, in higher order cortices, as well as the role of gradient organization and its potential disruption in brain pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Continuous_Stimulation_Response_Maps  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maps that represent cortical response to continuous stimulation of one body side were created for each subject separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because stimulation was applied in two different mannerslip to toe and backmaps were created accordingly: (i) lip to toe, (ii) toe to lip, and (iii) a mean of the two maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted fMRI response was determined using a boxcar function of 3 s, convolved with a two gamma hemodynamic response function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed linear correlation between the predicted response of the first two TRs (3 s) of the continuous whole-body stimulation and each voxel's time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model that corresponds with the first correlation was then cross-correlated again with the same time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure yielded 10 correlation coefficient values, representing the whole-body response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two additional lag-values were added to account for the hemodynamic delay, yielding 12 correlation coefficient values, giving rise to 12 lag-values in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lag-values that corresponded with the highest correlation value between the predicted response and the time course in each voxel yielded the cortical response map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gradient_Extraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first patient group (Brown-Séquard Syndrome), we compared cortical maps in response to continuous stimulation of the left and right body sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because left and right somatosensory responses are not exactly symmetrical, we chose maps according to the overlap with the maps generated from the block design runs (GLM analysis with predictors for cheek, palm, and toe for each body side).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradients from the two stimulation responses were extracted from the same selected map, while correlation threshold was kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy controls were analyzed in the same manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second patient group, which underwent surgical repair, we compared maps from two different scans: a scan recorded soon before surgery and a scan performed one month after surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To keep the same gradient location, we defined a patch of interest (POI) on the flattened cortex surface and used the same POI to extract gradients from maps before and after surgery (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in this patient group, we compared the same anatomical regions in different time points with the same correlation threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, POIs were defined according to the anatomical location rather then the exact functional distribution, yielding higher GDVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body sides that were more disturbed before surgery (according to the GDV) were used for calculating the group affect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy controls were analyzed in the same manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sanity_CheckUnified_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The different nature of the two patient populations and patients heterogeneity required approaches that were slightly different: Comparison of left and right in the Brown-Séquard group required a more functional approach because the two hemispheres were not precisely symmetrical; gradients before and after surgery were compared according to precise anatomical location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify our approach and to remove any degrees of freedom, we also analyzed all different gradients in the same manner: All gradients were extracted anatomically from the first run starts with lip stimulation with the same correlation threshold (0.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GDV was computed without cluster size threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting GDVs are presented in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that, although this deviation might lead to less accurate GDVs, the same relations (higher GDVs in the disturbed body side of the Brown-Séquard patient and in the scan performed before surgery in the surgical repair group) would be found also in this analysis, highlighting the robustness of our models and analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This prospective cohort study was composed of five patients with hemihypoesthesia (unilateral) related to partial Brown-Séquard syndrome due to cervical disk protrusion [four males, 41.8 ± 11.8 y of age (mean ± SD)], four patients with cervical disk protrusion who underwent surgical repair (two males, 34.0 ± 4.1 y of age), and five age-matched healthy volunteers (two males, 41.4 ± 13.1 y of age).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One patient who participated in the Brown-Séquard group and who aggravated 18 mo later was rescanned also before and after surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No participant had any other neurological, psychiatric, or systemic disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients underwent a semistructural interview that documented time of pathology onset, symptoms, and their development, past medical history, and family and social history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurological examination elicited normal muscle strength and moderate to severe hypoesthesia for light touch for all patients (for the Brown-Séquard patients: in the affected body side).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients underwent MRI of the cervical spine, including T1, T2, and short TI inversion recovery (STIR*) contrasts in sagittal and axial views (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stimuli_and_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patients and healthy controls underwent two different stimulation paradigms: continuous (periodic design) and discrete (block design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the continuous stimulation, a whole-body brush movement was applied lip-to-toe and toe-to-lip bilaterally in two different scanning sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each scanning session contained 14 whole-body stimulation cycles, 7 to each body side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of each stimulation cycle was 15 s, which was followed by a 12-s rest baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Session started with 30 s of silence before the first cycle onset and ended with 4.5 s after the last cycle offset, in addition to 12 s of silence between body sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the discrete stimulation paradigm, the right and left toes, palm, and cheek were stimulated in separate blocks (yielding six conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each body part stimulation was repeated four times in a randomized order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation lasted 6 s followed by 9-s rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sessions started with 28 s of silence before the first cycle onset and ended with 6 s after the last cycle offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concordance with the patient's deficit, in both stimulation paradigms, a natural light-touch stimulation was delivered using a 4-cm-wide paint brush by the same experimenter, who was well-trained before the scans to maintain a constant pace and pressure during the sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenter wore fMRI-compatible electrodynamic headphones, which delivered preprogrammed (Presentation; Neurobehavioral Systems) auditory cues signaling the precise timing of the body part sequence, which enabled a controlled velocity of tactile stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_MRI_Image_Acquisition_Procedures_and_Preprocessing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patients and controls were scanned at the same site using a Siemens Trio 3T system (32-channel head coil) with the same imaging sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired using a whole-brain, gradient-echo (GE) echoplanar (EPI) [repetition time (TR)/time echo (TE) = 1,500/27 ms, flip angle = 70, field of view (FOV) = 192 × 192 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, 26 axial slices, slice thickness/gap = 4 mm/0.8 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, high resolution (1 × 1 × 1 mm) T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired to aid spatial normalization to standard atlas space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anatomic reference volume was acquired along the same orientation as the functional images [TR/TE = 2,300/2.97 ms, matrix = 256 × 256, 160 axial slices, 1-mm slice thickness, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preprocessing was performed using the Brain Voyager QX 2.8.4.2645 software package (Brain Innovation), including head motion correction, slice scan time correction, and high-pass filtering (cutoff frequency, two cycles per scan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal smoothing (FWHM = 4 s) and spatial smoothing (FWHM = 4 mm) were applied on the periodic design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional and anatomical datasets for each subject were aligned and fit to standardized Talairach space (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cross-Correlation_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A boxcar function (3 s) was convolved with a two gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF), to derive a predictor for the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This predictor and the time course of each voxel were cross-correlated, allowing for 12 lags with one TR (time repetition) interval time to account for the stimulation duration of each cycle (10 TRs) and two additional TRs to account for the hemodynamic delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each voxel, we obtained the lag-value with the highest correlation coefficient between the time course and 1 of 12 predictors and the value of this correlation coefficient (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gradient_Quantification_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above procedure yielded map values (lag and correlation coefficient), corresponding to vertex coordinates of the brain surface (flat).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients with Brown-Séquard syndrome, in whom we compared left and right gradients, we chose a correlation threshold that best captured S1 and SMA gradients separately for each subject, constant for both sides (mean, 0.37; SD, 0.035).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients that underwent surgical repair, in whom we compared gradients before and after surgery, threshold was kept constant for all maps (0.30) (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradients of the primary somatosensory and the supplementary motor cortex were extracted by defining a patch of interest (POI) on the flat cortex surface (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each lag and its corresponding coordinates were represented by a specific color in an RGB image matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrix was segmented into clusters with the same lag-value (Fig 2A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster-size threshold, set according to the gradient size, defined the minimum number of pixels that accounted for a cluster (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a next step, we have calculated the coordinates of a geometric centroid for each cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centroids were plotted on an xy plane in which the axes preserved the original image scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further define a vector that best represented the quality of the gradient, centroids were projected on a linear fit (Fig 2B and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This manipulation yielded a one-dimensional series of lag-values reflecting the cluster organization and order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuity of the gradient was defined with respect to the differences between lags, giving rise to a derivative vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradient was characterized according to the variance of this derivative vector (variation from a perfectly organized gradient).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was thus termed the gradient dispersion value (GDV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find an optimal fit (lowest GDV), on which centroids were projected, we performed multiple rotations (35 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise, 1-degree step) and translations (within four intervals between the extrema of vertical axis components) of the linear fit which covered the potential line orientation through the scattered centroids (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding GDVs were calculated while the minimal value was extracted to best capture the gradient's continuity and monotonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for significant differences between averaged groups of GDVs we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Block_Design_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A general linear model (GLM) was applied to the block design data, using predictors (boxcar function, 6 s) convoluted with a two gamma HRF for each of the six conditions (cheek, palm, and toes, bilaterally).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation maps for each body part were obtained by contrasting each condition versus baseline, to verify the gradient localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak activations for the cheek and toes in the contralateral postcentral gyrus were defined as the start and end point of the S1 homunculus and were compared with the gradient maps obtained from the continuous stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SMA homunculi, the localization was verified by the peaks along the medial walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Power_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the disturbance in somatosensory inputs was also reflected in the power of the fMRI signal, we quantified the power of the BOLD signal in each homunculus using the block design data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extracted a patch of interest (POI) of the contralateral S1 and SMA from the inflated presentation of each contrast (cheek, palm, and toes) containing the most significant 50 and 10 vertices, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method therefore does not require correction for multiple comparisons because only the most significant vertices are selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent signal change was calculated as the maximum value of epoch-based (1 to 1 TR around condition onset) event-related averaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
