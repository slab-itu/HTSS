Neutrophil-derived alpha defensins control inflammation by inhibiting macrophage mRNA translation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophils are the major effectors of acute inflammation responding to tissue injury or infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by inflammatory macrophages also provides a powerful proresolution signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils also release abundant amounts of the antimicrobial peptides alpha defensins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this report, we show that the most abundant of these peptides, HNP1 (Human Neutrophil Peptide 1), profoundly inhibits protein translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It achieves this without affecting mRNA stability or preventing mRNA polysomal association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a peptide released from one cell, a leukocyte, entering and directly modulating the translatome of another cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It alludes to a previously unidentified mechanism, driven by dying neutrophils, that ensures the timely resolution of macrophage-driven inflammation, without compromising antimicrobial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophils are the first and most numerous cells to arrive at the site of an inflammatory insult and are among the first to die.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that alpha defensins, released from apoptotic human neutrophils, augmented the antimicrobial capacity of macrophages while also inhibiting the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, alpha defensin administration protected mice from inflammation, induced by thioglychollate-induced peritonitis or following infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have now dissected the antiinflammatory mechanism of action of the most abundant neutrophil alpha defensin, Human Neutrophil Peptide 1 (HNP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we show that HNP1 enters macrophages and inhibits protein translation without inducing the unfolded-protein response or affecting mRNA stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a cell-free in vitro translation system, HNP1 powerfully inhibited both cap-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation while maintaining mRNA polysomal association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a peptide released from one cell type (neutrophils) directly regulating mRNA translation in another (macrophages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By preventing protein translation, HNP1 functions as a molecular brake on macrophage-driven inflammation, ensuring both pathogen clearance and the resolution of inflammation with minimal bystander tissue damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

HNP1_Inhibits_the_Synthesis_of_Proteins__Which_Is_Dependent_on_HNP1_Tertiary_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that although alpha defensins augmented the macrophages ability to kill intracellular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these peptides simultaneously inhibited the production of multiple cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HNP1 also inhibited TNF biosynthesis from HMDMs stimulated with the toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist R848 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biosynthesis of IL-6 and IL-1 induced via the T-cell surrogate stimulus CD40L/IFN was also reduced (Fig 1B), confirming that disparate stimuli and multiple secreted proteins were susceptible to HNP1-mediated inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of HNP1 was crucial for its cytokine inhibitory potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the intramolecular disulphide bonds that stabilize the triple-stranded beta-sheet structure of HNP1 were disrupted (linearized HNP1, l-HNP) or when dimerization was prevented by replacing the tryptophan residue at position 26 with the nonpolar amino acid alanine (W26A) (16), a complete loss of cytokine inhibitory potential was seen (Fig 1C and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast N-methylation of Ile20 (Melle), which also prevents dimerization, had a minimal effect on the ability of HNP1 to inhibit R848-induced TNF production by HMDMs (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if HNP1 might inhibit protein synthesis per se, stimulated HMDMs were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of HNP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [35S]methionine incorporation into proteins within cellular lysates (i.e., cellular proteins) and the culture media (i.e., secreted proteins) was visualized (Fig 1E) and quantified following 18 h of culture (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, HNP1 treatment significantly reduced the quantity of both 35S-labeled cellular and secreted proteins in unstimulated HMDMs and robustly inhibited the labeling of secreted proteins in CD40L/IFN-stimulated HMDMs, possibly reflecting the highly secretory phenotype of the stimulated macrophage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, secreted TNF was significantly reduced by HNP1 (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall cellular protein levels were unchanged during the time course of the experiment (Fig S1B), consistent with a lack of increased global protein turnover and with maintenance of cell number and viability, as previously reported (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, neutrophil-derived HNP1 profoundly inhibits global protein synthesis within the resting or activated macrophage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exogenous_HNP1_Accumulates_in_the_Macrophage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HNP1 gained entry to macrophages and was found within the membrane and cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no clear colocalization of HNP1 (or the control peptide W26A) with the ER marker calreticulin (Fig 2A and Fig S2 A and C) or with ribosomes (stained with anti-Rps20; Fig 2B and Fig S2 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments also showed no nonspecific staining or cross-reactivity between HNP1 and the ER or ribosomal secondary antibodies (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HNP1_Binds_Nonspecifically_to_RNA_but_Does_Not_Alter_mRNA_Transcription_or_Stability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As HNP1 enters the macrophage, it may, by reason of its positive charge and amphipathic nature (10, 18), bind to mRNA, so altering its turnover and inhibiting protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was tested using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with 25-mer homopolymeric RNA oligonucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to W26A, HNP1 showed concentration-dependent shifts of poly(C) (Fig 3 A and B), poly(A) (Fig S4 A and B), and poly(U) RNA (Fig S4 C and D), which were observed in both the presence or absence of Mg2+ (Fig S4E), a cation often required for nucleic acid binding by proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An antibody supershift EMSA also confirmed that HNP1 could bind to mRNA [coding for the firefly luciferase (fLuc) or -galactosidase (-gal) reporters] (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ask if HNP1 affected mRNA transcription, we quantified the steady-state mRNA levels generated by CD40L/IFN-stimulated HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA levels of TNF, IL-10, cyclooxygenase (Cox2), and tristetraprolin (TTP) were unaffected by HNP1 treatment of HMDMs over a 24-h time course (Fig 3C), despite a clear reduction in TNF protein production (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess mRNA decay, HNP1- or W26A-treated HMDMs were stimulated (with R848) for 1 h, resulting in maximal TNF- mRNA levels, before the addition of actinomycin D to arrest further transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay rate of TNF- mRNA was not significantly modulated in HNP1 versus W26A-treated HMDMs over a further 1-h time course (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TNF- mRNA stability is mediated in part by the zinc-finger protein TTP, which binds AU-rich sequences, we also assessed TNF- protein secretion from activated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from TTP-deficient (TTP/) mice or wild-type littermate controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, HNP1 (but not l-HNP1) was still able to significantly inhibit the secretion of TNF- from TTP/ BMDMs (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data show that HNP1 can bind to RNA, likely in a sequence-independent manner, but does not affect mRNA stability or turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HNP1_Does_Not_Induce_ER_Stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that HNP1 does not inhibit the exocytosis of TNF from HMDMs (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also wished to confirm that it did not prevent protein synthesis by inducing the unfolded protein response (UPR) (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the positive control thapsigargin (TG), we did not detect an increase in the synthesis of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), X-box-binding protein (XBP1), or CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in HNP1-treated and -stimulated HMDMs (Fig 4), despite a clear inhibition of R848-induced TNF production at 6 and 24 h (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the profound inhibition of protein synthesis by HNP1 was not the result of an induced UPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HNP1_Does_Not_Block_Translation_Initiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ask if HNP1 affected translation directly and to avoid the confounding effects of mRNA transcription, processing, or nuclear export, we used the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation of the canonical fLuc reporter mRNA was profoundly inhibited in the presence of HNP1 but not by the mutant control peptides l-HNP or W26A (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with TNF mRNA, HNP1 did not destabilize the reporter mRNA because input mRNA levels were maintained (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IC50 value for this effect was 1.6 M (or 5.5 g/mL) (Fig 5C), a concentration that significantly reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines from stimulated HMDMs in vitro (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eukaryotic mRNA has a 5 monomethylated cap structure (m7G) that is crucial for canonical translation initiation, the rate-limiting and primary node of translation regulation (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To interrogate the role of translation initiation in HNP1-mediated inhibition, we used reporter mRNAs that contained a viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in their 5 untranslated regions (5 UTRs), bypassing some or all of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) requirements and initiating translation cap-independently (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) IRES mRNA reporter initiates translation independently of the majority of eIFs but is dependent on the ternary complex (eIF2, GTP, and tRNAi), whereas the Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV) IRES allows the direct assembly of the 80S ribosome at the start codon, bypassing all canonical initiation factor requirements (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, despite their diverse mechanisms of translation initiation, HNP1 was also able to prevent the synthesis of both the CSFV-driven translation of -Gal (Fig 5D) and the CrPV-driven translation of Renilla luciferase (RLuc) (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As HNP1 is able to prevent the translation of mRNAs using diverse mechanisms of translation initiation, it is most likely that it is acting downstream of this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this empirically, ribosomal recruitment onto a radiolabeled m7G-capped fLuc reporter mRNA was quantified in the presence of cycloheximide to halt the 80S ribosome at the start codon, preventing translation elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HNP1 weakly inhibited translation initiation at 5 min following mRNA addition, by 10 min similar maximal 80S recruitment to that seen in vehicle control-treated extracts was observed (Fig 5F), indicating only a small reduction in the rate of 80S recruitment in the presence of HNP1 and supporting the conclusion that HNP1 predominantly inhibits mRNA translation postinitiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HNP1_Does_Not_Affect_Ribosomal_Association_with_mRNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally to ask if luciferase mRNA was maintained on polysomes despite its significantly reduced translation, we assessed the steady-state ribosomal association of m7G-fLuc mRNA in the presence or absence of HNP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite using a concentration of HNP1 that profoundly inhibited reporter protein synthesis (Fig 1E), we observed no change in the polysomal profile (Fig 6A) or the distribution of m7G-fLuc mRNA across the polysomal region of the density gradient (fractions 410) (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the presence of EDTA resulted in polysomal dissociation and depletion of the reporter mRNA from the fractions containing translating mRNA (Fig 6B and Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also wished to confirm if a similar mode of action was seen in HMDMs that had been treated with HNP1 or vehicle control (for 18 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMDMs so treated were then stimulated with R848 for 2 h to up-regulate the synthesis of TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the bulk polysome profile for HNP1-treated HMDMs was similar to that of control-stimulated cells (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the polysomal association of TNF mRNA in untreated or HNP1-treated stimulated HMDMs was not significantly altered (Fig 6D), despite the significant inhibition of TNF protein synthesis (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm that although HNP1 profoundly alters protein translation at a point after translation initiation, it does not prevent mRNA polysomal association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells of the immune system have developed tightly regulated systems to ensure the timely resolution of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of mRNA translation is emerging as a major mechanism that regulates the levels of proteins within leukocytes (reviewed in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have now identified a previously unidentified mechanism in which the most abundant neutrophil -defensin, HNP1, which is readily released as these cells die (5), inhibits bulk protein translation within macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the characteristic hydrophobic, amphipathic nature of -defensins allows them to partition into the membrane lipid layer (25), it also ensures ready access to the cells interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal imaging showed that HNP1 entered macrophages (Fig 2) without inducing a UPR (Fig 4) or affecting mRNA stability (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first description of an eobiotic peptide released by one cell profoundly affecting the translational capacity of another, in the absence of a requirement for de novo transcription and without compromising antimicrobial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HNP1 was able to inhibit translation initiation via diverse mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both canonical cap-dependent (Fig 5) and noncanonical, cap-independent translation (driven by either a CSFV or CrPV IRES) were profoundly inhibited in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the small inhibitory effect of HNP1 on translation initiation (Fig 5F) was insufficient to explain the magnitude of the effects seen in vitro and within macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the dramatic inhibition of CrPV IRES-driven translation, which dispenses with the initiation event, implicates an HNP1-mediated inhibition downstream of translation initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HNP1 could inhibit translation by binding nonspecifically to mRNA, or equally it could sequester factors essential for translation, such as tRNA or ribosomal protein and/or rRNA components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports point to several RNA-binding proteins that require a net positive charge and arginine side chains (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alpha defensins also possess four positively charged arginines, which might allow it to interact with RNA (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These side chains are important for its function, as the substitution of these amino acids for similarly charged lysine significantly reduces its bactericidal activity (17, 26) (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the ability of HNP1 to kill a diverse array of bacterial and viral pathogens, it will be of interest to determine whether HNP1 can similarly prevent prokaryotic protein translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because HNP1 binds nonspecifically to RNA, we asked if it could inhibit translation by modulating ribosome engagement with mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both reporter and cellular mRNAs remained polysome-associated (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6), and the polysomal distribution of these mRNAs was similar in control and HNP1-treated RRL and HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translational repression could be occurring via either elongation and/or termination (27), and we would speculate that HNP1 prevents translation elongation (22), which has recently been established as a major control point for protein synthesis (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies also allude to the greater importance of protein synthesis rate over degradation rate in determining overall protein levels (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of a significant change in overall HMDM cellular protein level (Fig S1B) argues against an HNP1-mediated increase in nonspecific cellular protein degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, HNP1 profoundly inhibits reporter protein synthesis in cell-free assays in which protein turnover pathways are fundamentally compromised and HNP1 itself has no known protease activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken altogether, we believe these data indicate that HNP1 affects de novo protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tertiary structure of monomeric HNP1 is also clearly important for translational inhibition, as highlighted by the loss of efficacy observed for l-HNP1 or W26A (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the N-methylation of HNP1 Ile-20 (Melle), which prevents dimerization, does not alter the ability of Melle to inhibit TNF- production, confirming that HNP1 dimerization is not required to inhibit macrophage protein translation (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of HNP13 in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is between 3 and 25 g/mL, with an average of 12.4 g/mL, suggesting that the concentration reached in tissues is similar to that used in our assays (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies have shown that HMDMs fully recover their proinflammatory potential within 72 h following exposure to -defensins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So although they clearly disable the macrophage protein translation machinery, they do not induce macrophage apoptosis (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study reported that -defensins reduced the release of IL-1 from activated monocytes, while not affecting the transcription of IL-1 mRNA (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, these observations can likely be explained by the translation of proIL-1 being impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have uncovered that neutrophil -defensins abrogate the bulk mRNA translation of proteins within HMDMs, without affecting mRNA transcription or stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way they prevent an excessive proinflammatory response that would create its own collateral damage while still acting as powerful antimicrobial peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an antimicrobial peptide that also has a translation-based antiinflammatory role, acting as a molecular brake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It opens the way for developing similar peptide-based therapeutics that would act as effective combined antiinflammatory and antimicrobial agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Analysis of mRNA polysomal recruitment in RRL was performed according to the manufacturers instructions with the following modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of translation initiation, RRL was pretreated with 25 g/mL HNP1 and 150 g/mL cycloheximide for 30 min before the addition of 2 ng 32P-labeled m7G-fLuc-A0 mRNA for various times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polysomes were resolved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and fractionation as previously described (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter mRNA content in each fraction was quantified as direct disintegration per minute on a scintillation counter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of steady-state polysome association, RRL was pretreated with 25 g/mL HNP1 for 30 min before the addition of 2 ng 32P-labeled m7G-fLuc-A0 mRNA for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation elongation was arrested by addition of 150 g/mL cycloheximide, or ribosomes were dissociated by addition of 25 mM EDTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polysomes were resolved and mRNA distribution quantified as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the quantification of TNF mRNA polysomal association in HMDMs, cells were treated with vehicle control (0.01% acetic acid) or 25 g/mL HNP1 for 18 h in serum-free conditions and then stimulated with R848 for 2 h. Cycloheximide at 150 g/mL was added 10 min before lysis and polysome fractionation as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractions were collected directly into TRIzol-LS (ThermoFisher) and spiked with 1 g mouse total RNA before RNA purification using DirectZol spin columns (Zymo Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative human TNF mRNA levels in each fraction were quantitated as described above, and mouse 18S rRNA was simultaneously quantitated to control for variability in RNA recovery between fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
