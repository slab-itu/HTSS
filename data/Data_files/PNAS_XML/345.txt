Heterometallic antennareactor complexes for photocatalysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis holds significant promise for controlling chemical reaction rates and outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, traditional plasmonic metals have limited surface chemistry, while conventional catalysts are poor optical absorbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By placing a catalytic reactor particle adjacent to a plasmonic antenna, the highly efficient and tunable light-harvesting capacities of plasmonic nanoparticles can be exploited to drastically increase absorption and hot-carrier generation in the reactor nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate this antennareactor concept by showing that plasmonic aluminum nanocrystal antennas decorated with small catalytic palladium reactor particles exhibit dramatically increased photocatalytic activity over their individual components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modularity of this approach provides for independent control of chemical and light-harvesting properties and paves the way for the rational, predictive design of efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metallic nanoparticles with strong optically resonant properties behave as nanoscale optical antennas, and have recently shown extraordinary promise as light-driven catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditionally, however, heterogeneous catalysis has relied upon weakly light-absorbing metals such as Pd, Pt, Ru, or Rh to lower the activation energy for chemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that coupling a plasmonic nanoantenna directly to catalytic nanoparticles enables the light-induced generation of hot carriers within the catalyst nanoparticles, transforming the entire complex into an efficient light-controlled reactive catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Pd-decorated Al nanocrystals, photocatalytic hydrogen desorption closely follows the antenna-induced local absorption cross-section of the Pd islands, and a supralinear power dependence strongly suggests that hot-carrier-induced desorption occurs at the Pd island surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When acetylene is present along with hydrogen, the selectivity for photocatalytic ethylene production relative to ethane is strongly enhanced, approaching 40:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that antennareactor complexes may greatly expand possibilities for developing designer photocatalytic substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We synthesized heterometallic nanoparticle complexes consisting of aluminum nanocrystals (AlNC) (25) decorated with multiple smaller Pd islands as an embodiment of the antennareactor concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pd nanoparticles function as the optically lossy catalytic material coupled to the plasmonic AlNC antenna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AlNC core is surrounded by an intrinsic 2- to 4-nm self-limiting oxide (26), separating it from Pd islands grown directly onto the outside of the Al2O3 shell using a weak-capping growth approach (27) (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antennareactor geometry leads to internal field enhancements and increased optical absorption in the Pd islands decorating the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show, via calculated near-field enhancements in a 10-nm Pd island at the surface of a 110-nm diameter AlNC (Fig 1 B and C) and, for comparison, a 110-nm Al2O3 nanosphere (Fig 1 D and E), the effect of coupling a plasmonic antenna to an optically lossy transition metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local field enhancement in the Pd island for the antennareactor geometry is over one order of magnitude higher than for the Al2O3 nanosphere case, due to the plasmon-enhanced near fields at the AlNC surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect leads to a drastic increase in hot-carrier production in the reactive Pd islands decorating the surface, because hot-carrier generation is proportional to internal field intensity enhancement rather than bulk material absorption (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The wavelength-dependent absorption in Pd for the AlNCPd antennareactor and the Al2O3Pd control case was calculated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and is shown in Fig 1F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AlNCPd antennareactor geometry (solid red curve) shows an increased absorption at 500 nm corresponding to plasmon-assisted absorption enhancements from the dipolar resonance of the AlNC (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Al2O3Pd geometry (black curve) shows only a broad, weak absorption across the visible region of the spectrum, with slight increase in the UV (less_than400 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also show that the absorption enhancements in such heterometallic systems can be calculated directly as the product of absorption in the reactor metal (Fig 1F, black curve) and the near-field enhancements (blue curve) to yield the calculated absorption (dashed red curve) without the use of extensive FDTD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, if the original Pd absorption in an isolated geometry (black curve) is multiplied by the electric field enhancement (blue curve) on the antenna particle alone at the position where the Pd island would be situated, this calculated absorption (dashed red curve) closely matches the Pd absorption in the coupled geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides further evidence for the antenna-induced absorption enhancement mechanism and suggests that the optical response of the antennareactor system can be determined by modeling separate responses from the individual catalytic reactor and the plasmonic antenna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This insight provides a path for straightforward optimization of antennareactor structures, where the antenna response can be tuned independently to provide the best spectral overlap with reactor photocatalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental evidence for coupling between the Al plasmonic nanocrystal and the Pd islands shows distinct modes corresponding to the individual antenna and reactor constituents as well as the coupled system (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) performed in a monochromatic, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), distinct modes corresponding to Al, Pd, and the coupled AlPd complex are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonnegative matrix factorization was used to separate the information encrypted in the EELS spectrum image into spectral components (Fig 2A) and a set of coefficients corresponding to the nanometer-scale resolution spatial distribution of the plasmon excitation probability, herein referred to as plasmon maps (Fig 2 BE) (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two Al modes show a maximum electron loss probability at 6 eV and 7 eV (Fig 2A), both with a secondary shoulder at 2.5 eV corresponding to the dipolar resonances of AlNCPd (confirmed with UV-visible spectroscopy, SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the plasmon maps shown in Fig 2 BE, an outline of the nanoparticle structure [also shown as the high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) in Fig 2A, Inset] has been overlaid to assist in visualization relative to the specific components of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can see from the Al LSPR maps that prominent excitation from Al is found at the AlAl2O3 interface, with highest intensity in regions of the Al nanoparticle surface without Pd decoration (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attributed to local damping of the Al LSPR through interactions and coupling with Pd interband transitions (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmon excitation probability is damped where smaller nanoparticle aggregation is found, but is nearly completely eliminated in and around larger (10 nm) Pd islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two modes attributed to Pd, only one exhibits coupling to the Al core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mode corresponds to plasmon-assisted enhancements in Pd directly on the surface of the AlNC, and will be referred to as the antenna mode (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second mode can be attributed to Pd interband transitions (Fig 2E) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antenna mode reveals intensity across a broad range of energies (1.56 eV) that overlay the dipolar resonance contribution from Al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two modes contributed from Pd show how the proximity of a lossy catalytic metal to a plasmonic metal core can influence the electronic properties of the decorating catalytic metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antenna mode (red) shows clear enhancements on the surface of the Pd islands in areas with high coverage and large islands (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemically synthesized AlNCs can exhibit small protrusions of excess Al2O3 extending from their surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this specific antennareactor nanoparticle, a larger protrusion of Al2O3 decorated with Pd, indicated with a white arrow in the HAADF-STEM in Fig 2A, Inset, is observed at the base of the nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the antenna mode of the composite nanoparticle, this region shows no enhancement (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the Pd interband transitions are excited (Fig 2E), a strong excitation is observed across the entire nanoparticle, including the Pd found on the Al2O3 protrusion (a secondary example and experimental description of EELS plasmon mapping is provided in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The photocatalytic properties of the AlNCPd antennareactor complex differ dramatically from that of either individual components of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied nonthermal, photocatalytic hydrogen desorption, which is the rate-limiting process in the H2 adsorptiondesorption equilibrium on the surface of Pd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated, from density functional theory (DFT), a ground-state energy barrier of 1.18 eV/H2 to desorb hydrogen (SI Appendix, Fig S7 and Table S2) because of the very exothermic and barrier-free dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pd(111), consistent with recent literature (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we believe that the more consequential process for Pdin contrast to earlier reports of plasmon-induced dissociation of H2 on Au (7, 8) and Al (15)is the interaction of the generated hot carriers with adsorbed H and D atoms on Pd, inducing desorption of HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmon-induced dissociation, recombination, and desorption processes are all charge-neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the chemical reaction is completed, the hot electrons recombine with the holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the AlNCPd complex, the wavelength dependence of HD production (Fig 3A, red) closely follows the calculated absorption cross section (black) supporting a hot-carrier mechanism (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When qualitatively compared with pristine AlNCs, the wavelength dependence of HD production is dramatically different (green), with the maximum HD production occurring at a photoexcitation wavelength of 800 nm, corresponding to the interband transition of Al (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative consumption of H2 at the dipolar LSPR of AlNC:Pd are reported in SI Appendix, Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with our previous work, AlNCPd antennareactor complexes show an order of magnitude greater reactivity than Au/SiO2 (7) and nearly two orders of magnitude greater reactivity than pristine AlNCs (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation laser power dependence of this reaction was measured at 492 nm and 800 nm, corresponding to the dipolar plasmon resonance and Al interband transition, respectively, and showed a supralinear response at both wavelengths (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such supralinear responses with increasing optical power density have been suggested as a hallmark of hot-carrier-driven chemistry on nanoparticle surfaces (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temperature dependence measurements between 300 K and 400 K without external illumination show an increase in HD generation with increasing temperature; however, the calculated wavelength-dependent local maximum temperature increase expected on the nanoparticle surface is only between 2 K and 16 K for Al and Pd surfaces, respectively, within the experimental range of excitation laser power densities (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such small local temperature increases under illumination suggest that, although photothermal heating of the Pd lattice may contribute slightly to H2 desorption, the primary cause can be attributed to the excitation of photoexcited hot carriers in the antennareactor complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the importance of hot electrons versus holes for the desorption process, we calculated densities of states and analyzed the contributions of PdH bonding and antibonding interactions, from DFT (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bonding PdH orbitals lie very low in energy (6 eV below the Fermi level), so a hot-hole-initiated process seems less likely from these initial results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the PdH antibonding interactions manifest just above the Fermi level and thus can be expected to be easily populated by hot electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these DFT results, a hot-electron-initiated destabilization of the PdH bonds leading to desorption seems more likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we caution that the band structure obtained from DFT does not necessarily reflect (or quantitatively capture) the correct physics of excited carriers on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, embedded correlated wave function calculations are underway that remedy the too-facile charge transfer of DFT (35), to identify the exact mechanism of hot-carrier-mediated hydrogen desorption from Pd surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional contributing reaction mechanisms include H2 migration through the oxide to the AlNC surface and hot-electron transfer across the oxide into Pd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of H2 followed by dissociation by plasmon- and interband-transitioninduced hot carriers was found to be the primary mechanism in pristine AlNCs (15) and certainly also contributes in the antennareactor complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is a small effect because, as shown in SI Appendix, Fig S8, the overall rate of HD production on AlNCPd antennareactors is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than in pristine AlNCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the wavelength dependence of HD production on pristine AlNCs and AlNCPd, specifically the drastic increase in the HD yield at the Al dipolar plasmon, we can conclude that electron transfer effects also play only a minor role for the overall reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the plasmon-assisted absorption enhancements in Pd at 500 nm (Fig 1F) are the major effect responsible for the increase in reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The photocatalytic properties of the AlNCPd antennareactor complex are translatable to other chemical reactions, such as hydrogenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One important and industrially relevant reaction is the selective reduction of acetylene (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethylene is a commodity chemical precursor used in the production of polyethylene-based materials with widespread commercial use; however, under traditional thermal conditions, ethane is also produced in a side reaction during hydrogenation of acetylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With AlNCPd antennareactor complexes, we have found a drastic increase in the selective reduction of acetylene to ethylene under white-light illumination compared to traditional thermal reduction (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selectivity also shows a large increase with increased laser power density (red); representative gas chromatograms for both thermal and photohydrogenations are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in ethylene:ethane product ratio from 7 to 37 is observed for the photohydrogenation case (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, traditional thermal heating of the AlNCPd complexes showed that ethylene:ethane selectivity leveled off at a maximum of 10:1 before showing a drop to 6:1 at 360 K (black).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This selectivity enhancement seen in photohydrogenation, yet not seen in traditional thermal hydrogenation, is likely due to the availability of dissociated H2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both photohydrogenation and thermal hydrogenation cases, acetylene adsorbs on the surface and undergoes the first and second hydrogenations to produce ethylene (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, two forward reaction pathways are possible: ethylene desorption or subsequent hydrogenation of ethylene to produce ethane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both desorption and hydrogenation of ethylene from Pd(111) have similar activation barriers within the margin of error of previous DFT calculations (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the availability of dissociated H2 dictates the branching ratio between these two reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In photocatalytic hydrogenations, plasmon-induced hot carriers lead to rapid desorption of H2, biasing the equilibrium toward desorption and thus limiting the availability of hydrogen on the surface for additional hydrogenation of ethylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis of hot-carrier-induced H-starved surfaces leading to increased selectivity is also backed up by reduced yields of ethylene in the photocatalytic hydrogenation case (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With illumination, there is less surface-activated H, which also reduces the likelihood of the first and second hydrogenations of acetylene needed to produce ethylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thermal hydrogenations, ethylene yields are higher (T  360 K) at the expense of reduced selectivity, most likely due to minimal changes in dissociated H2 surface coverage, and enough kinetic energy in the system to overcome the activation energies and favor subsequent hydrogenations of ethylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selectivity increase observed for the photohydrogenation of acetylene could open doors for developing more selective hot-carrier-driven chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The direct coupling of plasmonic nanoantennas with catalytic nanoparticles into a single heterometallic complex allows for absorption enhancements in poorly light-absorbing catalytic metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With antennareactor complexes, hot-carrier production and photothermal heating can be dramatically increased near catalytically active surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept is a highly modular one; for example, tuning the composition or size of the plasmonic antenna allows for light-induced photocatalysis at specific wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, enabling optimization of such complexes for specific chemical reactions and reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, by changing the reactor to different metals, alloys, semiconductors, or insulators, the surface chemistry and photocatalytic activity can be highly tuned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmon-induced hydrogen desorption reported here shows that the antennareactor geometry increases hot-carrier production, thereby allowing for new, light-driven reaction pathways on the catalytic metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing this antennareactor concept to favor specific hot-carrier-driven photocatalytic processes where control over reaction specificities is highly desirable opens a new door for the development of precise, ultimately predictive control of catalytic chemistry using light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
