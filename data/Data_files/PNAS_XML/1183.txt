Spider toxin inhibits gating pore currents underlying periodic paralysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Voltage-gated ion channels contain domains that have discrete functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central pore domain allows current flow and provides ion selectivity, whereas peripherally located voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) are needed for voltage-dependent gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain mutations trigger a leak current through VSDs, known as gating pore current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) type 2 is caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.4 that neutralize positive charges in S4 voltage-sensing segments of VSDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Hm-3 toxin from the crab spider Heriaeus melloteei inhibits gating pore currents through such mutant channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that Hm-3 and similar toxins may constitute useful hits in developing gating pore current inhibitors and HypoPP therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gating pore currents through the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.4 underlie hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) type 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gating modifier toxins target ion channels by modifying the function of the VSDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the hypothesis that these toxins could function as blockers of the pathogenic gating pore currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that a crab spider toxin Hm-3 from Heriaeus melloteei can inhibit gating pore currents due to mutations affecting the second arginine residue in the S4 helix of VSD-I that we have found in patients with HypoPP and describe here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR studies show that Hm-3 partitions into micelles through a hydrophobic cluster formed by aromatic residues and reveal complex formation with VSD-I through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the S3b helix and the S3S4 extracellular loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data identify VSD-I as a specific binding site for neurotoxins on sodium channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gating modifier toxins may constitute useful hits for the treatment of HypoPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Properties_of_INa_in_pR222W_Channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The p.R222W mutation was found in patients with HypoPP (5), but its molecular pathomechanism was not described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied INa properties of the p.R222W channel in HEK293 cells (Fig S1 AH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current density of p.R222W channels was reduced compared with wild-type channels (P less_than 0.001 at 0 mV), whereas the voltage of half-maximal activation and fast or slow inactivation (V1/2; see SI Materials and Methods) were unaltered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope factors of activation and fast inactivation were less steep (P less_than 0.01) and steeper (P less_than 0.001), respectively, for p.R222W channels compared with wild-type channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the time constant of open-state inactivation was increased in p.R222W channels [P less_than 0.01 for (0)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other parameters of p.R222W channels were unaltered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many HypoPP mutants show INa loss of function (2123) analogous to reduced current density of p.R222W channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may result in hypoexcitability and play a role in the clinical phenotype, but it cannot account for the depolarization observed in muscles from patients with HypoPP (4, 22, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced rate of sodium channel inactivation is a gain-of-function property that has been associated with paramyotonia and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, but not with HypoPP (1, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HypoPP is often defined as paralysis without myotonia, arguing that the slowed inactivation kinetics are not contributing to the symptoms experienced by mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Properties_of_IGP_in_pR222W_Channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked if p.R222W mutant channels conducted IGP using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To isolate IGP, INa was blocked with 1 M tetrodotoxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leak-subtracted currentvoltage data revealed hyperpolarization-activated inward currents for p.R222W channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current amplitude at 80 mV was 49 ± 11 nA (n = 21) for p.R222W channels and 25 ± 6 nA (n = 20) for wild-type channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guanidinium increases the amplitude of IGP in channels where an S4 arginine has been substituted (10, 25) and can be used to confirm the presence of IGP caused by such mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When half of the extracellular sodium was replaced by guanidinium, the current amplitude at 80 mV increased to 0.8 ± 0.1 A in cells expressing p.R222W channels, whereas the current in cells expressing wild-type channels was 0 ± 15 nA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For uninjected oocytes, these values were 28 ± 12 nA and 10 ± 3 nA in Na+ and Na+/Gn+, respectively (n = 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that p.R222W channels conduct hyperpolarization-activated IGP, similar to channels containing the p.R222G mutation found in another patient with HypoPP and previously shown to conduct IGP (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean current amplitude of p.R222G channels at 80 mV was 138 ± 28 nA in a Na+ solution and 1.7 ± 0.2 µA in Na+/Gn+ solution (n = 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IGP_Inhibition_by_Hm-3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hm-3 is a gating modifier toxin from the crab spider Heriaeus melloteei (26) and has been hypothesized to exert its effect by acting on the VSDs of NaV channels (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether Hm-3 could inhibit guanidinium-enhanced IGP of p.R222W and p.R222G channels (Fig 2 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 inhibited IGP for both mutant channels, with 10 M Hm-3 suppressing 67 ± 5% of p.R222W currents (n = 4) and 64 ± 4% of p.R222G currents (n = 10) at 80 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IC50 for p.R222G channels measured from noncumulative data was 5.4 ± 0.8 M at 80 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is more than 10-fold higher than the IC50 reported for the INa of NaV1.4 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VSD-I_Specific_Effects_of_Hm-3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the specificity of Hm-3 with a series of mutant channels that conduct IGP: p.R672G (R2, VSD-II), p.R1132Q (R2, VSD-III), p.R219G (R1, VSD-I), and p.R225G (R3, VSD-I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike p.R672G and p.R1132Q, p.R219G and p.R225G have not been identified thus far in patients with HypoPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guanidinium substantially increases the amplitude of nonlinear leak currents for all mutant channels (Fig S1I), confirming the presence of IGP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For p.R219G, p.R672G, and p.R1132Q channels, the currents were activated by hyperpolarization similar to p.R222W/G channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in p.R225G, IGP was activated by depolarization, although the presence of guanidinium in the extracellular solution increased the current amplitude at all voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 (10 M) did not inhibit IGP of mutant channels activated by hyperpolarization (n = 4 for p.R672G and p.R1132Q, n = 6 for p.R219G; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 (10 M) inhibited the depolarization-activated IGP of p.R225G channels (n = 9; Fig 3A) at voltages negative to 0 mV; the IGP was unaffected at positive voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also asked if the inhibition of the INa by Hm-3 was affected by different VSD mutations (Fig 3 BD and Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to voltage steps to 20 mV, inhibition by 1 M Hm-3 was similar to wild-type for p.R672G and p.R1132Q channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reduction in current amplitude was significantly lower for p.R222G and p.R219G channels (for both mutants, P less_than 0.01 vs. wild-type channels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nonsignificant trend toward a smaller effect on p.R222W and p.R225G was also seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For p.R219G, p.R222G, and p.R225G, we also studied INa inhibition with 10 M Hm-3, with both p.R222G and p.R219G showing reduced inhibition compared with wild-type channels (P less_than 0.01; Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction in the inhibitory effect of Hm-3 on p.R222G channels is consistent with the higher IC50 of IGP inhibition of p.R222G channels compared with the reported IC50 of INa inhibition of wild-type channels (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shift in the voltage dependence of activation by 10 M Hm-3 was evident for p.R219G channels, although smaller than for wild-type channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the absence of inhibition of p.R219G IGP by 10 M Hm-3 is not due to a lack of Hm-3 binding to the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  INa and IGP data suggest that Hm-3 forms specific interactions with VSD-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We proceeded to investigate this interaction using NMR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hm-3_Binds_to_the_S3S4_HelixLoopHelix_Motif_in_VSD-I  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VSD-I of human NaV1.4 (residues L114S246) was produced by cell-free expression (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed micelles of zwitterionic detergents [1:1 dodecylphosphocholine/N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (DPC/LDAO)] provided optimal conditions for NMR measurements (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this milieu, VSD-I has an expected -helical content of 60% (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3D and S5A), but its stability at the temperatures needed for NMR studies is limited (half-lifetime of 24 h at 45 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the backbone resonance assignment was obtained for 47% of residues belonging to the VSD sequence (Fig 4D and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hm-3 has previously shown affinity to zwitterionic and anionic lipid vesicles (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied the interaction between Hm-3 and DPC/LDAO micelles in the absence of VSD-I (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium dissociation constant of the Hm-3/micelle complex (KM) of 36.5 ± 3.1 M revealed that the toxin has a considerably high affinity to the micelle surface (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 interacts with the micelle through a hydrophobic cluster formed by aromatic residues (W11, F12, W16, and Y25), while positively and negatively charged groups either contact with polar head groups of detergents (e.g., K32) or protrude into the aqueous environment (Fig 4C and Fig S6 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial structure of the toxin does not change significantly upon micelle binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then titrated 15N-labeled VSD-I in DPC/LDAO micelles with unlabeled Hm-3 and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the position and intensities of the backbone 1H15N resonances (Fig 4 A and B and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5B and S6C) indicated the formation of a toxin/channel complex and revealed the location of binding interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 interacts with the outer half of the S3 helix of VSD-I (S3b, residues S199T207) and the C-terminal part of the S3S4 extracellular loop (residues L212I215) by the two-stranded, antiparallel -sheet (residues C23K28 and L31I33) and W11 and F12 belonging to the membrane-binding surface (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S3S4 loop accommodates two negatively charged groups (E208 and D211).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the signals of these residues are not identified in the NMR spectra, significant changes are observed for the neighboring residues T207 and L212, implying the participation of their side chains in complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the absence of any responses from residues A217 and R225 (R3) in the S4 helix indicates that they do not participate in toxin binding; R219 and R222 (R1 and R2) remained unassigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of chemical shift perturbations indicates that the binding of Hm-3 does not introduce significant changes in the spatial structure of VSD-I outside the S3b/S3S4 loop and the topology of Hm-3/micelle interaction is not significantly altered upon toxin binding to VSD-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium dissociation constant of the Hm-3/VSD-I complex (KV) of 6.2 ± 0.6 M was determined by the analysis of VSD-I chemical shift changes during Hm-3 titration (Fig S7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pull-down assay using VSD-I attached to an Ni2+ resin confirmed the formation of the Hm-3/VSD-I complex (Fig S7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that Hm-3 interacts with the S3S4 helixloophelix (paddle) motif of VSD-I, we tested the activity of Hm-3 on KV2.1 channels where their paddle motif was substituted with the corresponding structures of NaV1.4 VSDs (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of the resulting hybrid channels was significantly reduced by 1.5 M Hm-3 only when the paddle motif of VSD-I was introduced (Fig 4E), but not that of any other VSDs (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we replaced NaV1.4 residues suggested by NMR to interact with Hm-3 (p.D211H and p.E208A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of INa by 1 M Hm-3 was reduced significantly in p.D211H (n = 6; Fig S2 A and B), while a small nonsignificant reduction was observed in p.E208A (n = 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 10 M, Hm-3 inhibition of p.D211H (n = 4) and p.E208A (n = 3) channels was wild-typelike (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR-Based_Model_of_Hm-3_VSD-I_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Hm-3 complex with the up state of VSD-I was modeled using protein-to-protein docking with specific restraints imposed by NMR (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A resulting solution (Fig 5A) shows the toxin peripherally attached to the S3bS4 region of VSD-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex is stabilized by two salt bridges (K24E208 and K28D211) and by hydrophobic/stacking interactions: W11 side chain is sandwiched between F198, I201, M202, and Y205; Y25 makes contacts with M202, M203, and L206; and I27 is in contact with L206 and I215.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, F209 of VSD-I may participate in hydrophobic interactions with I33 and V35 residues in the C-terminal -strand of the toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VSD-I_as_a_Binding_Site_for_Gating_Modifier_Toxins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present several lines of evidence that the crab spider toxin Hm-3 affects channel gating by interacting with VSD-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 inhibits IGP evoked by mutations in VSD-I (Fig 2 DF), but not in VSD-II or VSD-III (Fig 3A), and Hm-3 inhibition of INa is reduced by mutations of R1 and R2 in VSD-I, while unaffected by mutations of R2 in VSD-II or VSD-III (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Hm-3 alters NMR signals in the paddle motif of VSD-I (Fig 4D), and when this region is inserted in KV2.1 channels, it conveys Hm-3 sensitivity to these channels (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a mutation in the VSD-I S3S4 loop predicted to break a salt bridge reduces the inhibitory effect of Hm-3 (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VSD-I has been proposed as one of the binding sites for ProTx-II from the tarantula Thrixopelma pruriens, but it is not the principal site (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore identify VSD-I as a specific binding site for gating modifier toxins (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hm-3 inhibits NaV1.4 at submicromolar concentrations but does not affect all NaV isoforms (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignment of the proposed binding site shows that the S3S4 loop is one of the most variable regions of VSD-I (Fig S9), and some of the nonsensitive isoforms lack the aspartate corresponding to D211 (NaV1.2 and NaV1.3) or a hydrophobic residue corresponding to M203 (NaV1.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These residues form contacts with Hm-3 in our model (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another Hm-3resistant channel, NaV1.8, contains an additional positively charged residue in the S3S4 loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our mutagenesis data, E208 is missing in the insect DmNaV1 channel, which is sensitive to Hm-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMR data suggest that Hm-3 can anchor onto the membrane surface in a position compatible with binding the paddle motif (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar mechanism was proposed for some other gating modifier toxins from spider venom acting on KV and NaV channels (e.g., VsTx1, ProTx-II, huwentoxin-IV, SgTx1, GxTx-1E) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 binds to the channel with its -hairpin, interacting with negatively charged residues from the S3S4 loop (Fig 5A); such residues in the same loop of other VSDs are essential for binding of other toxins (3235) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model of the Hm-3/VSD-I complex is in good agreement with the model describing interactions of spider gating modifier toxins with KV channels (32, 34, 36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hm-3_Mode_of_Action  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several lines of evidence suggest that Hm-3 stabilizes the down state of VSD-I: (i) the toxin inhibits NaV1.4 INa by shifting channel activation to more positive voltages (27), (ii) Hm-3 inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated IGP of p.R222G/W channels (Fig 2 DF), (iii) Hm-3 shifts the voltage dependence of p.R222G IGP to more depolarized voltages (Fig S2C), and (iv) Hm-3 inhibits the depolarization-activated p.R225G IGP similar to INa: Conductance increases at more positive voltages (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Hm-3 does not alter the voltage dependence of p.R219G IGP in contrast to INa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the reduced shift of p.R219G INa by Hm-3 and the fact that its IGP is activated at more hyperpolarized voltages than p.R222G IGP (Fig 2C vs. 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our NMR data likely describe the up state of VSD-I as the recordings were made in the absence of voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that similar to other gating modifier toxins from spider venom (38), Hm-3 interacts with both up and down states of VSD-I but has a higher affinity to the down state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Hm-3 inhibition of INa (27) and IGP (Fig S2D) can be reversed by applying prolonged depolarizing voltage pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a constant tail voltage of 100 mV, inhibition by Hm-3 is at its maximum following hyperpolarizing prepulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after depolarizing prepulses the tail current amplitude increases, suggesting that the inhibition by the toxin is relieved when the voltage sensor moves to the up state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Binding of Hm-3 to the up state is likely to be membrane-mediated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major free energy contribution to the stability of the Hm-3/VSD-I complex comes from the partition of the toxin into the micelle (free energy of 6.5 kcal/M; Fig S7E), while binding to VSD-I within the micelle adds only 1.1 kcal/M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this comparatively low free energy gain does not necessarily indicate the weakness of the toxin/domain complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It rather suggests that Hm-3 forms hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts similar to those already present between VSD-I and lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, high-resolution structural data of ion channel VSDs are available only for the up state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the binding of Hm-3 to the down state of VSDs cannot be modeled accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is evident, however, that the relative orientation of Hm-3 binding elements, the S3b helix and S3S4 loop, changes from two spatially separated regions in the up-state models to a continuous surface in the down-state models of VSDs (39) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compaction of the binding interface likely underlies the increased affinity of the toxin to the resting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data suggest that stabilization of the voltage sensor by Hm-3 in the down state does not, per se, result in the inhibition of p.R222G/W IGP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, by preventing the up movement of S4 in VSD-I, Hm-3 stabilizes the active state of IGP (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also suggest that Hm-3 forms specific and state-dependent interactions to inhibit IGP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that Hm-3 stabilizes VSD-I in the down state where p.R222G IGP is active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 either introduces a local conformational change sufficient to constrict the gating pore or directly occludes it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced INa inhibition of R1 and R2 mutant channels by Hm-3 suggests that it may directly interact with these residues in the down state and, in the absence of R2, prevent the flow of ions through the gating pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Toxins_as_Hits_for_Development_of_HypoPP_Therapies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main pathomechanism of HypoPP is presumed to consist of gating pore leak currents through VSDs of NaV1.4 or CaV1.1 that depolarize and paralyze the muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, compounds blocking the leak currents may prevent the depolarization and paralysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify the gating modifier toxin Hm-3 as an inhibitor of IGP of HypoPP p.R222G/W channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hm-3 also suppresses INa of wild-type and mutant channels, limiting its clinical usefulness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our study proposes several ways forward to develop agents with improved selectivity toward IGP and with minimum activity on the wild-type channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, gating modifier toxins are a useful source for identifying novel IGP inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, application of guanidinium will increase the throughput of IGP pharmacological studies, allowing characterization of a large number of toxins on a set of mutant VSDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, NMR studies can identify key toxinchannel interactions that may help direct the development of hit compounds, clarify the pharmacophores, and eventually improve the therapeutic options of HypoPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hm-3_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hm-3 was produced recombinantly following a published procedure (27) as part of a fusion protein with thioredoxin, which was cleaved at methionine residues by cyanogen bromide (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NMR studies, 15N-labeled Hm-3 was produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, transformed Escherichia coli cells were first cultured in LB medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having reached the mid-log phase, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in the minimal growth medium M9 containing 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2% glucose, 0.1% 15NH4Cl, 0.6% NaH2PO4, 0.3% K2HPO4, 0.05% NaCl, and 1 mM thiamine (pH 7.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other steps were carried out as with cold toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Biology_and_Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials and methods for mutagenesis, the NaV1.4 channel patch clamp in HEK293 cells, and the two-electrode voltage clamp of X. laevis are described by Zaharieva et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16) and in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimeric rat NaV1.4/KV2.1 constructs were generated as described by Bosmans et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oocytes for NaV1.4 expression work were isolated from adult female X. laevis in accordance with the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 or the Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VSD-I_Sample_Preparation_and_NMR_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples of the unlabeled and 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled VSD-I were produced using a cell-free expression system in the insoluble form as described elsewhere (28, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitate of the reaction mixture was solubilized in 500 L of 20 mM TrisHCl, 300 mM NaCl, and 10% DPC (pH 8.0), and purified by Ni2+ chromatography in 0.5% DPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LDAO was added to the purified protein (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-III 600 and 800 spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes at pH 5.5 and 45 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H,15N-TROSY spectra were used to monitor binding of Hm-3 to 15N-labeled VSD-I and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detergent concentration in the samples was kept constant during titrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium dissociation constants of Hm-3/micelle and Hm-3/VSD-I complexes (KM and KV, respectively) were determined from the chemical shift titration data assuming fast (on the NMR time scale) exchange of Hm-3 molecules between three different states (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computer_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homology models of VSD-I in the up and down states were constructed using as a template the VSD-I from the cryo-EM structure of the NaVPaS channel (42) and the structures from the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of the KV1.2/2.1 chimeric channel (39), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recently published cryo-EM structure of the NaV1.4 channel from the electric eel was not used for the modeling because VSD-I is poorly resolved in this structure (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural model of the Hm-3/VSD-I complex was generated with the HADDOCK2.2 web server (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
