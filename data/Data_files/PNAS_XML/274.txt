title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extensive graft-derived dopaminergic innervation is maintained 24 years after transplantation in the degenerating parkinsonian brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parkinsons disease is the most common movement disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the histopathological analysis of a unique patient with Parkinsons disease who underwent unilateral cell transplantation in the putamen with human embryonic mesencephalic tissue at 24 y before death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient enjoyed major clinical benefits for at least a decade after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a quarter of a century, complete graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation was still evident in the transplanted putamen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Synucleinpositive inclusions, some with the appearance of typical Lewy bodies, were present in 1112% of the grafted dopaminergic neurons, reflecting spread of pathology from the host brain to the transplant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical improvements were gradually lost from 14 y posttransplantation, indicating that even extensive graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation loses its efficacy in a severely degenerating brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical trials using cells derived from embryonic ventral mesencephalon have shown that transplanted dopaminergic neurons can survive and function in the long term, as demonstrated by in vivo brain imaging using 18F-fluorodopa and 11C-raclopride positron emission tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the postmortem analysis of a patient with Parkinsons disease who 24 y earlier underwent unilateral transplantation of embryonic dopaminergic neurons in the putamen and subsequently exhibited major motor improvement and recovery of striatal dopaminergic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathological analysis showed that a dense, near-normal graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation of the putamen can be maintained for a quarter of a century despite severe host brain pathology and with no evidence of immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ubiquitin- and -synucleinpositive inclusions were seen, some with the appearance of typical Lewy bodies, in 1112% of the grafted dopaminergic neurons, reflecting the spread of pathology from the host brain to the transplants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the clinical benefits induced by transplantation in this patient were gradually lost after 14 y posttransplantation, our findings provide the first reported evidence, to our knowledge, that even a viable dopaminergic graft giving rise to extensive striatal reinnervation may lose its efficacy if widespread degenerative changes develop in the host brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient_History_and_Clinical_Follow-Up  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 1989, at age 59 y, the patient underwent transplantation with ventral mesencephalic tissue from four human embryos obtained at routine suction abortions (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a computed tomography-guided stereotactic technique, dissociated tissue was implanted along three tracts in the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the right putamen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had developed typical PD in 1980 and was started on l-dopa treatment in 1982.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He did well until 1986, when he developed onoff symptoms, with off periods characterized by resting tremor, hypokinetic movements, and rigidity, particularly on the left side of the body, and only mild parkinsonian symptoms during on periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Up to 10 y after transplantation, the patient was monitored according to the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations protocol (9) as part of a scientific program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He improved dramatically during the first 3 y, and l-dopa was withdrawn at 32 mo (8, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunosuppressive treatment (prednisolone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine) was slowly tapered and then stopped at 64 mo (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-dose l-dopa (approximately one-third of the preoperative dose) was reintroduced at 74 mo owing to progression of symptoms axially and in the limbs ipsilateral to the graft (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient responded well to this medication, and motor function and l-dopa dose remained unchanged thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 10 y after transplantation, he showed a marked clinical benefit, with virtually no rigidity, minor hypokinesia, intermittent and mild resting tremor, and no onoff fluctuations (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Off-medication dyskinesias were not observed on clinical examinations during the first decade posttransplantation, except for a slight nonprogressive activity-related dyskinesia in the left foot that appeared during the third posttransplantation year (7, 8, 10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post hoc analysis of video recordings revealed nontroublesome, very mild off-medication dyskinesias on the left side of the body (contralateral to the graft) at 28 mo and 11 y after transplantation, but not at 12 mo after transplantation (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between 10 and 24 y after transplantation, the patient was followed as a regular patient at the neurology outpatient clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A routine neurologic examination, including assessments of rigidity, tremor, hypokinesia, and cognitive function, was performed by the same neurologist every 69 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motor function remained unchanged until 12 y posttransplantation, when a low-dose dopamine agonist was added for 2 y and the l-dopa dose was increased to the preoperative level because of worsening hypokinesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased l-dopa doses were accompanied by slight bilateral dyskinesias, but no off-medication dyskinesias were noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The patient initially responded well to this change in medication regimen, but starting in year 14 began to exhibit progressively increasing rigidity and hypokinesia and a gradual loss of the beneficial l-dopa response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in year 14, cognitive impairment was first noted, and progressive dementia ensued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His condition continued to deteriorate, and no graft-related motor improvement remained at 18 y posttransplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At that time, the patient was unable to walk and had lost the ability to swallow and speak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He died of cardiac insufficiency at 24 y after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent for an autopsy was obtained in June 2009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed descriptions of the preoperative history, the transplantation procedure, and the clinical course in this patient up to 10 y after surgery have been published previously (7, 8, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Survival_of_Dopaminergic_Neurons_in_the_Grafts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postmortem analysis identified all three grafts in the dorsal putamen (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 6,246, 10,728, and 25,854 surviving dopaminergic neurons [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive and/or neuromelanin-containing] were found in the rostral, middle, and caudal grafts, respectively (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells formed clusters in the periphery of each graft (Fig 1 A and B) (3, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority (76%) of the neuromelanin-containing neurons within the graft were TH-immunoreactive (Fig 1 CE) and associated with dense networks of axonal/dendritic profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 24% of the neurons that contained distinct neuromelanin granules had no detectable TH immunoreactivity, suggesting down-regulation of TH (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Complete_Reinnervation_of_Grafted_Putamen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nontransplanted putamen was devoid of TH-positive terminals (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 3G), consistent with the presence of few neuromelanin-positive neurons bilaterally in the substantia nigra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a rich network of TH-positive fibers extended throughout the postcommissural part of the transplanted putamen (Fig 2 CK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TH-positive fiber density showed a gradient extending from the core of the grafts to the edge of the putamen (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the area adjacent to the graft (Fig 3 AE), the density of the TH-positive innervation was comparable to that of the dopaminergic innervation in the putamen of an age-matched control subject (age 85 y) who died from a nonneurologic disease (Fig 3 F, H, and I; dashed line in 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar dense innervation was seen in sections stained for vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precommissural part of the putamen, containing the rostral graft, was paraffin-embedded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 4-Âµm-thick paraffin sections through this part, TH immunostaining allowed visualization of cells, but not of axons or terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microglia_Reaction_and_Graft_and_Host_Brain_Pathology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although immunosuppression was terminated at 5 y posttransplantation, at 24 y there was no evidence of an ongoing immune/inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analyses showed no difference between transplanted putamen, nontransplanted putamen, and putamen in the control subject in terms of numbers of IBA-1positive (recognizing both activated and nonactivated microglia) (Fig S2 AC) or CD68-positive cells (recognizing activated microglia) (Fig S2H) or in the morphology of microglia (14) (Fig S2 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The patient exhibited a dense, near-normal dopaminergic reinnervation derived from the grafts at 24 y posttransplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two main mechanisms likely underlie the gradual loss of the l-dopa response and dopaminergic graft effects on motor function, as well as the progressive cognitive decline starting at 14 y posttransplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a considerable number of synucleinopathy-related phenotypes were detected in the transplanted neurons, reflecting pathology spread from the host brain to the transplant, which could contribute to the decreasing functional efficacy of a portion of the grafted dopaminergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analyses revealed ubiquitin- and -synucleinpositive Lewy bodies in 11% and 12% of transplanted neurons, respectively (Fig 4 B, C, and Q), higher than the percentages reported previously (1.25% of transplanted neurons) in 12- to 22-y-old transplants (2, 3, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, because the majority of the more than 40,000 grafted neurons maintained TH immunoreactivity and provided extensive dopaminergic reinnervation of the putamen, it is likely that the complete lack of responsiveness to l-dopa and the concomitant loss of the graft effect were caused mainly by the severe pathological changes postsynaptically, i.e., in the host brain outside the graft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient displayed substantial general atrophy, with considerable widening of the lateral ventricles and severe medial temporal lobe atrophy (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuropathologically, PD with dementia was diagnosed, owing to characteristics of extensive Lewy pathology in all brain regions including the limbic system and neocortex, corresponding to Braak stage 6 (15) (Fig 4 DP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis showed the occurrence of Lewy bodies in 20% of remaining pigment granule-containing neurons in the host substantia nigra, higher than the percentage of Lewy bodies in the grafted dopaminergic neurons (1112%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Synucleinpositive neurites were widespread in the brain, commonly involving limbic and neocortical regions, accompanied by degeneration of white matter, which also was macroscopically atrophic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate a complete graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation of the postcommissural putamen maintained for 24 y after transplantation in a patient with PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with observations in the same patient at 10 y posttransplantation, when positron emission tomography revealed normalization of 18F-dopa uptake and 11C-raclopride binding in the grafted putamen (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that a rich dopaminergic innervation that develops over the first 3 y after transplantation and gives rise to major motor improvement can be preserved for a quarter of a century in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the clinical outcome in this patient demonstrates that even such a viable graft may lose its efficacy if widespread -synucleinopathy and major degenerative changes develop in the host brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund University (nr2014/631).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postmortem_Brain_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The patients brain (obtained at 4 d postmortem) was fixed in 6% buffered formaldehyde solution for 1 mo and then transferred to 20% sucrose solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions were cut into coronal whole brain sections and small specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brain regions in sucrose were sliced into blocks containing basal ganglia (four blocks from rostral to caudal), mesencephalon, pons, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and some other brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most rostral block of the basal ganglia was paraffin-embedded, and the other three blocks were used for frozen section preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All brain regions not set aside for quantitative assessments were used for diagnostic analysis, including assessment of synuclein pathology and viability of the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basal ganglia blocks were cut into 40-Âµm-thick free-floating frozen sections and 4-Âµm-thick slide-mounted paraffin sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories) staining, free-floating sections were quenched with 3% H2O2 in 10% methanol for 15 min before blocking (5% normal horse or goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies (diluted in 3% serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS) overnight at 4 Â°C or room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibodies used in these experiments are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After rinsing, biotinylated secondary antibodies (horse anti-mouse, horse anti-rabbit, goat anti-rat; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were applied for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with ABC complex (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min, rinsing, and then incubation with DAB (Vector Laboratories) for 30 s or longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized with xylene and then sequential decreasing concentrations of ethanol before use in the immunohistochemistry procedure described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunofluorescence double labeling, two different primary antibodies raised in rabbit and mouse followed by Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies raised in donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autofluorescence Eliminator reagent (EMD Millipore) was applied before mounting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before blocking, both free-floating frozen sections and slide-mounted paraffin sections were treated with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.4) to achieve effective antigen retrieval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-floating sections were incubated in citrate buffer at 80 Â°C for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin sections were boiled in citrate buffer in a microwave oven for 14 min at 800 W. Sections were rinsed in PBS before staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging_and_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bright-field images were captured using an Olympus DP73 camera, driven by CellSens software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark-field images were obtained using an Olympus AX70 camera, driven by Leica DMI 6000B software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The numbers of surviving neuromelanin- and/or TH-positive grafted neurons were assessed along each injection track in both paraffin and frozen TH-stained sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Abercrombie formula was used to estimate the number of cells in each graft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this formula, cell diameter is assessed from an average of 45 neurons in each graft (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The density of the TH-positive innervation was assessed using a modified sphere counting technique of Mouton et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a 100Ã oil-immersion objective, in a bright-field microscope (Olympus AX70), a z-stack was captured throughout the entire thickness of the section at 1-Âµm intervals, using Velocity v5.4.2 image analysis software (PerkinElmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, a 19-Âµm-diameter sphere (the probe) was created to measure fiber density within the z-stack, and the points at which fibers passed through the circumference of the sphere at each z-level were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A score of 1 was assigned for each fiber crossing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each probe, the total number of fibers passing through the sphere was expressed as a measure of fiber density within the measured volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the VMAT2-positive fibers, staining intensity was measured using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten images from both grafted and nongrafted putamen were chosen for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were adjusted to gray scale, and a threshold was set to exclude the background area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity measurements were performed within regions of interest and within the range of threshold limit (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For quantification of microglia, eight image fields were chosen from sections of grafted and nongrafted putamen and from the putamen of a normal subject immunostained with IBA1 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell numbers in each field were counted, and the IBA1-positive cells classified into four different morphological phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, five images were chosen in CD68-stained sections and the total cell numbers in all fields were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
