Cell autonomous regulation of herpes and influenza virus infection by the circadian clock  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The circadian clock coordinates our physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circadian disruption, as occurs during shift work, increases the risk of chronic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infectious diseases, circadian regulation of systemic immunity seems to underpin time-of-day differences in responses to extracellular pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, circadian rhythms are cell autonomous, and their interaction with intracellular pathogens, such as viruses, is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that time of day of virus infection has a major impact on disease progression, in cellular models as well as in animals, highlighting the key role that cellular clocks play in this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clock disruption leads to increased virus replication and dissemination, indicating that severity of acute infections is influenced by circadian timekeeping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viruses are intracellular pathogens that hijack host cell machinery and resources to replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than being constant, host physiology is rhythmic, undergoing circadian (24 h) oscillations in many virus-relevant pathways, but whether daily rhythms impact on viral replication is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the time of day of host infection regulates virus progression in live mice and individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpes and influenza A virus infections are enhanced when host circadian rhythms are abolished by disrupting the key clock gene transcription factor Bmal1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular trafficking, biosynthetic processes, protein synthesis, and chromatin assembly all contribute to circadian regulation of virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, herpesviruses differentially target components of the molecular circadian clockwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates that viruses exploit the clockwork for their own gain and that the clock represents a novel target for modulating viral replication that extends beyond any single family of these ubiquitous pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and require host organisms to proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the course of a day, viruses may encounter host environments that are more or less conducive to replication and dissemination (5, 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the time of day of infection would influence viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we infected WT mice intranasally with a recombinant luciferase-expressing virus, Murid Herpesvirus 4 (M3:luc MuHV-4), at two times of day (Fig 1A and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a rodent pathogen, this virus elicits natural host immune responses and implements evasion strategies in laboratory mice (11, 12), which allow it to establish latent (or quiescent) infection after primary infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT mice infected intranasally at the onset of resting phase [Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT0); lights on], exhibited 10-fold higher viral replication than mice infected just before their active phase (ZT10) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time-of-day effect required a functional clock because Bmal1/ mice, which have no overt circadian rhythms (2), showed no difference when infected at different times (Fig 1B and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Bmal1/ mice exhibited high levels of MuHV-4 infection when inoculated at either time of day (Fig S1 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that the timing of infection in relation the circadian cycle has major effects on herpesvirus pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because infection of Bmal1/ mice resulted in high levels of virus replication in vivo (Fig S1 D and F), we hypothesized that its role in clock function was important in regulating virus propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tracked M3:luc MuHV-4 infection longitudinally in WT and Bmal1/ mice, infecting intranasally at ZT7: the time when BMAL1 is maximally active at genomic sites in peripheral tissues (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, virus replication increased greater than threefold at days 57 in Bmal1/ mice compared with WT mice (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw a similar pattern when the acute infection spread to the superficial cervical lymph nodes (SCLNs) (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, latent infection was established to a similar extent in WT and Bmal1/ mice (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To exclude that elevated infection levels were specific to MuHV-4, we infected mice with a different herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), by scarification of the left ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tracked the progression and extent of HSV-1 infection using a recombinant virus encoding luciferase under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CMV:luc HSV-1) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute HSV-1 infection was significantly enhanced in arrhythmic Bmal1/ mice (Fig 2 C and D and Fig S2 D and E), as with MuHV-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As infection progressed, Bmal1/ mice failed to contain HSV-1 spread, which disseminated across the head to the right ear (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with MuHV-4, although acute infection was more severe when circadian rhythms were disrupted, latent infection was established to a similar extent in both genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although apparent trends toward higher numbers of latent viral genomes in Bmal1/ mice was noted, this did not reach statistical significance (Fig S2F), suggesting that circadian rhythms principally modulate primary infection in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A more vigorous immune response to incoming virus at the onset of the active phase might oppose MuHV-4 infection at ZT10 in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated virus replication at different circadian times in synchronized cell models, which display robust 24-h rhythms but are not subject to systemic immune regulation (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our in vitro cellular clock model, we used confluent monolayers in which there were limited numbers of dividing cells, and no detectable circadian rhythm in cell cycle activity after synchronization (Fig S3 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used high resolution real-time bioluminescence recording to monitor both M3:luc MuHV-4 replication kinetics and the amount of virus replication (measured by total bioluminescence) correlated with infectious particle production (Fig 3B and Fig S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, when cell populations were infected with MuHV4 at different times in vitro, the time-of-day effect on infection observed in mice was recapitulated (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total bioluminescence was significantly increased in cells infected during the rising phase of Bmal1 expression (CT1824, indicated by open arrowheads) compared with cells infected during decline of Bmal1 expression (CT3036, indicated by solid arrowheads) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, MuHV-4 infection at different times significantly altered the rate of virus replication (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the entire kinetic profile of infection depended on the circadian phase the virus encountered, such that slower initial replication rates were associated with prolonged viral gene expression [Fig 3D and Fig S4D; Pearsons r = 0.999 (first cycle) or r = 0.982 (second cycle), P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, in agreement with our in vivo observations, MuHV-4 infection was significantly increased in primary Bmal1/ fibroblasts compared with WT cells (Fig 4 A and B and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When synchronized WT and Bmal1/ fibroblasts were infected at different circadian times (Fig S5A; CT of infection indicated by open and solid arrowheads), the time-of-day effect on MuHV-4 infection in WT cells was abolished in those from Bmal1/ mice (Fig 4C and Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, HSV-1 replication was significantly enhanced in Bmal1/ cells compared with WT cells (Fig 4 D and E and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cellular circadian clock exerts a major effect on herpesvirus infection, indicating that our observations in live mice do not simply result from circadian modulation of immune cell function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that cellular circadian rhythms impact on virus replication, we speculated that herpesviruses may manipulate the molecular clockwork during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess this, we infected mouse NIH 3T3 cells, expressing luciferase under the control of the Bmal1 promoter (Bmal:luc), with MuHV-4 at different circadian times (Fig 5A and Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MuHV-4 acutely induced Bmal1 expression from 6 h after infection, irrespective of the circadian phase at which the cells were infected (one-way ANOVA: peak Bmal1:luc, P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent cellular circadian rhythms during viral infection depended on the time at which cells were infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus-mediated Bmal1 induction during the endogenous fall in Bmal1 transcription generated a Bmal1 peak and disrupted circadian reporter expression (infection at CT18-24, indicated by open arrowhead in Fig 5A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, viral induction at other times (infection at CT3036; indicated by solid arrowhead in Fig 5A) enhanced the usual rise in Bmal1 transcription, and cellular rhythms remained robust for three cycles afterward (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly suggest that induction of Bmal1 expression by herpesviruses has different consequences for clock function depending on when in the circadian cycle infection occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analogous to arrhythmic Bmal1/ in vivo and cellular models, enhanced viral replication was observed in cells infected at circadian times when endogenous circadian rhythms were subsequently disrupted (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 D and E and 5 A and B; indicated by open arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse peripheral tissues that support herpesvirus replication, cellular CT24 corresponds to onset of the rest (light) period (14), where rapid, higher levels of initial replication would maximize the chance of transmission during the subsequent active (dark) phase 1224 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular CT36 corresponds to the onset of the active period, when slower, lower levels of replication would permit efficient transmission in the following active phase 2436 h later and perhaps reduce detection at a time when the immune system is primed for pathogen attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Critically, expression of repressive clock genes, such as mCryptochrome1 (mCry1) and mPeriod2 (mPer2), was not induced during viral infection (Fig 5C and Fig S6B), but a significant, rapid reduction was seen when cells were infected at CT18 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with MuHV-4 infection ushering cells from a repressive circadian phase to one where BMAL1 is active, via sustaining Bmal1 expression and relieving CRYPTOCHROME-mediated repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HSV-1 infection also acutely up-regulated Bmal1 (Fig 5D), even more so than MuHV-4, suggesting that Bmal1 is specifically targeted by both - and -herpesvirus families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, Bmal1 expression is induced in cells overexpressing viral transcriptional activators from either herpesviruses (Fig S7), and interactions between BMAL1/CLOCK and several HSV-1 transcriptional activators in vitro have been reported previously (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Herpesviruses co-opt cellular transcriptional mechanisms to replicate and target clock transcription factors (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked if the impact of BMAL1 ablation on viral infection extended beyond direct transcriptional regulation, to the global changes in cellular physiology that occur when circadian rhythms are disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this, we infected WT and Bmal1/cells with the orthomyxovirus, influenza A (IAV) (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAV replicates within the nucleus but encodes its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and therefore does not directly use the host cells transcriptional machinery for viral gene expression, in contrast to herpesviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, loss of BMAL1 also significantly augmented IAV protein expression and replication (PB2::GLUC bioluminescence two-way ANOVA: genotype effect, P = 0.0004; single-cycle growth two-way ANOVA: genotype effect, P = 0.0102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar impact of cellular arrhythmicity on two disparate, clinically relevant virus families implies a broader influence of circadian clocks, and specific components such as BMAL1, on viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which cellular systems underpin the time-of-day effect on viral replication, we first identified proteins that exhibit changes in abundance between opposite circadian phases (CT18 vs. CT30) in WT cells, when viral replication in WT, but not in Bmal1/ cells, was significantly different (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that virus infection is augmented in Bmal1/ cells at both time points (Fig 4C), we then focused on the subset of proteins within this group whose abundance was either increased or decreased at both of these times in Bmal1/ cells compared with WT cells (Fig 6 C and D and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circadian-regulated proteins expressed at higher levels in Bmal1/ cells were enriched for those involved in protein biosynthesis (Fig 6C, Fig S8A, and Table S1), including amino acid biosynthesis, ribosome structure, translation, and protein folding clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum function, protein localization, and intracellular vesicle trafficking were significantly enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that enhanced capability for viral protein biosynthesis, assembly, and egress contribute to clock control of virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, circadian-regulated proteins expressed at lower levels in Bmal1/ cells were enriched for those involved in organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and chromatin assembly (Fig 6D, Fig S8B, and Table S2), suggesting that virus particle uncoating, genome trafficking, and histone association contribute to clock control of virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, clock-mediated effects on viral infection in cells can be ascribed to discrete functional categories of protein effectors targeting specific aspects of the virus replication cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that altering only the time when hosts are infected significantly affects the extent of virus infection and dissemination in vivo, reflecting the profound change in physiology that naturally occurs over a day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host circadian rhythms underpin this phenomenon, because behaviorally arrhythmic mice show no such time-dependent differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the degree to which these intracellular pathogens replicate is a function of circadian time in isolated cells, without systemic circadian cues or host defenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For pathogens such as Plasmodia, which cause malaria, synchronizing their replication cycle with host circadian rhythms contributes to their success (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we speculate that coevolution of viruses with their host clocks enables them to capitalize on the predictability of daily rhythms driven by cell autonomous molecular clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable to our findings with herpesviruses, rhythmic gene expression can persist during hepatitis C virus and influenza A virus infection, albeit with altered circadian phase and amplitude (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such changes to host circadian rhythms enhance virus propagation between cells or transmission between hosts are open questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key feature of cellular clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli: initial time-of-day effects would be amplified if dysregulated timekeeping cues perpetuate from infected to neighboring uninfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results strongly suggest that herpesvirus and IAV replication increases in arrhythmic cells, as demonstrated by virus-induced disruption at certain circadian times or via loss of BMAL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, does this help or hinder persistence at the level of the host or population?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSV-1 disseminates more extensively in Bmal1/ mice, for example, but augmented primary productive replication may generate more robust adaptive immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How do viruses engage with the molecular clockwork and modulate timekeeping?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the simplest level, the circadian activity of host metabolic and trafficking pathways places constraints on replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, many viruses reprogram cellular metabolism, which can feedback directly to the core clock mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more intriguing possibility is that viruses actively gauge the cellular circadian phase via interaction with core clock components and exploit subsequent circadian variation in replication kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HSV-1 viral transactivator infected cell polypeptide 0 (ICP0) is thought to associate directly with BMAL1, whereas viral transcription is driven by a complex containing CLOCK (15, 16, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, why not associate with CLOCK directly and why use BMAL/CLOCK at all?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of CLOCK does not oscillate, and its circadian function is bestowed via interaction with BMAL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that herpesviruses recruit BMAL/CLOCK to lock viral transcription to cellular circadian time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that ICP0 induces Bmal1 expression outside the context of infection, implying that Bmal1 is specifically targeted, rather than a cell-intrinsic innate immune response to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this presents an apparent paradox, given that replication is enhanced in the absence of BMAL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why induce a protein that appears to exert an antiviral effect?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shifting cells from a repressive circadian phase via concomitant acute induction of Bmal1 and mCry1 repression likely stimulates replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One straightforward explanation is that chronic arrhythmicity in Bmal1/ cells generates a cellular environment less equipped to deal with viral challenge or that baseline levels of BMAL1 contribute to cell intrinsic antiviral immune responses (e.g., via IFN signaling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining viral pathogenicity in alternate clock knockout genetic models and in hosts subject to chronic circadian desynchrony will help disentangle such possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent paradox additionally highlights the complex nature of circadian investigations, in that clock proteins may be co-opted during virus replication in ways unrelated to their timekeeping function (non-circadian effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the global impact of circadian rhythmicity must be considered, rather than the effect of individual clock components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our work does imply that constitutively low levels of BMAL1 lead to increased herpes and influenza A viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, as well as its daily oscillation, Bmal1 expression undergoes seasonal variation in human blood samples, with lowest levels during the winter months (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this may contribute to viral dissemination at the population level because many viruses, including influenza, cause infection more commonly in the winter (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that global Bmal1 expression is substantially lower in mouse models of circadian desynchronization (23), our work also suggests that shift workers might be more susceptible to viral disease and therefore prime candidates for vaccination against viruses such as influenza.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, timing of influenza vaccine administration in the morning vs. afternoon has recently been shown to be a determinant in the systemic immunization response in people aged 65 y (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this, acute manipulation of the molecular circadian clockwork may provide a strategy for the development of novel antiviral therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animal experimentation was licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, with University of Cambridge Local Ethical Review.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals had ad libitum access to chow and water and were maintained on 12-h light:12-h dark cycles, with lights on and lights off designated ZT0 and ZT12, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stated ZTs, age-matched C57BL/6J WT (Bmal1+/+) and Bmal1/ mice were intranasally infected with 1 × 104 plaque-forming units (pfu) M3:luc MuHV-4 or 5 × 106 pfu CMV:luc HSV-1 by left ear scarification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescence imaging was performed with an IVIS Lumina and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_Bioluminescence_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary fibroblasts were generated as described previously (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circadian transcriptional rhythms were monitored using confluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC) transfected with mPeriod2:luciferase, mCryptochrome1:luciferase, or Bmal1:luciferase reporters and temporally synchronized by temperature cycles (32 °C:37 °C; 12 h:12 h) or 100 nM dexamethasone treatment (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison between in vivo and in vitro experiments, peak Bmal1:luc bioluminescence was operationally designated as CT = 0/24 h. M3:luc MuHV-4 and CMV:luc HSV-1 infections were performed at high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 13 pfu/cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescence was monitored using a LumiCycle-32 system (Actimetrics) or Alligator Bioluminescence Incubator System (Cairn Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PB2::GLUC IAV (MOI = 2 pfu/cell) replication was assessed by sampling medium at intervals postinfection and determining Gaussia luciferase activity using a BioLux Kit (NEB E3300L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synchronized, confluent primary WT and Bmal1/ cells were harvested at either CT = 18 h or CT = 30 h. Lysates were digested and labeled with tandem mass tags (TMTs) according to the manufacturers instructions (Thermo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide mixtures were separated on a 50-cm, 75-m-ID Pepmap column over a 3-h gradient at 40 °C and eluted directly into the mass spectrometer (Thermo Q Exactive Orbitrap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xcalibur software was used to control the data acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 was used to process the raw data acquired with a reporter ion quantification method (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Uniprot KB database of mouse sequences was used for peptide identification [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.1%].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-tailed t tests were performed in Perseus (FDR cutoff = 0.05; within-groups variance S0 factor = 0.1) to identify proteins significantly different between CT18 and CT30 in WT cells, but not Bmal1/ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group was then tested via two-tailed t test for significant differences between WT and Bmal1/ cells at both CT18 and CT30 (FDR cutoff = 0.05), presented graphically in R using the HeatMap package and subject to Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation clustering analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outputs were graphically presented using Cytoscape EnrichmentMap and annotated using Clustermaker Markov Cluster Algorithm and WordCloud (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample size was determined using the resource equation: E (degrees of freedom in ANOVA) = (total number of experimental animals)  (number of experimental groups), with sample size adhering to the condition 10 less_than E less_than 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison of MuHV-4 and HSV-1 infection in WT vs. Bmal1/ mice at ZT7 (Fig 2), the investigator did not know the genotype of the animals when conducting infections, bioluminescence imaging, and quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bioluminescence imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally with endotoxin-free luciferin (Promega E6552) using 2 mg total per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following anesthesia with isofluorane, they were scanned with an IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life Sciences), 15 min after luciferin administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal intensity was quantified using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences), obtaining maximum radiance for designated regions of interest (photons per second per square centimeter per Steradian: photonss1cm2sr1), relative to a negative control region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 d after infection, mice were culled, and tissue was removed for analysis of latent infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Virus_Latency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analysis of MuHV-4 latent infection in mice, viral genome loads were measured by real-time PCR using DNA extracted from spleen tissue as previously described (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MuHV-4 M2 gene was amplified using a Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbett Research), and PCR products were quantified by hybridization with a Taqman probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome copy number was determined by comparison with a standard curve of cloned M2 plasmid templates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular DNA was quantified in parallel by amplifying part of the adenosine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (APRT) and the ratio of MuHV-4 genome copies to APRT determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactivation of latent MuHV-4 was measured by infectious center assay: spleens were disrupted into single-cell suspensions and serial dilutions were cocultured with cell monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 6 d, cells were fixed and stained for plaque counting, as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of HSV-1 latent infection in mice, viral genome loads were measured by real-time PCR using DNA extracted from dorsal root ganglion tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSV-1 ICP0 gene were amplified using a Rotor Gene 3000, and PCR products were quantified by hybridization with a Taqman probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome copy number was determined by comparison with a standard curve of cloned ICP0 plasmid templates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular DNA was quantified in parallel by amplifying part of the APRT gene and the ratio of HSV-1 genome copies to APRT determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All cells were propagated in DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose (Sigma D6546), supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FetalClone III serum (Thermo Scientific HyClone), 1× Glutamax (Life Technologies), 100 U penicillin/mL, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (PenicillinStreptomycin Solution; Sigma P0781).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfections were conducted using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After synchronization, cells were transferred to Air Medium, containing DMEM (Sigma D5030) supplemented with 5 g/L glucose, 20 mM Hepes, 100 U penicillin/mL, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 0.035% NaHCO3, FetalClone III serum, 1× Glutamax, 2× B-27 Supplement (Life Technologies 17504-044), and 0.3 mM Luciferin (Biosynth L8220).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were initiated 24 h after cells were transferred to constant conditions, so that they would not be subject to any effects of the synchronization treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescence was monitored using a LumiCycle-32 system (Actimetrics), and recordings were analyzed using LumiCycle Data Analysis software (Actimetrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Cycle_Analysis_of_Confluent_Cell_Monolayers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NIH 3T3, primary WT, and Bmal1/ fibroblasts were sequentially transduced with lentiviral fluorescent ubiquitin-based cell cycle indicators (FUCCI) mCherry::Cdt1 and amCyan::Geminin reporters (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual reporter-positive cells were selected by FACS (Influx Cell Sorter; BD Biosciences) and seeded onto 35-mm dishes for subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that expression of mCherry::Cdt1 and amCyan::Geminin correspond to G1 (2n DNA content) and S/G2 (2 less_than n  4 DNA content) cell cycle phases, respectively, cells were stained with DNA dye DRAQ5 (abcam) and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR-Fortessa; BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine dynamics of replicative activity under experimental confluent conditions, synchronized FUCCI reporter monolayers were observed by time-lapse live cell imaging over 3 d (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted epifluorescent microscope).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stated circadian times, numbers of mCherry::Cdt1- and amCyan::Geminin-positive cells were counted, and their ratio was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate MuHV-4 and HSV-1 stocks, infected BHK21 cells were harvested following the development of cytopathic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus titer was determined by plaque assay as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MuHV-4, BHK21 or NIH 3T3 cell monolayers were incubated (2 h at 37 °C) with 10-fold dilutions of virus then overlaid with 0.6% carboxymethylcellulose to limit progeny virus spread to adjacent cells only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 d, cells were fixed in 10% (wt/vol) formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue for plaque counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For HSV-1, BHK21 cells were incubated (45 min at 37 °C) in suspension with 10-fold dilutions of virus before supplementation with 1% carboxymethylcellulose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 12 d, cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue for plaque counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT and PB2::GLUC IAV stocks were amplified in 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs and titrated by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IAV titration, Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers were incubated (1 h at 37 °C) with virus in serum-free medium and then overlaid with 1.2% Avicel (IMCD)/DMEM plus 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical), 0.14% BSA (Sigma), and 1× Glutamax (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 d, cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue for plaque counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, single-cycle growth curves were performed as follows: parallel cell cultures were infected with WT IAV (MOI = 5 pfu/cell; 37 °C) and after 1 h any remaining input virus was removed by acid washing (40 mM citric acid, pH 3, 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stated times after infection, cultures were harvested and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of infectious virus produced within the time stated was determined by plaque assay as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlation_of_Viral_Bioluminescence_and_Infectious_Particle_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To correlate M3:luciferase MuHV-4 (M3:luc MuHV-4) and CMV:luciferase HSV-1 (CMV:luc HSV-1) bioluminescence with production of infectious particles, parallel confluent fibroblast monolayers were incubated with luciferase viruses at a range of multiplicities of infection (MOI; 20.001 pfu/cell for M3:luc MuHV-4; 100.001 pfu/cell for CMV:luc HSV-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Input virus was then removed by acid washing (40 mM citric acid, pH 3, 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescence was monitored in real time using a Lumicycle-32 (Actimetrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stated times after infection, parallel cultures were harvested and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of infectious virus produced was determined by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total bioluminescence acquired during stated times after infection was determined by the area under curve (AUC) method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation analysis was performed using linear regression (total bioluminescence vs. log10 pfu produced by equivalent cultures over the same time frame during exponential growth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ICP0_in_Vitro_Expression_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ICP0 adenoviral vectors were a kind gift from Anna Salvetti and Marie-Claude Geoffroy (INSERM U649, Nantes, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Tet-On system comprises Ad.CMV.rtTA (expressing rtTA from the HCMV immediate early promoter), Ad.TRE.ICP0 [expressing ICP0 from a tetracycline-responsive (TRE) promoter], and Ad.TRE.FXE [expressing a nonfunctional RING-finger deletion mutant (FXE) of ICP0 from a TRE promoter] as previously described (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIH 3T3 cells expressing the Bmal1:luc reporter construct were infected with the adenovirus vectors alone or in combination (Ad.CMV.rtTA: MOI = 10 pfu/cell; Ad.TRE.ICP0 or Ad.TRE.FXE: MOI = 4 pfu/cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 46 h of bioluminescence recording, doxycycline (Dox) was added (1 µg/mL) and bioluminescence recording resumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteomics__Lysis_and_Alkylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary fibroblasts from WT (Bmal1+/+) and Bmal1/ mice were grown to confluence in 6-well plates (n = 3 per time point) and synchronized with 100 nM dexamethasone for 20 min, and their medium was exchanged and then incubated under constant conditions (37 °C in darkness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then harvested by briefly washing with ice-cold PBS and incubating with lysis buffer (250 mM Hepes, 1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mM DTPA) for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first time point was designated Circadian Time (CT)18 and the other CT30 based on the assessment of cells expressing the Bmal1:luc or the Per2:luc reporter that were synchronized in parallel (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3C and 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After scraping the cell monolayers into 1.5-mL tubes, lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 16,100 × g in a bench top microfuge for 10 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Pierce) and 100 g per condition transferred into a new tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final volume was adjusted to 100 L with lysis buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then reduced with 5 L 200 mM TCEP and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. Five microliters of 375 mM iodoacetamide was added to alkylate proteins and incubated for 30 min, protected from light, at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alkylation reaction was quenched by adding 600 L ice-cold acetone and protein precipitated by incubating at 20 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the following day, the samples were centrifuged at 16,100 × g in a bench top microfuge for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acetone was removed, and the pellets were air-dried for 5 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteomics__Digestion_and_TMT_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acetone-precipitated pellets were resuspended in 100 L 100 mM TEAB aided by sonication on ice for 10 cycles (30 s on; 30 s off; medium power) in a Bioruptor sonicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trypsin (2.5 g Promega Trypsin Gold) per 100 g protein sample, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial incubation, a further 2.5 g trypsin was added, and the digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMT labeling was performed according to the manufacturers instructions (Thermo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the TMT labeling reagents were resuspended by adding 82 L anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) to each vial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 41 L TMT reagent was added to the digested proteins and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with occasional vortexing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight microliters of 5% hydroxylamine was then added to the samples and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to quench the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMT-labeled samples were combined after elution at equimolar ratios (as below) and dried by vacuum centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Proteomics__Cleanup_and_LC-MS_MS_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peptides dried by vacuum centrifugation were cleaned up in preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis using C18 Stage Tips with a centrifuge-based protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides were then aliquoted and taken to dryness by vacuum centrifugation and may be stored at 80°C until required for LC-MS/MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled peptide samples were resuspended in 50 L 0.1% TFA, sonicated for 15 min, and injected (5 L per injection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide mixtures were separated on a 50-cm, 75-m-ID Pepmap column over a 3-h gradient at 40 °C and eluted directly into the mass spectrometer (Thermo Q Exactive Orbitrap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xcalibur software was used to control the data acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instrument was run in data dependent acquisition mode with the top 10 most abundant peptides selected for tandem MS (MS/MS) by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 and an ion target of 3 × 106.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCD scans were performed with 35% normalized collision energy (NCE) at 35,000 resolution (at m/z 200), and the ion target was set to 2 × 105 to avoid coalescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteomics__Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 was used to process the raw data acquired with a reporter ion quantification method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Uniprot KB database of mouse sequences was used for peptide identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides identified with CI values 95% were used for protein identification and quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Database searching parameters included precursor ion mass tolerance of 5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da, digestion by trypsin, TMT 6-plex modification of peptide N termini and lysine residues, with dynamic modifications at oxidation (M), deamination (N,Q), in addition to the static modifications at Methylthio (C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A peptide estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 was used to generate tables with protein and peptide identifications and quantifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feature matching was enabled between runs for peptide identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter ion intensity (corrected and uncorrected) was imported into Perseus v1.5.2.6 for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summary statistics were calculated on log2 transformed reporter ion intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data quality obtained from the TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis was checked by S-curve analysis and polygon and volcano plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrected intensities were normalized by subtracting the mean value for each reporter ion column from each intensity within that column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histograms revealed normal distributions centered on zero, confirming that this transformation was successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare values more easily, data for each protein was normalized by the z-score method across all time-points and genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were then used for subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-tailed t tests were performed in Perseus using an FDR cutoff of 0.05, and a within-groups variance S0 factor of 0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDR was calculated by permutation-based method using n = 250 permutations per test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins showing significant difference between CT18 and CT30 in WT cells, but not Bmal1/ cells, were subsequently tested via two-tailed t test for significant differences between WT and Bmal1/ cells at both CT18 and CT30 (FDR cutoff, 0.05) and presented graphically in R using the HeatMap package (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins meeting both significance criteria were then subjected to DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering analysis (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outputs were graphically presented using Cytoscape EnrichmentMap application and annotated using Clustermaker Markov Cluster Algorithm and WordCloud.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For animal experiments, two-way ANOVA was performed on log10-transformed values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normality and equality of variance were confirmed by the KolmogorovSmirnov test and Levenes median test, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple two-tailed t tests with an FDR cutoff of 0.05 were also performed (*P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cellular assays with multiple groups, ANOVA was performed with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons (*P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equality of variance was confirmed via the BrownForsythe test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cellular assays with two groups, two-tailed t tests with Welchs correction were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-tests were used to compare variances and variances were not significantly different unless stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For luciferase herpesvirus cellular assays, raw bioluminescence values were background-subtracted (bioluminescence  bioluminescence at t = 0 h after infection) and total bioluminescence was calculated using the AUC method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experiment, total bioluminescence values were normalized (0% = bioluminescence at t = 01 h; 100% = maximum total bioluminescence value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of virus replication kinetic parameters (Hill slope, time to 50% peak infection, and time to 50% decrease from peak infection), raw bioluminescence values were subject to asymmetric sigmoidal nonlinear regression as illustrated in Fig 3B, with goodness of fit reported by the coefficient of determination, R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons analysis was performed to test for correlations, with the correlation coefficient (r) and two-tailed P values reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PB2::GLUC IAV cellular assays and raw bioluminescence values were background-subtracted (PB2::LUC-infected bioluminescence  mock-infected bioluminescence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were subject to sigmoidal doseresponse (variable slope) nonlinear regression to determine plateau bioluminescence, with goodness of fit reported by R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total IAV PB2::GLuc bioluminescence was calculated using the AUC method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
