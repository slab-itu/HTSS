Molecular evidence of keratin and melanosomes in feathers of the Early Cretaceous bird Eoconfuciusornis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report fossil evidence of feather structural protein (beta-keratin) from a 130-My-old basal bird (Eoconfuciusornis) from the famous Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota, which has produced many feathered dinosaurs, early birds, and mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple independent molecular analyses of both microbodies and associated matrix recovered from the fossil feathers confirm that these microbodies are indeed melanosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use transmission electron microscopy and immunogold to show localized binding of antibodies raised against feather protein to matrix filaments within these ancient feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work sheds new light on molecular constituents of tissues preserved in fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microbodies associated with feathers of both nonavian dinosaurs and early birds were first identified as bacteria but have been reinterpreted as melanosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas melanosomes in modern feathers are always surrounded by and embedded in keratin, melanosomes embedded in keratin in fossils has not been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide multiple independent molecular analyses of both microbodies and the associated matrix recovered from feathers of a new specimen of the basal bird Eoconfuciusornis from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work represents the oldest ultrastructural and immunological recognition of avian beta-keratin from an Early Cretaceous (130-Ma) bird.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply immunogold to identify protein epitopes at high resolution, by localizing antibodyantigen complexes to specific fossil ultrastructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retention of original keratinous proteins in the matrix surrounding electron-opaque microbodies supports their assignment as melanosomes and adds to the criteria employable to distinguish melanosomes from microbial bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work sheds new light on molecular preservation within normally labile tissues preserved in fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossil_Feather_Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to demonstrate that samples 201 to 205 were preserved as three-dimensional, thick carbon sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM images of the fossil feathers (Fig 1 FJ) were compared with those of G. gallus remiges (Fig 1 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher magnifications, much of the fossil is composed of 3D microbodies, with some regions retaining a very thin carbon layer (Fig 1 FI) that covers the microbodies (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This thin layer displays fibrous bundles in arrays that form regular angles (Fig 1 G and I), a feature previously reported in the epicortex of G. gallus feathers (27) and also observed in Fig 1 C and D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms microstructural similarity between Eoconfuciusornis and extant G. gallus feathers (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microbodies preserved in Eoconfuciusornis STM 7-144 are distinct, relatively uniform, elongated, electron-dense, and embedded in a less electron-dense filamentous matrix (Fig 2 A and B), patterns also observed in extant feathers (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both filaments and microbodies are more densely packed in the fossils, suggesting some diagenetic alteration perhaps involving compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A polyclonal antiserum raised against extracts of mature modern white chicken feathers (28) was used to test the hypothesis that the exceptional microstructural preservation in these fossil feathers extended to the molecular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling support the presence of epitopes in fossil tissues consistent with beta-keratin, a family of proteins not produced by either mammals or microbes but that comprise 90% of proteins in extant feathers (28) and are coexpressed with alpha-keratin in the skin, beak, and claw tissues of reptiles and birds (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are also referred to as corneous proteins (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific immunoreactivity to components within the fossil feathers of Eoconfuciusornis (Fig 3) was revealed by tissue-specific, although weaker, localization of fluorescence signal (Fig 3 C and D) in a pattern comparable to extant black chicken feathers used as a positive control (Fig 3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No fluorescence was present in any controls, where the primary antiserum was omitted, but all other steps were kept identical (Fig 3 A, B, E, and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, antibodies to hemoglobin (a protein found in vertebrate red blood cells, used as an irrelevant control) and peptidoglycan (a glycosaminoglycan produced exclusively by bacteria) did not react with the fossil feather sample (Fig S1), supporting both the persistence of keratinous components and the specificity of the anti-feather antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied the same anti-feather antiserum (28) to ultrathin sections (90-nm) of fossil and modern black feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding was detected using a secondary antibody conjugated to 12-nm gold particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gold particles were seen associated with fibril bundles measuring 3 nm, consistent with filaments of beta-keratin matrix (Fig 4 GI), but were sparsely distributed relative to binding in modern controls (Fig 4 D and FL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other structures, including the electron-dense microbodies and needle-shaped structures probably of diagenetic origin, were completely unlabeled (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4E and 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No gold particles were visible in the negative controls (omitting the primary antiserum) (Fig 4 AC), similar to results from immunofluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher-resolution immunoelectron localization of gold particles generally confirms the binding of the anti-feather antiserum visualized in fluorescence microscopy, and verifies that these fossil feathers partially preserved the molecular structure of the featherkeratin epitopes, which remains immunoreactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChemiSTEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained high-resolution elemental maps of ultrathin sections of fossil feathers using ChemiSTEM technology [FEI Titan G2 series of Cs-corrected STEM (scanning/transmission electron microscopy)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology reveals the elemental distribution of nanogold particles bound to antibodies (Fig 5 BD and IK) and identifies, at high spatial resolution, other elements (e.g., N) that would be expected to be present in organic remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology also identifies and localizes potential diagenetic compounds (e.g., calcium mineral morphs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies tagged with gold localize to and overlap with relatively high concentrations of sulfur in both ancient (Fig 5 AC) and modern (Fig 5 E, I, and J) feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keratin molecules incorporate the S-bearing amino acid residue cysteine in relatively high concentrations (31, 32), supporting the hypothesis that these antibodies are most likely binding keratin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied the same technology to modern feathers to show that extant melanosomes contain higher concentrations of copper, sulfur, and calcium (Fig 6 GJ) than are seen in the keratin matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the elements Cu, S, and Ca localize to electron-dense microbodies visualized in the fossil feathers (Fig 6 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that the keratinous matrix surrounding melanosomes in modern feathers (Fig 6 K and L) contains greater concentrations of carbon and nitrogen than are seen in fossil feathers (Fig 6 E and F), indicating a possible diagenetic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fossil feathers also show needle-shaped structures (Fig 5A) that are high in Ca (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that these structures are most likely of diagenetic origin (Fig 5F) and possibly microbially mediated, because they are not found in modern feathers and their shape is consistent with early diagenetic morphs of calcium-containing minerals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, phosphorus is barely measurable, and does not map to the Ca signal, so a CaPO4 mineral morph can be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elemental maps obtained from lower-magnification images using environmental scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (ESEM-EDS) (Fig S2) indicate a higher concentration of Ca in the fossil feather material, which maps to both the microbodies and the needle-like mineral structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The smooth and dense outer cortex of the feathers of Eoconfuciusornis was imaged using SEM and compared with that of extant chicken feathers at the same magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both samples, immediately below this dense cortex, 3D microbodies were present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanosomes are suspended in a beta-keratin matrix (33), a pattern and distribution similar to what is seen in Eoconfuciusornis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM analyses of modern feathers rarely showed melanosomes, as these are obscured by the dense outer feather cortex, and melanosomes herein were not visualized unless this cortex was removed (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this dense cortex is rarely observed in fossil feathers, exposing microbodies for easier observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the cortex disintegrated early in diagenesis, as seen in taphonomic experiments of feather degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TEM of 90-nm sections taken from Eoconfuciusornis feathers was comparable to images of modern feathers in that the matrix of both samples contained filaments consistent with fibrillar keratin and electron-dense bodies consistent with melanosomes in size, orientation, and location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, although suggestive, imaging alone is not conclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesized that the exceptional ultrastructural preservation may extend to the molecular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capitalizing on the specificity and sensitivity of the vertebrate immune response, which has been used successfully to characterize other originally keratinous fossil material (34, 35), we show that antibodies raised against feather proteins (28) react specifically with ancient feathers in in situ experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding, as visualized by green fluorescence signal, is reduced in intensity but comparable in pattern and distribution to that of extant feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased intensity of antibody binding in the fossil feather may be due to several factors: (i) greater degradation resulting in a reduced number of recognizable epitopes; (ii) some epitopes present in modern feathers (against which the antibody was raised) may not have been present at this early stage in avian evolution (29, 36); or (iii) epitopes may be blocked or masked by infiltration with minerals or other factors resulting from diagenetic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the results we observed by immunofluorescence labeling, we applied nanogold (12-nm)-labeled antibodies to 90-nm sections of fossil feathers and observed localized binding under TEM, which allows much higher resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the anti-feather antibodies localize to filaments within the matrix, supporting the hypothesis that the matrix is composed of material consistent with filamentous beta-keratin proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No gold labeling was detected in or associated with the microbodies embedded in this matrix in either fossil or extant feathers (Fig 4), supporting the specificity of antibody binding to keratinous matrix but not other components of the feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments produced complementary data that confirm the presence of molecules consistent with feather keratins in the fossil tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution elemental mapping (ChemiSTEM) adds additional information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique showed that regions binding antibodies complexed to gold also demonstrate a relatively high concentration of both sulfur and nitrogen, which would be expected in keratinous material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The keratin protein family incorporates high concentrations of amino acids rich in sulfur (31, 32), whereas carbon and nitrogen are common to all amino acids and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the possibility that the sulfur signals might be enlarged by the antibodies cannot be fully excluded based on the present experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, it has been demonstrated that certain trace elements, such as copper, sulfur, and calcium, are present in both fossil and modern melanosome-bearing tissues, and it has been suggested that these elements may be used as biomarkers for melanin-derived compounds in fossils (2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is problematic, however, in that all Cu, S, and Ca are also derived from bacterially induced decay as well as many diagenetic processes (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the ways to differentiate between melanosomes and morphologically similar bacteria is to directly correlate, at high resolution, these trace elements to the microstructures but not the surrounding matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resolution of either ESEM-EDS or synchrotron rapid scanning X-ray fluorescence (SRS-XRF) maps is not sufficient to attribute the elements specifically to any organelles (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution elemental maps achieved by ChemiSTEM technology display high levels of copper and sulfur in both the modern melanosomes and ancient microbodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus confirms that both Cu and S colocalize to proposed melanin-bearing organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although S is also observed in both the fossil feather matrix and the microbodies, Cu is found only within the melanosomes, indicating little diagenetic movement and supporting the original distribution of this element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we conclude that the microbodies examined herein are indeed the fossilized remains of melanin-bearing organelles and that they contain high concentrations of the original trace elements of the living organisms preserved through geological time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another notable trace metal is calcium, which was once thought to be chelated by and affect the chemical properties of melanin (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this association, it was proposed that Ca distribution could be used as a proxy for melanin distribution in fossil feathers (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies, the SRS-XRF maps of Ca in the neck region of a specimen of Confuciusornis sanctus showed a strong correlation with Cu (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ESEM-EDS maps (Fig S2) also suggest that the distribution of Ca strongly correlates with diagenetically altered feather structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the high-resolution elemental maps show that Ca signal is much weaker in melanosomes of extant feathers compared with that in the microbodies of fossil feathers and, although Cu is localized within proposed melanosomes in the fossil, Ca maps to both microbodies and the needle-shaped structures within the featherkeratin matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Ca-concentrated needle-shaped structures are absent in extant feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that precipitation of calcium, possibly mediated by microbes during the fossilization process, facilitated ultrastructural and molecular preservation of the feathers by stabilizing them at the molecular level before they could completely degrade (5, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has long been known that the association with mineral substrates greatly enhances the preservation potential of biomolecules (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it has been proposed that calcium may incorporate into molecular fragments, conferring stability, and that this process may be microbially mediated (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the surrounding sediments of this Eoconfuciusornis specimen consist mainly of Al silicates, with little or no calcium detected, the source of the calcium observed in these feathers remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular dating techniques suggest that feather beta-keratin diverged from feather-like beta-keratins about 143 Ma (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these molecular dates are correct, feathers of Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis were constitutively distinct from those of extant bird feathers, and thus feather structure preceded modern feather proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular data show that only in the Early Cretaceous did feather beta-keratins begin to diversify to their modern forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecular changes conferred greater elasticity to feathers than is seen in materials composed of other types of beta-keratin (29), thus optimizing the material properties of feathers for flight (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversification of feather beta-keratin genes coincided with and perhaps facilitated the radiation of modern birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another factor that may contribute to the unique biomaterial properties of feathers is the epidermal differentiation cysteine-rich protein (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This molecule has the same gene structure as beta-keratins, and is coexpressed with them at certain stages of development in most keratinized tissues of living birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is only in feathers that this protein continues to be detected throughout life (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatly elevated cysteine levels in this protein facilitate intramolecular cross-linking, and contribute to the stability and resistance of feathers to degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further molecular recovery of ancient feather materials may allow direct testing of these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multiple independent analyses used in this study provide strong evidence for the retention of original and phylogenetically significant protein components in Eoconfuciusornis STM 7-144, and are consistent with the identification of melanosomes as well as keratin filaments in these ancient (130-Ma) tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the oldest report of ultrastructure consistent with beta-keratin from an Early Cretaceous bird feather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying keratin is key to ruling out a microbial source for microbodies identified in fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the depositional context and mode of preservation of this bird are similar to those of numerous other Early Cretaceous Jehol birds (and dinosaurs) and Jurassic Yanliao dinosaurs in China (13, 10, 11, 13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity suggests that other fossils preserved at these localities could provide additional sources of molecular information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, our study incorporating specific antibody reactivity in this Early Cretaceous specimen demonstrates the benefit of testing other fossil tissue samples with antisera generated against specific protein epitopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such tests have the potential not only to distinguish between keratinous feathers and skin-derived collagen fibers (43, 44) but also to characterize the molecular composition of early feathers and elucidate steps leading to the evolution, at the molecular level, of modern bird feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight samples (S102, S111, S112, S201, S202, S203, S204, and S205) removed from STM 7-144 were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples S102, S111, and S112 were directly observed by SEM without coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples S201, S202, S203, S204, and S205, which were selected for molecular analysis, were washed successively in 75% (vol/vol) ethanol and E-pure water and ultrasonically cleaned to avoid potential contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then dried under a biological hood, and the surface structure was documented using SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the samples were put into 50% HF for 3 to 5 d to dissolve the silicon minerals of the matrix and washed with E-pure water three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 1- to 2-mm3 samples were selected to be dehydrated in two changes of 70% ethanol for 30 min each, followed by one change of a mixture of LR White (medium-grade) and 70% ethanol (2:1) for 1 h, followed by another two changes of 100% LR White for 1 h each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process was carried out at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the samples were moved to gelatin capsules, filled with 100% LR White, covered to exclude oxygen, and allowed to polymerize for 24 h at 60 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome with a DiATOME 45° knife was used to cut 200-nm sections for immunohistochemistry analysis and 90-nm sections for TEM observations, immunogold tests, and ChemiSTEM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extant feathers were treated in the same way but sectioned with a different diamond knife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither fossils nor extant feathers were fixed, and only the extant feathers were stained with uranyl acetate (5 min) and Reynolds lead citrate (8 min) before the TEM morphological observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were repeated multiple times to validate results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dried samples were mounted on stubs with double-sided carbon tape (S111 and S112), and one sample from an extant chicken feather was coated with 10 nm of gold/palladium for 30 s. The SEM-EDS data were collected from uncoated S102, S201, S203, S204, and S205.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were imaged with a Leo 1530 VP analytical scanning electron microscope controlled by JEOL InTouchScope version 1.05A software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two detectors were used for taking SEM images: (i) a normal secondary electron detector, used at high vacuum and 1 to 5 keV, and (ii) a variable-pressure secondary electron detector, used at low vacuum and 10 to 20 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 90-nm sections were mounted on carbon-coated copper grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were stained with 5% methanolic uranyl acetate (5 min), washed in E-pure water, stained with Reynolds lead citrate (8 min), and washed in E-pure water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were imaged using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (AATC) from Nanjing Forestry University and a JEM-2100Plus transmission electron microscope from the State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, at 80 to 100 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the production of anti-feather antibody, see Moyer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The autofluorescence immune-labeling protocol was modified from Schweitzer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 200-nm sections were mounted on six-well Teflon-coated slides, with about 10 sections in each well, and dried overnight at 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were etched with 25 g/mL proteinase K in 1× PBS at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) (30 min) and last with NaBH4 (twice for 10 min each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubations were interrupted by two 5-min washes in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following these steps to accomplish epitope retrieval and quenching of autofluorescence, 4% normal goat serum in PBS was applied to occupy nonspecific binding sites and prevent spurious binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-feather, 1:200; polyclonal rabbit anti-hemoglobin, 1:200; monoclonal mouse anti-peptidoglycan, 1:200) in primary dilution buffer overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sections were then incubated with secondary antibody [biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (antibody recognizes both heavy and light chains)] (Vector Laboratories; BA-1000) diluted 1:500 for rabbit primary antibodies, and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories; BA-9200) diluted 1:500 for monoclonal mouse anti-peptidoglycan, for 2 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then incubated with fluorescein avidin D [fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC); Vector Laboratories; A-2001] for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All incubations were interrupted by sequential washes (twice for 10 min each) in PBS/Tween 20 followed by two 10-min rinses in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories; H-1000) and coverslips were applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus biological microscope and captured using an AxioCam MRc 5 (Zeiss) with 10× ocular magnification on the Axioskop 2 Plus in the AxioVision software package (version 4.7.0.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The postembedding TEM immunogold-labeling protocol was modified from the methods shared in the protocol database from IHCWORLD Life Science Products & Services (www.ihcworld.com/_protocols/em/post_immunoem_embed812.htm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 90-nm sections were collected on carbon-coated nickel grids (EMS; CFT200-NI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grids were incubated in PBS/Tween 20 for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four percent normal donkey serum in PBS was applied to occupy nonspecific binding sites and prevent spurious binding for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grids were incubated in primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-feather, 1:20) in primary dilution buffer for 3 h at RT and then washed with PBS/Tween 20, 10 times for 2 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All grids were then incubated with secondary antibody [12-nm Colloidal Gold AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), 1:20; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 711-205-152] for 1 h. The grids were rinsed with PBS/Tween 20, 10 times for 2 min each and in E-pure water three times for 30 s each, and dried with filter paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were observed using the FEI Titan G2 80-300 electron microscope at the Analytical Instrumentation Facility (AIF) of North Carolina State University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChemiSTEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sections (90-nm) were collected on carbon-coated nickel grids (EMS; CFT200-NI) and analyzed with an FEI Titan G2 80-300 electron microscope at the AIF of North Carolina State University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FEI Titan G2 series of Cs-corrected scanning/transmission electron microscopes with the revolutionary ChemiSTEM technology is applied in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new technology greatly enhances EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) detection sensitivity due to a number of innovations in the system architecture, including the X-FEG (a high-brightness Schottky field emission gun source), Super-X EDX detector system (four windowless silicon drift detectors with shutters integrated deeply into the objective lens), and high-speed electronics capable of 100,000 spectra readouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new system architecture provides many performance benefits, such as improved light element detection, better sample tilt response, faster mapping, and atomic chemical mapping capabilities of crystalline structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
