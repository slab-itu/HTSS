Tunable allosteric library of caspase-3 identifies coupling between conserved water molecules and conformational selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interconversion of states in the caspase-3 native ensemble is affected by binding of ligands that either stabilize or destabilize active-site loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear how the ensemble is regulated in cells, aside from modulating levels of endogenous caspase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a library of caspase-3 variants with activities that vary by more than four orders of magnitude and show that removal of conserved water molecules may provide a strategy to design novel allosteric inhibitors that globally destabilize the active conformation within the ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that posttranslational modifications fine-tune caspase activity by disrupting conserved water networks, and our database provides an approach to examine caspase signaling in cells by modifying caspase-3 activity while simultaneously maintaining endogenous enzyme levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The native ensemble of caspases is described globally by a complex energy landscape where the binding of substrate selects for the active conformation, whereas targeting an allosteric site in the dimer interface selects an inactive conformation that contains disordered active-site loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations and posttranslational modifications stabilize high-energy inactive conformations, with mostly formed, but distorted, active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the interconversion of active and inactive states in the ensemble, we used detection of related solvent positions to analyze 4,995 waters in 15 high-resolution (less_than2.0 Å) structures of wild-type caspase-3, resulting in 450 clusters with the most highly conserved set containing 145 water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that regions of the protein that contact the conserved waters also correspond to sites of posttranslational modifications, suggesting that the conserved waters are an integral part of allosteric mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we created a library of 19 caspase-3 variants through saturation mutagenesis in a single position of the allosteric site of the dimer interface, and we show that the enzyme activity varies by more than four orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our database consists of 37 high-resolution structures of caspase-3 variants, and we demonstrate that the decrease in activity correlates with a loss of conserved water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that the activity of caspase-3 can be fine-tuned through globally desolvating the active conformation within the native ensemble, providing a mechanism for cells to repartition the ensemble and thus fine-tune activity through conformational selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Caspase allosteric regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Active caspase-3 dimer showing active site loops L1L4 and L2 from each protomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Model for allosteric regulation of caspases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procaspase native ensemble contains at least two states and favors the inactive conformations, whereas the mature caspase native ensemble contains several states, including the active conformation (state 1), a low-energy state with disordered active site loops (state 3), and a high-energy state with displaced catalytic groups (state 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maturation of the procaspase is influenced by PTMs or signaling cascades (Bad-Bax, for example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active conformation (state 1) is selected by the binding of substrate, whereas inactive conformations (states 2 and 3) are selected by the binding of allosteric ligands or PTMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global_Analysis_of_Caspase-3_Solvation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a global analysis of solvation using the recently described DRoP program (30), which analyzes positions of water molecules in related X-ray crystal structures to cluster the waters in crystallographically related positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One also determines the level of conservation for each water molecule as well as conserved contact positions on the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our database consisted of 15 high-resolution (less_than2 Å) structures of wild-type caspase-3 and contained 4,995 water molecules (Fig 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After clustering and conservation analysis, we identified 450 unique clusters (Fig 2B), which we grouped based on degree of conservation in the database: 93%, 8093%, 6679%, and less_than66% (Fig 2C, blue, cyan, orange, and red, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved waters, defined as the group present in 14 of the 15 structures (93%), comprise 145 water molecules and are the focus of the subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the conserved waters interact with active-site loops and helices on or near the protein surface (Fig 2C, blue spheres, and Fig 3A), particularly in the dimer interface, whereas the least-conserved waters (less_than66%) are located in the substrate-binding groove and chain termini (Fig 2C, red spheres).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that there was no effect on the conserved waters from crystal packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formation of the intact active site involves movement of active site loop 3 (L3) from a solvent-exposed position, in which the loop is mostly disordered, to the active position, where the loop forms the substrate-binding groove along the protein surface (Fig 1A) (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the substrate-binding pocket is drythat is, it does not contain conserved watersseveral conserved waters are observed to connect the C-terminal side of L3, with helices 1 and 4 on the opposite side of the central cavity (Fig S1B and described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, several conserved waters interact with the N-terminal side of L3, the so-called elbow-loop region (20) near the central cavity of the dimer interface (Fig S1A), and the conserved waters connect L3 with the loop-bundle of L2, L2, and L4 (Fig 1A), which form a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the active conformation (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steric clashes between the elbow-loop and L2 in the closed-loop conformation is a primary source of allosteric regulation in maintaining the disordered-loop inactive conformation (Fig 1B, state 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved waters at the N and C termini of L3 likely stabilize the active conformation of the loop through extensive hydrogen bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the conserved waters near L3 of caspase-3 is also consistent with an allosteric network in caspase-1, where side chains in this region are known to change H-bonding patterns in the transition from inactive to active states (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DRoP analysis also showed that many conserved waters bind to helices 1, 4, and 5 (Fig 3A, blue regions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, no protein effectors have been observed to bind in this region of caspase-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, these helices are known to contain several sites of modification in caspases, including phosphorylation (11) and glutathionylation (34), as well as a zinc-binding site (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential linkage between modifications at these sites and allosteric regulation of enzyme activity is currently not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the active site loops, the C-terminal region of helix 3 (Fig 3A, H3) also interacts with several conserved waters (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flexibility in this helix affects the population distribution in the native ensemble, where rotation of the helix toward the dimer interface narrows the S1 binding pocket and disrupts the catalytic C163 and H121, thus abolishing activity (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the N terminus of helix 3, as well as three short -strands near the active site (13), which bind to conserved waters (Fig S1D), undergoes extensive rearrangements in the transition from the procaspase-3 zymogen to the mature caspase-3 (see Fig 7) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the same region in caspase-6 undergoes a coil-to-helix transition, which increases the distance between the catalytic histidine, located on 1, and the catalytic cysteine, located at the base of active site L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extended helix form of caspase-6 is stabilized by zinc binding to an allosteric site near helix 5 (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of caspase-6 structures is not sufficient to include in the DRoP analysis with caspase-3, so it is not clear whether similar conserved waters are present; however, if caspase-6 has conserved waters near 13 and turn 6, as observed in caspase-3 (Fig S1D), then the sites would be abolished upon transition to the extended helix conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further parsed the set of 145 conserved waters into three groups based on hydrogen-bond contactsnamely, surface, channel, or buried, and the three groups contain 104, 14, and 27 waters, respectively (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved surface water molecules (Fig 3D) are distributed throughout the protein, although notably the substrate-binding groove appears dry because the active-site waters are less conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved channel water molecules are found primarily near helix 3 and connecting helices 1 and 4 (Fig 3E), whereas buried water molecules (Fig 3F) connect several active-site loops, as well as several loops near helices 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, the buried water molecules are distributed similarly to the PTMs described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from studies of zinc binding to caspase-6 (29) and phosphorylation of helix 5 in caspase-6 (36, 37), little is known of the mechanisms by which PTMs or metal binding affect enzyme activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positioning of the conserved buried water molecules in caspase-3 suggests that the PTMs may affect partitioning of the native ensemble by disrupting conserved water networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Saturation_Mutagenesis_in_an_Allosteric_Site_Provides_a_Library_of_Caspase_Variants_with_a_Broad_Range_of_Activities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that the inactive conformations in the native ensemble (Fig 1B) have altered solvation, we examined changes in the conserved waters resulting from mutations in the allosteric site within the central cavity of the dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose this site because, as described (26, 27), the binding of allosteric inhibitors to this site prevents active-site loop formation via steric clashes with L3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allosteric site of the central cavity is considered a common allosteric site in caspases (35), so it may report on a common mechanism for regulation of caspase activity, as opposed to a unique site that may report on a mechanism specific to caspase-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, two mutations of V266 at the center of the allosteric site suggested context-dependent changes in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, mutation of V266 to histidine abolished enzyme activity, primarily due to destabilizing helix 3 (22, 23, 38), whereas mutation of V266 to glutamate decreased activity only 10-fold in the mature caspase, but resulted in a substantial increase in activity of the zymogen, most likely due to expulsion of a linker from the dimer interface, allowing the active conformation to form in the zymogen (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, other amino acids in or near the allosteric site have been mutated, and several high-resolution structures are available for the variants (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a saturation mutagenesis approach, we changed V266 to all other amino acids, resulting in 17 new mutants at this site, because V266H and V266E have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity measurements for the 20 proteins show that the substitution of V266 with glutamate is unique in increasing activity of the zymogen because all other mutations at this site had little effect on zymogen activity (Fig 4A and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of V266H (described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), V266Y, and V266N, all of which had no activity, the substitutions at V266 in the zymogen resulted in changes between 0.1-fold and threefold that of wild-type procaspase-3, with an average activity of 6.7 × 102 M1s1 (excluding the three inactive variants and V266E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to results for the zymogen, we observed large effects on the activity of mature caspase-3 when V266 was substituted with other amino acids (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exceptions of V266H (described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) and V266P, both of which exhibited no activity, the activities of the mutants varied by nearly four orders of magnitude, with V266F exhibiting the lowest measurable activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations resulted in increased KM values of up to 10-fold, where the average KM was 23.2 M for this dataset, and large decreases in kcat of up to 100-fold (Table S3), with the combined changes resulting in a large distribution of activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described for the V266E and V266H variants (38), there were no changes in dimer stability, so the changes in enzyme activity were not due to lower dimer formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was no correlation in enzyme specificity (Fig 4C), kcat (Fig 4D), or KM (Fig 4E) with changes in side-chain volume upon substitution of V266.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, there was no apparent correlation with side-chain chemistry, because changes in activity did not correlate with hydrophobicity, aromatic, small polar, or charged groups of side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_and_Dynamic_Studies_Show_That_Flexibility_in_the_Allosteric_Site_Disrupts_Conserved_Waters_and_Propagates_to_the_Active_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine changes in enzyme activity for the V266 mutant dataset and potential changes in the conserved waters, we determined the structures of 13 of the 17 new variants by X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noting that structures of the V226H and V266E variants have been described (22, 39), we were therefore successful in obtaining a nearly complete structural description of the saturation mutagenesis dataset at V266, where only V266G, V266P, V266T, and V266R did not crystallize (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 13 new V266X structures, 12 structures had resolution of less_than2Å and were used in the subsequent DRoP analysis (described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During formation of the active conformation of caspase-3, R164, from active site L2, intercalates between Y197 (-strand 6) and P201 (elbow-loop of L3) in the dimer interface (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the movements that are prevented through binding of allosteric effectors in the central cavity (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type caspase-3, six water molecules, three from each protomer, form a hydrogen-bonding network across the dimer interface and stabilize R164 and R164 (from the second protomer) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network across the dimer interface is important for positioning active-site loop 2 and C163 for catalysis (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the DRoP analysis, we identified two of the three water molecules as conserved (93%) (Fig 5A, Wat40 and Wat50), whereas the third water was present in 80% of the structures in our database of wild-type caspase-3 (Fig 5A, Wat177).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structures of the V266 variants show that substitution of valine with small side chains (A, S, and C) generally retains the H-bonding network in the interface (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the small side chains, substitution of V266 with larger side chains generally disrupted the H-bonding network by displacing the conserved waters (Wat40, Wat50, and Wat177) in the interface (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five of the V266 variants showed two conformations for the side-chainV266S (Fig S2B), V266D (Fig S3C), V266F (Fig 5B), V266Y (Fig 5C), and V266W (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two conformations can be characterized generally based on their positions relative to R164.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first conformation, the bulk of the side chain is positioned close to R164; in the second conformation, the bulk of the side chain is positioned away from R164 and closer to Y195 on -strand 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the V266E variant (Fig S3A), the larger side chain (compared with valine) displaces the conserved waters, but maintains the hydrogen-bonding network in the interface, whereas the side chain of aspartate, which is shorter than that of glutamate, is observed in two conformations, with longer hydrogen bonds between the waters and the side chain (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asparagine side chain is locked between these two conformations (Fig S3D), as is the histidine side chain (Fig 5E), and disrupts the conserved waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, either the changes in hydrogen bonding in the interface or increased side-chain dynamics, or both, may explain the lower activity in V266S, V266D, and V266N compared with V266E (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case of V266I, the isoleucine is observed in conformation 1, where the bulk of the side chain is near R164, whereas the leucine side chain in V266L is observed in conformation 2, near Y195 (Fig S4 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positioning of I266 results in a shift of Y197 and of Y195, on -strand 5, away from -strand 6, suggesting steric clashes in the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the leucine side chain forms close van der Waals contacts with L266 of the second protomer, with no observed shifts in Y195 or Y197 (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the V266I variant retains the water network in the interface, the less-optimal hydrophobic contacts across the interface, as well as potential steric clashes with the neighboring -strand, may explain the lower activity (1.6 × 103 M1s1) compared with the V266L variant (9.0 × 103 M1s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although the side chains for F266 (Fig 5B), Y266 (Fig 5C), and W266 (Fig 5D) are observed in two conformations, the V266Y variant exhibits significantly higher activity than the two other mutants (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is most likely because of formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Y266 and the side chain of R164.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the 15 V266X mutants showed no large structural changes that affected the active sites, so substitution of V266 in the dimer interface results in localized structural changes that affect conserved waters in the interface, side-chain fluctuations at 266, and residues on the neighboring -strand 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all of the structures contain an active-site inhibitor, the data show that the mutations have little global effects on the ground-state active conformation observed in the crystals (Fig 1A, state 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We showed previously that the lower activity of mutants coupled to V266H correlated to changes in the mobility of several active-site loops (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the changes in active-site loop mobility for the caspase-3 mutant database in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, from the structural databases, we determined the average B-factor for each residue in wild-type caspase-3 (Fig S5 A and B), based on the 15 structures in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that, relative to the average B-factor for all residues (16.4 ± 5.8), active-site loops L1 and the C-terminal region of L3 show increased mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable data were determined for the caspase-3 mutant database (Table S2 and Fig S5 C and D), where the average B-factor for all residues was 16.0 ± 6.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the two databases showed that each residue of the mutant caspase-3 demonstrates similar B-factors as those of wild-type caspase-3, because the difference is close to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, active-site loops L1 and L3 are both less mobile in the caspase-3 mutants based on significantly lower B-factors compared with wild-type caspase-3 (Fig S5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, amino acids in the turn connecting helices 4 and 5, as well as the amino and carboxyl termini of the protomers, are more mobile in the caspase-3 mutants (Fig S5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second way in which we examined active-site loop mobility was to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on six mutantsV266Y, V266F, V266D, V266E, V266Q, and V266Nbecause of the differences in enzyme activity and structural features described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from 50-ns MD simulations of wild-type caspase-3 (22) provide the baseline for comparison with the V266 mutants and show that the largest fluctuations are observed in two active-site loops (L1 and L4) and turn 6, which contains E123 and E124 (Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positioning of turn 6 is important for activity because it contains residues that form part of the oxyanion hole during catalysis, as well as residues that contribute to the hydrogen-bonding network of the dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, turn 6 connects -strands in the surface -sheet (13) described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MD simulations for the V266 variants show that the rms fluctuations (rmsfs) are generally within 12 Å of those observed for wild-type caspase-3 (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the data are reported as rmsf (rmsfMut  rmsfWT), so values greater than zero show larger fluctuations in the mutant compared with those of wild-type caspase-3, whereas values less than zero reflect larger fluctuations in wild-type caspase-3 compared with those of the mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons of fluctuations in V266D (Fig 6A) to those in V266E (Fig 6B) and in V266F (Fig 6C) to those in V266Y (Fig 6D) show increased fluctuations in turn 6 that result in new, albeit transient, interactions between E123, in turn 6, and the catalytic H121.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type caspase-3, H121 fluctuates between two conformations during the simulation, which likely reflects its movements during proton transfer of the catalytic reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these conformations, the H121 side-chain fluctuates between 7 and 12 Å from E123.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the V266D and V266F variants, movements in turn 6, along with the fluctuations in H121, result in shorter distances between H121 and E123, between 3.2 and 4.1 Å, so the electrostatic interactions between H121 and E123 may affect the catalytic activity by decreasing the rate of proton transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the motions described for turn 6 do not appear to be coupled with changes in mobility of active-site loops L1, L3, or L4 described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the surface -sheet (13) and turn 6 is more similar to that of the inactive zymogen than to the active conformation (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the active enzyme, turn 6 is in the down conformation (Fig 7, blue), where E124 is positioned to H-bond with R164 in the central cavity of the dimer interface (see also Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the up conformation observed in the zymogen (Fig 7, orange), turn 6 is rotated away from the central cavity such that E124 is solvent-exposed, and the surface -sheet, 13, is not well-formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the V266 variants, fluctuations in turn 6 displace the catalytic H121 by 2.7 Å (Fig 7A), whereas the catalytic cysteine is moved 1.7 Å from the active position (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 7, representative data for V266D are shown in yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, all variants showed increased fluctuations in helix 3, which, as described previously for V266H, also affect the positions of the catalytic groups through movements propagated through the surface -sheet, 13 (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the B-factor analysis shows that, on average, the caspase-3 variants have lower mobility in active site loops L1 and L3, whereas the MD data show that the lower activity of some V266 variants may result from fluctuations in turn 6 and active-site loop 2, culminating in displacement of the catalytic groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lower_Activity_Correlates_with_Changes_in_Solvation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed the DRoP analysis on the V266 variants for which we obtained X-ray crystal structures of less_than2-Å resolution (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To expand the database, we also included 24 additional caspase-3 variants for which we have previously determined enzyme activity and high-resolution structures, providing a database of 37 caspase-3 variants containing a total of 10,736 water molecules (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After DRoP analysis, we determined the average B-factor for each conserved water molecule in the database (Fig S7A) and determined which of the water molecules within the set of 145 conserved waters were absent in each mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter data are presented in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we describe the total number of conserved waters displaced for each mutant, and, second, we quantified the disruption of each of the conserved waters in the caspase-3 mutant database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the latter results as relative disruption (Fig S7), where a value of 1 signifies that the conserved water was disrupted in all caspases in the database, and a value of 0 signifies that the conserved water was present in all caspases in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that all three classes of the conserved waters (surface, channel, and buried) were affected by the mutations, with conserved surface waters demonstrating the largest changes (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The database of 37 variants provides a range of enzyme activities, nearly four orders of magnitude (Fig 4F), and the DRoP analysis shows that the change in enzyme activity correlates with a loss of conserved waters, where the lower catalytic efficiency (Fig 4F) was due to lower kcat (Fig 4G) and higher KM (Fig 4H) values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point in Fig 4 FH represents one mutant in the caspase-3 database, where an average of 27.9 waters are displaced per mutant, with a broad range between zero (wild-type) and 70 waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fits of the data show that, when the 145 conserved waters are present (no change in the waters), values for kcat, 0.65 s1 (Fig 4G, range of 0.421.04 s1), and KM, 9.7 M (Fig 4H, range of 9.310.2 M), yield an enzyme specificity of 6.7 × 104 M1s1, which is similar to that obtained from a fit of the data in Fig 4F, 1.65 × 105 (range of 1.36 × 105 to 2.01 × 105) M1s1 and agrees well with values previously determined for wild-type caspase-3 (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the broad range of values in Fig 4 FH suggest that the data may reflect the heterogeneity of the ensemble and report on multiple inactive conformations rather than a single discrete state as represented in Fig 1B (state 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, an improved understanding of inactive conformations characterized by increased dynamics of turn 6 vs. those with increased dynamics of helix 3, as well as the dehydration associated with each state, may allow one to parse data such as those shown in Fig 4 to resolve multiple inactive conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in the conserved water molecules also report on potential hotspots on the protein where water networks may be sensitive to conformational changes or to ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept is analogous to the solvent mapping of Ras, where binding of multiple small organic compounds provides maps of potential ligand-binding sites (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine potential hotspots on caspase-3, we analyzed the relative disruption of each of the 145 conserved waters in the caspase-3 mutant database (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We parsed the data into five bins, representing levels of disruptionless_than0.1 (blue), 0.110.25 (cyan), 0.260.5 (green), 0.510.7 (orange), and 0.711 (red) and we mapped the relative disruption onto the conserved waters of the caspase-3 structure using the same color code (Fig 8A and Fig S7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly disrupted waters (0.711; red) were present primarily at the chain termini, and the conserved waters with low disruption (less_than0.1; blue) were primarily buried waters that are close to sites of posttranslational modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 8A (and Fig S7 CE), the remaining water molecules are found throughout the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We highlight two examples that show significant changes in the conserved waters, where 2060% of the structures report disrupted water networks: the helix 3-dimer interface cavity and two areas of the face containing helices 1, 4, and 5 (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, of 21 conserved water molecules that interact with the helix 313turn 6 region, 13 of those waters are disrupted in the mutant database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, several water molecules near turn 6 form part of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network between the dimer interface, turn 6, and the N terminus of helix 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five water molecules in this network are disrupted in the caspase-3 variants (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our MD simulations, we examined fluctuations in the set of conserved water molecules compared with the nonconserved waters and bulk solvent, and the results showed that the average rmsf for the conserved water molecules (9.1 ± 4.0 Å) is similar that of the nonconserved waters (10.2 ± 3.5 Å) or the bulk solvent (11.9 ± 2.6 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one observes variations within the clusters of conserved waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, two of the five water molecules in the cluster near turn 6 have lower than average RMSF (Wat21 and Wat32; 4.25.8 Å), whereas three waters (Wat13, Wat48, and Wat65) demonstrate higher than average rmsf (11.517.2 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 8B, these five conserved water molecules connect the N terminus of helix 3 with amino acids on -strand 5 of the dimer interface (Y195 and Y197) and turn 6 near the active site (E124).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described above, structural perturbations due to the mutations at V266 in the dimer interface are localized to side-chain perturbations at position 266 and residues on the neighboring -strand 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our DRoP analysis and MD simulations of the conserved water molecules show that the structural perturbations in the interface are propagated through -strand 5 to turn 6 by disruption of the conserved water molecules that connect the two regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of the water molecules likely results in the increased flexibility of turn 6 observed in MD simulations (Fig 6), movements toward the up position observed in the inactive zymogen (24) (Fig 7), and transient interactions between E123 (on turn 6) and the catalytic H121 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the two conserved water molecules that hydrogen-bond to E124 in turn 6, Wat48 and Wat65, having the largest fluctuations in the cluster (rmsf of 11.5 and 17.2 Å, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, our DRoP analysis and MD simulations show that 15 of 24 conserved waters that bind to helices 1 and 4 are disrupted in the mutant database, with a cluster of conserved waters bound to the C terminus of helix 4 (Fig 8C, Lower) and a cluster of conserved waters bound to the N terminus of helix 4 (Fig 8C, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the data support two modes of action for the conserved water clusters connecting helix 4 with the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the change in hydration of the C terminus of helix 4 may propagate along the helix toward active-site loop 3 through ionic interactions with charged or polar groups on helices 1 and 4, culminating in a change in mobility of D211 in active-site loop 3 (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One observes that 9 of the 12 conserved waters in this network are disrupted in the caspase-3 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the loss of the conserved water molecules at the C terminus of helix 4 may propagate to the active site of the second protomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the 180° rotation of the two protomers, the active sites are on approximately opposite ends of the dimer (Fig 1A), so the region of the C termini of helices 1 and 4 and the turn between helices 4 and 5 (Fig 8C, Lower) are connected to the active site of the second protomer through proximity to the loop bundle of active site loops L2, L2, and L4 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved water molecules near the C terminus of helix 4 and the turn between helices 4 and 5 also connect the helices to binding sites for the N and C termini of the protein (Fig S7E), and we find that he conserved water molecules in these binding sites are also disrupted in the caspase-3 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the N and C termini show increased mobility in the mutants, as does the adjacent loop 2 (Fig S5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the fluctuations described above, the conserved waters that hydrogen-bond to D228 show the largest rmsf in the cluster, 14.217.2 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regardless of whether the loss of conserved water molecules is propagated through intraprotomer or interprotomer contacts, or both, the changes culminate in lower mobility in active-site loop 3 (Fig S5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several amino acids in the helix 1,4,5 network are known to be modified on caspases, including glutathionylation of caspase-3 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the region is close to other modification sites, including phosphorylation of the N terminus of several caspases (35), so the conserved waters may be important for bridging communication networks between sites of PTMs and the active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, helix 5 contains a binding site for zinc (29), ionic interactions (40), and phosphorylation sites (11) that are important in allosteric regulation of several caspases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the data show that the entire face of caspase-3 containing helices 1, 4, and 5, which is on the opposite side of the central -sheet from the allosteric site, is perturbed by mutations in the dimer interface and that the loss of conserved water molecules may be propagated to the active site in the same protomer through helix 4 or to the active site of the second protomer through contacts near the loop bundle, including loop L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data show that multiple regions of the protein were affected by mutations in the allosteric site of the dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein solvation mediates folding, stabilizes native structures, and is critical for enzyme function (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, disruption of proteinwater interactions may result in unfavorable changes in stability or dynamics (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the well-known changes in solvation for the conformational transitions of hemoglobin (43), relatively little is known about the role of water in allosteric transitions (4447).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides insight into the intrinsic nature of allosteric mechanisms and the role of water molecules in conformational selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of water molecules in the caspase-3 mutational database, combined with structural and dynamic studies, shows that disrupting conserved waters on the protomer is correlated with a shift in the population of states toward an inactive conformation (state 2 in Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data further describe the inactive state as a conformation with a distorted active site, transient interactions that may decrease the rate of the proton transfer of the catalytic histidine, desolvated through removal of conserved water molecules, and with lower mobility in two active-site loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the analysis reports on changes in the conserved waters within the protomer, particularly regarding the allosteric site of the central cavity, and also suggests that interprotomer interactions propagate the effects of desolvating the helix 1,4,5 face of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effects of mutations on the conserved water molecules are global, in that changes are observed throughout the protein, the data show that conserved waters may report on communication between allosteric sites facilitated by the bridging water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact suggests that, in addition to targeting the allosteric site of the dimer interface to stabilize the disordered-loop conformation (state 3 in Fig 1B), ligands that remove conserved water molecules from the protomer could effectively fine-tune caspase-3 activity by shifting the population toward the high-energy inactive conformation (state 2 in Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The disordered-loop conformation (Fig 1B, state 3) appears to be a low-energy state because it is readily trapped by small drug compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also observed in the so-called closed-loop conformations of several caspases, where binding of active site loop L2 in the dimer interface prevents insertion of the elbow loop of L3 and subsequent formation of the substrate binding groove (20, 21, 36, 37, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the allosteric site of the dimer interface is not modified by PTMs in the cell, and a global analysis of caspase modifications (35), along with trapping high-energy states of caspase-2 (28) and -3 (22, 23), shows that the disordered-loop conformation is only one of potentially several inactive states in the ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of the high-energy inactive conformations of caspase-2 and -3 show that disruption of the catalytic groups can be achieved without large-scale disordering of the active site loops, as small shifts in the catalytic cysteine and histidine are sufficient to inactivate the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-energy inactive state may provide an advantage for regulation of caspase activity in the cell, particularly if the state is stabilized by posttranslational modifications, because it provides the cell with a means to reversibly control activity by coupling one or more modifications to increased population of the inactive state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the modification would result in an unstable high-energy state that would rapidly convert to the more stable active conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The database described here provides a tunable allosteric library of caspase-3 variants with nearly four orders of magnitude change in activity, which we suggest will be useful for examining caspase-3 signaling in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In current transfection technologies, caspase activity is manipulated in cells through knockdown or knockout strategies coupled with expression of caspase variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of endogenous caspase activity are difficult to control, and interpretation of results from overexpressed caspase variants can be problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New genome-editing techniques, however, combined with our caspase-3 database, should provide tools to fine-tune caspase-3 activity while simultaneously maintaining endogenous protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cloning__Expression__and_Protein_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described with plasmids pHC332 (wild-type caspase-3) (50) and pHC33209 [caspase-3(D9A,D28A,D175A); uncleavable procaspase-3] (50, 51) and the primers shown in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with each of the plasmids, and proteins were expressed and purified as described (22, 31, 38, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme_Activity_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial velocity of substrate cleavage was measured at 25 °C in the presence of varying concentrations of substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC), as described (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final protein concentration for the active mutants was 10 nM, whereas a protein concentration of 100 nM was used for the largely inactive mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total reaction volume was 200 µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, substrate was added to the sample, which contained protein in activity assay buffer (150 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, 50 mM NaCl, and 1% sucrose), and samples were immediately excited at 400 nm, while the fluorescence emission was measured at 505 nm for 60 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Water_Clusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water molecules were analyzed by using DRoP, as described (30), and the web server dropinthemattoslab.org/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, all structures were first aligned to that of wild-type caspase-3, [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2J30], and then loaded onto the web server.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DRoP program returns a PDB file that contains clustered and renumbered waters, as well as the level of conservation of each water molecule in the database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved waters were further characterized based on the number of hydrogen bonds to the protein and to other water molecules: buried, form at least three H-bonds to protein side chains or backbone atoms; channel, generally form two H-bonds to the protein and at least one H-bond to other channel or buried water molecules; surface, form one or two H-bonds with the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of the caspase-3 mutants in the I222 space group, DRoP analysis was carried out after alignment with wild-type caspase-3 (PDB ID code 2J30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For caspase-3 mutants in the C121 space group, which consists of a dimer of protomers in the asymmetric unit, one protomer was removed from the file before alignment with wild-type caspase-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After DRoP analysis, the conserved water molecules in each mutant were inspected for displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystallization_and_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Caspase-3 variants were crystallized in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CMK as described (22, 31), and most crystals appeared within 3 d, although some took as long as 3 wk to grow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryoprotectants included 20% (vol/vol) PEG 400/80% reservoir solution or 20% (vol/vol) MPD/80% reservoir solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Datasets were collected, and structures were solved by molecular replacement using the wild-type caspase-3 structure for initial phasing (PDB ID code 2J30); structural models were refined by using Phenix (54), as described (23, 31, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures were determined for all V266X variants, except for V266G, V266P, V266R, and V266T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13 structures determined were within 0.095 Å rmsd from wild-type caspase-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MD simulations were performed for 50 ns with GROMACS (Version 4.5) (55) by using the Amber99 force field (56) and the TIP3P water model (57), as described (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD simulations of conserved water molecules were performed as described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural model that is used to represent the protein and crystal waters, both conserved and nonconserved positions, is caspase-3 (PDB ID code 2J30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein molecules were represented by using the extended atom model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved waters were arranged in a segment labeled XWAT, and the nonconserved waters in a segment labeled OWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was placed in an equilibrated box of size 80 × 76 × 76 Å with 11,316 TIP3 water molecules (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrated water segment was labeled SOLV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOLV segment waters that are within 2.8 Å of protein, XWAT, or OWAT molecules were deleted, leaving 7,975 SOLV molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All minimization and dynamics calculations were performed by using the MD and mechanics program CHARMM (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was then energy-minimized by using 20 steps of Steepest Descents minimization with alternately the protein, XWAT, OWAT, and SOLV residues not constrained, and then 500 steps of Adopted Basis Set Newton Raphson energy minimization were performed with no constraints applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD then were performed for 200,000 steps of propagation using the Verlet Leapfrog algorithm after a heating routine that starts the randomly assigned velocities at 10 K and increases the temperature by 5 K each 10 steps until the simulation temperature reaches 300 K. Trajectory collection/scaling (scaling refers to reassignment of random velocities around 300 K) was then performed with no scaling events in the 200,000 steps of trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time step was 2 fs, electrostatics were modeled by using a constant dielectric of 1.0 and allowing the water in the simulation box to establish the local dielectric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image centering was checked each 10 steps, and a coordinate set was saved every 10 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shake algorithm was applied to bonds containing hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rmsfs were calculated using the analysis routines in CHARMM 36B2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
