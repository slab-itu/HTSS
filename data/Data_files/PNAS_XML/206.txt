Ablation of huntingtin in adult neurons is nondeleterious but its depletion in young mice causes acute pancreatitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of the toxicity gain of expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, many studies have used RNAi and other approaches to inactivate the mutant HTT gene in Huntingtons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Htt is essential for early embryonic development, and normal function of Htt in adult animals remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using conditional Htt knockout mice, we found that loss of Htt causes the lethal phenotype only in postnatal mice but not in adult mice, and this early death is due to acute pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Htt interacts with serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 3 (Spink3) to inhibit trypsin activity in pancreatic cells and thus prevents acinar cell degeneration and pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This age- and cell type-dependent function indicates the safety in knocking down neuronal HTT in adult brains for treating Huntingtons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Huntingtons disease (HD) protein, huntingtin (HTT), is essential for early development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because suppressing the expression of mutant HTT is an important approach to treat the disease, we must first understand the normal function of Htt in adults versus younger animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using inducible Htt knockout mice, we found that Htt depletion does not lead to adult neurodegeneration or animal death at  greater than 4 mo of age, which was also verified by selectively depleting Htt in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, young Htt KO mice die at 2 mo of age of acute pancreatitis due to the degeneration of pancreatic acinar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Htt interacts with the trypsin inhibitor, serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 3 (Spink3), to inhibit activation of digestive enzymes in acinar cells in young mice, and transgenic HTT can rescue the early death of Htt KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings point out age- and cell type-dependent vital functions of Htt and the safety of knocking down neuronal Htt expression in adult brains as a treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Loss_of_Htt_Mediates_Age-Dependent_Death_in_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the function of Htt in adult mice, we crossed conditional Htt KO mice (16) to transgenic CAG-CreER mice that ubiquitously express a tamoxifen-inducible CreER, resulting in inducible Htt KO (ubiquitous KO) mice that would deplete Htt expression upon tamoxifen injection (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected tamoxifen into ubiquitous KO mice at 2, 4, and 8 mo of age and Western blot analysis confirmed that tamoxifen injection caused Htt depletion in various brain regions in ubiquitous KO mice at different ages (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the life span clearly indicated an age-dependent death of ubiquitous KO mice: more than 95% of 2-mo-old mice died within 10 d after Htt depletion, whereas 70% of 4-mo-old and 95% of 8-mo-old mice could survive after Htt depletion (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For older ubiquitous KO mice, there were no significant differences in the rotarod performance and body weight gain compared with their controls (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also verified that the depletion of Htt in ubiquitous KO mice caused no significant changes in LC3I/II, P62, Caspase-3, NFB, and FAT10 in the brain and peripheral tissues (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Depletion_of_Neuronal_Htt_in_Adult_Mice_Does_Not_Cause_Death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above studies suggested that depletion of Htt in the brain might not be responsible for the death of young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this, we crossed floxed Htt mice with transgenic mice expressing Nestin-CreER, such that the resulting crossed mice (neuronal KO) had selectively depleted Htt expression in neuronal cells after tamoxifen injection, as Cre expression is driven by the neuronal Nestin promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed that tamoxifen injection caused Htt depletion in various brain regions in neuronal KO mice at different ages (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, very few (less_than18%) 2-mo-old neuronal KO mice died, and all neuronal KO mice  greater than 4 mo lived normally after Htt was depleted by tamoxifen injection (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These living mice showed the same body weight, rotarod performance, and gripping ability as their controls (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because depletion of Htt is known to affect the neurogenesis or survival of developing neurons (16, 17), we examined 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice, but found no difference in the brain size and volume between controls and Htt KO mice (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For neuronal KO mice, depletion of Htt by tamoxifen for 90 d did not show any difference in the brain volume compared with control mice (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological examination showed no morphologic defects in neuronal KO mice (Fig S2A), which is supported by Western blotting results that detected no significant changes in NeuN, -tubulin III, GFAP, P62, LC3I/II, and caspase-3, except mouse Htt protein (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent staining also did not show any changes in LC3I/II, -tubulin III, and cleaved caspase-3 staining in ubiquitous and neuronal KO mouse brains (Fig 3E and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we crossed floxed Htt mice to transgenic mice that express CreER in the forebrain under the control of the neuronal promoter CaMKII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossed mice, upon tamoxifen injection, showed normal growth and survival without any detectable brain atrophy or degeneration (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results demonstrate that ubiquitous KO mice show an age-dependent death that is unlikely due to the depletion of Htt in neuronal cells or neuronal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Htt_Depletion_Causes_Acute_Pancreatitis_That_Results_from_Acinar_Cell_Degeneration_in_Young_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next focused on the peripheral tissue morphology of dead ubiquitous KO mice and found abnormal and inflamed abdominal cavities (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was significant inflammation in the abdominal organs, including intestine, vessels, and pancreas, as evidenced by hemorrhagic, black-brown necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma and peripancreatic fat (Fig 4A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pancreas was swollen and did not show the typical tan, lobulated architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these features indicate acute pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice after injecting tamoxifen to induce Htt depletion for different days and found the typical acute pancreatitis changes: the acinar cells were initially enlarged at day 3, and then the mice started to have ascites, ileus, and splanchnic hyperemia before their death at day 7 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot results confirmed that Htt in pancreas is depleted in ubiquitous KO mice (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, histological examination revealed that living ubiquitous KO mice at 4 and 8 mo of age, which had been injected with tamoxifen for 5 d, show no abnormal pancreatic histology (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of ubiquitous KO mice that were injected with tamoxifen at 4 or 8 mo of age and then used to isolate their tissues 2 mo later did not reveal any abnormal histology in their pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elastase 3B or protease E (CELA3B), which is secreted from the pancreas as a zymogen, is also increased (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although autophagy activation can also be the cause of acute pancreatitis (18), we saw no significant alteration in P62 and LC3I/II, whereas caspase-3 activation was evident (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute pancreatitis is often caused by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, serum amylase, lipase, pancreas amylase, trypsin, and other pancreatic enzymes show high activities in 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice (Fig 4E and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we performed electron microscopic examination of pancreatic tissues of 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the pancreatic tissue from control mice (heterozygous floxed Htt mice injected with tamoxifen), we found increased zymogen granules in acinar cells, nuclear chromatin clumping, and margination, indicating apoptosis, mitochondria enlargement, and edema, as well as lysosomes containing degenerated cytoplasmic elements or organelles (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of zymogene granules and apoptosis or necrosis in pancreatic acinar cells also confirmed that Htt depletion increased the accumulation of zymogene granules and acinar cell death (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Htt_Interacts_with_Spink3_to_Inhibit_Trypsin_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenotypes and morphological studies of 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice clearly indicate acute pancreatitis caused by Htt depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acute pancreatic inflammation can be induced by activation of digested enzymes in pancreatic zymogens in acinar cells (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation normally involves a hydrolysis reaction of inactivated forms of enzymes by trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we saw the degeneration of acinar cells, we focused on the molecules known to inhibit trypsin activity in acinar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot results show that Spink3, a mouse homolog of human SPINK1 that inhibits trypsin in acinar cells (22), is selectively decreased in 2-mo-old mouse pancreatic tissues compared with 4- and 8-mo-old mouse pancreatic tissues (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mutations in the human Spink3 homolog SPINK1 cause pancreatitis (2326) and the selective decrease of Spink3 in young mouse pancreas is associated with acute pancreatitis in 2-mo-old ubiquitous KO mice, we further investigated whether Htt associates with Spink3 to inhibit trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using immunoprecipitation of pancreatic tissues from wild-type mice at 2, 4, and 8 mo of age, we found an age-dependent association of Htt with Spink3, which declines from 2 to 8 mo (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the association of Htt with Spink3 in pancreatic tissues in young mice may be more important for Spink3s function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the functional relevance of this binding, we transfected a series of Htt and Spink3 constructs into primary cultured acinar cells from ubiquitous KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were treated with tamoxifen (KO) to deplete endogenous Htt and then transfected with full-length HTT (fHTT), N-terminal HTT (1208 aa, nHTT), or truncated HTT (tHTT) lacking N-terminal 169 amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring trypsin activities of these transfected cells revealed that fHTT and tHTT, but not nHTT, could restore the inhibitory function of Htt on trypsin activity when endogenous Htt has been depleted (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed transfection of HEK293 cells with a series of HTT and Spink3 constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without overexpression of Spink3 and HTT, HEK293 cell lysates show detectable trypsin activity when incubated with porcine trypsin and the substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity was inhibited by expressing Spink3 and could be further reduced when additional tHTT was also expressed (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, nHTT was unable to promote this inhibition, supporting the idea that a truncated HTT lacking the N-terminal region is able to bind Spink3 to inhibit trypsin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transgenic_tHTT_Rescues_the_Early_Death_of_Ubiquitous_KO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have generated transgenic mice that express tHTT lacking N-terminal 169 amino acids under the control of the human HTT promoter (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we have found that tHTT is able to bind Spink3 (Fig 5C), we wanted to see if this transgenic HTT could rescue the acute pancreatitis and early death of ubiquitous KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we crossed tHTT transgenic mice with ubiquitous KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR genotype indicates that the transgenic tHTT existed in the crossed mice (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossed mice were then injected with tamoxifen at the age of 6 wk to deplete the endogenous full-length Htt in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice carrying the transgenic tHTT, however, continued to live versus the ubiquitous KO mice that did not express transgenic tHTT (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After depleting endogenous Htt for 5 mo, examination of the body weight of mice also revealed that these KO mice expressing tHTT (tHTT/KO) are indistinguishable from control mice (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then isolated the pancreatic tissues from tHTT/KO mice to perform Western blotting, which showed the expression of tHTT that is smaller than the endogenous full-length Htt in wild-type mouse pancreatic tissues (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the proteins for apoptosis (cleaved caspase3), necrosis (RIP3), autophagy (P62, LC3I/II), and CELA3B enzyme showed no alteration compared with those in the control mouse pancreatic tissues (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this in vivo rescue effect also supports the idea that Htt is important for preventing pancreatic inflammation in young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the results we obtained, we propose a model for the acute pancreatitis caused by the loss of Htt in young mice (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pancreatic tissues of young mice, Htt binds Spink3 to help inhibit trypsin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without Htt, this inhibition is abolished, leading to trypsin activation in acinar cells and resulting in acinar cell degeneration and pancreas inflammation, as well as early death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function is not only cell-type specific but also age dependent, as aging increases the expression of Spink3, whose inhibitory effect on trypsin may also be dependent on other age-related factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HTT is known to be essential for early embryonic development, and conditional knockout of Htt during the postnatal stage can also cause neurodegeneration (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, mutant HTT with expanded polyQ can rescue this embryonic lethality (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of polyQ or the proline-rich domain does not affect mouse development (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, humans homozygous for mutant expanded polyQ HTT age to adulthood with no obvious enhancement in pathology (31, 32), indicating that the expansion or lack of polyQ does not affect early development, but polyQ expansion causes late-onset neurodegeneration and neurological symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, great efforts have gone into suppressing the expression of mutant HTT in the treatment of HD (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, because of the essential function of HTT, a major concern has always been the possible side effects of depleting HTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies suggest that such concerns may be allayed if depletion of HTT occurs only in the brain or in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The previous studies using CaMKII-driven Cre transgenic mice show the degeneration of some neuronal cells and the degree of the degeneration appears to depend on age; the later depletion of Htt yielded a lesser extent of neuronal degeneration (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Htt function in the brain appears to be age dependent, although its role in developing neuronal cells has been clearly shown by a number of studies (17, 3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies show that in adulthood, Htt knockout does not affect neuronal survival or cause any significant movement or behavioral phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is also supported by mice with selectively depleted Htt expression in the brain via Nestin-CreER or CaMKII-CreER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be pointed out that a few Nestin-Cre/KO mice die early, which is likely due to the expression of Cre in pancreatic acinar cells driven by the Nestin promoter (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our studies suggest that depletion of HTT in adult brain would not cause severe phenotypes as seen in early development, providing a rationale to design a more efficient strategy to completely eliminate the expression of mutant HTT in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings also show that the interaction of Htt with Spink3 is important for preventing acute pancreatitis at young ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spink3 is the mouse homolog of serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) in humans, which is expressed at high levels in the pancreas (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPINK1 is involved in pancreatitis in humans (24, 39, 40), as patients heterozygous for a SPINK1 mutation have a 20- to 40-fold increased risk of developing pancreatitis (23, 26, 41, 42), and this risk may be as high as 500-fold in individuals with homozygous mutations (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, germ-line knockout of the mouse Spink3 does not lead to acute pancreatitis but autophagic death of pancreatic acinar cells, although the homozygous KO mice die postnatally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference could be due to the species- and age-dependent role of Spink3 in mouse, as Spink3 also plays important roles in the proliferation and/or differentiation of various cell types during mouse development (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a progressive degradation of the exocrine pancreas is seen at 16.5 days postcoitus in Spink3 KO mice, which was attributed to autophagic cell death (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in adult mice, the expression level of Spink3 appears to be important for acute pancreatitis, because transgenic expression of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor-1 rescues Spink3-deficient mice and restores a normal pancreatic phenotype (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another issue is why the loss of Htt-mediated death is age dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw that Spink3 is expressed at a lower level in pancreatic tissues in young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that Htt binds more Spink3 at younger ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the association of Htt with Spink3 is particularly important for Spink3 to inhibit trypsin activities when Spink3 is at a low level in pancreatic acinar cells at young ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In older mice, the higher levels of Spink3 could be due to its interaction with other proteins, which may substitute the function of Htt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies suggest that Htt possesses a cell type-specific function that is also age dependent, adding more complexity to this large protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is somewhat surprising, it is reasonable given that Htt associates with so many proteins (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also known that mutant Htt with expanded polyQ repeats could cause a loss of function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, polyQ expansion can inhibit the normal function of Htt by altering its interactions with other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such consequence could be different from the complete loss of normal Htt, as the complete loss of HTT may be compensated by other molecules, whereas a partial loss of normal function of htt due to polyQ expansion may also affect the function of other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compensatory mechanisms for the loss of Htt may be cell-type and age dependent and can confound the interpretation of the function of Htt and the absence of overt phenotypes in adult mice that lack Htt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite further studies being required to understand the cell type-specific function of Htt, our results provide evidence for the first time to our knowledge that depletion of Htt causes cell type- and age-dependent phenotypes and also indicate the safety for a more efficient way of depleting neuronal HTT in adult brain to achieve better treatments for HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All mice were maintained and bred in the Division of Animal Resources at Emory University on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse housing environment is specifically pathogen-free in accordance with institutional guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Emory University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal use followed the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal use protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Emory University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Htt floxP-flanked mice were generated as previously described (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate inducible ubiquitous knockout mice, we crossed Htt floxP-flanked mice with B6.Cg-Tg [(CAG-cre/Esr1)5Amc/J; The Jackson Laboratory] transgenic mice that express tamoxifen-inducible Cre throughout the body to generate homozygous Htt-floxed mice that also express Cre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injected tamoxifen into these homozygous mice for 5 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate neuronal Htt knockout mice, we injected tamoxifen into homozygous Htt floxP-flanked mice with C57BL/6-Tg(Nes-cre/Esr1*)1Kuan/ (The Jackson Laboratory) transgenic mice, in which CreER fusion protein is expressed in neuronal cells under the control of the rat Nestin (Nes) promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the forebrain Htt knockout mice, the homozygous Htt floxP-flanked mice with B6;129S6-Tg(Camk2a-cre/ERT2)1Aibs/J (The Jackson Laboratory) that express tamoxifen-inducible Cre driven by the mouse CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha) promoter region were injected with tamoxifen for 5 d. To generate tHTT transgenic mice [C57BL/6-Tg(tHTT)], we fused the truncated HTT cDNA encoding 1703,141 amino acids of human Htt to ECFP, P2A, and RGBPA genes in a vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting construct expresses tHTT under the control of human HTT gene promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microinjection of linearized construct into SV129/B6 mouse embryos was conducted by the Emory University Transgenic Mouse Core Facility to generate transgenic tHTT mice [C57BL/6-Tg (tHTT)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the tHTT transgenic/Htt ubiquitous KO mouse, the tHTT mice were crossed with homozygous floxed Htt/CAG-CreER mice that also contained the transgenic CAG-CreER gene and bred to homozygous Htt-floxed mice with Cre and tHTT transgene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting crossed transgenic mice would deplete endogenous Htt expression upon tamoxifen injection, while expressing transgenic tHTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNAs used for PCR genotyping from all mouse models were isolated by DirectPCR Lysis Reagent (tail) (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  102-T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were used for genotyping of the wild-type Htt (forward, 5-CTA AAG CGC ATG CTC CAG ACT G-3; reverse, 5-AGA TCT TGG CTG AGT TAT AGG TCA GC-3), Htt floxP (forward, 5-CAT TTG ATT CTT ACA GGT AGC CTG -3; reverse, 5-AGA TCT TGG CTG AGT TAT AGG TCA GC-3), and Cre positive (forward, 5-GCG GTC TGG CAG TAA AAA CTA TC-3; reverse, 5-TGT TTC ACT ATC CAG GTT ACG G-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were used for genotyping of transgenic tHTT as follows: forward, 5-ATC TGT CGA CGG CAC CAT GGT GAG CAA GGG CGA GGA G-3; reverse, 5-ACC AAG CTT CTC CAG TTT GTC ATC GTC ATC CTT GTA GTC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For injection of tamoxifen into the mice, tamoxifen purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (T5648) was dissolved in 100% ethanol as stock solution at 20 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A calculated amount of tamoxifen was mixed thoroughly with corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich, C8267), and the ethanol was removed by Vacufuge plus (Eppendorf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tamoxifen that had been dissolved in corn oil was injected intraperitoneally into mice at 0.1 mg per 1 g body weight for 5 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The body weight of mouse pups was measured every day from birth to 2 mo old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After tamoxifen injection, the body weight of mice was measured every month for 5 consecutive months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For motor function assay, mice (1015 per group) were assessed by a Rotamex 4/8 (Columbus Instruments International) every month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the test, mice were trained on the rotarod at the speed of 5 rpm for 20 min for 3 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For testing, the speed of the rotarod was set to accelerate from 0 rpm to 40 rpm, with the increment of 0.1 rpm per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were allowed to rest for 20 min between trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was subjected to three trials, and the time was recorded automatically by the machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average time of three trials was used to evaluate the motor activity of the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the gripping ability test, mice were measured by grip strength meters (Columbus Instruments International) every month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the initial test, mice were trained for 3 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the test, the grip strength meters were set to zero, a mouse was placed on the wire netting to let it firmly grasp the meter, and the same strength was used to pull the mouse tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were recorded automatically by the machine, and each mouse was tested three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average strength of three trials was used to evaluate the gripping ability of the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The brain volume was measured by skull volume; the skull volume was filled with water and the mouse brain was added to the container.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water overflow from the container was then measured by a volumetric cylinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL amphotencin B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell line was purchased from ATTC and the cell lines were cultured in compliance with the US Public Health Service Guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary mouse acinar cells were cultured as described previously (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before seeding, six-well culture dishes were coated with type I collagen (5 g/cm2) by adding 1 mL of type I collagen solution (50 g/mL in 0.02 M acetic acid, 0.2 m filtered) to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After discarding the collagen solution, the coated wells were washed twice with 1× PBS and dried at least 12 h before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All procedures for isolating acinar cells were performed under a sterile atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mouse pancreas dissection, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and fixed on the flat wooden board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated pancreatic tissues were rinsed twice with 1× Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium ion Ca2+ chelators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pancreas was sliced to small pieces of 2 mm3 using a Noyes scissors and a scalpel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sliced pancreas was transferred into a 50-mL polypropylene tube followed by centrifugation at 450 × g for 2 min in 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After discarding the supernatant to remove cell fragments and blood cells, 10 mL of collagenase IA solution (1× HBSS containing 10 mM Hepes, 200 units/mL of collagenase IA, and 0.25 mg/mL of trypsin inhibitor) were added to pancreas sections, which were then transferred to a 25-cm2 flask for incubation for 2030 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time (every 5 min), a mechanical dissociation was performed by energetically moving back and forth the pancreas fragments about 10 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dissociation, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 10 mL of cold washing buffer (HBSS 1× containing 5% FBS and 10 mM Hepes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociated pancreatic tissues were transferred into a sterile 50-mL polypropylene tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 450 × g at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were resuspended and washed with 10 mL of buffered washing solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After washing, the cell pellets were resuspended in 7 mL of Waymouth's medium containing 2.5% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (PS), 0.25 mg/mL of trypsin inhibitor, and 25 ng/mL of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell mixture was filtrated by passing through a 100-m filter to retain the nondigested fragments while pancreatic acinar structures (acinus of 1015 cells) could pass through.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated acini were seeded as 2 mL per well in a six-well culture dish and then cultured at 37 °C under 5% (vol/vol) CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After culturing for 24 h, the cells were used for DNA transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H&E_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For H&E staining the mouse tissues, the tissues were isolated after mice were anesthetized with 5% chloral hydrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse tissues were fixed in the 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% neutral buffered formaldehyde) overnight, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned to 5 µm by Winship CorePathology Core Laboratory at Emory University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot__Immunofluorescence__Immunohistochemistry__Coimmunoprecipitation__and_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For Western blot, protein samples were homogenized in the Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40) or RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% DOC, and 1% Triton X-100) with 1× protease inhibitor (Sigma, P8340).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of protein loaded was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysates were run in a Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blots were analyzed using relative antibodies specific for different proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins on the blot were visualized by using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (34095) or Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (RPN2232) for Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, mice were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated brain, pancreatic, and other tissues were fixed overnight (1216 h) in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS, and then transferred into 30% sucrose at 4 °C to let the brain completely sink to the bottom of the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brains or other tissues were sectioned at 20 m with a cryostat at 19 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice tissue slides or cultured cells were fixed for 12 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS at room temperature, blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100/3% BSA/1× PBS for 30 min, and incubated with primary antibodies to relative proteins in 3% BSA/1× PBS overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were washed three times with 1× PBS and rinsed with specific donkey anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -goat fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Hoechst for staining nuclear that was diluted in 1× PBS for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse tissue sections were examined by using a Zeiss (Axiovert 200M) microscope with a digital camera (Orca-100; Hamamatsu Photonics) and Openlab software (Improvision).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For coimmunoprecipitation, the Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.0% Nonidet P-40) was used to homogenize the mouse tissues and culture cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23227) and 2,000 µg of protein was used for one experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 30 µl Protein A-beads (Sigma) were used to preclean the protein lysates for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer, and then analyzed for Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For electron microscopy, the mice were perfused with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PB, pH = 7.3) containing 4% PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details for electron microscopic examination were described previously (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme_Activity_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were killed at intervals between 30 and 48 h after the 2 or 3 i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of tamoxifen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sera of blood were isolated by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the upper layer sera were stored at 80 °C for further studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measurement of pancreatic enzyme activities, pancreatic tissues were thawed and homogenized in iced buffer containing 5 mM MOPS, 1 mM MgSO4, and 250 mM sucrose (pH 6.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample preparation for trypsin, trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP), and MPO assay was performed as described previously (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amylase and lipase activities were determined by commercially available kits (DLPS-100 and DAMY-100) (BioAssay System).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Trypsin_Activity_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trypsin activities were determined with a fluorescent assay using a spectrophotometer in which samples were excited at 380 nm and emissions were collected at 440 nm for a minimum of 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA was added to the cell lysates, which was digested by trypsin, resulting in a fluorescent dye called MCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) that can be detected via fluorescence intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse pancreas tissues were homogenized by using a Teflon homogenizer for 50 strokes and sonicated for 10 s on ice in homogenization buffer (pH 6.5, 5 mM MOPS, 250 mM sucrose, and 1 mM magnesium sulfate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysates were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were used for trypsin assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine tissue or cell protein concentration, a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (23225) was used with the absorbance value at 562 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A final working concentration of 50 M trypsin substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA was dissolved in assay buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mg/mL BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture (285 L 50 M Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA and 15 L of cell lysate supernatants) was added into the 96-well microplate, allowing the cleavage of the substrate by trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard curve was generated using commercial porcine trypsin (Sigma, T8003) in different concentrations (010,000 units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vitro trypsin activity assay of cultured HEK293 cells transfected with different Spink3 and HTT forms, 15 L cell lysate supernatants was mixed with 10 L 2,000 units porcine trypsin (Sigma, T8003) and 275 L 50 M trypsin substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA and then used for trypsin assay as mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
