Metabolic activity induces membrane phase separation in endoplasmic reticulum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Membranes can adopt distinct phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest membrane system inside cells and also harbors the richest metabolic activity including lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike plasma membrane where separated lipid raft domains have been predicted and observed, ER membrane is thought to be uniformly fluidic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such understanding is based on biophysical studies of model membrane under thermodynamic equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unclear whether and how lipid synthesis activity perturbs the equilibrium and promotes phase segregation in ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we utilized coherent Raman imaging technique to track lipid synthesis and surprisingly revealed solid-like domains emerging from liquid ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this phenomenon can be tuned by the incoming nutrient source, demonstrating the susceptibility of ER membrane to nonequilibrium modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Membrane phase behavior has been well characterized in model membranes in vitro under thermodynamic equilibrium state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the widely observed differences between biological membranes and their in vitro counterparts are placing more emphasis on nonequilibrium factors, including influx and efflux of lipid molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest cellular membrane system and also the most metabolically active organelle responsible for lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the nonequilibrium metabolic activity modulates ER membrane phase has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we studied the phase behavior of functional ER in the context of lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing advanced vibrational imaging technique, that is, stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, we discovered that metabolism of palmitate, a prevalent saturated fatty acid (SFA), could drive solid-like domain separation from the presumably uniformly fluidic ER membrane, a previously unknown phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential of various fatty acids to induce solid phase can be predicted by the transition temperatures of their major metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interplay between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids is also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our study sheds light on cellular membrane biophysics by underscoring the nonequilibrium metabolic status of living cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Palmitate_Promotes_Membrane_Lipid_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ER hosts the majority of de novo lipid synthesis in the cell (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the ER is able to build new membrane components from external nutrients including fatty acids and supply the renewal of other membrane-bound organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it has been reported that palmitate, the most abundant fatty acid in circulation (15), promotes phospholipid synthesis and accumulation in the ER (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand how palmitate metabolism reshapes the cellular lipidome and what types of lipid metabolites are accumulating, we analyzed changes in cellular lipid composition over time by HPLC-MS (Fig 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The time-dependent lipid heat map (Fig S1) reveals significant fold increase in glycerolipids [diacylglyceride (DG), triacylglyceride (TG), and phospholipids] and ceramide (Cer) (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms that exogenous fatty acid promotes de novo lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when quantified by the change in absolute amount, several particular lipids show up in the highest rank of increase or decrease (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides TG, a common storage lipid, the major lipid accumulation is attributed to DG, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) with two saturated fatty acyl chains (most likely 16:0 or 18:0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, there is a slight decrease in cholesterol ester (CE) and PC lipids with unsaturated acyl chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, palmitate caused time-dependent accumulation of fully saturated glycerolipids that elevated the overall lipid saturation in the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vibrational_Imaging_Reveals_Dynamic_Structures_Derived_from_Lipid_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the spatial heterogeneity of these newly synthesized lipids, we then sought to visualize their distribution and organization as well as relation to the ER in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward this, we employed the emerging vibrational imaging technique for stable-isotopelabeled small molecules (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the vibration of carbondeuterium bond (CD) in small molecules provides distinct chemical contrast for stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This platform is well-suited for studying lipid metabolism as well as membrane biophysics (1619), since tagging small lipid molecules with relatively bulky fluorophores often significantly perturbs lipid metabolism (20) (and will also be shown later in our study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, most common fluorescent tags such as NBD and BODIPY were termed ill-suited when used to study lipid biophysics (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We treated cells with deuterium-labeled palmitate (d-palmitate) for several hours before acquiring CD SRS images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that palmitate-derived lipids possessing the CD label formed isolated micrometer-sized patches (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then correlated the CD SRS image with confocal fluorescence from a luminal ER marker (ER-GFP) (Fig 2B) or a membrane ER marker (mCherry-Sec61) (Fig S2 A and B) transiently expressed in the same cell, or from immune-stained ER membrane protein SERCA2 (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, we confirmed that these new structures colocalized with the ER, consistent with ER accumulation of palmitate-derived lipids mentioned earlier (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we studied the dynamics including both the growth and turnover of these structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We supplemented HeLa cells with palmitate concentration varying from 10 to 400 M for duration from 1 to 20 h (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in reference to the free fatty acid concentration in circulation (fluctuating in a wide range from submillimolar to several millimolar) (22) and that commonly applied in other studies [e.g., 400 M (8, 2325)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the new structures grew over time, faster at higher concentration (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appeared as isolated puncta in early stages and gradually developed into large lamellar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development over time well correlates with the accumulation of palmitate metabolites revealed by lipidomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these structures exist in a wide range of time and dose conditions we have used: at concentration down to 10 M, or after as short as 1-h treatment (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To resolve the growth dynamics in single cells, we performed a sequential treatment first by palmitate followed by d-palmitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later-applied label appeared on the rim, which suggests that the development of the structure is driven by accumulation of new palmitate metabolites at the periphery (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compartments disappeared gradually following removal of palmitate from the media, indicating that their development relies on the sustained influx of fatty acid (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the above dynamic features suggest that these palmitate-derived structures were driven by cellular metabolic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further verified the above conclusion based on the following additional lines of evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, although palmitate is reported to be toxic at high dose (26), no observable cell death occurred under the time and dose condition we used for imaging (Fig S3B), which indicates that the cells are metabolically active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, quantification of intracellular free fatty acid (FFA) reveals a transient rise and then recovery to baseline level within 3 h (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FFA alone is not sufficient to form such stable structures over a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, these structures were abolished by small-molecule inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase that catalyzes the first step in lipid synthesis (27) (Fig S3 D and E), and were also suppressed by siRNA of GPAT4, an enzyme involved in phospholipid synthesis (28) (Fig S3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Newly_Synthesized_Lipids_Form_Phase-Separated_Membrane_Domains_in_the_ER  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the observed dynamic accumulation of palmitate metabolites in ER, we asked whether ER membrane phase had been affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we first examined if the new structures are membrane, and then evaluated if they are phase-separated domains from the fluidic ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We confirmed that they were not lipid droplets (LDs) where neutral lipid metabolites (TAG and CE) are stored using Nile Red staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At early stage (1-h incubation), LDs as stained by Nile Red already accumulate significant CD signal that appear saturated in intensity (Fig 3A, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the majority of palmitate-derived structures lacked staining by Nile Red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity profiles imply that the failure of staining in the latter structure is not due to poor Nile Red contrast in small nascent LDs (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed they did not correlate with nascent LD sensor cherry-LiveDrop (29) (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, quantitative image analysis of the Nile-Redpositive and negative structures reveals significant difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LDs can be easily distinguished in the image as small intense puncta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the non-LD structures exhibit wider distribution in size but weaker and more uniform intensity than LDs (Fig S4 B and C), suggesting a lamellar organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, morphologically, reconstructed z-stack images revealed planar micrometer-sized structures in xy but with diffraction-limited z profiles (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits into the model where planar membrane bilayer lies parallel to the illumination plane (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells where individual compartments are no longer resolvable from each other, we could always find step-like features in the line profile of CD SRS intensity (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could then identify an equal spacing after calculating pairwise intensity difference (Fig 3E) (14 ± 5 V in HeLa and 19 ± 6 V in COS-7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an estimation, this intensity spacing translates into 3.1 × 106 palmitoyl groups in focus, which approximates to the SRS signal size calculated from one deuterated lipid bilayer, suggesting the compositional unit to be lipid bilayer (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in parallel with lipidomic analysis that the accumulating lipids (DG, PA, PI, and PC) are all membrane constituents (Fig 1), these pieces of evidence from imaging strongly support that palmitate-derived lipids are forming membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In fact, forming domains instead of blending into existing ER membrane already implies different organization in palmitate-derived lipids from the native ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then further examined the spatial relation of these domains to ER membrane using two types of membrane markers, one lipid (BODIPY-C12) and one membrane protein (mCherry-sec61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BODIPY-C12 is a common fluorescent analog of palmitate (Fig 4A) and also serves as a general membrane lipid marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we added trace BODIPY-C12 along with d-palmitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, different patterns were observed in the correlative SRS and fluorescence images (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CD SRS exhibited many isolated domains, BODIPY-C12 highlighted reticular structure resembling the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even negative correlation can be observed between BODIPY fluorescence and CD SRS channel in flat regions of ER membrane such as large sheet and nuclear envelope (Fig 4C and Fig S5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation, on one hand, could be reconciled by strong perturbation from the BODIPY tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it supported the hypothesized lateral phase separation in ER membrane, since bulky fluorescent probes usually favor partitioning into disordered over ordered phase in vitro (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This lateral phase separation can be further verified with an ER membrane protein marker, mCherry-Sec61 (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, on large sheets, negative correlation can be clearly identified between CD SRS and mCherry fluorescence channels (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Special considerations must be taken when examining the lateral heterogeneity in ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different from plasma membrane or vesicle, the ER has a unique architecture composed by tubular and lamellar cisternae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that the planar structure of CD SRS domains fits into the model of so-called ER sheet (lamellar cisternae), where a lamellar space is enclosed by two opposing membrane bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palmitate metabolites completely occupied one layer (and expand ER sheet), while forming intercalating domains on fluidic ER on the other layer (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is manifested in the line profiles of CD SRS that negatively correlates with fluorescence channel (Fig 4 C and E and Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emergence_of_Solid-Like_Domain_in_ER_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike plasma membrane (about 50% cholesterol), ER membrane is characterized by low cholesterol level [36% of lipids (30)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This predicts unique phase behavior in ER membrane, because cholesterol is known to eliminate solidliquid transition and promote Lo-phase formation in in vitro model membrane (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, ER membrane in its normal state is believed to adopt uniform Ld phase due to low lipid saturation (1, 14, 32), but meanwhile is potentiated for LSo phase separation if saturation level elevates sufficiently (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since palmitate-induced lipid synthesis introduces into the ER new membrane components that are overall more saturated, we hypothesized that such influx was able to drive solid-like domain separation from the otherwise Ld-like ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid phase is characterized by highly ordered acyl chain packing, as well as ultraslow lateral motion (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to test our hypothesis, we first evaluated the conformational order and then estimated the translational mobility of lipids within these domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Raman spectroscopy, acyl chain conformational order could be inferred from the Raman peak width of CD2 symmetric stretch vibration at 2,101 cm1: the more ordered, the narrower the peak (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectra measured from d-palmitatetreated cells (Fig 5A, cell 25 °C or 37 °C) resembled that from d62-DPPC in the ordered (presumably So) phase (Fig 5A, d62-DPPC 25 °C), but displayed pronouncedly narrower peaks than d62-DPPC or d31-POPC in Ld phase (Fig 5A, d62-DPPC 42 °C and d31-POPC 25 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To offer more spatial information, we performed ratiometric SRS imaging between 2,101 and 2,168 cm1 to map the conformational order of intracellular palmitate metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, with reasonable heterogeneity, the membrane domains display high 2,101/2,168 cm1 ratio close to the ordered phase (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in situ Raman microspectroscopy and SRS spectral imaging unraveled a marked increase in acyl chain conformational order on the palmitate-derived membrane domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then sought to evaluate the translational mobility within the phase-separated domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since fluorescent probes failed to incorporate into these domains (Fig 4), we relied on pulse-chase SRS imaging to estimate the lateral diffusion coefficient (D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequentially treated the cells with d-palmitate, then regular palmitate, and finally d-palmitate again, and observed a bulls-eye-like pattern in the CD SRS channel (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar bulls-eye pattern was observed for a longer-chain SFA, stearic acid (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By estimation, if these domains were in the liquid phase, one would predict homogeneous CD signal distribution within individual domains (2D free diffusion displacement d = 510 m) due to fast lateral diffusion [D(Ld)  1 m2/s, D(Lo)  101 m2/s] (1, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semiquantitatively, Gaussian fitting of the line profiles yielded an estimated D about 104 m2/s (Supporting Information), which is close to that in So phase [D(So)  103 m2/s (1, 34)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, collision between separate domains was also captured (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the collided domains neither completely fuse nor recover the circular morphology in nearly half an hour, again suggesting that they are in solid phase wherein intradomain interaction overcomes line tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, with various characterizations, we confirmed the existence of solid-phase membrane in living mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Tm_Palmitate_Metabolites_Provide_Driving_Force_for_Phase_Separation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain insight into the molecular driving force underlying solid-like domain, we evaluated the phase transition temperature (Tm) of accumulated lipids highlighted in lipidomics (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that those 32:0 and 34:0 lipids all bear significantly higher Tm (Tm = 4167 °C, Table S1) than physiological temperature, which could account for the driving force of LSo phase separation under the low cholesterol presented in the ER (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further test whether high-Tm lipids are indeed enriched in phase-separated membrane domains, we performed detergent wash by Triton X-100 following palmitate treatment (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance to nonionic detergent such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C is a classical assay used to identify the existence of potentially ordered membrane domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRS imaging revealed that CD domains but not the majority of endogenous CH2-bearing lipids showed resistance to detergent wash (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then did parallel lipidomic analysis on control or palmitate-treated cells before and after detergent wash (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We divided the major lipid species (DG, PA, PI, and PC) into high-Tm (Tm  37 °C) and low-Tm (Tm less_than 37 °C) categories and quantified each category in total lipid extract or detergent-resistant fraction (Fig 5 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the result shows that new lipid synthesis is dedicated to high-Tm lipids but not low-Tm lipids; thus, increase in high-Tm lipids is well correlated with appearance of CD SRS signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the increased portion of high-Tm lipids is mostly retained after detergent wash while low-Tm lipids are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further pinpointed the direct involvement of high-Tm lipids in the formation of detergent-resistant CD SRS domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar detergent-resistant membrane pattern was also observed following treatment of regular palmitate, which rules out the possible interference of isotope labeling (Fig S7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lipidomic and imaging analysis together demonstrate the preferred localization of high-Tm lipids within solid-like membrane domains, supporting that high-Tm metabolites were indeed the molecular driving force for such phase separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER_Membrane_Phase_Separation_Can_Be_Tuned_by_Fatty_Acid_Unsaturation_and_Chain_Length  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the hypothesized connection between high-Tm lipids and membrane domain formation, ER phase separation should be dependent on the molecular identity of the fatty acid and can be predicted by the Tm of its main lipid metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we similarly applied a common unsaturated fatty acid (UFA), oleate, whose metabolites (e.g., DOPC) possess very low Tm due to the unsaturation in the acyl chain (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colocalization of CD SRS to Nile Red fluorescence reveals that oleate is incorporated almost exclusively into LDs, and did not form membrane domains (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We went on to test a set of deuterated SFAs including lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and stearic acid (C18:0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their metabolites show elevating Tm values due to increasing fatty acyl chain lengths (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our hypothesis, they exhibited increasing capability to drive large-scale phase separation at the same concentration (Fig 6B): C12:0 does not form visible membrane domains but numerous LDs even after prolonged treatment; C14:0 only forms domains with limited size (1 m); C18:0 forms large-scale membrane structures even faster than C16:0 does.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, in the functional sense, we found similar dependence for fatty-acidinduced cell death (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell death was observed only after prolonged incubation with the long-chain SFA C16:0 and C18:0, but not with UFA or short-chain SFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dependence is also correlated with stress markers reported elsewhere that are mutually independent, including Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) signaling, activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (25, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the metabolic effect of a fatty acid might be predicted by simple physicochemical principle regarding the Tm of its metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interplay_Between_Fatty_Acids_in_Modulating_ER_Membrane_Phase_Separation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the plasma consists of a complex and fluctuating mixture of SFA and UFA (15), this further raises an interesting question whether fatty acids could influence each other in the metabolic modulation of ER membrane phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticing the relatively low Tm of POPC, we hypothesized that oleate might prevent the system from being driven by palmitate to phase separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, we added oleate together with d-palmitate to study its influence on the phase separation potential of the latter (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical studies have found that oleate can channel palmitate into LDs (23), which is also manifested in CD SRS images from our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more importantly, oleate also diminished the solid-like domains in a concentration-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in this context, oleate itself stays excluded from the remaining solid-phase membrane (Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oleate was also able to reduce solid membrane after its formation in a pulse-chase manner (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to oleate, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, was also able to reduce the area of palmitate-derived solid membrane domains (Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In parallel, we compared the lipid profile after cotreatment of oleate to that only treated by palmitate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both total lipid extract and detergent-resistant fraction show significant alteration by oleate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of oleate is clearly reflected in the level of low-Tm and high-Tm lipids (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total lipid extract, oleate reduced more high-Tm lipids than low-Tm lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In detergent-resistant fraction, which is more specific to the solid-phase membrane, oleate also significantly reduced high-Tm lipids but did not affect low-Tm lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in supplementation to the current understanding that accumulation of neutral lipids is cytoprotective, a previously unknown mechanism for UFA to rescue the cytotoxicity of SFA might lie in its ability to destruct the solid-like membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By taking advantage of live-cell SRS microscopy coupled with minimally perturbative isotope labeling, we discovered that the influx of high-Tm lipids caused by SFA metabolism could drive the formation of large-scale membrane domains in the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the newly formed domains exhibited solid-like characteristics as detergent resistance, high conformational order, ultraslow lateral diffusion, strong intradomain interaction, and large-scale structural stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation thus reveals the susceptibility of ER membrane phase to the metabolic activity, and, to some extent, corroborates the theoretical prediction under nonequilibrium condition (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we want to emphasize that the earlier work by Fan et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) focuses on LoLd phase separation to account for lipid raft on plasma membrane, and the nonequilibrium condition there largely refers to vesicle delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological manifestations are different here for the ER with all of the unique characteristics such as low cholesterol level and high de novo lipid synthesis activity, although the conclusion drawn from our study converges to a similar physical principle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In retrospect, ER membrane phase separation has escaped previous observations possibly for three reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, decades of membrane biophysics studies in live cells have been primarily focused on plasma membrane, where high cholesterol level (about 50%) (1) favors Lo and Ld phases instead of solid phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it has to be observed under nonequilibrium condition, where metabolic activity in the ER perturbs the membrane far enough from equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the solid-phase membrane is difficult to capture by fluorescent lipid probes due to their poor ER delivery and/or low partitioning into potentially ordered phase (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we showed that bulky-labeled BODIPY-C12 could not partition in solid domain (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same reason, such phase separation could elude the examination of membrane fluidity using fluorescent FA analogs (24), which only report on the liquid phase in ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Culture_and_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa (ATCC) and COS-7 (ATCC) cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled or unlabeled fatty acids (Sigma or Cambridge Isotope Lab) were coupled to BSA (Sigma) in 2:1 molar ratio and added to medium to designated concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four hundred micromolar fatty acid was used, if not specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ER is visualized in live cells using CellLight ER-GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers manual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mCherry-Sec61 was a gift from Gia Voeltz, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient transfection was done with Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 (BODIPY-C12) (Molecular Probes) was used as a fluorescent fatty acid tracer at 2 M. Neutral lipid was stained with 1 M Nile Red solution (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SRS_and_Fluorescence_Imaging_and_Raman_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The setup for SRS microscopy was similar to what was described earlier (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlative SRS and confocal fluorescence imaging was performed on the same microscope (FV1200; Olympus) and objective (60×, water immersion, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.2, UPlanAPO/IR; Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous Raman spectra were acquired using an upright confocal Raman spectrometer (Xplora; HORIBA Jobin Yvon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
