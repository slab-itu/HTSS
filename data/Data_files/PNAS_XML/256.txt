Mapping physiological G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways reveals a role for receptor phosphorylation in airway contraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies in transfected cells have established that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate a number of intracellular signaling pathways; however, which of these pathways are physiologically important is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a genetically engineered mouse to demonstrate a novel role for M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-mAChR) phosphorylation in airway constriction, with implications for human respiratory disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining this finding with other M3-mAChR physiological responses, we generate a map of responses that are downstream of G protein-dependent signaling or receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a map predicts the outcome of biased GPCR drugs designed to drive receptor signaling preferentially toward pathways that improve therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxic/adverse outcomes and provides a fundamental approach to the rational design of next-generation GPCR-based therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to initiate a plethora of signaling pathways in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear which of these pathways are engaged to mediate physiological responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examine the distinct roles of Gq/11-dependent signaling and receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling in bronchial airway contraction and lung function regulated through the M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-mAChR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a genetically engineered mouse expressing a G protein-biased M3-mAChR mutant, we reveal the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation in bronchial smooth muscle contraction in health and in a disease state with relevance to human asthma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this mouse model can be used to distinguish the physiological responses that are regulated by M3-mAChR phosphorylation (which include control of lung function) from those responses that are downstream of G protein signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, we present an approach by which to predict the physiological/therapeutic outcome of M3-mAChRbiased ligands with important implications for drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Phosphorylation-Deficient_M3-mAChR_Mutant_Is_Expressed_in_ASM_and_Coupled_Normally_to_Gq_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously established that a mutant of the M3-mAChR, where 15 Ser phosphoacceptor sites in the third intracellular loop were mutated to Ala, showed reduced levels of agonist-mediated phosphorylation and significantly attenuated coupling to arrestin and arrestin-dependent signaling while maintaining near-normal coupling to Gq/11-dependent signaling (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present further evidence that G protein coupling of the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant is normal by evaluating the coupling of both WT and mutant receptors to 10 different G-subunits in a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based live cell assay (18, 19) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments demonstrated that the profile of G protein activation between the WT M3-mAChR and the phosphodeficient mutant was very similar, with both receptor types predominantly coupling to Gq (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, there appeared to be no significant coupling of the M3-mAChR to G12/13 proteins (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments in which the receptor was not transfected showed no significant activation of G proteins, including Gq (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A mutant mouse strain, termed M3-knockin (M3-KI), was generated, where the M3-mAChR gene locus was modified to express the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant in place of the WT receptor (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscarinic receptor expression levels in lungs from M3-KI mice (determined by radioligand binding) were not significantly different from the muscarinic receptor expression levels in lungs from WT mice (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the levels of the mutant receptor transcript in the lungs from M3-KI mice were similar to the levels of the WT receptor in C57BL/6J mice as determined by RT-PCR (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an in-house Ab to the M3-mAChR, we found a normal expression profile of the mutant M3-mAChR in ASM of M3-KI mice, as indicated by colocalization of immunostaining of the receptor and -actin in airways (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

M3-mAChR_Mediates_ASM_Contraction_in_a_Receptor_Phosphorylation-Dependent_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the impact of mutating phosphorylation sites on the M3-mAChR in the lung, we used precision cut lung slices (PCLS) to monitor bronchoconstriction (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous reports (21), we showed that muscarinic receptor stimulation of PCLS from WT mice resulted in a concentration-dependent narrowing of the airways [half-maximum effective concentration (pEC50) = 5.47 ± 0.06, maximum drug effect (Emax) = 82.47 ± 5.82] (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the responsiveness of PCLS from M3-KI mice was significantly reduced in both maximal response and potency (pEC50 = 4.01 ± 0.06, Emax = 40.79 ± 5.73) (Fig 2 AD and Movies S1 and S2.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the coupling of the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant to Gq/calcium signaling in PCLS derived from M3-KI mice was seen to be very similar to the coupling observed in WT PCLS cultures (Fig 2 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite normal coupling to Gq/calcium mobilization, the mutant receptor expressed in M3-KI mouse lung showed reduced airway contraction, indicating an important role for receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling in M3-mAChRmediated ASM contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because previous studies had established that the RhoA pathway mediates calcium-independent ASM contraction (35), we investigated the role of RhoA signaling downstream of M3-mAChR phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro analysis of RhoA activation using a FRET-based biosensor (Fig 3A) revealed that the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant coupled with  greater than 200-fold lower potency to the RhoA pathway (pEC50 = 5.41 ± 0.63) than the WT receptor (pEC50 = 7.74 ± 0.17) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the RhoA pathway ultimately results in the phosphorylation of MLC and smooth muscle contraction (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining for phosphorylation of MLC on Ser-19 showed pronounced MLC phosphorylation in the ASM in PCLS from WT animals in both the basal state and following carbachol stimulation (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ASM in PCLS from M3-KI mice showed substantially less MLC phosphorylation (Fig 3D), a result consistent with reduced activation of RhoA signaling in M3-KI airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the RhoA-kinase inhibitor H1152 reduced the maximal M3-mAChR contractile response in PCLS from WT mice by 43% and the potency of ACh-mediated contraction by  greater than 10-fold (pEC50 was reduced from 5.07 ± 0.15 to 3.98 ± 0.13 following H1152 treatment) (Fig 3 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that a significant component of the M3-mAChRmediated ASM contractile response was independent of Gq/calcium signaling but was dependent on M3-mAChR phosphorylation and the activation of the RhoA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with this notion was the fact that inhibition of M3-mAChRmediated Gq/calcium mobilization in PCLS from WT mice using the recently characterized Gq inhibitor FR900359 (22) (Fig 3H and Fig S3 A and B) did not affect the M3-mAChRmediated contractile response (Fig 3 H and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of FR900359 used in these experiments (30 nM) completely prevented the carbachol-mediated calcium response in PCLS (Fig 3H) but had no significant effect on carbachol-mediated smooth muscle contraction (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, inhibition of Gq/calcium signaling with FR900359 did not significantly affect the small contractile response seen in PCLS from M3-KI mice in response to carbachol, (Fig S4 A and B) and FR900359 did not appear to affect the level of MLC phosphorylation in PCLS from WT mice stimulated with carbachol (Fig 3K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data point to RhoA-mediated signaling downstream of receptor phosphorylation having a prominent role in M3 receptor-mediated ASM contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lung_Function_and_Allergen-Associated_Airway_Hyperresponsiveness_Are_Dependent_on_M3-mAChR_Phosphorylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if the reduction in the contractile response of PCLS obtained from M3-KI mice translated to changes in in vivo lung function, lung resistance in response to ACh challenge in WT mice and M3-KI mice was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies revealed a rightward shift in the potency and a decrease in the maximal response of the lung resistance induced by administration of ACh in M3-KI mice (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in lung resistance in response to ACh in the M3-KI mice was also reflected in a significant increase in the concentration of ACh required to elevate lung resistance by 100% (logPC100) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
M3-mAChR signaling through RhoA in ASM has been closely linked with experimentally induced airway hyperresponsiveness in different studies using murine models of allergy (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested here if the reduced coupling of the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant to RhoA signaling and the subsequent reduction in ASM contraction observed in M3-KI mice had an impact on allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness using a murine model of allergic inflammatory airway disease (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, WT mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with saline (0.9% NaCl) showed an increase in lung resistance to ACh that was significantly augmented in mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with ovalbumin (Fig 4C), a response defined as classical airway hyperresponsiveness (24, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, M3-KI mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with ovalbumin showed no hyperresponsiveness in response to ACh administration (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of hyperresponsiveness following ovalbumin sensitization/challenge in M3-KI mice was also reflected by the lack of change in the logPC100 value in M3-KI mice following ovalbumin sensitization/challenge (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the logPC100 value fell from 2.38 ± 0.02 in WT mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with saline to 1.68 ± 0.06 after ovalbumin sensitization and ovalbumin challenge, indicative of airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the logPC100 value for the M3-KI mice that were ovalbumin-sensitized and saline-challenged (2.64 ± 0.17) was not significantly different from the logPC100 value for M3-KI mice that had been ovalbumin-sensitized and ovalbumin-challenged (2.59 ± 0.06) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that M3-mAChR phosphorylation was required in the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The acute ovalbumin-sensitization model used here is associated with an inflammatory response, as indicated by changes in cytokine levels and infiltration of immune cells into the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of cell infiltration by assessing total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) determined that the accumulation of inflammatory cells into the lung following ovalbumin sensitization and ovalbumin challenge was not significantly different between WT and M3-KI mice (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of different inflammatory cell types in the BAL was carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the macrophage levels (Fig S5B) were not seen to change following ovalbumin sensitization/challenge of WT and M3-KI mice, the numbers of eosinophils (Fig S5C), neutrophils (Fig S5D), and lymphocytes (Fig S5E) were significantly increased, by the same extent, in WT and M3-KI mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with ovalbumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorylation_of_the_M3-mAChR_Regulates_Specific_Physiological_Responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show here how the G protein-biased M3-mAChR mutant receptor expressed in M3-KI mice can be used to define the role of receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling in bronchial ASM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that this approach could be extended to include other M3-mAChRmediated responses and that a map of the physiological responses that lay downstream of the two fundamental signaling arms of the M3-mAChR, namely, G protein-dependent and phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling, could be generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we compared the M3-mAChRmediated contraction of bronchial smooth muscle with other M3-mAChRmediated physiological responses, namely, salivary secretion and weight gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous gene KO studies established that salivary secretion in response to low doses of the muscarinic partial agonist pilocarpine was almost completely dependent on M3-mAChR (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these studies were confirmed here, where salivary secretion in response to pilocarpine was significantly reduced in M3-mAChR KO mice (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, salivary secretion in response to pilocarpine in M3-KI mice was significantly enhanced compared with WT animals (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that in contrast to M3-mAChRmediated contraction of ASM, M3-mAChRmediated secretion of saliva was independent of receptor phosphorylation signaling but was dependent on signaling through Gq pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight increase in salivary secretion observed in M3-KI mice may reflect the fact that phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, which are traditionally considered to desensitize G protein responses, are not in operation in M3-KI mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
M3-mAChR KO mice have also previously been reported to show reduced food intake and decreased body fat (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype has been associated with the action of the M3-mAChR on the hypothalamic leptin/melanocortin system (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the M3-mAChR KO mice showed an increase in both resting and total energy expenditure (oxygen consumption) as well as an increase in the rate of oxidation of fatty acids (30), phenotypes that have been linked with M3-mAChR regulation of sympathetic flow (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of both of these physiological processes in M3-mAChR KO mice combines to generate an overall lean phenotype, where the mice show reduced total body weight (29, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm these data here by demonstrating that M3-mAChR KO mice have reduced body weight compared with WT controls (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the M3-mAChR KO mice, M3-KI mice were slightly, but significantly, heavier than the WT controls (Fig 5 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that M3-mAChR signaling via Gq protein is the primary signaling pathway that regulates M3-mAChR metabolic and feeding responses responsible for weight gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining these data with previously published results (Discussion), a map of the physiological pathways downstream of phosphorylation/arrestin signaling and G protein-dependent signaling can be generated (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This map can be used to predict the physiological/therapeutic outcome of biased M3-mAChR ligands (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study demonstrates a previously unidentified role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation in the regulation of lung function and in driving airway hyperresponsiveness, one of the key features of allergic inflammatory airway disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our unique observation also highlights the importance of receptor phosphorylation in mediating M3-mAChRinduced ASM contraction via the activation of the RhoA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because previous studies had demonstrated a role for RhoA signaling in calcium-independent ASM contraction (35), we used a genetically engineered mouse that expresses a phosphorylation-deficient variant of the M3-mAChR (M3-KI) to investigate the possibility that phosphorylation of the M3-mAChR was involved in coupling the receptor to RhoA signaling and, through this mechanism, to ASM contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That phosphorylation of the M3-mAChR plays a role in coupling to RhoA was indicated by (i) data showing that pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase in WT PCLS phenocopied the reduced airway contraction response observed in PCLS from M3-KI mice, (ii) that the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR showed markedly reduced coupling to RhoA, and (iii) that phosphorylation of MLC was significantly reduced in ASM of M3-KI mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we used the recently characterized Gq inhibitor FR900359 (22) to demonstrate that M3-mAChRinduced calcium mobilization was inhibited by FR900359, whereas M3-induced airway contraction was not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our experimental design measured the overall calcium changes in whole PCLS, we cannot completely exclude a role of compartmentalized changes in Gq-driven calcium signals in ASM in the regulation of airway contraction, as shown by others (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our data are consistent with a recent report demonstrating that muscarinic-mediated contractile responses in human PCLS were less sensitive to FR900359, and therefore less dependent on calcium, than contraction mediated by histamine receptors (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, knocking down -arrestin-1 has recently been shown to impair muscarinic-mediated bronchoconstriction (33), demonstrating the complexity surrounding the procontractile pathways coupled to M3-mAChRs in ASM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies, coupled with our data, support the hypothesis that M3-mAChR phosphorylation mediates activation of RhoA signaling (possibly by arrestin recruitment) that results in increased MLC phosphorylation and ASM contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phosphorylation-dependent calcium sensitization process plays a prominent role in M3-mAChRdependent ASM contraction, with a minor role played by calcium transient-dependent processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that vagally derived ACh limits airflow by bronchoconstriction mediated by the activation of the M3-mAChR on ASM (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation in ASM contraction identified here is of physiological relevance, then it might be expected that the lung function of M3-KI mice would be different from the lung function of WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found (by assessing lung resistance) that airway obstruction in response to ACh was significantly reduced in M3-KI mice compared with WT mice, an observation consistent with the notion that the phosphorylation status of the M3-mAChR is important in regulating baseline cholinergic ASM tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with studies conducted in healthy volunteers showing a significant improvement in lung function by anticholinergic drugs (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in an acute murine model of allergic inflammatory airway disease, which mimics several of the central hallmarks of human bronchial asthma (35), including airway hyperresponsiveness and immune cell lung infiltration, we show that the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to ACh was dependent on M3-mAChR phosphorylation-dependent pathways because sensitized M3-KI mice failed to demonstrate the typically enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both normal and pathophysiological lung function in M3-KI mice was significantly different from WT mice, indicating an important role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation in the regulation of airway narrowing in health and disease states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms by which allergen-exposed M3-KI mice were protected against the development of abnormal bronchial responsiveness appeared to be unrelated to the number of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils) recruited within the airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dissociation between airway inflammation and the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness has been previously reported in various studies, including observations in asthmatic patients (36) as well as in animal models of allergic inflammatory airway disease (34, 37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we propose that in the lung, phosphorylation of the M3-mAChR is important in driving key asthmatic features, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, in part, via M3-mAChR phosphorylation and RhoA-dependent signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our M3-KI mouse line expressing G protein-biased M3-mAChR mutant defined a previously unidentified role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation-dependent signaling in ASM contraction, we reasoned that this mouse line could be used to investigate other M3-mAChRmediated physiological responses and establish whether these responses were dependent on G protein- or receptor phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined M3-mAChRmediated salivary secretion and weight gain and established that both of these responses were slightly up-regulated in M3-KI mice, indicating that they were not dependent on receptor phosphorylation/arrestin signaling, but more likely dependent on G protein coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of the phosphorylation-dependent desensitization of G protein-mediated signaling may be responsible for the modest but significant increase in weight and salivary secretion observed in M3-KI mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These physiological responses could be added to our previous studies demonstrating a predominant role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation/arrestin coupling in the regulation of insulin secretion (14) and learning and memory (15), as well as in G protein coupling in M3-mAChR regulation of p53 subcellular localization and apoptosis (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining all these studies, we have generated a map of the physiological responses mediated by the M3-mAChR through either G protein- or receptor phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This map has allowed us, for the first time to our knowledge, to make a prediction of the likely physiological outcomes of a biased GPCR ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an M3-mAChR drug-like ligand showing stimulus bias toward receptor phosphorylation and arrestin signaling would preferentially engage physiological signaling pathways that would promote changes in insulin secretion, have an impact on learning and memory, and regulate bronchoconstriction (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same ligand would not be expected to have a substantial impact on salivary secretion, weight gain, and mechanisms associated with cell survival (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis has considerable potential application in drug discovery, where biased ligands can be designed to direct signaling toward those pathways that result in clinical efficacy and away from pathways that lead to adverse/toxic outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, by using a genetically modified mouse expressing a G protein-biased receptor, we are not only able to define the physiologically relevant signaling pathways acting downstream of a particular GPCR (in this case, the M3-mAChR) but also to determine what type of signaling bias to design into ligands targeting that receptor to promote a particular physiological/therapeutic outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animal_Experimentation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were performed under a project license from the British Home Office, United Kingdom, under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Weight_Gain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male C57BL/6NTac WT (n = 10) and M3-KO (n = 10) mice and C57BL/6J WT (n = 10) and M3-KI (n = 6) mice were weighed weekly after weaning (between day 24 and day 27 after birth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse were housed in groups of three to five and fed with normal chow ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_PCLS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Precision cut lung slicing was performed as described previously (10, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT C57BL/6J or M3-KI adult mice (810 wk old) were killed by cervical dislocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trachea was exposed, and a cannula was inserted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lungs were inflated using 1.0 mL of a 2% (wt/vol) low-melting-point agarose solution, followed by a 0.1-mL air bolus to force the agarose out of the airways and into the alveoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflated lungs were dissected from the thoracic cavity, mounted in agarose, and sliced using a Manual Vibroslice (World Precision Instruments) at a thickness of 250 m and placed in ice-cold HBSS buffer [10 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suitable airways on slices were selected on the basis of the following criteria: presence of a full smooth muscle wall (i.e., cut perpendicular to the direction of the airway), presence of beating cilia to eliminate blood vessels, and unshared muscle walls at airway branch points to eliminate possible counteracting contractile forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were then transferred to incubating buffer and incubated at 37 °C on a rotating platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trauma caused by tissue slicing contracts the airway, presumably by the release of mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incubation buffer (DMEM supplemented with Glx and penicillin/streptomycin) was therefore changed every 30 min for 6 h to remove any constrictor mediators released from the tissue that would prevent the airway from relaxing to baseline and then every 24 h as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next day (18 h later), slices were washed again with fresh medium and used in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contraction_Responses_of_PCLS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PCLS were placed in a 12-well plate in 1.0 mL of assay buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The airway was located using a microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 25), and the slice was held in place using a stainless-steel ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Media were added for baseline measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The camera was positioned so that a live video feed (QICAM; QImaging) of the airway could be viewed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A baseline image was taken, followed by the administration of different concentrations of carbachol (CCh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were collected every 5 min after each concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Airway lumen size was measured using a macro written within Image Pro-Plus (version 6.0) software (Media Cybernetics) and given in units of 2 m. After functional studies, the area of each airway at baseline and at the end of each dose of agonist was calculated using the same macro written within Image Pro-Plus software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were plotted as a percentage of contractions of the initial (basal) airway size (expressed as 100%) for each concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Log pEC50 and Emax values for each airway were derived from a concentrationresponse curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical difference was shown by using paired and unpaired t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining_for_Ser-19_Phosphorylation_of_MLC2_in_PCLS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For phosphorylated Ser-19 MLC staining, PCLS were prepared as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were incubated in HBSS and stimulated with vehicle or CCh (100 M, 10 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCLS were fixed for 1 h in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS and then washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 0.1% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-floating PCLS were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature (RT) in TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% (vol/vol) goat serum, and 5% (wt/vol) BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were incubated with an Ab to phospho-MLC2 (Ser-19) (1:100 in blocking buffer; Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were washed three times in TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at RT with rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and antiactin -smooth muscle-Cy3 Ab (SigmaAldrich) (both 1:400 in blocking buffer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were then washed three times, and mounted in Vectorshield hardset mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Radioligand_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crude lung membranes from WT C57BL/6J and M3-KI mice were prepared as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were culled by cervical dislocation, and lungs were removed and homogenized in 19 vol of ice-cold assay buffer [30 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA (pH 7.5)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C using an RC5 centrifuge (Sorvall) with an SS34 rotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in assay buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was homogenized, the protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay, and membranes were adjusted to a 0.5-mg/mL concentration to use in the binding assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saturation binding experiments were performed in duplicate with increasing concentrations of [3H]-N-methyl scoploamine (NMS) (0.12.5 nM) added to each tube containing assay buffer (as above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific binding for each concentration of [3H]-NMS was determined by the addition of 10 M atropine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes (50 g) were added to each tube (to a total volume of 500 L) for 2 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane-bound radioligand was separated from free ligand by rapid filtration onto GF/B glass microfiber filters (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), followed by washing twice with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane-bound radioactivity was extracted overnight and determined by liquid scintillation counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

WT C57BL/6J, M3-KO, or M3-KI adult mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and tissue from the hippocampus, heart, and lung was removed and immediately frozen on dry ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was prepared from 100 mg of each tissue using an RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions, including treatment with RNase-free DNase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First-strand synthesis was performed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Life Technologies) with 1 g of total RNA template per reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used in PCR reactions to amplify muscarinic receptor subtypes from the resulting cDNA using 5 L of first-strand synthesis reaction products as a template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primer pairs were used:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining_for_the_M3-mAChR_in_Mouse_Lung  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, ensuring that the trachea remained intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chest cavity and trachea were exposed, and the trachea was cannulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lungs were gently overinflated with ice-cold 4% (wt/vol) PFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following fixation, lungs were immediately removed and further fixed overnight in 4% (wt/vol) PFA at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lungs were processed in paraffin wax, and sections from each lobe were taken using a microtome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were either stained with H&E or underwent antigen retrieval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following antigen retrieval, sections were washed in TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked for 2 h at RT in TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% (vol/vol) goat serum, and 5% (wt/vol) BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated with a mouse mAb (in-house) to the M3-mAChR (1:100 in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this incubation, sections were washed three times in TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with a rabbit -actin Ab (1:100 in blocking buffer; Abcam) for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were washed again three times, and then incubated with both fluorescent secondary Abs (1:400 in blocking buffer; mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and rabbit Alexa Fluor 594; both from Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following three washes, slices were mounted in Vectorshield hardset mounting medium with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All images were taken using either a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a Colibri illumination system with Axiovision 4.8 software (Zeiss) or a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope with Zen 2009 software (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ca2+_Signaling_in_Lung_Slices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PCLS from WT or M3-KI mice were washed twice in Krebs Heinseleit buffer (KHB) and incubated in KHB containing 4 M Fura-2:00 AM (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/mL BSA, and probenecid for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After loading, the slice was placed in a prewarmed chamber containing KHB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 40× oil-immersion objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loaded lung slices were excited at 340 nm and 380 nm at a sample rate of 0.67 Hz by means of an excitation wheel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential fluorescent image pairs were recorded at wavelengths  greater than 510 nm via a cooled ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and processed with MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free intracellular Ca2+ signal was expressed at a ratio of 340:380 or change of the ratio of fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_RhoA_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polyornithine-coated 96-well plates were seeded with CHO cells (10,000 cells per well).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, cells were transfected with the Rho-binding-domain (Raichu-RBD) probe [described by Itoh et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42)] and with either M3-mAChR or the M3-receptor phosphonegative mutant, using Lipofectamine 2000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The media was changed 24 h posttransfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the next day, cells were starved for 1 h at RT in Tyrode buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET signal was assessed using an EnSpire reader (PerkinElmer), after cells were treated for 15 min with an increasing concentration of CCh diluted in Tyrode buffer or Tyrode buffer alone at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the Raichu-RBD sensor was excited at 405 nm, and FRET (520540/4 nm) or CFP (460480/4 nm) emission was recorded (500 flashes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Area-under-the-curve values for each emission were assessed, and the FRET values were calculated using a FRET/CFP ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM, represent four independent experiments, and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni correction (*P less_than 0.05; **P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ovalbumin_Sensitization_of_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were sensitized on day 0 and day 10 with alum (diluted 1:1 in saline) and ovalbumin (10 g per mouse, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for a period of 19 d. On days 1924, mice were challenged with vehicle, saline intranasal (i.n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), or ovalbumin (50 g per mouse, i.n.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) assessment, BAL, and tissue collection were performed 24 h after the last challenge on day 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AHR_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resistance/compliance measurements were obtained from tracheotomized and ventilated mice using whole-body plethysmography (EMMS) as previously described (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lung resistance (RL) was expressed as a percentage of change from baseline RL with nebulized PBS (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of ACh required to increase RL by 100% from baseline was calculated (PC100), and log PC100 was taken as a measure of AHR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BAL_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BAL samples and cytospins were obtained and analyzed as previously described (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAL fluid (BALF) was obtained by rinsing lungs three times with 0.8 mL of cold PBS via endotracheal tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BALF samples were centrifuged to isolate cells from fluid and frozen at 80 °C until analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAL cells were resuspended in 200 L of PBS and centrifuged (30 × g for 6 min in a Shandon Cytospin 4; Thermo Scientific) onto glass slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell slides were subsequently fixed and stained using a Diff-Quick Kit (Reagena) and counted under an optical microscope (Olympus BH2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokine_Measurements_in_BALF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BALF was used to measure IL-5, IL-6, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, IFN-induced protein-10, eotaxin, and TNF- concentrations using magnetic beads coated with capture Ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylated detection Ab to each analyte was bound to the beadcytokine complex, followed by the addition of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic beads were read using a Luminex MAGPIX analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic beads were illuminated, and two spectrally distinct light-emitting diodes illuminated the beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyte of interest and the magnitude of the PE-derived signal were detected and recorded on xPONENT software (Luminex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean fluorescent intensity was analyzed using a five-parameter logistic method on XLfit software v.5.3.1.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Salivary_Secretion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were anesthetized by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection with 100 mg/kg of ketamine/0.25 mg/kg of medetomidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this procedure, mice were injected with pilocarpine (1 mg/mL, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and salivary secretion (in milligrams of saliva) onto GF/B filter paper (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was recorded every 5 min over a 35-min period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmids_Used_for_G_Protein_BRET_Biosensor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rluc II G-subunit constructs were generated by insertion of Rluc II into the -helical domain of the G-subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP10 was fused to the N-terminal domain of G1 to generate GFP10-G1 as described previously (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G_Protein_BRET_Biosensor_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess G protein coupling to the M3-mAChR, HEK-293 cells were seeded into six-well plates at 5 × 105 cells per well and allowed to settle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then cotransfected with 200 ng of receptor, 200 ng of Rluc II G-subunit, 100 ng of G1, and 200 ng GFP10-G1 subunits using PEI (Polysciences) at a ratio of 3 g of PEI to 1 g of cDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were detached using PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and distributed into poly-d-lysinecoated white 96-well microplates and incubated for a further 24 h before the assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then washed with HBSS and incubated in HBSS for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To initiate the assay, Coelenterazine 400a (Nanolight Technology) was added (2.5 M) and incubated for 5 min; cells were then stimulated with CCh (100 M) for 10 min before emissions at 400 nm and 510 nm were measured using a Tristar LB 941 multimode plate reader (Berthold Technologies) equipped with a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 (BRET2) filter set (400 ± 70-nm and 515 ± 20-nm filters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BRET signal was represented as the 510/400 ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand-induced change in BRET signal was determined by subtracting the signal obtained by the addition of vehicle from the values obtained from the addition of CCh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Where indicated, data were evaluated using two-way ANOVA, KruskalWallis, and MannWhitney tests; paired and unpaired t tests; and two-way ANOVA with Dunnetts multiple comparisons test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
