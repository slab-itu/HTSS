Neutron structures of the Helicobacter pylori 5-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase highlight proton sharing and protonation states  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gastrointestinal infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is strongly associated with the development of gastric cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H. pylori 5-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (HpMTAN) is an interesting drug target because of its vital role in the production of menaquinone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HpMTAN offers a unique target for treating H. pylori infections without affecting the survival of the human microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutron crystallography was performed to determine hydrogen atom positions that provide insight into the catalytic mechanism and transition state stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MTAN (5-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-ribosidic bond of a variety of adenosine-containing metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Helicobacter pylori MTAN (HpMTAN) hydrolyzes 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine in the second step of the alternative menaquinone biosynthetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substrate binding of the adenine moiety is mediated almost exclusively by hydrogen bonds, and the proposed catalytic mechanism requires multiple proton-transfer events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is the protonation state of residue D198, which possesses a pKa above 8 and functions as a general acid to initiate the enzymatic reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we present three corefined neutron/X-ray crystal structures of wild-type HpMTAN cocrystallized with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), Formycin A (FMA), and (3R,4S)-4-(4-Chlorophenylthiomethyl)-1-[(9-deaza-adenin-9-yl)methyl]-3-hydroxypyrrolidine (p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA) as well as one neutron/X-ray crystal structure of an inactive variant (HpMTAN-D198N) cocrystallized with SAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support a mechanism of D198 pKa elevation through the unexpected sharing of a proton with atom N7 of the adenine moiety possessing unconventional hydrogen-bond geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the neutron structures also highlight active site features that promote the stabilization of the transition state and slight variations in these interactions that result in 100-fold difference in binding affinities between the DADMe-ImmA and ImmA analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Neutron_Crystallography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All neutron diffraction data were collected at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monochromatic neutron diffraction data were collected on the HpMTAN/SRH/adenine complex using the BIODIFF beam line at the FRM II research reactor at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffraction data were indexed and integrated using DENZO and then were scaled with SCALEPACK (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quasi-Laue neutron diffraction data were collected on the transition-state analogs and binary substrate complex crystals at room temperature on the IMAGINE beamline located at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neutron data were processed using the Daresbury Laboratory LAUE suite program LAUEGEN modified to account for the cylindrical geometry of the detector (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program LSCALE was used to determine the wavelength-normalization curve using the intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections measured at different wavelengths and merged in SCALA (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallographic data are given in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

X-Ray_Crystallography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
X-ray crystallographic datasets were collected at room temperature using crystals taken from the same crystallization drops that provided crystals for the neutron diffraction studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Datasets were collected on a Rigaku HighFlux HomeLab instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution X-ray diffraction dataset was collected in cryogenic conditions (95 K) at the LS-CAT ID-F beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction datasets were collected, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 software suite (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using phasing information from the HpMTAN/FMA structure with Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3NM5 (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HpMTAN/SRH/adenine X-ray structure was refined using SHELX-97 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution HpMTAN/p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA structure and room-temperature X-ray datasets for the joint X-ray/neutron (XN) refinements were refined using PHENIX (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallographic data for the joint XN- datasets are given in Table S2, and the high-resolution X-ray dataset is given in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Joint_XN_Refinement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The jointly refined XN structures were all refined using nCNS (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After initial rigid-body refinement, several cycles of positional, atomic displacement parameter, and occupancy refinement followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each refinement cycle the structure was manually checked using Coot (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2FO-FC and FO-FC neutron scattering length density maps then were examined to determine the correct orientation and protonation states of residues with exchangeable protons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All water molecules were refined as D2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, water oxygen atoms were positioned using X-ray difference maps and then were shifted slightly in accordance with the neutron scattering length density maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange at OH, NH, and SH sites were refined using D occupancy as the metric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID codes 5CCD, 5K1Z, 5JPC, 5CCE, and 5KB3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Defining_Proton_Positions_During_the_Catalytic_Reaction_of_HpMTAN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well accepted that the initiation of the catalytic reaction of HpMTAN is afforded by the donation of a proton from D198 to the N7 position of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positioning of D198 described in the transition-state analogs and product complexes is afforded by three hydrogen-bond interactions from the hydroxyl side chain of S197, the backbone amide of A200, and N6 of the adenine moiety (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deprotonated adenine N7 nitrogen atom has been calculated to possess negative electrostatic potential before protonation, promoting interaction with and proton transfer from D198 (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of the omit difference FO-FC nuclear map of the product complex reveals strong difference density for a shared deuterium ion between the carboxylic acid moiety of D198 and N7 of adenine (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the shared D+ ion was unexpected because it has not been previously proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D+ ion develops a trifurcated hydrogen bond that is positioned at a distance of 1.8 Å and 2.3 Å from O1 and O2 of D198, respectively, and 1.7 Å from N7 of the adenine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angle between N7D+O1 is 98° and between N7D+O2 is 116°, deviating significantly from the more common 180° in countless biological interactions or the 155° angle observed in the MTAN transition-state analog neutron structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the bonding distances of ND+ and D+O1 are nearly equivalent, suggesting that the pKa values of D198 and N7 are closely matched and implying a possible low-barrier hydrogen bond (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of the shared D+ ion further confirms the involvement of D198 in the initiation of the catalytic reaction by protonation of the adenine N7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this hydrogen-bond network elevates the pKa of the D198 side chain and ensures that a proton is available in the active site for subsequent enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, omit difference FO-FC nuclear density was observed for a deuterium atom on the N9 position of the adenine molecule, further highlighting the importance of the shared D+ ion in the catalytic mechanism (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an accepted mechanism for MTAN, after the initiation of the catalytic reaction, the presence of the resulting carboxylate moiety of D198 develops an N7-HO1 hydrogen-bond interaction with the protonated N7 of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient positive charge of the adenine moiety consequently leads to breakage of the N-ribosidic bond, resulting in an adenine molecule with a protonated N7 and an unprotonated N9 (12, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformation directly conflicts with the protonation states observed in the product complex and suggests that, after disruption of the N-ribosidic bond, the N9 accepts a proton, and N7 begins sharing its proton with the D198 side chain instead of retaining the proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing question addressed by the protonation states of the adenine product is the identity of the specific chemical group that donates a proton to N9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that the conserved residue E13 acts as a general base to activate the nucleophilic water molecule that attacks the intermediate during the enzymatic reaction (9, 12, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the structure of the ternary product complex shows that the protonated N9 is 6.7 Å from E13 and lacks neighboring proton acceptors that could allow a proton shuttle-like mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, all the neutron structures presented here show E13 to be in the deprotonated, carboxylate form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is unlikely the observed pKa of 5.6 is the result of E13 functioning as a general base in activating the nucleophile but instead ensures a fully deprotonated carboxylate to orient the nucleophilic water molecule properly for attack on the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleophilic water molecule then directly donates a proton to N9 subsequent to nucleophilic attack on the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations of the deuterium positions of the subsequent adenine product better define the proton transfer events involved in catalysis (Fig 3) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SRH-binding subsite of the HpMTAN active site contains a variety of polar residues that allow the recognition of the ribose moiety of the substrate, some of which have ambiguous hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the substrate complex, the observed nucleophilic water molecule is positioned by hydrogen-bond interactions with both the guanidinium moiety of R194 and a fully deprotonated carboxylate moiety of E13 with distances of 1.8 Å and 1.6 Å, respectively (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the putative nucleophile provided by these residues ensures the positioning of a lone pair of electrons in the nucleophile toward the anomeric carbon of the ribose moiety before the formation of the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following nucleophilic attack by the water molecule on the intermediate, a fully deprotonated E13 is observed forming a hydrogen-bond interaction with the O1 hydroxyl of SRH in the product complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conserved glutamate residue has been demonstrated to be important for the catalytic reaction based on a significant loss of activity in EcMTAN variants E12Q (EcMTAN-E12Q) and E12A (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neutron structures described here offer an interesting alternative hypothesis for the significant, but not complete, loss of enzymatic activity in the EcMTAN variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of each neutron structure highlights E13 in HpMTAN as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to the backbone amides of residue A9, M10, and V78 in addition to the nucleophilic water molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analogous Q12 residue in EcMTAN-E12Q could alter the hydrogen-bond network for the nucleophilic water molecule and reorient it within the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this improper orientation of the nucleophilic water molecule, the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the nucleophile needed to form the new bond with the C1 of ribose is oriented toward the Q12 side chain in the E12Q variant and away from the oxocarbenium ion intermediate, consequently decreasing the likelihood of nucleophilic attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis also can explain why the EcMTAN variants retain a low level of enzymatic activity without a general base at this position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, thermal motion or random reorientation of the nucleophilic water molecule within the active site immediately following oxocarbenium ion formation in the EcMTAN-E12Q variant could allow a minority of the Michaelis complexes to undergo nucleophilic attack and complete catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inspection of the neutron structure for HpMTAN-D198N/SAH provides additional information that supports an expanded role of S197 in the catalytic mechanism of HpMTAN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of S197 in the catalytic reaction has been studied previously for EcMTAN with an MTAN-S197A variant that possessed only 10% of the wild-type activity (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, S197 was suggested to be the proton donor for D198, allowing the hydroxyl of S197 to be regenerated by the bulk solvent through the classical Grotthuss mechanism (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the product complex, S197 and D198 develop a strong, linear, 1.9 Å, O-DO1 hydrogen-bond interaction (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this interaction assists in positioning the D198 side chain to promote proton donation to the substrate, the presented neutron structure as well as published X-ray structures suggest that S197 may play a role in proton transfer to D198 and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HpMTAN-D198N/SAH neutron structure, the deuterium position on the S197 hydroxyl is reoriented, creating a new hydrogen-bond network involving a water molecule in a small hydrophobic pocket abutting the active site (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S197 O-D group rotates nearly 180°, positioning the deuterium away from the N198 side chain as the result of the ND2 group developing an N-DO hydrogen bond with a distance of 2.4 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other ND2 atom of N198 forms an N-DN hydrogen bond with N7 of the SAH at a distance of 2.1 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the previously published HpMTAN-D198N X-ray crystal structures, this pocket always contains a single ordered water molecule, but no corresponding density is observed in the wild-type structures (5, 12, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ordering of this water molecule could simply be a consequence of the D198N mutation, it is expected that this pocket contains a disordered water molecule in the wild-type enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water in the hydrophobic pocket interacts with S197 by accepting a hydrogen bond from the S197 side chain at a distance of 1.7 Å (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the water molecule within this small hydrophobic pocket develops a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of F208 as well as forming an O-H interaction with the side chain of the highly conserved F208 (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrogen-bonding pattern suggests a possible mechanism for the binding of a hydronium ion within this pocket and a proton shuttle to D198 mediated by S197.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this water molecule plays a role in the enzyme mechanism or is simply a function of the inactivating D198N mutation is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is intriguing, however, to consider that the binding of a hydronium ion to this site in the wild-type enzyme could be stabilized through a cation- interaction with F208 and promote D198 protonation via a proton shuttle through S197.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a role for ordered water molecules has been highlighted in other neutron structures (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario offers a possible second mechanism by which the enzyme ensures a protonated D198 residue upon binding substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insights_into_Transition-State_Stabilization_and_Inhibitor_Affinity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the transition-state analog neutron structures, specifically FMA and p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA, the observed deuterium positions provide information about the specific hydrogen-bond interactions that contribute to the high-affinity binding of these inhibitors and to stabilization of the transition state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in the hydrogen-bond interactions of the two transition-state analogs were observed in the ribose-binding site, whereas the hydrogen-bond interactions in the adenine-binding pocket were conserved in both transition state complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HpMTAN/FMA and HpMTAN/p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA neutron structures, 2FO-FC nuclear density indicates a protonated N7 atom mimicking the protonated substrate immediately after the initiation of the catalytic reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong hydrogen-bond interaction between the deprotonated carboxylate group of D198 and the N7 proton of the nonhydrolyzable adenine mimics retains a distance of 2.0 Å and an angle of 155° between the three atoms in both complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, slight variations in the hydrogen-bond distance were observed between the hydroxyl of S197 and the carboxylate of D198 in both transition-state analog structures as compared with the product complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA complex, the observed O-DO1 hydrogen-bond distance increased to 2.4 Å with a 142° angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FMA complex demonstrated a more dramatic change in the O-DO1 hydrogen bond consisting of 2.6 Å with 112° angles between the three atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA and the product complex, the hydroxyl of S197 forms a van der Waals interaction with the C8 hydrogen atom of adenine, which in FMA is replaced by a nitrogen atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the loss of the van der Waals interaction between the S197 hydroxyl and the substrate weakens the hydrogen bond interaction between S197 and D198.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HpMTAN/p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA complex demonstrates several hydrogen-bond interactions that contribute to the picomolar affinity of this inhibitor even though HpMTAN is suggested to form an early dissociative transition state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was shown that the Kd for p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA was 570 pM for HpMTAN, an affinity roughly 100-fold higher than that of the ImmA analog that was demonstrated to have a Kd of 40 nM (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in the affinities of the transition state analogs to structurally similar homologs of MTAN have been studied previously using computational techniques (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2FO-FC nuclear density for the HpMTAN/p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA complex demonstrates a deuterium atom located on the N1 of the pyrrolidine moiety, confirming the presence of the cationic nitrogen atom in the catalytic site of HpMTAN (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this neutron structure gives a direct view of the hydrogen-bond interactions that orient a lone pair of electrons on the nucleophilic water molecule toward the newly formed oxocarbenium ion intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen atom of the nucleophile is observed to form a strong N-DO hydrogen-bonding interaction from both the guanidinium moiety of R194 and the cationic nitrogen atom of the N1 from the pyrrolidine moiety with distances of 1.8 Å and 1.6 Å, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the deuterium atoms of the nucleophile form moderate-strength O-DO hydrogen-bonding interactions with the deprotonated carboxylic acid moieties of E13 and E175 at distances of 2.3 Å and 2.5 Å, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the other various interactions between p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA and HpMTAN, the observed hydrogen bonded network with the nucleophile contributes significantly to the proper orientation of the water molecule for attack on the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the high-affinity binding of p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA is caused by the presence of a cationic character and not by possible flattening of the pyrrolidine ring, a 1.4-Å resolution X-ray crystal structure was refined showing that the N1 is sp3 hybridized (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inspection of the HpMTAN/FMA complex provides evidence regarding the difference in affinities observed between DADMe-ImmA and ImmA transition-state analogs (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HpMTAN/FMA complex an unusual binding orientation of the nucleophilic water molecule was observed that does not allow a lone pair of electrons to be positioned toward the inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual orientation of the water molecule is afforded by strong and moderate hydrogen-bond interactions with the guanidinium moiety of R194, the carboxylate moiety of E13, and the O3 hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of FMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, in the HpMTAN/FMA neutron structure the 2FO-FC nuclear map shows that the deuterium atom of the O3 hydroxyl for the ribose moiety is rotated 76° from the O2 of E175 toward the 5-alkylthiobinding subsite of the catalytic site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although an increase in the distance between the hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor was not observed, the new proton position disrupts the hydrogen-bond interaction with O2 of E175 that is observed in all other neutron structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new orientation of the deuterium atom for the O3 hydroxyl allows a new O-DO hydrogen-bond interaction to form with the O2 hydroxyl at a distance of 2.1 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The O-DO2 hydrogen-bond interaction between the O3 hydroxyl and the carboxylate side chain of E175 was shown to be essential for the catalytic reaction, because the removal of the O3 hydroxyl from the ribose moiety and the use of E175 EcMTAN variants eliminate catalytic activity (6, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, it has been proposed that the O3 hydroxyl becomes ionized during the formation of the transition state to assist in stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate (11, 32), but the neutron structures presented here demonstrate a protonated O3 hydroxyl and a fully deprotonated E175 carboxylate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Purification_of_HpMTAN_and_HpMTAN-D198N  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purification of both recombinant HpMTAN and HpMTAN-D198N was performed as previously described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells containing a pET-32based plasmid encoding a polyhistidinethioredoxin translational fusion with HpMTAN were grown in LB containing 0.1 mM chloramphenicol and carbenicillin at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.60.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were induced by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and were incubated for 32 h at 16 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial lysis was carried out using sonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the filtered supernatant was applied to a 5-mL HiTrap TALON Crude column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer corresponding to the lysis buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear gradient of 5150 mM imidazole was used to elute HpMTAN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human rhinovirus 3C protease was added to the fractions containing HpMTAN, and the sample was dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein sample then was reapplied to the 5-mL HiTrap TALON Crude column to remove the human rhinovirus 3C protease as well as the polyhistidinethioredoxin tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the protein sample was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Hi-Load Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystallization_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before crystallization, the purified HpMTAN and HpMTAN-D198N samples were dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was concentrated to 50 mg/mL by ultrafiltration (EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein concentration was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 3,105 M/cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before crystallization, HpMTAN was incubated with SAH (Sigma), FMA (Berry and Associates, Inc.), or p-ClPh-Thio-DADMe-ImmA [synthesized by G.B.E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40)] at a concentration of 2 mM of the compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HpMTAN-D198N was incubated with SAH at a concentration of 2 mM to obtain the substrate complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallization studies were performed in a nine-well sandwich plate (Hampton) and equilibrated with 50 mL of well solution containing 100 mM Hepes (pH 7), 2830% (wt/vol) PEG 550 monomethyl ether, and 50 mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate for HpMTAN complexed with SAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The well solution for all other complexes consisted of 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1520% (wt/vol) PEG 550 monomethyl ether, and 95 mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallization drops consisted of 150 µL of the complex and 150 µL of the well solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystals used for neutron diffraction were measured to be roughly 3.0 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm (1.5 mm3) and were mounted in a thick-walled quartz capillary containing a reservoir solution matching the well solution but made with 100% D2O to allow H/D exchange before the neutron diffraction experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
