Fuxianhuiid ventral nerve cord and early nervous system evolution in Panarthropoda  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the evolution of the CNS is fundamental for resolving the phylogenetic relationships within Panarthropoda (Euarthropoda, Tardigrada, Onychophora).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ground pattern of the panarthropod CNS remains elusive, however, as there is uncertainty on which neurological characters can be regarded as ancestral among extant phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis, an early Cambrian euarthropod from South China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VNC reveals extraordinary detail, including condensed ganglia and regularly spaced nerve roots that correspond topologically to the peripheral nerves of Priapulida and Onychophora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate the persistence of ancestral neurological features of Ecdysozoa in early euarthropods and help to reconstruct the VNC ground pattern in Panarthropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Panarthropods are typified by disparate grades of neurological organization reflecting a complex evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil record offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct early character evolution of the nervous system via exceptional preservation in extinct representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the neurological architecture of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the upper-stem group euarthropod Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis from the early Cambrian Xiaoshiba Lagerstätte (South China).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VNC of C. kunmingensis comprises a homonymous series of condensed ganglia that extend throughout the body, each associated with a pair of biramous limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Submillimetric preservation reveals numerous segmental and intersegmental nerve roots emerging from both sides of the VNC, which correspond topologically to the peripheral nerves of extant Priapulida and Onychophora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fuxianhuiid VNC indicates that ancestral neurological features of Ecdysozoa persisted into derived members of stem-group Euarthropoda but were later lost in crown-group representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings illuminate the VNC ground pattern in Panarthropoda and suggest the independent secondary loss of cycloneuralian-like neurological characters in Tardigrada and Euarthropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five individuals of C. kunmingensis display a narrow (maximum width, 170 µm) and slightly convex rope-like structure with a metameric pattern that extends medially throughout the body (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2, and Table S1); its segmental organization and position at the ventral midline identifies this feature as the VNC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is supported by comparisons with other preserved components of the internal anatomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the VNC can be readily distinguished from the digestive tract of C. kunmingensis, which is expressed as a comparatively larger (maximum width, 860 µm) but fully compressed, linear structure running almost the entire length of the animal (23, figure 1 d and e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VNC extends from at least the five anteriormost reduced trunk tergites (i.e., dorsal exoskeletal plates) to tergite T23 at the posterior end of the trunk (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, S2, and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the VNC would have continued into the head region in life, our material does not preserve any anterior neurological structures that have been previously identified as the dorsal brain or nerves leading to the antennae and specialized postantennal appendages (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of fossilized brains in these otherwise exceptionally preserved specimens can be attributed to the small sample size and moderate postmortem disarticulation; likewise, other studies addressing neurological structures in Cambrian fossils rarely report the CNS preserved in its entirety (811).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VNC also expresses a distinctive dark/light color banding throughout its length, with the dark bands varying from black to reddish-brown between specimens (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2C); this variability in color reflects differences in the extent of weathering between individual specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectroscopy indicates the presence of residual organic carbon associated with the dark-colored bands (Fig S4) but not in the light ones, likely mirroring differences in their original histology and early diagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the carbonaceous films, the VNC is typified by modest relief relative to adjacent exoskeletal features, attesting to a degree of early diagenetic permineralization before complete degradational collapse (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurologically, the C. kunmingensis VNC consists of an interconnected series of separate metameric ganglia (dark colored bands) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal connectives are not morphologically discrete, but their presence is strongly suggested by the alternating light colored bands between the condensed ganglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct preservation style of these neurological structures likely stems from differences in their original histology; whereas the condensed ganglia are enriched in lipids due to the presence of abundant somata, the connectives consist of neurites and lack cell bodies (1, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ganglia have an elongate subelliptic outline (maximum length, 600 µm; 3.5:1 length/width) and are roughly three times longer than the connectives (maximum length, 206 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ganglia remain separate throughout the entire VNC, with no indication of fusion or specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a progressive reduction in the size of individual ganglia along the body, with the anteriormost being 3 times longer and 1.5 times wider than the posterior ones (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preserved proximal portions of the trunk endopods indicate that each ganglion was associated with a single pair of biramous appendages (Fig 1C and Fig S2 A and B), which, like the ganglia, become progressively smaller posteriorly (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, each of the five anteriormost reduced tergites (Fig 1A) correlates with an individual ganglion and leg pair, whereas the comparatively larger tergites T6T26 overlie up to four ganglia and their corresponding appendages (Fig 1D and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 A and B and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This organization reflects the notable dorsoventral segmental mismatch that typifies the fuxianhuiid trunk (23, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unique disarticulation pattern of the head shield in the Xiaoshiba fuxianhuiids (23)aided by mechanical preparationreveals submillimetric neurological detail in C. kunmingensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In specimen YKLP 12026, the exposed VNC extends from the oral region into tergite T6, comprising a total of seven ganglia (Fig 2 AC and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close inspection reveals the presence of delicate nerve roots (maximum length, 209 µm; width, 9 µm) emerging at both sides of the VNC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nerve roots are regularly spaced (1720 µm) and originate from both the ganglia (i.e., segmental) and interganglia connectives (i.e., intersegmental) at acute angles (4060°) relative to the VNC (Fig 2 CE and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 B and C and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergent chevron-like pattern most likely resulted from moderate postmortem displacement of the distal portions of the peripheral nerves relative to the VNC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are at least a dozen paired sets of roots associated with each ganglion and four to six nerve roots associated with the longitudinal connectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential preservation of the proximal bases of the nerve roots precludes the identification of precise relationships between these structures and the exoskeletal morphology, such as the walking legs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of distal neurological preservation suggests that, similarly to 3D guts in Burgess Shale fossils (24), the VNC and the proximal nerve roots were permineralized during early diagenesis due to the chemically reactive composition of adjacent lipid-rich ganglia (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence microscopy corroborates the anatomical and compositional continuity of the regularly spaced nerve roots and VNC throughout the body (Fig 2 C and E and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Xiaoshiba fossils provide previously unidentified insights on the neurological diversity of Cambrian euarthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the context of extant representatives, the postcephalic CNS of C. kunmingensis exhibits notable similarities with the thoracic VNC of the notostracan Triops cancriformis, which consists of a homonymous series of separate ganglia linked by short connectives that become progressively smaller toward the posterior end (1, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall morphology of T. cancriformis further resembles C. kunmingensisand generally other fuxianhuiidsin the presence of dorsoventral trunk segmental mismatch expressed as appendage polypody (23, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similarly unspecialized VNC is also found in crustaceans typified by a trunk region with undifferentiated limb-bearing segments, such as the remipedes (5, 7) (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike C. kunmingensis and T. cancriformis, however, the body organization of remipedes does not evince any type of trunk segmental mismatch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the paleoneurological data available indicate that the fuxianhuiid CNS combines a relatively simple VNC without signs of functional specialization (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) with a tripartite brain bearing both olfactory and optic lobes (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the position of fuxianhuiids within upper-stem Euarthropoda (17), this character combination could suggest the evolutionary convergence of either the VNC of Chengjiangocaris with Branchiopoda or the complex brain of Fuxianhuia with Malacostraca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the fuxianhuiid CNS may approximate the complex brain (sans optic lobes) and unspecialized VNC of remipedes (5, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the neurological organization of fuxianhuiids reflects an ancestral condition as suggested by their phylogenetic position, it would support the symplesiomorphic nature of a malacostracan-like brain for Pancrustacea/Tetraconata (6, 8) and also imply an independent increase in VNC complexity among extant crustacean lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of consensus pertaining to the phylogenetic placement of Branchiopoda, Remipedia, and Malacostraca relative to Hexapoda based on molecular and neuromophological data (57, 27) complicates deciding between these hypotheses based on the available paleoneurological information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neurological organization of the fuxianhuiid VNC leads to more informative comparisons with other panarthropod groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from Euarthropoda (15, 9), the presence of segmental ganglia is also characteristic of the CNS in Tardigrada (18, 28) (Fig S5B) and has been used to advocate the sister-group relationship between these clades (16, 17, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of segmental ganglia in C. kunmingensis provides a minimum phylogenetic threshold for the evolution of this feature in total-group Euarthropoda (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At a broader phylogenetic level, the neurological organization of C. kunmingensis also exhibits marked similarities with the VNC of Onychophora (Fig 3 and Fig S5A), namely the presence of numerous regularly spaced peripheral nerve roots (1215, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major difference, however, is that the onychophoran postcephalic CNS is lateralized and lacks morphologically discrete segmental ganglia despite clearly having a segmented organization (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the proximal preservation of the peripheral nerves makes it uncertain whether the C. kunmingensis VNC possessed complete ring commissures like those in onychophorans (1214), this feature could potentially add morphological support for the sister-group relationship between Euarthropoda and Onychophora suggested by molecular phylogenies (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among crown-group euarthropods, there are only a restricted number of intersegmental peripheral nerves emerging from the longitudinal connectives in the VNC of some pancrustaceans (1, 4, 5) (SI Text, Fig 3, and Fig S5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is possible that the presence of numerous peripheral nerves in the VNC of C. kunmingensis and Onychophora is symplesiomorphic, as comparable structures are also found in the orthogonal CNS of Priapulida (31) and other protostomes (12, 13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any event, the postcephalic CNS of C. kunmingensis reveals a unique combination of neurological characters otherwise unknown in any extant group within Panarthropoda (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test these different hypotheses and to clarify the polarity of neurological characters in extant and extinct groups, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis incorporating the available fossil data on the postcephalic CNS of total-group Panarthropoda (SI Text and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results support the sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda (Fig 3 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7), corroborated by several unambiguous synapomorphies of the VNC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These synapomorphies include the presence of condensed segmental ganglia connected by commissures, the anterior shift of the leg nerves following a parasegmental organization, and the presence of a stomatogastric ganglion associated with the tritocerebral segment (SI Text) (14, 16, 18, 19, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the presence of numerous segmental and intersegmental peripheral nerves in C. kunmingensis (Fig 2 BE) is recognized as an ancestral condition that persisted in derived members of upper stem-group Euarthropoda (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among extant groups, homologs of the intersegmental peripheral nerves are expressed in both Priapulida (31) and Onychophora (12, 13, 15, 29) but are otherwise greatly reduced in number or completely lost in crown-group Euarthropoda and Tardigrada, respectively (1, 5, 16, 28) (Fig S5); the secondary reduction/loss is recognized as a result of parallel evolution between these lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic analysis also indicates that several neurological characters shared between Onychophora and Tardigrada are actually symplesiomorphic and likely reflect the broader ground pattern of Panarthropoda (Fig 3); these include the median interpedal commissures, an orthogonal-like organization, and paired segmental leg nerves (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lateralized VNC is resolved as synapomorphic for Onychophora (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings argue against the secondary loss of morphologically discrete segmental ganglia in the VNC of Onychophora (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the evolution of the VNC in crown-group Euarthropoda is the result of secondary simplification relative to the CNS of cycloneuralians and other panarthropods, as informed by the transitional neurological organization of C. kunmingensis (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The integration of paleoneurological data with the present understanding of the developmental biology of extant groups illuminates major issues pertaining the evolution of the nervous system in Panarthropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the ground pattern of the panarthropod postcephalic CNS incorporates a paired, but not lateralized, VNC with median interpedal commissures, an orthogonal organization with complete ring-commissures, paired leg nerves, and intersegmental peripheral nerves (SI Text); in this context, an orthogonal VNC with complete ring commissures is a symplesiomorphy inherited from a cycloneuralian-like ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of condensed segmental ganglia, a lateralized organization, anteriorly displaced leg nerves following the parasegments, and a stomatogastric ganglion (SI Text) (Fig 3), represent derived features that were acquired later in the evolutionary history of the different panarthropod phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fossils were photographed with a Nikon D3X fitted with a Nikon AF-S Micro Nikkor 105-mm lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For close-up images, a LEICA M205-C stereomicroscope fitted with a Leica DFC 500 digital camera was used under directional illumination provided by a LEICA LED5000 MCITM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geochemical analyses were performed with an inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence photography was performed as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data matrix includes 50 taxa and 95 characters (Dataset S2 and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis was run in TNT (33) under New Technology Search, using Driven Search with Sectorial Search, Ratchet, Drift, and Tree fusing options activated in standard settings (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis was set to find the minimum tree length 100 times and to collapse trees after each search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All characters were treated as unordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an initial analysis, all characters were treated as equally weighted (Fig S6A); subsequent repetitions with variable concavity values (k) were used to explore the effect of different degrees of homoplasy penalization to test the robustness of the dataset (Fig S6 BD) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Character_Coding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dataset used for the phylogenetic analysis has been updated from that presented by Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36), including the formulation of new neurological characters to resolve large-scale relationships within Panarthropoda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crown-group euarthropods Limulus polyphemus (Chelicerata, Xiphosura) and Triops cancriformis (Mandibulata, Notostraca) were included as their neurological organization has been extensively studied (13, 37) and to appropriately polarize the characters in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional extant taxa were included based on recent studies describing aspects of the brain and VNC organization; these include the eutardigrades Macrobiotus cf harmsworthi and Hypsibius dujardini (16, 18), the heterotardigrades Echiniscus testudo, Actinarctus doryphorus, and Batillipes pennaki (28, 38), the peripatopsid Metaperipatus blainvillei, and the peripatid Epiperipatus biolleyi (12, 13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil and extant taxa are scored according to a single model of head segmental organization that is informed by developmental studies on extant Onychophora, Tardigrada, and Euarthropoda (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characters 180 largely follow those of Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36); only those with minor modifications are outlined here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters 8186 from Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36) have been substantially revised to integrate the paleoneurological data available from C. kunmingensis and better reflect the diversity of VNC morphology in Panarthropoda; these changes are described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Comments_on_the_Results_of_the_Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the cladistic analysis provide strong support for the sister-group relationship of Tardigrada and Euarthropoda (i.e., Tactopoda), to the exclusion of Onychophora (20, 36); this topology is retrieved in the equally weighted analysis (Fig S6A) and throughout a broad range of homology penalization (Fig S6 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of Tactopoda allows reconstructing the evolutionary history of the VNC within Panarthropoda in detail (Fig 3) and indicates that mapping the neurological data (characters 8294) to match the sister-group relationship between Onychophora and Euarthropoda (21, 22) results in a less parsimonious reconstruction of character transformations (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the latter scenario would require the convergent evolution of several neurological features in Tardigrada and Euarthropoda, namely the presence of condensed ganglia in the nerve cord, the anterior shift of the leg nerves following a parasegmental organization, and the presence of a stomatogastric ganglion (Characters 86, 91, and 94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative scenario in which all these features are symplesiomorphic for Panarthropoda would favor the substantial secondary simplification of the VNC in Onychophora (30) (Fig S7B); however, the lack of clear developmental or neurological data supporting the loss of all these complex features in the CNS of Onychophora argues against this evolutionary scenario (12, 13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The variability observed between the different analyses indicates that phylogenetically basal lobopodians within the stem lineages of Onychophora and Euarthropoda represent rogue taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aysheaia pedunculata, Onychodictyon ferox, Jianshanopodia decora, and Megadictyon haikouensis are variably recovered as either the most basal members of stem-group Euarthropoda (Fig S6 B and C) or in a less resolved position within stem-group Panarthropoda (Fig S6 A and D); only at high concavity values is O. ferox resolved as basal within stem-group Onychophora (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability reflects that of previous analyses (20, 36) and indicates that additional material is necessary to better constrain the morphology and phylogenetic affinities of these lobopodians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, taxa that occupy a more crown-ward phylogenetic position evince a substantial degree of stability within each of the total-groups, even though it is not possible to resolve the internal relationships within Luolishaniidae (stem-group Onychophora) and Radiodonta (stem-group Euarthropoda) with the present dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within stem-group Onychophora, the basal lobopodians Paucipodia inermis, Diania cactiformis, and Onychodictyon gracilis evince some plasticity in their position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the formal description of the putative VNC in P. inermis (44) will help to elucidate its precise affinities and further inform the early evolution of the nervous system in early onychophoran ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal topology of total-group Tardigrada is stable in all of the analyses and differs from previous studies in that O. ferox was not recovered within this group under any degree of homology penalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyses further allowed to recover a monophyletic Heterotardigrada but were unable to resolve the phylogenetic position of the Orsten Siberian tardigrade (48) relative to the crown-group, despite the overall eutardigrade like appearance of this fossil, including the presence of claws with multiple branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the topology within total-group Euarthropoda is largely stable, save for the fluctuating positions of A. pedunculata, O. ferox, J. decora, and M. haikouensis discussed before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only additional variation occurred in the position of the gilled lobopodian Pambdelurion whittingtoni; whereas in most analysis this taxon was recovered as crown-ward relative to Kerygmachela and stem-ward relative to a clade including Radiodonta and Deuteropoda, at low concavity values (Fig S6B), P. whittingtoni was resolved as sister-taxon to Radiodonta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationships between other members of stem-group Euarthropoda are consistent with previous analyses (17, 20, 49), including the recent finding that Opabinia regalis may occupy a more crown-ward position relative to Radiodonta than previously considered (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
