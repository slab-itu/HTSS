Induction of de novo -synuclein fibrillization in a neuronal model for Parkinsons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it has been established for over 100 years that Lewy bodies (LBs) represent the major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), we still do not know why these fibrillar intraneuronal inclusions of -synuclein (-Syn) protein form, or how they contribute to disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the major causes underlying this gap in knowledge is the lack of animal models that reproduce the formation of fibrillar LB-like inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we show that the absence of human -Syn (h-Syn) fibrillization into LBs in mice can be attributed to interactions between h-Syn and its endogenously expressed mouse -Syn homologue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we provide well-characterized primary neuronal and in vivo models that recapitulate the main molecular feature of PD, bona fide -Syn fibrillization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lewy bodies (LBs) are intraneuronal inclusions consisting primarily of fibrillized human -synuclein (h-Syn) protein, which represent the major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although doubling h-Syn expression provokes LB pathology in humans, h-Syn overexpression does not trigger the formation of fibrillar LB-like inclusions in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that interactions between exogenous h-Syn and endogenous mouse synuclein homologs could be attenuating h-Syn fibrillization in mice, and therefore, we systematically assessed h-Syn aggregation propensity in neurons derived from -SynKO, -SynKO, -SynKO, and triple-KO mice lacking expression of all three synuclein homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we show that h-Syn forms hyperphosphorylated (at S129) and ubiquitin-positive LB-like inclusions in primary neurons of -SynKO, -SynKO, and triple-KO mice, as well as in transgenic -SynKO mouse brains in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, correlative light and electron microscopy, immunogold labeling, and thioflavin-S binding established their fibrillar ultrastructure, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching/photoconversion experiments showed that these inclusions grow in size and incorporate soluble proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated whether the presence of homologous -Syn species would interfere with the seeding and spreading of -Syn pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in line with increasing evidence demonstrating that the spreading of -Syn pathology is most prominent when the injected preformed fibrils and host-expressed -Syn monomers are from the same species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insights that will help advance the development of neuronal and in vivo models for understanding mechanisms underlying h-Syn intraneuronal fibrillization and its contribution to PD pathogenesis, and for screening pharmacologic and genetic modulators of -Syn fibrillization in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Induction_of_h-Syn_Inclusion_Formation_in_SNCA__Primary_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several studies have reported that overexpressed h-Syn in mouse primary neurons exhibits diffuse localization without forming discreet inclusions (811).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the absence of m-Syn would affect this distribution, we examined the localization of transiently expressed h-Syn in primary neurons derived from C57Bl6/J/ola/hsd mice (SNCA/) lacking expression of m-Syn (Fig S1 A and B) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although h-Syn exhibited the previously reported diffuse distribution in WT neurons, a significant proportion of the SNCA/ neurons developed spheroid-like inclusions that were consistently observed in close association with nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes (Fig 1A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype was observed in primary neurons derived from another SNCA/ mouse strain (B6,129 × 1-Sncatm1Rosl/J) generated by targeted deletion of two exons of the m-Syn gene (Fig S1 C and D) (13), thereby establishing that the formation of inclusions is directly linked to the specific loss of m-Syn expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this finding, re-expression of m-Syn in SNCA/ neurons significantly reduced the formation of intraneuronal h-Syn inclusions, and restored the diffuse distribution of h-Syn in most neurons (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether the total abolishment of m-Syn expression is necessary to promote h-Syn inclusion formation, we assessed whether decreasing m-Syn levels in WT neurons via shRNA-mediated silencing is sufficient to promote this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient expression of three different vectors encoding shRNA hairpin loops showed efficient silencing of m-Syn in transfected neurons as compared to neurons transfected with scrambled shRNA sequences (Fig S1E), and biochemical analysis of lentivirally infected neurons showed 50% reduction in m-Syn expression (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably however, m-Syn silencing did not promote the formation of h-Syn inclusions in WT neurons (Fig S1G), suggesting that even low levels of m-Syn are sufficient to attenuate inclusion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

h-Syn_Inclusions_Reproduce_Key_LB_Features_and_Exhibit_Fibrillar_Ultrastructure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several cellular models manifesting -Syn accumulation into inclusions in human cell lines have been reported, upon -Syn overexpression alone (1416), coexpression with synphilin-1 (17), exposure to proteasome inhibitors (9), or application of oxidative/nitrative insults (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, inclusions observed under these conditions typically do not reproduce all key LB features, including decreased solubility, hyperphosphorylation at Serine-129 (pS129) (20), ubiquitination (21), thioflavin-S (ThS) binding, and fibrillar ultrastructural organization (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assessed whether the h-Syn inclusions observed in SNCA/ neurons fulfill these pathological features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the formation of inclusions is linked to decreased h-Syn solubility, WT or SNCA/ neurons were infected with lentiviruses encoding h-Syn and were then fractionated into nonionic detergent-soluble and nonionic detergent-insoluble fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this assay, lentivirally infected SNCA/ neurons showed significantly less monomeric h-Syn in detergent-soluble fractions compared to WT counterparts (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this effect was not caused by decreased total h-Syn expression in SNCA/ neurons, because similar total h-Syn RNA and protein levels were observed in unfractionated WT and SNCA/ neurons (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the decrease in soluble monomeric h-Syn was concomitant with the appearance of high-molecular-weight (HMW) h-Syn species in detergent-insoluble fractions of lentivirally infected SNCA/ neurons (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate our fractionation protocol, we treated WT neurons with insoluble h-SynAlexa633 PFFs (characterized in Fig S3), which showed a strong signal almost exclusively within the detergent-insoluble fractions (Fig 1C), as previously reported (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that abolishing m-Syn expression enhances the aggregation propensity of h-Syn in primary neurons, as reflected by decreased solubility and the formation of insoluble HMW h-Syn aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possibility is that the inclusions in SNCA/ neurons represent aggregated h-Syn that is contained within vesicles of the endo-lysosomal pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we systematically assessed the colocalization of inclusions with specific markers for early endosomes [Ras-related protein (Rab) 5 and Ras homolog gene family member B (RhoB)], late endosomes (Rab7), lysosomes [lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1)], autophagosomes [microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)], and multilamellar bodies [CD63 antigen (CD63)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S4A, although some h-Syn inclusions showed weak partial colocalization with cotransfected markers of late endosomes (Rab7-GFP) and lysosomes (Lamp1-RFP) indicating potential degradation by this pathway, most of the inclusions showed no colocalization with any of the cotransfected markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we assessed whether the inclusions formed in SNCA/ neurons are readily detectable using common LB probes, namely, antibodies against -Syn (1), pS129-Syn (20), and ubiquitin (21), as well as thioflavin-S (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1D, immunostaining using nine different anti-Syn antibodies with epitopes spanning most of the -Syn sequence all revealed bright spheroid intraneuronal inclusions, thereby establishing that these structures indeed comprise full-length h-Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dual immunofluorescence analysis showed that the inclusions are also hyperphosphorylated at S129 and are ubiquitinated, and costaining with thioflavin-S indicated that the inclusions could comprise cross-sheet fibrillar content (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether the h-Syn inclusions comprise the characteristic fibrillar ultrastructure observed in LBs, we performed correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) which allows ultrastructural examination of neurons previously identified by confocal microscopy as containing fluorescent inclusions (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy-two hours posttransfection, h-Syn inclusions were detected in close association with nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes or near mitochondria but were rarely found surrounded by a uniform lipid bilayer, thereby further ruling out the possibility that the inclusions are vesicular in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, high-magnification ssTEM of the correlated inclusions revealed intertwining whirls of filamentous structures in most analyzed inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual measurements of these structures showed that the filaments have an average diameter ranging from 713 nm (Fig 2D), which is similar to that of fibrils within genuine LBs (24), and thereby suggests that h-Syn could be aggregating into fibrils within these inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rule out the possibility that these flexible filamentous structures could represent membranes that have been entrapped within inclusions, we performed an additional CLEM experiment in which we treated neurons exhibiting de novo aggregates (composed of Mych-Syn) with h-SynAlexa633 PFFs for 24 h and then, within adjacent neurons, compared the ultrastructure and diameter of de novo filaments (comprising only Mych-Syn), internalized PFFs, mixtures of both, and intracellular membranes (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S4 D and E, although intracellular membranes showed a broad distribution of diameters (712 nm with a mean average of 8.7 nm), internalized PFFs and mixtures of de novo formed filaments and PFFs showed a much more defined width distribution of 1013 nm and a higher mean diameter of 11 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although filaments in de novo inclusions exhibited a broader width distribution compared to PFFs and mixtures (713 nm), with some of the filaments having a low diameter that could classify them as membranous, the great majority (75%) were in the range of 1013 nm, within the narrow distribution of PFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether h-Syn is the constituent of the observed fibrillar structures, we sought to assess their reactivity with antibodies against -Syn by immunogold labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we probed the ability of four different antibodies that have different epitopes against the N terminus, C terminus, and non-Abeta component (NAC) region of -Syn to detect h-Syn PFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we found that polyclonal antiPAN-Syn antibodies such as ab-6176 and FL-140 detect PFFs much more readily than monoclonal h-Synspecific antibodies (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assessed the reactivity of the fibrillar structures observed within h-Synexpressing SNCA/ neurons to the ab-6176 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, 3D reconstruction of ssTEM images clearly showed immunogold particles reacting with outer and inner portions of the filaments detected within inclusions (Fig 2 E and F), thereby confirming the presence of synuclein within these structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the inclusions observed in SNCA/ neurons exhibit similarities to LBs in terms of solubility and immunoreactivity, and demonstrate signs of bona fide fibrillization events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the filaments do not have an orderly arrangement with a dense core, as typically observed in brainstem LBs, but are embedded among an electron-translucent medium, which is probably composed of sequestered soluble -Syn protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the filaments are not organized as in authentic LBs, they may recapitulate early stages of LB formation that may need more time or additional factors to mature and remodel into more organized LB-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

h-Syn_Inclusions_in_SNCA__Neurons_Grow_in_Size_and_Incorporate_Soluble_-Syn  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated mechanisms underlying h-Syn inclusion growth over time using fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SNCA/ neurons transiently expressing h-Syn, inclusions were detected 24, 48, and 72 h posttransfection, and the size of inclusions appeared to increase over time as assessed by quantifying 3D-rendered inclusion volumes (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the kinetics of inclusion growth in real time, we performed fluorescence live-imaging experiments using h-Syn that is N-terminally tagged to mEOS2, a fluorescent protein that is photoconvertible from bright green (506 nm) to orange-red (584 nm) when excited at near-UV wavelengths (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, somatic and neuritic mEOS2-Syn inclusions were detected 24 h posttransfection in SNCA/ neurons and continued to grow in volume over 72 h. Moreover, the detected inclusions were reactive with antibodies against total -Syn, ubiquitin, and pS129-Syn (Fig 3C), suggesting that the fusion protein reproduces the aggregation properties of untagged h-Syn and could be used to investigate the kinetics of inclusion formation in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Short-interval (1 h) confocal live imaging followed by 3D surface rendering showed that the volume of individual inclusions increased over time, with very few reversible fusion events noted (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, analysis of the speed of moving particles showed that most detected inclusions are immobile (Fig 3D), thereby ruling out the possibility of inclusion growth being caused mainly by the fusion of small, motile aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the percent increase in volume was variable among different inclusions, with some doubling their volume within 50 min and others showing modest changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that the growth rate of inclusions is not linear and constant over time, and is not necessarily similar for the whole population of inclusions within the same neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether mEOS2-Syn inclusions incorporate soluble h-Syn over time, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and photoconversion live-imaging experiments (Fig 3E), which allow assessing the rates of protein diffusion into (DIN) and out of (DOUT) inclusions respectively, and determining the relative proportion of immobile protein within inclusions (immobile fraction, IF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FRAP experiments we photobleached individual inclusions and monitored the recovered fluorescence from diffusing soluble cytosolic protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3F and Movie S2, FRAP measurements showed the recovery of fluorescent signal within photobleached inclusions, and monoexponential fitting of FRAP plots from 90 different inclusions allowed the estimation of DIN and IF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average value for DIN was very low (0.03 µm2/s), consistent with previous results for immobilized -Syntetracysteine inclusions in SH-SY5Y cells (0.030.04 µm2/s) (26), suggesting the presence of a structure that impedes free diffusion of soluble h-Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this notion, 32% of the protein was estimated to be found within the IF, thereby establishing that inclusions comprise immobilized proteins that are unable to equilibrate with the cytoplasmic pool, likely because they are bound or sequestered in a dense compact structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of high amounts of soluble mobile protein (68%) within inclusions is in line with our ssTEM data showing filamentous structures embedded within a bulk of electron-translucent milieu, which is probably sequestered soluble h-Syn protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the DOUT, we used the photoconvertible property of mEOS2, where we photoconverted individual inclusions by near-UV irradiation and monitored the decrease in photoconverted fluorescence intensity within inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay in fluorescence would reflect outward diffusion of proteins from the inclusions to the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, irradiation of inclusions with a 405-nm laser resulted in rapid photoconversion of 488-nm mEOS2-Syn fluorescence to 568 nm (Fig 3G and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, although exponential fitting of decay curves from 50 different neurons revealed a slightly lower estimation of the IF than obtained from FRAP experiments (16 ±10%), the estimated DOUT (0.0022 ± 0.0007 µm2/s) was almost 16-fold lower than the DIN (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that, within the same time period, significantly more protein enters into inclusions than diffuses out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our findings together suggest that the h-Syn aggregates in SNCA/ neurons incorporate soluble protein into stable structures, most likely the fibrils observed by ssTEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inclusion_Formation_in_SNCA__Neurons_Is_an_Aggregation-Driven_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether the formation of h-Syn inclusions is an aggregation-driven process, we assessed whether altering the propensity of h-Syn for aggregation affects the formation and/or growth of neuronal inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two modified h-Syn proteins, a C-terminally truncated variant (at position 120) that has been shown to aggregate more readily than full-length -Syn in vitro and in vivo (27), and a variant with the S87E substitution that inhibits h-Syn aggregation in similar models (28, 29), were expressed in WT or SNCA/ neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4A, although similar proportions of SNCA/ neurons expressing full-length (-SynFL) or truncated (-Syn120) h-Syn developed inclusions, the S87E aggregation-deficient variant exhibited mostly diffuse distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was not caused by a difference in protein expression levels among the three proteins, because similar mean fluorescence levels per neuron were detected across conditions (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expression of the -Syn120 mutant did not affect the number of neurons forming inclusions, we investigated whether the kinetics of mEOS2-Syn inclusion growth are affected by this modification (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface reconstruction of inclusions showed that at 24 h posttransfection mEOS2-Syn120 formed significantly larger inclusions than mEOS2-SynWT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the few inclusions formed by the mEOS2-SynS87E mutant were much smaller compared to mEOS2-SynWT inclusions at 48 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we investigated whether treatment with a pharmacological -Syn aggregation inhibitor, tolcapone (30), would affect the formation of inclusions in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, tolcapone treatment reduced the formation of inclusions by 60% and restored the diffuse distribution of h-Syn in SNCA/ neurons (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that the formation of h-Syn inclusions in SNCA/ neurons is an aggregation-driven process, as inclusion formation was significantly inhibited both by the introduction of a single amino acid substitution known to inhibit h-Syns aggregation propensity, and by treatment with a known aggregation inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Endogenous_-Syn_KO_Is_a_Natural_h-Syn_Aggregation_Inhibitor_in_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that homologous members of the synuclein family could act as natural physiological inhibitors of abnormal -Syn aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we compared h-Syns propensity for aggregation in primary neurons derived from mice lacking expression of -Syn (-Syn KO) (31), -Syn (-Syn KO) (32), or all three synucleins (triple KO) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of - and -Syn in corresponding KO cultures was validated by immunocytochemistry (Fig 5A); -Syn expression was not detectable in any of the cultures, probably because of its low expression levels in hippocampal neurons, as previously reported (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, when we assessed the distribution of exogenously expressed h-Syn across the different cultures (Fig 5B), we found that -SynKO and triple-KO neurons similarly develop -Syn inclusions, unlike WT controls and -SynKO neurons that mostly exhibit diffuse h-Syn distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the inclusions formed in -SynKO and triple-KO neurons were also hyperphosphorylated at S129, thus exhibiting a key pathological LB-like phenotype (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that, unlike endogenous -Syn, the other two homologs, -Syn and -Syn, have similar inhibitory effects on ectopic h-Syn aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that similar percentages of -SynKO and triple-KO neurons develop inclusions (35%) rules out the presence of a synergistic effect for the deletion of both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Absence_of_m-Syn_Promotes_Specific_Aggregation_of_h-Syn_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the presence of m-Syn affects the aggregation propensity of h-Syn in the brain, we crossed mice lacking endogenous m-Syn (SNCA/) (13) with mice carrying two copies of h-Syn (h-Syn+/+) (Fig S6A) (35) to generate (h-Syn+/+SNCA/) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical fractionation of brain homogenates into cytosolic (soluble) and particulate (insoluble) protein fractions was performed to assess whether these mice exhibit changes in h-Syn aggregation and solubility, compared to h-Syn+/+ controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our previous data, less monomeric h-Syn was detected in cytosolic fractions derived from h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice than in cytosolic fractions derived from h-Syn+/+ counterparts (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease in monomeric h-Syn was concomitant with the appearance of HMW h-Syn species within particulate fractions, which were detected using three different antibodies against h-Syn, thereby establishing their specificity (Fig 6A and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the decrease in soluble h-Syn was not the result of decreased total h-Syn expression in h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice compared to h-Syn+/+ counterparts, as similar total h-Syn mRNA and protein levels were observed in unfractionated brains of both genotypes (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that h-Syn aggregates readily and becomes less soluble in the absence of m-Syn in Tg mouse brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate further the extent of h-Syn aggregation in mouse brains, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on sections treated with proteinase K, which allows selective visualization of highly structured proteinase K resistant aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies (35), h-Syn+/+ mice showed abundant intraneuronal -Syn immunoreactive inclusions in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, some of which were proteinase K resistant (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, neurons from h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice showed higher immunoreactivity to anti-Syn antibodies and exhibited a significant increase in proteinase K-resistant inclusions in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, double immunolabeling showed that these inclusions are phosphorylated at S129 and exhibit strong reactivity for the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (Fig 6 C and D), both of which are markers of LB pathology (20, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the aggregation propensity of h-Syn is enhanced in the absence of m-Syn in vivo, as reflected by decreased h-Syn solubility and accumulation into proteinase K-resistant inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether abolishing m-Syn expression would promote the aggregation of human -Syn (h-Syn), the considerably less aggregation-prone homolog of h-Syn, we crossed Tg mice expressing h-Syn (37) with SNCA/ mice to generate h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical fractionation revealed that the absence of m-Syn did not affect the levels of soluble h-Syn or cause the appearance of insoluble h-Syn species (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that h-Syn was localized mostly within neuronal terminals and did not form any inclusions in the brains of h-Syn+/+ mice, as previously reported (37), or in the brains of h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice (Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that -Syn ablation does not promote the aggregation of h-Syn in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

m-Syn_Interacts_with_Aggregated_h-Syn_Species_and_Attenuates_Seeding_and_Spreading  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the mechanism by which m-Syn affects h-Syn aggregation, we first assessed whether overexpressed h-Syn interacts directly with endogenous m-Syn in WT primary neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we did not detect any interaction between the two proteins at the monomer level by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether m-Syn interacts with multimeric/aggregated h-Syn species rather than h-Syn monomers, we assessed the interaction of m-Syn monomers with equimolar amounts of h-Syn monomers or h-Syn PFFs (characterized in Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, m-Syn was coimmunoprecipitated only when it was mixed with h-Syn PFFs and not with h-Syn monomers (Fig 7A), indicating that monomeric m-Syn might interact preferentially with h-Syn PFFs in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm these findings and to obtain a quantitative assessment of the interaction between m-Syn monomers and h-Syn PFFs by an independent readout, we performed SPR measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, saturating amounts of either h-Syn monomers or h-Syn PFFs were immobilized by amine coupling to separate CM5 chips, and then increasing concentrations of m-Syn monomers were flushed onto the chips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7B, and in line with our immunoprecipitation experiments, no interaction was noted between injected m-Syn monomers and immobilized h-Syn monomers, even at the highest tested concentration for m-Syn (10 µM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, m-Syn monomers interacted readily with sonicated h-Syn PFFs in a dose-dependent manner, even at concentrations as low as 0.1 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether endogenous m-Syn similarly interacts with aggregated h-Syn species in primary neurons, we treated WT neurons with sonicated h-Syn PFFs and assessed interaction by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, and in line with our in vitro results, m-Syn coimmunoprecipitated with pulled-down h-Syn PFFs (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, confocal imaging revealed that internalized h-Syn PFFs colocalize with endogenous m-Syn (Fig S7C), which redistributes from a diffuse somatic localization into defined puncta as previously described (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show that m-Syn interacts preferentially with aggregated h-Syn PFFs in vitro and in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we explored whether such an interaction between -Syn PFFs and -Syn monomers from different species would seed or, alternatively, attenuate progressive monomer aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we assessed the aggregation kinetics of h-Syn or m-Syn monomers in the presence of either h-Syn PFFs or m-Syn PFFs (characterized in Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, assessment of thioflavin-T (ThT) binding and the formation of fibrillar structures by TEM showed that the seeding efficiency is significantly higher when h-Syn monomers and PFFs are of the same species (Fig 7C and Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, whereas the lag phase was eliminated in the mixture of h-Syn monomers and h-Syn PFFs, resulting in the appearance of fibrillar structures at 8 h of incubation, the aggregation profile of the mixture of h-Syn monomers and m-Syn PFFs was similar to that of h-Syn alone, in which only oligomeric species were formed at 8 h of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the mixture of m-Syn monomers with m-Syn PFFs showed the most dramatic elimination of the lag phase, with fibrils formed after only 2 h of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here again, although the addition of h-Syn PFFs to m-Syn monomers resulted in higher ThT plateau values than seen with m-Syn monomers alone, it failed to eliminate the lag phase and resulted in the formation of oligomeric species at 2 h. Taken together, these findings strongly show that the aggregation kinetics of -Syn are significantly accelerated when the seeds and monomers are from the same species, and that the presence of mixed species of monomers and PFFs results in reduced seeding capacity and slower aggregation kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether the seeding and spreading potential of -Syn PFFs is similarly affected by the presence of PFFs and endogenous monomers of the same species in the brain, we injected m-Syn PFFs or h-Syn PFFs into the striatum of WT (non-Tg) or SNCA/ mice (as controls) and then compared the seeding and spreading propensity in different brain regions 1 month postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we observed the most pronounced spreading of -Syn pathology only when m-Syn PFFs were injected into WT mice expressing endogenous m-Syn (Fig 7D); in these mice m-Syn accumulated into somatic inclusions that were ubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated at S129 in the cortex and amygdala (Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, h-Syn PFFs induced significantly less pathology at these regions in WT mice at the same time point, and SNCA/ mice showed very limited overall pathology following injection with either h-Syn PFFs or m-Syn PFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with the significantly reduced seeding efficiency of h-Syn PFFs in the presence of monomeric m-Syn in vitro; this reduced seeding efficiency may allow more time for natural inhibitory or clearance mechanisms to interfere with the seeding and spreading of exogenous h-Syn PFFs in mouse brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aggregation of -Syn into LBs has been directly linked to the pathogenesis of PD (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of formation and the precise effect of LBs on neuronal physiology and viability remains poorly understood, mostly because of the lack of animal and cellular models exhibiting de novo -Syn fibrillization into LB-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although doubling -Syn expression is sufficient to cause PD in humans, attempts to reproduce molecular PD pathology based on -Syn overexpression in various animal models have not been successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of success could imply the presence of cellular factors that inhibit h-Syn aggregation in these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we sought to systematically examine whether endogenous -Syn homologs attenuate h-Syn aggregation in mouse neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a substantial fraction of SNCA/ neurons expressing h-Syn develop inclusions that exhibit key LB-like features, including S129 hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ThS reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this phenomenon reflected de novo h-Syn fibrillization, as revealed by ssTEM following both CLEM and immunogold-labeling experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, none of the previously published cellular models that rely solely on the overexpression of h-Syn have reported inlcusions that exhibit these features altogether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple lines of evidence from many of our experiments further converged to establish that the formation of inclusions in SNCA/ neurons is an aggregation-driven process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of the aggregation-incompetent mutant S87E or treatment with the pharmacological -Syn aggregation inhibitor tolcapone significantly reduced the formation of inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, overexpression of the aggregation-prone truncated h-Syn variant (1-120) resulted in the formation of larger inclusions than seen with the WT protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases in which we observed increased inclusion formation, we also observed decreased h-Syn solubility and the appearance of HMW aggregates, concomitant with the loss of monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, time-lapse live imaging coupled with FRAP and photoconversion experiments showed in real time that the inclusions grow in size and readily incorporate soluble h-Syn protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly however, when we explored the toxic potential of these inclusions, we found that the aggregates formed do not provoke increased toxicity (SI Discussion and Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that intracellular h-Syn aggregates may be protective in cellular models (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are underway to determine whether these aggregates exhibit a similar role under conditions of cellular stress, such as treatment with mediators of oxidative stress or inhibitors of protein degradation, or other molecules known to contribute to PD pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established that SNCA/ primary neurons are more permissive of h-Syn aggregation in culture, we sought to validate this finding in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two previous independent studies had suggested that the expression of h-Syn120 or h-SynA53T in Tg mice lacking m-Syn expression leads to the formation of fibrillar inclusions within the substantia nigra or spinal cord (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we directly compared the aggregation propensity of h-Syn in brains of mice expressing or lacking endogenous m-Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data showed that h-Syn exhibits enhanced aggregation propensity in the absence of m-Syn, as reflected by decreased solubility, enhanced detection of HMW oligomeric species, and the formation of abundant proteinase K-resistant and pS129 hyperphosphorylated inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out the possibility that knocking out m-Syn promotes nonspecific aggregation, we conducted similar studies on h-Syn, the -Syn homolog that is significantly less prone to aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, knocking out m-Syn did not affect the levels, distribution, or staining pattern of h-Syn in Tg mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observation that the reintroduction of m-Syn in SNCA/ neurons significantly attenuates the formation of h-Syn inclusions suggests that the mouse homolog might directly inhibit h-Syn aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, although we could not detect a prominent interaction between h-Syn and m-Syn at the monomeric level in neurons, we consistently observed that monomeric m-Syn preferentially interacts with sonicated PFFs in vitro and in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we found that this interaction does not promote progressive seeding and spreading of pathology in vitro or in mouse brains in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, endogenous m-Syn might directly inhibit h-Syn fibrillization in WT primary neurons by stabilizing oligomeric species and capping the terminals of early fibrillar structures formed by h-Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is in line with the early study by Rochet et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) showing that m-Syn inhibits the fibrillization of h-Syn by stabilizing oligomers on the pathway to amyloid formation in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is consistent with literature reports demonstrating that the propagation and spreading of -Syn pathology is prominent when the injected PFFs and host-expressed monomers are from the same species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most of these studies, seeding and spreading of -Syn pathology was observed when m-Syn PFFs were injected into non-Tg mice expressing m-Syn (4042) or when h-Syn PFFs were injected into Tg mice expressing human -Syn protein (4348).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An attractive general implication of our findings is that the attenuation of aggregation by homologous proteins could represent a generic biological phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposition is consistent with multiple studies reporting decreased aggregation kinetics in the presence of homologous amyloidogenic proteins underlying different diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the key peptides involved in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimers disease, A40 and A42, were shown to inhibit each others aggregation reciprocally in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mutant hemoglobin -chain polymerization in sickle cell anemia was shown to be attenuated upon increasing ratios of its -chain homolog (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, in transthyretin (TTR) amyloid diseases, murine/human TTR homologs form heterotetramers that impair amyloid formation (51, 52), and aggregation in vivo was achieved mostly in Tg mice expressing TTR mutants on an endogenous TTR-KO background (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the aggregation kinetics of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in bulk solution was reduced dramatically by the presence of its rat homolog (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of these findings, we investigated whether this phenomenon could be extended to the other endogenous h-Syn homologs, -Syn and -Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that -SynKO cultures also developed h-Syn inclusions that were hyperphosphorylated at S129.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the distribution of h-Syn was not affected when expressed in -SynKO neurons, because the levels of -Syn in WT hippocampal neurons were already very low and therefore could not be reduced drastically in -SynKO neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are also in line with previous reports showing that -Syn inhibits -Syn aggregation in vitro (55, 56) as well as in vivo; double-Tg mice coexpressing both h-Syn and h-Syn exhibit ameliorated motor deficits and lower -Syn accumulation compared to Tg mice expressing h-Syn alone (37, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results further suggest that the total levels or ratio of both endogenous - and -Syn could be critical in protecting against h-Syn aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once this level drops below a certain threshold (in either single or triple KOs), the aggregation of h-Syn into LB-like inclusions becomes progressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this proposition is the observation that intermediate reduction of m-Syn levels by shRNA did not promote the formation of h-Syn inclusions in WT neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have shown that two endogenous members of the synuclein family, m-Syn and m-Syn, attenuate the aggregation of overexpressed h-Syn in mouse neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with the multitude of studies that have reported the inhibition of aggregation of other amyloidogenic proteins by their homologues (such as A, TTR, hemoglobin, and IAPP), this observation could reflect a more generic biological phenomenon in which endogenous homologs act as natural inhibitors of abnormal aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon could explain why most current rodent PD models relying on h-Syn overexpression in WT mice do not show prominent h-Syn fibrillization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, understanding the interactions between homologous proteins and the effect of such interactions on protein aggregation and amyloid formation could facilitate the generation of novel cellular and in vivo models of protein misfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to assess the dynamics of inclusion formation quantitatively in our neuronal model provides unique opportunities to elucidate molecular and cellular determinants that influence the mechanisms of -Syn fibrillization in living neurons, and to identify pathways that modulate this process and contribute to neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies using this model could make it possible to identify novel drugs for the treatment of PD based on modulating -Syn aggregation and interneuronal spreading, or enhancing the degradation and clearance of toxic -Syn aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the consequence of h-Syn aggregation into fibrillar structures on the viability of the SNCA/ neurons, we used the SYTOX Green vital dye (Invitrogen) and the TUNEL (Roche) marker of apoptosis as readouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, h-Syn expression for 24, 48, or 72 h did not provoke neuronal death in WT neurons, as previously reported (8, 38, 59), or in SNCA/ primary cultures (Fig S10A), indicating that h-Syn expression is not toxic to these neurons per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the relatively low transfection efficiency of neurons could mask subtle effects, we infected the neurons with lentiviruses that mediate more efficient neuronal transduction of h-Syn, with maximal expression occurring 6 d postinfection (Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, however, assessment of cellular death using the SYTOX Green assay revealed no significant differences between WT and SNCA/ neurons infected with h-Syn or with the empty vector control, in contrast to the 24-h H2O2 treatment that induced cellular death and prominent staining with SYTOX Green (Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation of this result is that only a fraction of SNCA/ neurons exhibit inclusions, and hence the effects could be diluted by non-inclusionforming neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we counted individual WT and SNCA/ neurons expressing mEOS2-Syn undergoing apoptotic death as identified by the TUNEL assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although inclusion-bearing SNCA/ neurons expressing mEOS2-Syn appeared to have less defined neurites, similar low percentages of TUNEL+ mEOS2-Synexpressing neurons were observed across the different cultures (Fig S10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results together intriguingly rule out h-Syn aggregation into fibrillar LB-like inclusions as being predominantly toxic to cultured primary hippocampal neurons at the tested time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Primary_Neuron_Culture_Preparation__Transfection__Infection__and_Tolcapone_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from postnatal day 0 C57BL/6JRccHsd (WT; Harlan Laboratories), C57BL/6JOlaHsd (-Syn KO; Harlan Laboratories) (12), B6,129 × 1-Sncatm1Rosl/J (-SynKO; Jackson Laboratories) (13), -SynKO (31), -SynKO (58), or ---SynKO (33) mice as previously described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, dissected tissues were dissociated with papain and triturated using a glass pipette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 min, cells were plated in minimum essential medium (MEM)/10% (vol/vol) horse serum onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)coated coverslips [12 mm glass (VWR International) for immunocytochemistry or 13 mm plastic (Thermanox, Nunc) for immunogold staining and TEM] at 1.5 × 105 cells/mL, or at 3 × 105 cells/mL in 35-mm confocal dishes (World Precision) for live imaging, or in 10-cm dishes (BD Biosciences) for biochemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medium was changed after 4 h to Neurobasal/ B27 medium, and neurons were treated with Arabinosylcytosine (AraC; Sigma) after 6 d in vitro (DIV) to stop glial division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 7 DIV, neurons were either transiently transfected for up to 3 d using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions or were infected with lentiviruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for up to 7 d. When indicated, at 24 h posttransfection, neurons were treated with 20 µM tolcapone (Sigma) for an additional 24 h before immunocytochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Plasmids__shRNA_Sequences__and_Lentiviral_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generation of the plasmid encoding mEOS2-Syn has been described previously (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, h-Syn cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pmEOS2-C1 plasmid (minus the start codon) to generate the mEOS2-SynFL fusion construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mEOS2-SynS87E and the mEOS2-Syn120 mutants were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) to introduce the S87E mutation or a stop codon at position 120, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The plasmids encoding the fluorescent markers for early endosomes (RhoB-YFP) and autophagosomes (LC3-GFP) were obtained from BD Biosciences, Clontech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid encoding GFP-CD63 was kindly provided by Remy Sadoul, Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France, plasmids encoding fluorescently tagged markers of the endo-lysosomal pathway (Rab5-RFP, Rab7-GFP, and Lamp1-RFP) were kindly provided by Darren Moore, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, the pRK172m-Syn plasmid was kindly provided by Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and the pcDNA6h-Syn and pT7-7h-Syn plasmids were kindly provided by Peter Lansbury, Harvard Medical School, Boston.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The V16C mutation then was introduced into the pT7-7h-Syn plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) to allow site-specific fluorescent labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coding sequences (ORFs) of h-SynFL, h-SynS87E, h-Syn120, or m-Syn were individually subcloned by Amsbio into a CMV-driven lentivector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A null control sequence (200 bp) was cloned in the same vector as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three shRNA sequences against m-Syn (NM_001042451) were also designed and cloned by Amsbio into a lentiviral-H1-shRNA expression vector comprising RFP-Puromycin as a dual marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control shRNA sequence having minimal off-target effects was cloned into the same vector:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lentiviral particles were produced and titered by Amsbio using the P24 antigen-capture assay kit (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5421; Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc.) in HEK 293T cells or via RFP fluorescent cell counting at 72 h posttransduction on HT1080 cells for shRNA-encoding viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral titers ranged from 4.88 × 106 to 6.82 × 106 infectious units (ifu)/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recombinant_Protein_Expression_and_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously described (10), BL21(DE3) cells were first transformed with pT7-7h-Syn, pRK172m-Syn, or pT7-7h-SynV16C and then were grown in LB medium at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After induction with 1 mM 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside (AppliChem) for 4 h, sonication was performed to lyse and pellet the bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 48,000 × g (20 min) was boiled for 5 min and recentrifuged for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supernatant was purified by anion exchange (HiPrep 16/10 Q FF; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) followed by gel filtration (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), reverse-phase C4 HPLC (Proto 300 C4, 20 mm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  × 250 mm, 10 µm average bead diameter; Higgins Analytical) and finally was lyophilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purity was established by loading 1 µg of protein on 15% (vol/vol) SDS/PAGE gels, staining with Coomassie stain (Life Technologies) for 5 min, and then destaining with boiled water until distinct bands appeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the exact mass and to rule out the presence of other contaminants, mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) were performed as explained below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mass_Spectrometry_and_UPLC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously described (60), proteins were analyzed by LC-MS using either an LTQ system (Thermo Scientific) or an LCQ Fleet mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein solutions were desalted before mass spectrometry analysis by reversed-phase chromatography using either a Hypersil GOLD C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 m) (Thermo Scientific) on the LCQ Fleet System or a Poroshell 300SB C3 column (1.0 × 75 mm, 5 m) (Agilent Technologies) on the LTQ system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, 10-L samples were injected into the column, and a linear gradient from 595% of solvent B against solvent A was deployed to elute proteins over 10 min, with solvent A comprising 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water and solvent B consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow rates were 500 L/min (LTQ System) and 300 L/min (LCQ Fleet System).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MagTran software (Amgen Inc.) was used to deconvolve charge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
UPLC analysis of proteins was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH300 C18, 1.7-µm pore size, 2.1 × 100 mm column (Waters) or an Acquity UPLC BEHC4, 1.7-µm pore size, 2.1 × 100 mm column (Waters), with a linear gradient of 1090% of solvent B against solvent A over 4 min [solvent A was water/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and solvent B was acetonitrile/0.1% TFA].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_h-SynAlexa633Labeled_Protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant h-SynV16C was dissolved in 200 mM Tris, pH 7.0 (Trizma hydrochloride solution; Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two equivalents (final concentration 200 µM) of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the protein solution followed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature, five equivalents (500 µM) of Alexa-Fluor 633 maleimide (Pierce) were added to the solution for 1 h, resulting in 95% h-SynV16C-Alexa633 as shown by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS. To separate the free dye from the labeled h-SynAlexa633, PD10 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration columns were used according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after the column was equilibrated with 50 mL of H2O, 25 mL of the protein solution was added and then was eluted with H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collected h-Syn fractions were identified by SDS/PAGE and Coomassie staining (Life Technologies), and by MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MS analysis to verify the correct mass of the labeled protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The h-SynAlexa633 fractions then were combined and lyophilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_and_Characterization_of_PFFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prepare h-SynAlexa633labeled PFFs, a 300-µM solution comprising unlabeled recombinant h-Syn with 10% h-SynAlexa633 was prepared by dissolving lyophilized proteins in 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting solution was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant then was incubated at 37 °C under constant agitation at 850 rpm on an orbital shaker for 5 d. The generated h-Syn fibrils were sonicated briefly (40% amplitude, one pulse for 5 s) and then were aliquoted and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare unlabeled h-Syn or m-Syn PFFs, recombinant proteins were processed similarly and were incubated at similar concentrations and incubation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amyloid formation (before and after sonication) was assessed by ThT binding, remaining soluble protein content, and TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ThT fluorescence reading (excitation at 450 nm, emission at 485 nm) was performed using a Bucher Analyst AD plate reader after protein samples were incubated with ThT (10 M, in 50 mM glycine, pH 8.5) in black 384-well plates (Nunc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the remaining soluble protein content, after 25-L aliquots were centrifuged at 20,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C) to pellet insoluble aggregates, the supernatant was resolved on 15% (vol/vol) SDS/PAGE gels that were stained with Coomassie stain (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the ultrastructure of -Syn PFFs, 3.5 L of the samples was applied onto glow-discharged Formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 60 s. The grid was then blotted with filter paper, washed twice with ultrapure water and once with staining solution [uranyl formate 0.7% (wt/vol)], and then stained for 30 s, blotted, and dried by vacuum suction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was carried out on a Tecnai Spirit BioTWIN electron microscope (FEI) operated at 80 kV and equipped with a LaB6 gun and a 4 k × 4 k FEI Eagle CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monitoring_in_Vitro_Aggregation_Kinetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously described, lyophilized proteins of monomeric recombinant h-Syn or m-Syn were dissolved in 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and filtered through a 100-KDa MW-cutoff filter to remove potential aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins were incubated at 20 µM either alone or with 10% h-Syn or m-Syn PFFs at 37 °C under constant agitation at 850 rpm for 3 d. Amyloid formation in samples taken at different time points was monitored by ThT binding and TEM, as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SPR_Detection_of_Interactions_Between_h-Syn_and_m-Syn  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore X100 instrument with a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  h-Syn monomers (ligand 1) or h-Syn PFFs (ligand 2) were immobilized through amine coupling chemistry to separate CM5 chips, using standard ligand immobilization protocols from Biacore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each chip, both flow cells (Fc1 and Fc2) were activated for 7 min with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 0.4 M 3-N,N-dimethyla-mino (EDC) at a flow rate of 5 µL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each ligand was injected at 5 µL/min in a solution of 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS) at a concentration of 20 µM on the activated sensor surface 2 (Fc2); then 1 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5) was added to block the unreacted NHS-esters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor surface 1 (Fc1) was activated/deactivated without ligand for its use as a reference surface for subtraction of nonspecific signal effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The running buffer for all experiments was TBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  m-Syn monomers were diluted in running buffer at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 µM and were injected in increasing concentrations over the two ligands, with one duplicate of lower concentration (5 µM) after the highest analyte concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contact time for binding and the dissociation time were 450 s. All binding cycles were performed at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regeneration using 1 M NaOH followed by 1.5 M glycine/HCl buffer was applied to the sensor surfaces between runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction data were analyzed using the Biacore X100 Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare) and Scrubber 2.0 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry_and_Imaging_of_Primary_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously described (10), primary neurons were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then incubated in blocking buffer [3% (wt/vol) BSA, 0.02% saponin in PBS] for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ThS staining, fixed cells were incubated with 0.05% ThS for 15 min and were differentiated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol before blocking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer comprising primary antibodies (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, coverslips were washed five times with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer comprising appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) as well as the nuclear stain DAPI (1:2,500) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After five washes with PBS, coverslips were washed once with double-distilled water and then were mounted on glass slides with DABCO mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were imaged using a LSM700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image analysis and 3D surface reconstruction were performed using the Zen 2012 SP1 (black edition; Carl Zeiss) and Imaris software, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CLEM_Analysis_of_Primary_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNCA/ neurons were transfected to express h-Syn for 72 h. In a separate condition, SNCA/ neurons were transfected to express Mych-Syn for 24 h and then were treated with h-SynAlexa633 PFFs for an additional 24 h. In both cases, the neurons were plated on FluoroDishes (World Precision), fixed with 4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde, and then stained using either the Syn-211 antibody (in the condition expressing h-Syn) or the anti-Myc antibody (for the Mych-Syn + h-SynAlexa633 PFF-treated condition) using the immunocytochemistry protocol described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained neurons were imaged by fluorescent confocal microscopy, and their location on the FluoroDish was established relative to scratches previously made at the bottom of the glass using a diamond-tipped pen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neurons then were processed for TEM and embedded in resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they were fixed with 2.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 2% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h, washed extensively in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for 1 h. After washing with double-distilled water, cells were stained en block with 1% uranyl acetate aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 h and washed in double-distilled water for 5 min, followed immediately by dehydration in graded alcohol series (2 × 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, and 2 × absolute ethanol) for 3 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dehydrated cells were infiltrated with Durcupan resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) diluted with ethanol at 1:1 for 30 min, at 2:1 for 30 min, and twice with pure Durcupan for 30 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, after the 2-h incubation in Durcupan resin, the FluoroDish was filled with fresh Durcupan resin (1 mm above the cells) and polymerized at 65 °C overnight to cure the resin completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hard resin was removed from the FluoroDish by immersing the dish alternately in hot (60 °C) water followed by liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A laser microdissection microscope (Leica Microsystems) was used to mark the position of selected neurons (previously imaged by fluorescent confocal microscopy) on the resin surface to help cut out the cells from resin disk and to facilitate the trimming process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected neuron was cut from the disk using a single-edged razor blade and was glued with superglue to a blank resin block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutting face was trimmed using a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome (Leica Microsystems) and a glass knife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial sections (50- to 60-nm thick) were cut with a diamond knife (DiATOME) and collected onto 2-mm single-slot copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coated with Formvar support film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Tecnai Spirit TEM (FEI) operating at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and equipped with a bottom-mounted 4 × 4 k Eagle CCD camera controlled by TIA acquisition software (FEI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For inclusion colocalization, the basis was (i) to identify the exact neuron imaged by confocal microscopy and subsequently by TEM, particularly to correlate the overall shape of the neuron by TEM and fluorescence; (ii) to correlate the location of the nucleus by fluorescence and TEM to use its shape as an internal guide-mark within the neuron; and then (iii) to correlate the fluorescently labeled -Syn inclusion within high-resolution TEM images as accurately as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the difference in the thickness of each single optical slice obtained by confocal imaging (300 nm) and the physical thickness of each ultrathin section imaged by TEM (60 nm per section) is the limiting factor for exact and precise alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each confocal optical slice is 5× thicker than the ultrathin section imaged by TEM, the confocal image always will account for fluorescence from more structures (i.e., from structures above or below the ultrathin section, which need to be verified case by case) than observed in a single TEM section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunogold_Labeling_and_Negative_Staining_of_h-Syn_PFFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five microliters of each sample was applied onto glow-discharged Formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids and adsorbed for 60 s. To minimize unspecific binding of the primary antibody, grids were incubated on two drops of blocking solution [10 mM PBS with 0.2% calf BSA (BSAc)] for 30 s each and then with primary antibodies for 40 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grids were washed again on two drops of blocking solution for 30 s each and then were incubated with secondary antibodies (either goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse) coupled with 10-nm colloidal gold particles) diluted 1:50 in the blocking solution for 40 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, grids were washed in two drops of PBS and were incubated for 1 min on a drop of 1% aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde to stabilize bound antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, grids were washed three times on a clean drop of ultrapure water and negatively stained with 2% (wt/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate for 45 s, blotted, and air-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was carried out on a Tecnai Spirit BioTWIN electron microscope (FEI) operated at 80 kV and equipped with a LaB6 gun and a 4 × 4 k FEI Eagle CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pre-Embedding_Immunolabeling_and_TEM_of_Primary_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To preserve antigenicity, cells were fixed with 2% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 7.4 for 1 h. Aldehyde-reactive groups were inactivated with 0.1% sodium borohydrate in 0.1 M PB for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a thorough washing with 0.1 M PB, cells were cryoprotected with 2% (vol/vol) glycerol and 20% (vol/vol) DMSO in 0.1 M PB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma membrane was permeabilized using two rounds of freezing/thawing cycles in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells then were incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 0.01 M PBS at pH 7.4, 0.2% BSAc, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 5% (vol/vol) normal goat serum and were washed twice for 10 min each in 0.01 M PBS with 0.2% BSAc and 0.02% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons then were incubated with the rabbit primary antibody antiPAN-Syn 6176 at a dilution of 1:50 overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4), 0.2% BSAc, 0.02% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excess of primary antibody was removed by washing three times in 0.01 M PBS at pH 7.4 containing 0.2% BSAc for 5 min each wash. Then neurons were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit) coupled with 0.8-nm Nanogold particles (Aurion) at a dilution of 1:50 in 0.01 M PBS at pH 7.4 and 0.2% BSAc for 4 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing three times in 0.01 M PBS at pH 7.4 containing 0.2% BSAc for 5 min each wash and twice for 10 min each in 0.1 M PB at pH 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibodies were stabilized by 30-min fixation with 2.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M PB at pH 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultra-small Nanogold particles were silver-enhanced (R-Gent SE-EM Silver Enhancement Reagents; Aurion) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, and staining was monitored by light microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with double-distilled water and 0.1 M PB, cells were postfixed with 0.05% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M PB for 15 min and were washed in double-distilled water for 5 min followed immediately by dehydration in a graded alcohol series (2 × 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, and 2 × absolute ethanol) for 3 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dehydrated cells were infiltrated with Durcupan resin diluted with ethanol at 1:1 for 30 min, at 2:1 for 30 min, and twice with pure Durcupan for 30 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, after 2 h incubation in fresh Durcupan resin, the coverslips were placed with grown cells faced down on 1-mm-thick silicone rings placed on a glass slide (coated with mold-separating agent) and filled with fresh resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sandwich was polymerized at 65 °C overnight to cure the resin completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coverslips were removed from the hard resin by immersing the polymerized resin disk alternately into hot (60 °C) water followed by liquid nitrogen until the coverslip parted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Block preparation, ultramicrotomy, and TEM imaging were performed as described above in CLEM Analysis of Primary Neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3D_Reconstruction_of_TEM_Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Serial images throughout the immunogold-labeled inclusions, as well as the neuron reconstruction in the CLEM experiment, were combined into image stacks and aligned using the FIJI program (fiji.sc/Fiji).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Segmentation of the feature of interest and 3D reconstructions were done using the TrakEM2 plugin for FIJI, and final 3D models were visualized using the Blender program (v.2.69; www.blender.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Live_Imaging__FRAP__and_Photoconversion_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All live-imaging experiments were performed using the LSM 700 inverted point scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a stage maintained at 37 °C, using a Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.3 Oil differential interference contrast M27 objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When noted, 3D surface reconstruction of Z-stacks was performed using Imaris software to assess the increase in inclusion volume and number over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For FRAP and photoconversion experiments, transfected neurons were first identified using a 488-nm laser (0.5% transmission) and a 515- to 565-nm bandpass filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then a circular region of interest (ROI) (r = 0.45 µm) representing an individual inclusion was either photobleached using the same diode laser at 488 nm (50% transmission, 50 iterations) or photoconverted using a diode laser at 405 nm (50% transmission, 50 iterations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experiment, time-lapse imaging of the 488-nm channel (alone for FRAP or with the 568 channel for photoconversion) was performed, with an interval of around 0.1 s and with the pinhole maximally opened (460 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hundred fifty images for FRAP and photoconversion (frame size 128 × 128 pixels, 0.179 × 0.179 µm, eight bits, pixel dwell: 2.55 µs) were acquired, 10 of which were acquired before bleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FRAP_and_Photoconversion_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FRAP and photoconversion data analysis was performed as previously described (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Datasets from different neurons were analyzed using Zen 2012 SP1 (black editionl Carl Zeiss) and Fiji (by Image J) software to obtain intensity plots at each time point t at the bleached ROI I(t) and of the entire neuron T(t), which was used to normalize FRAP and photoconversion curves as per the following formulas: Irel(t)= [I(t)/Imax] [Tmax/T(t)] for FRAP and Irel(t)= [I(t)/Imax]/[Tmax/T(t)] for photoconversion, with Tmax and Imax representing maximum fluorescence intensities of the entire neuron and of the bleached ROI, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postbleach values (for FRAP) and prebleach values (for photoconversion) were set to zero to facilitate comparison of the curves and monoexponential fitting (done using the R statistical coding script) using the following equations:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For FRAP: Irel(t) = (1  IF) (1  ekoff t) where IF is the immobile fraction and koff is the off rate of binding; for photoconversion: Irel(t) = IF + (MF)(et/), where MF is the mobile fraction, and  is the time constant for the decay of fluorescent intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The half time 1/2 then was determined using the following formulas:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For FRAP: 1/2 = (ln 0.5)/koff; for photoconversion: 1/2 = 0.69 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diffusion coefficient D was finally calculated from 1/2 values: D = (0.88) (W2/4 1/2), with W being the radius of the bleached ROI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Extraction_and_Immunoblotting_of_Primary_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seven days after lentiviral infection, neurons (in 10-cm dishes) were washed once with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract total protein content, neurons were directly scraped in 1× loading buffer [1.5% (wt/vol) SDS (SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH), 10% (vol/vol) glycerol (Fisher Scientific), 62.5 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Biosolve) (pH 6.8), 0.0025% Bromophenol blue (Aldrich), and 10% (vol/vol) -mercaptoethanol (Sigma)] and were boiled for 10 min at 95 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform sequential extraction of proteins, neurons were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Trizma base, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were incubated for 20 min on ice and were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting supernatants comprise nonionic detergent-soluble fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellets then were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 5% (wt/vol) SDS and were briefly sonicated (60% amplitude, 3 s on/off for 15 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting solutions comprise nonionic detergent-insoluble fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After sample concentrations of soluble or insoluble fractions were determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Thermo Scientific, equal protein amounts were separated on Novex 412% (vol/vol) Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer cell from Bio-Rad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR Biosciences GmbH) diluted 1:3 in PBS and was probed with primary antibodies (Table S1) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three washes in PBST [PBS 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (Fluka)], the membrane was incubated with Alexa Fluor (680 or 800 nm)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen or Li-COR Biosciences GmbH) at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with PBST, and scanned using a Li-COR scanner at a wavelength of 700 or 800 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoprecipitation_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the interaction of recombinant proteins, solutions of recombinant m-Syn were mixed with h-Syn monomers or h-Syn PFFs (2.5 M each) in a solution of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutions of h-Syn PFFs alone (2.5 M) were included as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 50 L of each of the samples was incubated with 1 g of primary antibody (Syn-211) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess interactions in primary neurons, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [20 mM Trizma base, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 50 mM NaF, pH 7.4] containing protease inhibitors, incubated for 30 min with agitation 4 °C, and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 1,000 g of each sample was incubated with 1 g of primary antibody (Syn-211) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, 50 L of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) was washed with PBS and then incubated with each of the samples overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beads were collected using a DynaMag magnet (Invitrogen), washed three times with PBS-Tween 0.01%, and incubated with 40 L 1× loading buffer at 95 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DynaMag magnet (Invitrogen) was used to separate the beads again, and then the supernatants were electrophoresed on Novex 412% (vol/vol) Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) for Western blotting as discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SYTOX_Green_and_TUNEL_Cytotoxicity_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess membrane integrity in neurons, the SYTOX Green dye exclusion assay (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturers instructions and as previously described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the SYTOX Green dye was diluted (1:15,000) in the medium of neurons plated and transfected in 96-well clear-bottomed black plates (Corning) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons subsequently were washed twice with PBS; then the fluorescence intensity per well was measured using the Infinite M200-Pro plate reader (excitation: 487 nm; emission: 519 nm) after the addition of 100 µL of PBS per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were fixed, and immunocytochemistry was performed as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate presence of apoptotic neurons, the TUNEL assay was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixed transfected neurons first were washed twice with PBS and then were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate buffer for 2 min on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two washes with PBS, neurons were washed with MTBS buffer (66 mM NaCl, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4) and subsequently were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the TUNEL reaction mix (Roche) according to the manufacturers recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the neurons were washed twice with PBS and once with MTBS and were blocked for immunocytochemistry as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Tg_Mice_Lacking_m-Syn_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tg mice expressing h-Syn under the regulatory control of the human PDGF B chain promoter were generated as previously described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early on, these mice (line D) develop intraneuronal inclusions, dopaminergic deficits, and motor impairments (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate endogenous m-Syn expression in these mice, we crossed them first with SNCA/ mice (13) to generate heterozygotes and then backcrossed these heterozygotes with SNCA/ mice to remove the remaining copy of m-Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting mice were self-crossed to generate Tg mice expressing two copies of h-Syn in the absence of any m-Syn expression (h-Syn+/+SNCA/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate Tg mice expressing h-Syn in the absence of endogenously expressed m-Syn, Tg mice expressing h-Syn under the control of the mThy-1 cassette (37) were crossed with SNCA/ mice (13) to generate h-Syn+/+SNCA/ mice using a strategy similar to that discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was extracted from tail biopsies and analyzed with PCR amplification to verify transgene presence in all animals (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processing_and_Biochemical_Analysis_of_Transgenic_Mice_Brains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anesthetized mice were killed by transcardiac saline perfusion, and brains were removed and divided sagittally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein or RNA analysis, the right hemibrain was frozen in isopentane cooled in a Shandon Lipshaw Histobath (NesLab) and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemical analysis, the left hemibrain was fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 48 h and then was sectioned sagittally at 40 m using a Vibratome 2000 (Leica) as described previously (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain homogenates were separated into total, cytosolic, and particulate fractions as previously described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, frozen brain tissue was placed in cold PDGF buffer (1 mM Hepes, 5 mM benzamidine, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 8.8) comprising phosphatase and protease inhibitors and then was homogenized for 1 min on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearing lysates by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C resulted in supernatants that comprise total protein content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fractionate the brains further, the same supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supernatants comprise soluble cytosolic fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were resuspended and sonicated in PDGF buffer and comprise insoluble particulate fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After sample concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Thermo Scientific, equal protein amounts were heated for 10 min at 70 °C and were separated by gel electrophoresis on 412% (vol/vol) BisTris SDS/PAGE gels (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the wet transfer system (Bio-Rad), immunoblots were blocked for 1 h with 10% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were processed using a chemiluminescence kit (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus; Perkin-Elmer) and were imaged using a VersaDoc system (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemical_Analysis_of_Tg_Mice_Brains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on serially sectioned, free-floating, vibratome sections of mouse brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were washed with PBS before and after being pretreated with 10% (vol/vol) H2O2 (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then sections were treated with proteinase K (1 g/mL) (Invitrogen) in 5× TE buffer [50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA] for 8 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative set of sections did not receive proteinase K treatment and was washed in PBS alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sections then were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 10% (vol/vol) normal goat (or normal horse) serum (Vector Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Table S1) at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and reincubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections then were rinsed in PBS and subsequently were incubated in avidinbiotin complex (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories) for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, sections were rinsed again with PBS, incubated in PBS containing 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Sigma) and 0.001% H2O2 (Sigma) to reveal staining, rinsed with H2O, mounted on glass slides, dehydrated, cleared with xylene, and coverslipped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, slices were washed with PBS, incubated in 10% (vol/vol) H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature, and then blocked in a solution of 3% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer comprising primary antibodies (Table S1), washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-568 (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices finally were washed and mounted on glass slides using DABCO mounting solution (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Semiquantitative_RTPCR_of_Primary_Neurons_and_Brain_Homogenates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was extracted from primary neurons infected with lentiviruses for 7 d or from frozen brain tissues of Tg mice using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was run using the Transcriptor One-Step kit (Roche Diagnostic) using the following primers:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PCR products were loaded onto an agarose gel (1%) and were stained with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies), and a 1-kb Plus DNA ladder (Fermentas) was used to estimate the size of the bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of the agarose gels were acquired with a GENi Imager (Syngene, Biolabo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stereotaxic_Injection_of_-Syn_PFFs_in_Mice_and_Immunohistochemical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three-month-old C57BL6/C3H F1 or SNCA/ mice (63) obtained from Jackson Laboratories were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and were stereotaxically injected in one hemisphere with sonicated recombinant h-Syn or m-Syn PFFs (5 g) in the dorsal neostriatum (coordinates: +0.2 mm relative to bregma, +2.0 mm from midline, +2.6 mm beneath the dura).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injections were performed using a 10-L syringe (Hamilton) at a rate of 0.1 L per min (2.5 L total per site) with the needle in place for 5 min at each target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals (five mice per condition) were killed at 30 d postinjection by overdose with ketamine/xylazine; brains were removed after transcardial perfusion with PBS and were fixed overnight in neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific) before being serially sectioned with the vibratome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40-m-thick serial sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronal sections were stained using cDAB (Vector Laboratories) as a chromogen, or double immunolabeling was performed using appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 or -568 (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are presented as mean ± SD, and statistical analyses were performed using StatView v. 5.0 (SAS Institute) and SPSS (IBM) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine statistical significance between two groups, P values were calculated using a two-tailed MannWhitney u test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For multigroup comparisons, a one-way ANOVA was performed followed by Scheffé post hoc analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
