Structural complexity and molecular heterogeneity of a butterfly ejaculate reflect a complex history of selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male ejaculates exhibit remarkable diversity, including variation in their spatial and temporal molecular composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complexity suggests that ejaculates provide functions far beyond the delivery of sperm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigated the molecular and functional specificity of the butterfly spermatophore, a structurally complex ejaculate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that its two distinct parts originate from separate regions of the male reproductive tract, are transferred sequentially during mating, and seem to be the result of a complex evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also highlight a large and previously unrecognized female contribution to the spermatophore, which calls into question traditional characterizations of females as passive recipients of these male ejaculates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male ejaculates are often structurally complex, and this complexity is likely to influence key reproductive interactions between males and females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite its potential evolutionary significance, the molecular underpinnings of ejaculate structural complexity have received little empirical attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this knowledge gap, we sought to understand the biochemical and functional properties of the structurally complex ejaculates of Pieris rapae butterflies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males in this species produce large ejaculates called spermatophores composed of an outer envelope, an inner matrix, and a bolus of sperm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females are thought to benefit from the nutrition contained in the soluble inner matrix through increases in longevity and fecundity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the indigestible outer envelope of the spermatophore delays female remating, allowing males to monopolize paternity for longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that these two nonsperm-containing spermatophore regions, the inner matrix and the outer envelope, differ in their protein composition and functional properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also reveal how these divergent protein mixtures are separately stored in the male reproductive tract and sequentially transferred to the female reproductive tract during spermatophore assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we discovered large quantities of female-derived proteases in both spermatophore regions shortly after mating, which may contribute to spermatophore digestion and hence, female control over remating rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we report evidence of past selection on these spermatophore proteins and female proteases, indicating a complex evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings illustrate how structural complexity of ejaculates may allow functionally and/or spatially associated suites of proteins to respond rapidly to divergent selective pressures, such as sexual conflict or reproductive cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Envelope_and_Inner_Matrix_Are_Composed_of_Distinct_Protein_Suites_Stored_in_Different_Regions_of_the_Male_Reproductive_Tract__Suggesting_Their_Sequential_Transfer_During_Mating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first sought to identify the protein constituents of the different regions of the spermatophore and the male and female reproductive tissues that contribute them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We dissected out four morphologically distinct secretory glands/regions of the male reproductive tract (Fig 1B) as well as the female bursa copulatrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessory glands were separated into distal and proximal regions (defined relative to the genital opening of the male).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also separated the male mating duct into duplex and simplex sections based on morphology (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From MS analysis of these nine tissues, we identified 341 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein quantities were highly correlated between biological replicates after bioinformatic subtraction of hemolymph proteins (Methods, Fig S1, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spermatophore envelope and inner matrix contained 63 proteins as major components (Fig 1A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing these proteins with SFPs previously identified in Heliconius butterflies (42), we found that 10 of our proteins are homologous to SFPs from Heliconius erato and/or Heliconius melpomene (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the spermatophore proteins found in P. rapae are enzymes (n = 27; 42.8%), including 11 proteases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance and diversity of proteases are a recurring characteristic of ejaculates in insects and more divergent taxonomic groups (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were also many proteins of undetermined function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirteen proteins had no discernable molecular domain or homolog, and five had homologs only to uncharacterized proteins in Lepidoptera, prohibiting their functional annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then estimated the proportional contribution of each male and female reproductive tissue to the spermatophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a likelihood model to estimate the weighted contribution of each individual tissue based on its quantitative protein profile (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from testes and vas deferens showed a negligible contribution to the spermatophore, and these tissues were, therefore, excluded from subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best fit model for the outer envelope showed the mating duct simplex to be the main contributor (36.2 ± 1.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the inner matrix, the mating duct duplex and the proximal accessory glands were the main contributors (44.3 ± 6.5% and 26.2 ± 5.4%, respectively) (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contributions suggest that the spermatophore is assembled in a sequential process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mating duct simplex is the most proximal to the male genital opening, and therefore, its secretion products (i.e., the envelope components) would be transferred first to the female.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secretion products from reproductive tract regions more distal to the genital opening, such as the mating duct duplex and the proximal accessory glands, would be transferred afterward to form the inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data suggest that spermatophore formation begins with transfer of the envelope, which is then inflated by the inner matrix material (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Large_Amounts_of_Female_Proteases_Invade_the_Spermatophore_During_or_Shortly_After_Mating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By combining the proteomic results with our nine previously published tissue-specific transcriptomes (34), we determined the origins of spermatophore proteins and whether they came from females and/or males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, most spermatophore proteins (n = 31; 49.2%) were highly specific to the male reproductive tract, whereas others (n = 26; 41.2%) are expressed in reproductive and nonreproductive organs of both sexes (Fig 1A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, we uncovered a large female contribution to the spermatophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five proteins found in large quantities in the spermatophore were identified as being solely expressed in the female reproductive tract, and one other is found predominantly in the bursa copulatrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By abundance, these female-specific proteins represent 25% of the soluble protein content in the envelope and 10.7% of the inner matrix (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all six of these female-produced proteins are proteases, each of which was previously identified as expressed in the bursa copulatrix (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the spermatophores sampled here were collected 2 h after matingthe earliest time point at which the envelope is fully hardenedthese proteases could have been incorporated either during the transfer of the ejaculate or shortly after the transfer was complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid incorporation of large amounts of female-derived proteases is consistent with our prior observations of the remarkably high concentrations of bursal proteases in virgin females (34, 38) and implies that females may already have an active role in spermatophore digestion even before breach of the indigestible envelope by the signum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Indigestible_Portion_of_the_Envelope_Is_Composed_of_Proline-Rich_Proteins__a_Hallmark_of_Extracellular_Structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In P. rapae and other butterflies (46), spermatophore envelopes are never fully digested and remain in the bursa copulatrix for the females lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This persistence implies that spermatophore envelopes are made of substances that the female is unable to digest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that spermatophore envelopes were also insoluble in vitro when incubated with detergents (SDS), proteases (proteinase K and trypsin), and reducing agents (DTT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only strong oxidizing agents were able to completely dissolve envelopes (96% sulfuric acid or 8.25% sodium hypochlorite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that covalent bonds, other than disulfide bonds, are involved in the polymerization of the envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the probable composition of the envelope, we performed an amino acid composition analysis on both the envelope and the inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined that the proportion of protein content by dry weight in the insoluble envelope was 73.3%, whereas the proportion of total protein in the inner matrix was 48.8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the envelope is mainly composed of protein and not composed of alternative structural molecules, such as chitin, which has been previously hypothesized (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared the amino acid composition of the envelope and inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most amino acids were present at roughly similar levels, there was a twofold higher proportion of proline in the envelope compared with the inner matrix (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified two proteins that could explain this high proportion of proline residues, which we named Proline-Rich Seminal Protein 1 (PRSP1) and PRSP2 (GenBank accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KU695466 and KU695467).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two proteins have the highest proline content of all of the proteins that we identified by MS (Fig 3 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they are highly abundant in the soluble portion of the envelope, accounting for almost 21% of soluble protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PRSP1 and PRSP2 are almost entirely absent from the spermatophore inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the PRSPs thus likely form the majority of the insoluble envelope structure, their amino acid profiles do not perfectly match the amino acid composition of the envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The envelope is then probably composed of a mixture of several proteins, including PRSPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A search against the PFAM database failed to identify recognized domains in either PRSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they seem to be specific to Lepidoptera, because we identified homologs in the postman butterfly (H. melpomene), the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), and the silkworm moth (Bombyx mori) but not in more divergent taxonomic groups (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both PRSPs contain three distinct regions with unusual amino acid compositions and highly repetitive sequences (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also possess two similar regions in their N-terminal ends: (i) a region rich in repeats of hydrophobic amino acids, charged amino acids, and proline and (ii) a C-terminal region rich in proline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such repetitive and proline-rich regions have also been reported in a protein purified from the spermatophore of the yellow mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor, aptly named spermatophorin (49), and other structural proteins, such as spider silk, the mammalian copulatory plug, collagens, and plant cell walls (5053).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Male-_and_Female-Contributed_Spermatophore_Proteins_Exhibit_Rapid_Evolutionary_Divergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the spermatophore envelope and inner matrix are different in composition and thus, likely serve different functions, we compared their evolutionary rates to ask if selection has acted differently on them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used sequences from P. rapae and a congener, Pieris napi, to estimate rates of evolution through their global dN/dS ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although orthologs were clearly identified in more distant species of Lepidoptera, their divergence at synonymous sites was so high as to be saturated and could not be used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using pairwise estimates between P. rapae and P. napi, we determined that, as a class, genes encoding spermatophore proteins exhibit elevated dN/dS ratios, indicating rapid evolutionary rates compared with muscle genes expressed in the bursa copulatrix (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter were used for comparison, because these muscle genes, which are coexpressed with other muscle tissues throughout the body [e.g., flight muscle (34)], represent a gene set that is relatively conserved across species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is largely consistent with reports of elevated evolutionary rates for ejaculate proteins in diverse taxonomic groups (42, 5457).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the male-specific genes, eight of them have discernable orthologs only in the close relative P. napi, whereas three others have no orthologs at all, suggesting either their rapid evolution or recent gene formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the majority of the male-specific genes without an identified ortholog or with an ortholog just in P. napi (nine genes; 72.7%) are part of the spermatophore inner matrix (Table S5), suggesting that this region of the spermatophore may be a hotspot for the evolution of SFPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to sequence-level substitutions, evolutionary diversity can also arise from gene duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we estimated rates of gene duplication for spermatophore constituents through reconstructed phylogenetic trees within the Lepidoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that female-expressed genes with products that are found in the spermatophore are duplicated at a significantly higher rate than a set of genes randomly chosen from the P. rapae transcriptome (Table 1 and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, all six female proteases found in the spermatophore exhibited evidence of butterfly-specific gene duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the female proteases are found in the same phylogenetic tree and originated from recent duplication events, either specific to butterflies or even potentially specific to the Pieris genus (Fig S4 and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to their recent origin, these proteases appear to be diverging rapidly, exhibiting elevated dN/dS ratios (comp83827_c1 dN/dS = 0.70, comp91676_c0 dN/dS = 0.39) compared with genes encoding muscle proteins (dN/dS  0.07 ± 0.07) (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, spermatophore genes expressed in males or both sexes were not duplicated more often than random controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many animal groups produce ejaculates that form distinct structural regions within or outside the female reproductive tract (e.g., copulatory plugs and spermatophores), and these structures are thought to influence reproductive outcomes through their unique functional properties (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the spermatophore of the butterfly P. rapae to characterize how a structurally complex ejaculate is formed, how it provides key reproductive functions, and how its protein components evolve between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first provided evidence that the spermatophore envelope and inner matrix are composed of distinct protein profiles (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that, in addition to being structurally complex, the lepidopteran spermatophore is also biochemically partitioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding represents an advance in our understanding of ejaculate function, because it provides an important example of how biochemical heterogeneity can produce structural complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of evolutionary dynamics, such heterogeneous ejaculates would allow the proteins from distinct regions to evolve more independently in response to different selective pressures, because they may occupy distinct biochemical niches during reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional analysis showed that the constituent proteins of each spermatophore region are stored in distinct subsections of the male reproductive tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding supports a model of spermatophore assembly, in which the envelope material is transferred first followed by the inner matrix and then sperm (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also raises the question of whether ejaculate proteins are expressed specifically in those sections or alternatively, if males slowly modify the transcriptional profile of their accessory glands to produce the divergent protein blends observed within the reproductive tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction has important implications for how males might strategically tailor their ejaculates to affect spermatophore composition and structure, perhaps in response to social experience or environment (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, males may be unable to readily alter their relative investment in spermatophore envelopes if these proteins are already produced and stored in the male simplex well in advance of mating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The focus of our empirical approach on structural complexity also drove more careful examination of particular morphological interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, we were motivated to better understand the spermatophore envelope, which represents an important reproductive interface between male- and female-expressed proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revealed that the indigestible portion of the envelope is a proteinaceous structure largely composed of two proline-rich proteins, PRSP1 and PRSP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the envelope is insoluble, even under biologically extreme proteolytic conditions, but was dissolved by harsh oxidizers, which suggests that its structural toughness is the result of covalent bonding between the repetitive PRSP domains, similar to the structural underpinnings of plant cell walls (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our examination of the physical origins of spermatophore constituents also led us to a surprising finding: females are far more involved in spermatophore formation than has been previously appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found large amounts of female-produced proteases throughout the spermatophore, making up 25% and 11% of soluble protein in the envelope and inner matrix, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteases are expressed at extraordinary levels in virgin females (38), suggesting that females may concentrate them in the bursa and/or reproductive tract before mating in an attempt to incorporate them into the spermatophore either during formation or shortly thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteases may then increase the rate of digestion of the spermatophore material, particularly the inner matrix, and may also assist the signum in breaching the outer envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding alters the decades-old interpretation of spermatophores as strictly male contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, previous studies have often quantified spermatophore mass as a measure of male reproductive investment (30, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work suggests that some nontrivial proportion of spermatophore mass is actually contributed by the female and may, therefore, have been misattributed as male investment in past work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is still unclear which selective pressures led to the evolution of the spermatophore structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a malefemale interface, several hypotheses are possible and are not all mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first hypothesis is that the envelope could provide a simple mechanical function to keep ejaculate contents from leaving the female tract; however, females receive the spermatophore in a closed-end pouchthe bursa copulatrixand leakage is not observed during the hour before the envelope hardens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second hypothesis emphasizes the spermatophore as a cooperative gift to the female.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the spermatophore envelope together with the female digestive traits (signum and the proteases) lead to optimal timing of release of the nutrients to be used by the female for her and her progenys benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third hypothesis instead focuses on the opportunity for sexual conflict, in which the envelopes resistance to digestion enables males to delay female remating and thereby, sire a larger proportion of her offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such sexual antagonism, spermatophore traits leading to slower digestion would be favored in social systems in which females have greater opportunity to mate with multiple males (i.e., polyandry) (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sexual conflict over female remating rate could have played an important role in the origin and subsequent evolution of these unusual proline-rich envelope proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this latter hypothesis, prior research in Heliconius butterflies has shown that polyandrous butterflies have thicker spermatophore envelopes than monandrous species (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sexual conflict would also imply that females evolve to counter these delays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, prior research indicates that the signum, a mechanical device for breaching the spermatophore envelope, tends to be maintained in polyandrous Lepidoptera species and lost in monandrous lineages (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extreme proteolytic contribution of females also raises the possibility that these proteins are locked in a coevolutionary arms race with male-derived spermatophore proteins, driven by sexual conflict over female remating rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the evolutionary rates of these male and female proteins are driven by sexual conflict vs. cooperative coevolution is an exciting avenue for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our focus on the biochemistry of spermatophore structure may offer inroads into the debate about spermatophores as paternal investment vs. mating effort (6163).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This debate hinges on the relative timing of fertilization vs. uptake of male resources by eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In species where a male fertilizes the same eggs that he provisions with ejaculate resources, the spermatophore can be considered paternal investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, males may often provision eggs that are destined to be fertilized by a subsequent male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stepfather situations (62) have led researchers to question whether spermatophores are indeed parental effort or should rather be considered simply mating effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the outer envelope is enriched with indigestible PRSPs, which delay female access to the soluble inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural arrangement extends the time that a male can fertilize a females eggs, but it also delays her uptake of the potentially nutritive inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the structural strategy adopted by P. rapae males seems to separate the initiation of fertilization from the timing of resource uptake from the spermatophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, spermatophores in this species may more frequently function as mating effort, particularly in populations where females mate readily again after spermatophore digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in populations with lower remating rates, spermatophore resources may also contribute to paternal investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this scenario need not be more generally the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spermatophores with structural phenotypes that make egg-provisioning resources more immediately available could favor parental investment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach would enable evidence for such strategies to be more readily identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we urge more careful consideration of the structural and biochemical complexity of male ejaculates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such work is likely to uncover insights into reproductive interactions between the sexes and highlight previously unconsidered axes of reproductive adaptation (64, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How males and females collaborate and quarrel over ejaculate processing in both space and time may lead us to better understand the control of reproductive tissues and by extension, the origin of reproductive dysfunctions that play critical roles in infertility, individual fitness, and reproductive isolation during speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal_Stocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
P. rapae individuals were sampled from a continuous laboratory colony established in 2012 from individuals collected in Rochester, Pennsylvania (40°4445 N, 80°945 W) and supplemented periodically by individuals collected from the same site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals were raised in insect growth chambers under controlled climatic conditions (24 °C, 60% relative humidity, 16-h light:8-h dark photoperiod).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larvae were reared on kale grown in greenhouses at the University of Pittsburgh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Dissection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Live animals had their head, thorax, and abdomen separated and immediately spread open in butterfly Ringers (66) to expose tissues of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a tissue-specific view of protein expression, we dissected several tissues from males and females: female bursa copulatrix (virgin), testes, accessory glands, vas deferens, and mating duct (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beginning at the male genital opening, the mating duct simplex is the first gland/tissue followed by the mating duct duplex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a typical P. rapae male, the whole mating duct is 10 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving distally, the accessory glands are next after the bifurcation of the vas deferens leading to the testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessory glands were subdivided into proximal and distal segments based on appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When dissected into butterfly Ringers solution, the contents of the proximal segment became cloudy, whereas the distal segment remained transparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same phenomenon happened when dissecting out the mating duct, with the duplex becoming cloudy, whereas the simplex remained transparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, used both visual appearance and morphology to divide the mating duct into duplex (distal from the genital opening) and simplex (proximal from the genital opening).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spermatophores retrieved from females 2 h after matingthe time at which they are solidified and adopt their typical shape in the female reproductive tractwere carefully rinsed in PBS one time as a whole after their removal from the bursa copulatrix and dissected into two different parts: the envelope and the inner matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were stored at 20 °C in Laemmli buffer [4% SDS, 120 mM TrisHCl, 0.02% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue] until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hemolymph_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individuals were decapitated and placed into a 500-L Eppendorf tube with a perforated bottom tip, which was inserted into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Eppendorf tube was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain 35 L clear hemolymph per individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hemolymph was stored in Laemmli buffer at 20 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Identification_by_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissues were stored in butterfly Ringers before being homogenized with a pestle in Laemmli sample buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies), and equal amounts of protein for each tissue were run for a short time on SDS/PAGE until they migrated a few millimeters into a 12% resolving gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel bands containing all proteins were excised from the gel and processed by the Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Center of the University of Pittsburgh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In-Gel_Trypsin_Digestion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out as previously described (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excised gel bands were washed with HPLC water and destained with 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate until no visible staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel pieces were dehydrated with 100% ACN and reduced with 10 mM DTT at 56 °C for 1 h followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 45 min in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel pieces were then again dehydrated with 100% ACN to remove excess DTT and IAA, rehydrated with 20 ng/L trypsin/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and digested overnight at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant tryptic peptides were extracted with 70% ACN/5% formic acid, vacuum dried, and reconstituted in 18 L 0.1% formic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tandem_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteolytic peptides from gel-based trypsin digestion were analyzed by a nanoflow reverse-phased liquid chromatography tandem MS. Tryptic peptides were loaded onto a C18 column (PicoChip column packed with 10.5 cm Reprosil C18, 3 m 120 Å chromatography media with a 75-m i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  column and a 15-m tip; New Objective, Inc.) using a Dionex HPLC system (Dionex Ultimate 3000; ThermoFisher Scientific) operated with a double-split system to provide an in-column nanoflow rate (300 nL/min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid for the initial mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in ACN for the subsequent mobile phase B. Peptides were eluted off the column using a 52-min gradient (240% B in 42 min, 4095% B in 1 min, 95% B for 1 min, 2% B for 8 min) and injected into a linear ion trap MS (LTQ-XL; ThermoFisher Scientific) through electrospray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The LTQ XL was operated in a date-dependent MS/MS mode, in which each full MS spectrum [acquired at 30,000 automatic gain control (AGC) target, 50 ms maximum ion accumulation time, and precursor ion selection range of m/z 3001,800] was followed by MS/MS scans of the five most abundant molecular ions determined from full MS scan (acquired based on the setting of 1,000 signal threshold, 10,000 AGC target, 100 ms maximum accumulation time, 2.0 Da isolation width, 30 ms activation time, and 35% normalized collision energy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic exclusion was enabled to minimize redundant selection of peptides previously selected by collision-induced dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Peptide_Identification_by_Database_Search  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MS/MS spectra were searched using the MASCOT search engine (Version 2.4.0; Matrix Science Ltd) against the previously published translated transcriptome of P. rapae (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following modifications were used: static modification of cysteine (carboxyamidomethylation, +57.05 Da) and variable modification of methionine (oxidation, +15.99Da).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass tolerance was set at 1.4 Da for the precursor ions and 0.5 Da for the fragment ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide identifications were filtered using PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms with a protein threshold cutoff of 99% and peptide threshold cutoff of 95% implemented in Scaffold (Proteome Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were identified with a 99% probability and by a minimum of two peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using those thresholds, 341 proteins were identified across all samples, including 117 proteins that were identified by five peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized spectral counts were used as a semiquantitative measure of protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex specificity was assessed by computing normalized expression values proportions for each gene from our previous transcriptomic study (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bursa copulatrix and the female reproductive tract were considered as female-specific tissues, whereas the male reproductive tract was considered male-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gene was considered sex-specific when the mean of its expression in sex-specific tissues represented more than 85% of its total expression across all nine tissues sampled in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hemolymph_Subtraction_from_MS_Data_and_Merger_of_Proteins_Isoforms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of hemolymph infiltration during the dissection of tissues of interest, all proteins identified by MS in the hemolymph were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If multiple proteins encoded by the same gene were identified, the maximum value for each tissue type was kept to create only one entry per protein/gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By subtracting hemolymph proteins and duplicates, 144 proteins remained in the dataset across all tissues, 63 being present in the spermatophore (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from testes and vas deferens showed a negligible contribution to the spermatophore and were not further considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Tissue_Contributions_to_the_Spermatophore  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contributions to the spermatophore from five male and female tissuesthe distal and proximal accessory glands, duplex and simplex mating ducts, and the bursa copulatrixwere quantitatively estimated using a likelihood framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein abundances of a spermatophore part (envelope or inner matrix) were represented as a row vector, s. The protein abundances of each tissue were represented in a matrix T, with rows as tissues and proteins as columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal was to estimate a weight for each tissue to represent its proportional contribution to a finished spermatophore part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weights were represented in a row vector w, with columns that correspond to the rows of T (tissues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weights were not permitted to take negative values, because we do not expect tissues to subtract proteins from the spermatophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rows of T and s were normalized to have identical sums, so that weights reflect proportional contribution to the spermatophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted protein composition of a spermatophore part was modeled as the product of the relative weights on each tissue (w) and the protein abundances in the five contributing tissues (T):s=wT+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The error term () was modeled as the normal distribution with zero mean and SD as a freely estimated parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likelihood function was defined as the probability of the residual values given the estimated error distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five tissue weights and the SD of the error were jointly optimized by numerically maximizing the likelihood function through the bbmle package in R (Ben Bolker; R Development Core Team, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marginal SEs for each tissue weight were used to calculate the probability of that weight being greater than zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a complementary approach, we estimated the weights using nonnegative least squares (NNLS) through the nnls package in R (Katharine M. Mullen, University of California, Los Angeles, and Ivo H. M. van Stokkum, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NNLS returned the same weights as the maximum likelihood estimates; however, NNLS does not yield SEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_the_Amino_Acid_Composition_of_the_Envelope_and_the_Inner_Matrix_of_the_Spermatophore  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A pool of eight spermatophore envelopes was boiled in 4% SDS at 95 °C for 1 h and rinsed five times in deionized water to keep only the insoluble fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pools of envelopes and corresponding inner matrices were then lyophilized and massed before submission to the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of Texas A&M University to determine their amino acid composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was transferred to a hydrolysis tube, and 200 µL 6 N HCl and 50 nmol internal standards were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same procedure was performed on the assay blank: two 50-nmol standards and a human serum albumin control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples, standards, blank, and control were subjected to 22 h of hydrolysis at 100 °C in 200 µL 6 N HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the hydrolysis, 10 µL were taken from all hydrolysates, dried down, resuspended in 100 µL 0.4 M borate buffer for derivatization, and transferred to the Agilent G1367E autosampler for automated derivatization and loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Agilent 1260 HPLC analyzes all samples by precolumn derivatization of the amino acids with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and 9-fluoromethyl-chloroformate (FMOC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OPA reacts with primary amino acids, and FMOC reacts with secondary amino acids (proline).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both reagents react rapidly and quantitatively and give highly fluorescent and UV-absorbing isoindole derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derivatized amino acids are separated by reverse-phase HPLC and detected by UV absorbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, asparagine and glutamine are deamidated to their respective acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results for those residues are then reported as Asx and Glx that combine the amounts for both the amide and the acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tryptophan and cysteine are destroyed by the acid hydrolysis and are not quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the acid used for hydrolysis is typically contaminated with glycine residues, and therefore, the results for this amino acid are not reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanomolar data were converted to micrograms to give an estimate of the protein mass in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because not all amino acids were quantified, protein masses are underestimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homologous genes searches were performed with BLASTP using protein sequences identified by MS as queries against protein databases of the following species: six Lepidoptera species: P. rapae translated ORFs (our data), B. mori (silkworm.genomics.org.cn/; Bombyx_mori.Bmor1.21.pep.all.fa), D. plexippus (monarchbase.umassmed.edu/; Dp_geneset_OGS1_pep.fasta), H. melpomene (www.butterflygenome.org/; heliconius_melpomene_v1.1_primaryScaffs_Protein.faa), M. sexta (agripestbase.org/manduca/; Manduca_sexta_OGS2_20140407_proteins.fa), and Plutella xylostella (gigadb.org/dataset/100078; P.xylostella.pep.fasta); two Diptera: D. melanogaster (flybase.org/; dmel-all-translation-r5.57.fasta) and Aedes aegypti (Liverpool strain; https://www.vectorbase.org/; Aedes-aegypti-Liverpool_PEPTIDES_AaegL3.1.fa); and two additional insects, Apis mellifera (hymenopteragenome.org/beebase/; amel_OGSv3.2_pep.fa) and Tribolium castaneum (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Tribolium_castaneum/protein/; protein.fasta.gz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLASTP outputs were then parsed to cluster homologous protein sequences together (E-value threshold of 1e10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple sequence alignments of clusters were performed using Clustal Omega (68), and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using PhyML (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Branch support values were computed using approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) statistics (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplicates for our genes of interest were accounted for when P. rapae homologs were found in the same clade containing our focus gene and Lepidoptera sequences only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control genes for the determination of the proportion of duplicated genes were chosen randomly within the whole transcriptome of P. rapae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of dN/dS were determined using pairwise alignments of P. rapae and P. napi sequences as an input for the codeml program (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control genes for the dN/dS estimates were muscle genes previously identified in the bursa copulatrix (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
