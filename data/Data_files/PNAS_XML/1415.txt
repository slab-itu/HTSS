title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Self-organized criticality and pattern emergence through the lens of tropical geometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A simple geometric continuous model of self-organized criticality (SOC) is proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model belongs to the field of tropical geometry and appears as a scaling limit of the classical sandpile model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that our observation will connect the study of SOC and pattern formation to other fields (such as algebraic geometry, topology, string theory, and many practical applications) where tropical geometry has already been successfully used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropical geometry, an established field in pure mathematics, is a place where string theory, mirror symmetry, computational algebra, auction theory, and so forth meet and influence one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we report on our discovery of a tropical model with self-organized criticality (SOC) behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model is continuous, in contrast to all known models of SOC, and is a certain scaling limit of the sandpile model, the first and archetypical model of SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe how our model is related to pattern formation and proportional growth phenomena and discuss the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in several contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our aim in this context is to present an idealized tropical toy model (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turing reaction-diffusion model), requiring further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Definition_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A dynamical system is a self-organized critical (SOC) system if it is slowly driven by an external force, exhibits avalanches, and has power law correlated interactions (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, section 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By an avalanche, we mean a sudden recurrent modification of the internal energy of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SOC systems, avalanches display scale invariance over energy and over time (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many ordinary critical phenomena near continuous phase transition (which requires fine tuning) display nontrivial power law correlations with a cutoff associated to the cluster size (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Ising model shows power law correlations only for specific parameters, while an SOC system, behaving statistically in an analogous manner, achieves the critical state merely by means of a small external force, without fine-tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Sandpile_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concept of SOC was introduced in the seminal papers of Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld (5, 6), where they put forward the archetypical example of an SOC system: the Sandpile Model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a highly idealized cellular automaton designed to display spatiotemporal scale invariance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other toy models in physics (e.g., the Ising model), a sandpile automaton does not attempt to apprehend the actual interactions of a physical system exhibiting SOC (such as a real sandpile).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sandpile cellular automaton is rather a mathematical model that reproduces the statistical behavior of very diverse dynamical systems: It is descriptive at the level of global emergent phenomena without necessarily corresponding to such systems at the local reductionist level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Imagine a large domain on a checkered plane; each vertex of this grid is determined by two integer coordinates (i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will write Z2 to denote the integral square lattice formed by all pairs of integers (i,j) in the Euclidean plane R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our dynamical system will evolve inside , which is the intersection of Z2 with a large convex figure in the plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this paper, we use the word graph to indicate a collection of line segments (called edges) that connect points (called vertices) to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definition_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sandpile model consists of a grid inside a convex domain  on which we place grains of sand at each vertex; the number of grains on the vertex (i,j) is denoted by (i,j) (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formally, a state is an integer-valued function :Z0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We call a vertex (i,j) unstable whenever there are four or more grains of sand at (i,j)that is, whenever (i,j)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution rule is as follows: Any unstable vertex (i,j) topples spontaneously by sending one grain of sand to each of its four neighbors (i,j+1),(i,j1),(i1,j),(i+1,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sand that falls outside  disappears from the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable vertices cannot be toppled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an initial state , we will denote by ° the stable state reached after all possible topplings have been performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a remarkable and well-known fact that the final state ° does not depend on the order of topplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final state ° is called the relaxation of the initial state .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bak and his collaborators proposed the following experiment: Take any stable state 0, and perturb it at random by adding a grain of sand at a random location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denote the relaxation of the perturbed state by 1, and repeat this procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a sequence of randomly chosen vertices (ik,jk) gives rise to a sequence of stable states by the rule k+1=(k+ikjk)°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relaxation process (k+ikjk)k+1 is called an avalanche ; its size is the number of vertices that topple during the relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a long enough sequence of uniformly chosen vertices (ik,jk), we can compute the distribution for the sizes of the corresponding avalanches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let N(s) be the number of avalanches of size s; then, the main experimental observation of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 is thatlogN(s)=logs+c.In other words, the sizes of avalanches satisfy a power law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2, we have reproduced this result with 1.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has only very recently been given a rigorous mathematical proof using a deep analysis of random trees on the 2D integral lattice Z2 (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Definition_3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recurrent state is a stable state appearing infinitely often, with probability one, in the above dynamical evolution of the sandpile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, the recurrent states are exactly those which can be obtained as a relaxation of a state 3 (pointwise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of recurrent states forms an Abelian group (9), and its identity exhibits a fractal structure in the scaling limit (Fig 3); unfortunately, this fact has resisted a rigorous explanation so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main point of this paper is to exhibit fully analogous phenomena in a continuous system (which is not a cellular automaton) within the field of tropical geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An advantage of the tropical model is that, while it has SOC behavior, just as the classical model does, its states look much less chaotic; thus, we say that the tropical model has no combinatorial explosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Mathematical_Modeling_for_Proportional_Growth_and_Pattern_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dichotomy between continuous mathematical models and discrete cellular automata has an important example in developmental biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A basic continuous model of pattern formation was offered by Alan Turing in 1952 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He suggested that two or more homogeneously distributed chemical substances, termed morphogens, with different diffusing rates and chemical activity, can self-organize into spatial patterns of different concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This theory was confirmed decades later and can be applied, for example, to modeling the patterns of fish and lizard skin (11, 12) or of seashells pigmentation (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the discrete modeling side, the most famous model is the Game of Life developed by Conway in 1970 (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A state of this 2D system consists of live and dead cells that function according to simple rules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any live cell dies if there are fewer than two or more than three live neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any dead cell becomes alive if there are three live neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A very careful control of the initial state produces oscillators and spaceships that certainly look fascinating but seem not to be related to realistic biological models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a strong philosophical conclusion of the Game of Life is that extremely simple rules can produce behavior of arbitrary complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more realistic cellular automaton has recently been derived from the continuous reaction-diffusion model of Turing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15, the transformation of the juvenile white ocelli skin patterns of the lizard Timon lepidus into a green and black labyrinth was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the authors presented the skin squamae of lizard as a hexagonal grid, where the color of each individual cell depended on the color states of neighboring positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cell automaton could successfully generate patterns coinciding with those on the skin of adult lizards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pattern formation is related to an important problem in developmental biology: how to explain proportional growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear why different parts of animal or human bodies grow at approximately the same rate from birth to adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sandpile simulations provide a qualitative toy model as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Example_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early on, it was observed experimentally that sandpiles have fractal structure in their spatial degrees of freedom (see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This example exhibits the phenomenon of proportional growth and scale invariance: If we rescale tiles to have area 1N and let N go to infinity, then the picture converges in the weak- sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 and references therein.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the patches and a linear pattern in this fractal picture were explained in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1719 using discrete superharmonic functions and Apollonian circle packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dhar and Sadhu (20) established certain 2D sandpile models where the size of newly formed patterns depends on the number of sand grains added on the top, but the number and shape of the patterns remain the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, they also proposed a 3D model that also forms proportionally growing patterns; these patterns look like the head, thorax, and abdomen of real larva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The perspective of our paper suggests that continuous tropical geometry should have consequences in the study of proportional growth modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conjecture that tropical functions should appear as gradients of growth (compare figure 3 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 and our Fig 5; see also section 2.5 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Tropical_Geometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropicalization can be thought of as the study of geometric and algebraic objects on the loglog scale§ in the limit when the base of the logarithm is very large.¶ Let us start by considering the most basic mathematical operations: addition and multiplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the logarithmic change of coordinates and with the base of the logarithm becoming infinitely large, multiplication becomes addition and addition becomes taking the maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, definex+tylogt(tx+ty)x×tylogt(txty)for x,y positive and then, taking the limit as t tends to +, setTrop(x+y)limt+x+ty=max(x,y),Trop(x×y)limt+x×ty=x+y.Tropical numbers are thus defined as the set of ordinary real numbers (together with {}; i.e., TR{}) and with tropical addition max(x,y) and multiplication x+y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tropical numbers form a semiring: All of the usual rules of algebra hold in T with the exception of additive inverses (the neutral element for addition is ; additive inverses are missing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This mathematical structure simplifies some computations, and several optimization problems are solved efficiently in this way; this is a growing area of applied research in the current decade [it has been used in auctions for the Bank of England (25), for biochemical networks (26), and for Dutch railroads, among other things (27)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermodynamics suggests that the tropical limit should be understood as the low temperature limit T0 (or equivalently, as the limit when the Boltzmann constant k vanishes, k0) of the classical algebraic and geometric operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this interpretation of the limit, the relevant change of variables is t=e1kT, where t is the tropical parameter (the base of the logarithm) and T is the temperature (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More relevant to realistic physical systems, tropical functions and tropical algebra appear naturally in statistical physics as the formal limit as k0, and this can be used to analyze frustrated systems like spin ice and spin glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is directly related to the appearance of the tropical degeneration in dimer models (28, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definition_4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let AZ2 be any finite set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tropical polynomial in two variables is a functionTrop(F(x,y))=max(i,j)A(aij+ix+jy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]A tropical polynomial should be thought of the tropicalization of a classical polynomial F(x,y)=(i,j)Aaijxiyj obtained by replacing all of the summations and multiplications by their tropical counterpartsthat is, max and addition, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For an excellent introduction to tropical geometry, we refer the reader to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Tropical_Limit_in_Algebraic_Geometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complex algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies geometric objects inside complex Euclidean spaces Cn that arise as zero sets of finite families of polynomials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple example of such an object is an algebraic curve C given by a single polynomial equation in two variablesC:F(x,y)=0,(x,y)C2,F(x,y)=(i,j)Aaijxiyj.Here A is a finite set of pairs of positive integers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of F is the maximal total power i+j of all of the monomials xiyj appearing in Fnamely, d=max(i,j)A(i+j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curve C is a 2D object despite its name (for two real dimensions is the same as one complex dimension).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A nonsingular complex curve C={F(x,y)=0} of degree d=deg(F) is a Riemann surface of genus g=12(d1)(d2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the usual lines (d=1) and quadrics (d=2) are topological 2-spheres, while cubics (d=3, also called elliptic curves), are tori.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The geometric counterpart of the tropicalization is as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a complex algebraic curve Ct defined by a polynomialFt(x,y)=(i,j)Aijtaijxiyj=0,|ij|=1,we call the amoeba At the image of Ct under the map logt(x,y)=(logt|x|,logt|y|), Atlogt(Ct).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limit of the amoebas At as t+ is called Trop(C), the tropicalization of Ct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The limit Trop(C) can be described entirely in terms of the tropical polynomial Trop(F) (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact can be proved by noticing that on the linearity regions of Trop(F(x,y)), one monomial in Ft dominates all of the others, and therefore, Ft cannot be zero, and consequently, we conclude that the limit Trop(C) is precisely the set of points (x,y) in the plane where the (3D) graph of the functionTrop(F(x,y))=max(i,j)A(aij+ix+jy)is not smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This set of points is known as the corner locus of Trop(F(x,y)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we define the tropical plane curve as the corner locus of a tropical polynomial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in Fig 6, the tropical degeneration Trop(C) of a complex curve C is essentially the graph of the curve depicted in a logtlogt scale for t very large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not very hard to verify that every tropical curve Trop(C) in the plane is a finite balanced graph, all of whose edges have rational slopes, such that at every vertex, the (weighted) directions of the primitive vectors in every direction cancel out (this is called the balancing condition and is akin to Kirchhoffs law for electrical circuits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, every such balanced graph on the plane appears as a tropical algebraic curve Trop(C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, it may be a good moment to point out that one can observe small tropical curves in Fig 4, where the final state of a sandpile is depicted; this already points toward a relationship between SOC and tropical geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

String_Theory__Mirror_Symmetry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropical geometry is intimately related to the interaction between algebraic geometry and string theory that occurs in the mirror symmetry program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a tropical 2D surface B, we can use the tropical structure to produce a pair (XB,XB) of mirror manifolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motivated M. Kontsevich to predict that counting tropical curves on B could be used for the calculation of GromovWitten invariants (which count holomorphic complex curves) in the A-side of mirror symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first example of such a calculation done from a rigorous mathematical perspective was accomplished by Mikhalkin (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This perspective has been expanded by Gross and Siebert (34) in their program to understand mirror symmetry from a mathematical viewpoint using tropical geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us also mention that the dichotomy between continuous and discrete models in our paper (already appearing in the biological models) has an important analogue in string theory: Iqbat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) have argued that, when we probe spacetime beyond the scale  and below Plancks scale, the resulting fluctuations of spacetime can be computed with a classical cellular automaton (a melting crystal) representing quantum gravitational foam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their theory is a three-tier system whose levels are classical geometry (Kähler gravity), tropical geometry (toric manifolds), and cellular automata (discrete melting crystals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theory that we propose in this paper is also a three-tier system whose levels are classical complex algebraic geometry, tropical geometry (analytic tropical curves), and cellular automata (sandpiles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems not to be a coincidence and suggests deep connections between our model for SOC and their model for quantum gravitational foam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tropical_Curves_in_Sandpiles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the appearance of tropical geometry in sandpiles, consider the toppling function H(i,j) defined as follows: Given an initial state  and its relaxation °, the value of H(i,j) equals the number of times that there was a toppling at the vertex (i,j) in the process of taking  to °.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discrete Laplacian of H is defined by the net flow of sand, H(i,j)H(i1,j)+H(i+1,j)+H(i,j1)+H(i,j+1)4H(i,j).The toppling function is clearly nonnegative on  and vanishes at the boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function H completely determines the final state ° by the formula:°(i,j)=(i,j)+H(i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It can be shown by induction that the toppling function H satisfies the least action principle: If (i,j)+F(i,j)3 is stable, then F(i,j)H(i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ostojic (36) noticed that H(i,j) is a piecewise quadratic function in the context of example 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consider a state , which consists of three grains of sand at every vertex, except at a finite family of pointsP={p1=(i1,j1),,pr=(ir,jr)}where we have four grains of sand:3+p1++pr=3+P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]The state ° and the evolution of the relaxation can be described by means of tropical geometry [the final picture (D) of Fig 7 is a tropical curve].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was discovered by Caracciolo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37), while a rigorous mathematical theory to prove this fact has been given by Kalinin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38), which we review presently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a remarkable fact that, in this case, the toppling function H(i,j) is piecewise linear (after passing to the scaling limit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prove this, one considers the family FP of functions on  that are (i) piecewise linear with integral slopes, (ii) nonnegative over  and zero at its boundary, (iii) concave, and (iv) not smooth at every point pi of P. Let FP be the pointwise minimum of functions in FP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, FPH by the Least Action Principle [since FP0,FP(pi)less_than0].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lemma_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the scaling limit, H=FP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that the toppling function H for Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 is piecewise linear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, applying Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, we obtain that ° is equal to 3 everywhere but the locus where H=0that is, its corner locus, namely an -tropical curve (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Definition_5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An -tropical series is a piecewise linear function on  given byF(x,y)=min(i,j)A(aij+ix+jy),where the set A is not necessarily finite and F|=0 (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An -tropical curve is the set where F is not smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each -tropical curve is a locally finite graph satisfying the balancing condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Remark_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropical curves consist of edges, such that to each direction of the edges there corresponds a line-shaped pattern (a string) such as the one encountered in Fig 4; these patterns can be computed (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In simulations, we have observed that these strings act like the renormalization group and, thus, ensure the proportional growth of the quadratic patches in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same occurs in other sandpile models with proportional growth, which suggests that tropical geometry is a less reductionist tool than cellular automata to study this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


The_Tropical_Sandpile_(TS)_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we define a model, the TS, reflecting structural changes when a sandpile evolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The definition of this dynamical system is inspired by the mathematics of the previous section; TS is not a cellular automaton, but it exhibits SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamical system lives on the convex set =[0,N]×[0,N]; we will consider  to be a very large square.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The input data of the system are a large but finite collection of points P={p1,,pr} with integer coordinates on the square .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each state of the system is an -tropical series (and the associated -tropical curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial state for the dynamical system is F0=0, and its final state is the function FP defined previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice that the definition of FP, while inspired by sandpile theory, uses no sandpiles or cellular automata whatsoever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermediate states {Fk}k=1,,r satisfy the property that Fk is not smooth at p1,p2,,pk; that is, the corresponding tropical curve passes through these points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In other words, the tropical curve is first attracted to the point p1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once it manages to pass through p1 for the first time, it continues to try to pass through {p1,p2}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once it manages to pass through {p1,p2}, it proceeds in the same manner toward {p1,p2,p3}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is repeated until the curve passes through all of P={p1,,pr}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We will call the modification Fk1Fk the kth avalanche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It occurs as follows: To the state Fk1 we apply the tropical operators Gp1,Gp2,,Gpk;Gp1, in cyclic order until the function stops changing; the discreteness of the coordinates of the points in P ensures that this process is finite.Again, as before, while sandpile-inspired, the operators Gp are defined entirely in terms of tropical geometry without mention of sandpiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is a dichotomy: Each application of an operator Gp either does something to change the shape of the current tropical curve (in this case, Gp is called an active operator) or does nothing, leaving the curve intact (if p already belongs to the curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Definition_6  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The size of the kth avalanche is the number of distinct active operators Gpi used to take the system from the self-critical state Fk1 to the next self-critical state Fk, divided by k. In particular, the size sk of the kth avalanche is a number between 0 and 1, 0sk1, and it estimates the proportional area of the picture that changed during the avalanche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the previous example, as the number of points in P grows and becomes comparable to the number of lattice points in , the TS exhibits a phase transition going into spatial SOC (fractality).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides evidence in favor of SOC on the TS model, but there is a far more subtle spatiotemporal SOC behavior that we will exhibit in the following paragraphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the ordering of the points from the first to the rth is important for the specific details of the evolution of the system, the systems statistical behavior and final state are insensitive to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is called an Abelian property, which was studied extensively in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42 for discrete dynamical systems (Abelian networks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model suggests studying continuous dynamical systems with this Abelian property, such as, for example, Abelian networks with nodes on the plane, a continuous set of states, and an evolution rule depending on the coordinates of the nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the Abelian property is equivalent to the least action principle (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SOC_in_the_Tropical_World  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TS dynamics exhibit slow driving avalanching (in the sense of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, p. 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once the tropical dynamical system stops after r steps, we can ask ourselves what the statistical behavior of the number N(s) of avalanches of size s is like.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We posit that the tropical dynamical system exhibits spatiotemporal SOC behavior; that is, we have a power law:logN(s)=logs+c.To confirm this, we have performed experiments in the supercomputing clusters ABACUS and Xiuhcoatl at Cinvestav (Mexico City); the code is available at https://github.com/elaldogs/tropicalsandpiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 8, we see the graph of logN(s) vs. logs for the tropical (piecewise linear, continuous) sandpile dynamical system; the resulting experimental  in this case was 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion_and_Further_Directions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have obtained a piecewise-linear (continuous, tropical) model to study statistical aspects of nonlinear phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As tropical geometry is highly developed, it seems reasonable to believe that it will provide new reductionist explanations for physical nonlinear systems in the future (as well as providing a tool for studying proportional growth phenomena in biology and elsewhere), as has already happened with nonlinear aspects of algebraic geometry and mirror symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we list open questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the point of view of real physical phenomena, the TS provides a class of mathematical and modeling tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some possible directions for further research are as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direction_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If  is a polygon with sides of rational slope, then each -tropical curve C can be obtained as the corner locus of FP for a certain set P of points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, one considers a (finite) set P of points that all belong to C and cover C rather densely, meaning that every point in C is very close to a point in P (at a distance less than a very small ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is shown in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41, the corner locus of FP is an -tropical curve passing through P that solves a certain Steiner-type problem: minimizing the tropical symplectic area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the set P is huge in this construction, an open question remains: Can we find a small set P={p1,,pr} (where r is approximately equal to the number of faces of C) such that C is the corner locus of FP?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We thank an anonymous referee for this question.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direction_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The operators Gp can be lifted to the algebraic setting, but for now, we can do this only in fields of characteristic two (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is it possible to lift Gp in characteristic zero (the complex realm)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, we expect that this difficulty can be alleviated by a mirror symmetry interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The issue is due to the symplectic nature of Gp: Indeed, -tropical curves naturally appear as tropical symplectic degenerations (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When  is not a rational polygon, one should take into account noncommutative geometry (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the mirror analog of Gp in the complex world?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that there should exist an operator Gp* acting on strings, and through this we expect power-law statistics for a mirror notion of the areas of the faces of -tropical curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closely related to this, in analogy to the work of Iqbar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35), we conjecture that the partition function obtained by summing over statistical mechanical configurations of sandpiles should have, via mirror symmetry, an interpretation as a path integral in terms of Kähler geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical geometry should play the role of toric geometry in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the precise geometric model in this situation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developments in this direction would allow a new renormalization group interpretation of SOC (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46 and 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direction_3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rastelli and Känel studied nanometer-sized 3D islands formed during epitaxial growth of semiconductors appearing as faceted pyramids that seem to be modeled by tropical series from an inspection of Fig 5 in this paper and figure 3 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be very interesting to prove that this is so and to study the consequences of this observation to the modeling of the morphology of such phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This may not be totally unrelated to allometry in biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is it possible that the gradient slope model, as in section 2.5 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22, could be piecewise linear, and the corner locus slopes could prescribe the type and speed of growth for tissues?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direction_4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study the statistical distributions for the coefficients of the tropical series in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explain why the slopes are mostly of directions (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is it possible that a concentration measure phenomenon takes place and that such a type of picture appears with probability one?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We thank Lionel Levine for this question.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#
