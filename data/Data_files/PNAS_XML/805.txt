Lipophilic siRNA targets albumin in situ and promotes bioavailability, tumor penetration, and carrier-free gene silencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has the capacity to silence traditionally undruggable targets, but in vivo delivery barriers limit clinical translation of siRNA, especially for nonhepatic targets such as solid tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most delivery strategies for RNAi cancer therapies focus on synthetic nanocarriers, but their shortcomings include limited delivery to and variable distribution throughout the target site and low therapeutic indices due to nonspecific, carrier-associated toxicities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diacyl lipid-modified siRNA can leverage albumin as an endogenous carrier, resulting in comprehensively enhanced pharmacokinetic properties that translate to greater quantity and homogeneity of tumor accumulation relative to nanocarriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The albumin-binding siRNA conjugate strategy is synthetically simple and safe at high doses, and thus is a translatable and potentially transformative option for RNAi oncology therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical translation of therapies based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) is hampered by siRNA's comprehensively poor pharmacokinetic properties, which necessitate molecule modifications and complex delivery strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought an alternative approach to commonly used nanoparticle carriers by leveraging the long-lived endogenous serum protein albumin as an siRNA carrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized siRNA conjugated to a diacyl lipid moiety (siRNA-L2), which rapidly binds albumin in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2, in comparison with unmodified siRNA, exhibited a 5.7-fold increase in circulation half-life, an 8.6-fold increase in bioavailability, and reduced renal accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benchmarked against leading commercial siRNA nanocarrier in vivo jetPEI, siRNA-L2 achieved 19-fold greater tumor accumulation and 46-fold increase in per-tumor-cell uptake in a mouse orthotopic model of human triple-negative breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 penetrated tumor tissue rapidly and homogeneously; 30 min after i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection, siRNA-L2 achieved uptake in 99% of tumor cells, compared with 60% for jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, siRNA-L2 achieved a tumor:liver accumulation ratio 40:1 vs. less_than3:1 for jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved pharmacokinetic properties of siRNA-L2 facilitated significant tumor gene silencing for 7 d after two i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proof-of-concept was extended to a patient-derived xenograft model, in which jetPEI tumor accumulation was reduced fourfold relative to the same formulation in the orthotopic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siRNA-L2 tumor accumulation diminished only twofold, suggesting that the superior tumor distribution of the conjugate over nanoparticles will be accentuated in clinical situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal the immense promise of in situ albumin targeting for development of translational, carrier-free RNAi-based cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified_siRNA-L2_Conjugate_Binds_to_Albumin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To synthesize siRNA conjugated to a diacyl lipid moiety (siRNA-L2), a single-stranded amine-modified siRNA was reacted with an NHS ester/dibenzocyclooctyne heterobifunctional cross-linker and subsequently conjugated with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[azido(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000-azide) to generate siRNA-L2 (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fully purified L2 conjugates were obtained by reverse-phase chromatography and purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following purification, sense strand siRNA-L2 was annealed to the corresponding antisense strand (for imaging studies, the antisense strand was Cy5-labeled).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was confirmed that conjugation of the L2 moiety to siRNA did not significantly impact its inherent gene silencing activity, as demonstrated by in vitro knockdown evaluation of siRNA and siRNA-L2 delivered via the commercial transfection reagent in vivo jetPEI (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The albumin-binding capacity of siRNA-L2 was confirmed using a nondenaturing, native PAGE assay (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 alone migrates above the albumin band because it exists as a micellar population at the concentration loaded into the gel (0.05 mg/mL), whereas critical micelle concentration is 1.4 g/mL (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the albumin:siRNA-L2 ratio increases, more siRNA-L2 binds to and migrates with albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unmodified siRNA does not bind to albumin to any degree at any of the concentrations tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of siRNA-L2 binding to albumin via isothermal calorimetry further confirmed spontaneous association of the molecules (dissociation constant was 1.38 M; SI Appendix, Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of L2 conjugates to albumin in the presence of complete serum was also evaluated by gel migration assay, revealing preferential binding to the albumin component of serum (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Albumin_Binding_of_siRNA-L2_Enhances_Circulation_Time_and_Reduces_Rapid_Renal_Clearance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the in vivo pharmacokinetics of siRNA-L2 in comparison with unmodified siRNA, circulation persistence was evaluated in real time using intravital confocal microscopy following i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circulation half-life (t1/2) of siRNA-L2 was 5.7-fold longer than unmodified siRNA (Fig 2 A and B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the area under the curve, a measure of bioavailability of systemically delivered therapeutics, was 8.6-fold greater for the L2-conjugate compared with unmodified oligonucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate in situ albumin binding, serum samples from mice injected with siRNA-L2 (blood collection at 20 min postinjection) were evaluated via PAGE gel migration assay and revealed the presence of albumin-bound siRNA-L2 (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm that albumin acts as a chaperone for siRNA-L2 in vivo and establish that siRNA-L2 association with albumin confers significant improvements in siRNA pharmacokinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support these studies, the time scale of degradation of unmodified and L2-modified oligonucleotides was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA and siRNA-L2 showed resistance to degradation in serum over the pharmacokinetic time frame assessed, and L2 modification imparted a slight improvement in resistance to serum degradation (SI Appendix, Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biodistribution of siRNA vs. siRNA-L2 was evaluated in excised organs at 20 min postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For in vivo studies, siRNA-L2 exhibited increased accumulation in almost all organs, likely due to its prolonged circulation time and reduced clearance into the urine in comparison with unmodified siRNA (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kidneys were the sole exception, showing significantly more unmodified siRNA accumulation (a 1.6-fold greater fraction of the total organ radiance) at this early time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This illustrates that using albumin as a natural carrier for siRNA-L2 reduces acute clearance through the renal route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

siRNA-L2_Outperforms_a_Leading_in_Vivo_Nanoparticle_Carrier_in_Safety_and_Tumor_Accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reduction in kidney accumulation and prolonged circulation half-life of siRNA-L2 motivated a comparison with commercially available in vivo nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is the biodistribution profile of siRNA-L2 in comparison with typical nanocarriers, as high uptake by mononuclear phagocytic system organs (the liver and the spleen) can result in minimal dose accumulation at the target site (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with nanoparticles, siRNA-L2 is expected to avoid this off-target accumulation and to more readily penetrate tumor tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
siRNA-L2 was compared with a leading formulation for nanoparticle-based in vivo nucleic acid delivery, in vivo jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo jetPEI nanoparticles (jetPEI NPs) have been used in clinical trials, and this comparison is therefore a stringent test for therapeutic potential (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before in vivo biodistribution studies, tolerated doses were determined for siRNA-L2 and jetPEI NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 is expected to avoid the toxic side effects associated with high doses of cationic nanocarriers, permitting safe use at higher dosages and potentially expanding the ultimate therapeutic index of siRNA drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toxicity was investigated by monitoring mouse body weight and quantifying blood chemistry markers of liver [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] and kidney [blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine] toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice injected with an siRNA-L2 dose of 10 mg/kg exhibited normal ALT, AST, and BUN levels statistically equivalent to those of saline-injected mice; these mice also showed no change in body weight (SI Appendix, Fig S4 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of jetPEI NPs at a dose of 1 mg/kg created no signs of toxicity, but doubling that dose to 2 mg/kg resulted in mortality for three of four mice and showed marked hepatic and renal toxicity in the single surviving mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that siRNA-L2 is a safer alternative to nanocarrier-based delivery with the potential for a much broader therapeutic index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 mg/kg for in vivo jetPEI and a well-tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg for siRNA-L2 were used in subsequent studies (MTD not determined for siRNA-L2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biodistribution profile of the L2 conjugate vs. jetPEI NPs was evaluated in a mouse orthotopic xenograft tumor model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 or jetPEI NPs were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into tumor-bearing mice and organs were evaluated for siRNA accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the absolute radiance in the organs over time from mice treated with jetPEI NPs or siRNA-L2, it is evident that the 10-mg/kg treatment of siRNA-L2 significantly enhances accumulation in all of the organs at an acute (30 min) time point (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the vast majority of siRNA-L2 was cleared from all organs excepting the kidneys and tumors by 24 h (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  jetPEI NPs, in contrast, create higher proportional delivery to and retention within the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) clearance organs (the liver and spleen) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in vivo tolerability of high siRNA-L2 doses enables a remarkable increase in tumor accumulation (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area under the curve within the tumor was 19.3-fold higher for siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg than for the maximum tolerated dose of jetPEI NPs (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose-matched siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg also outperforms jetPEI NPs in this measure of tumor accumulation by 2.4-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the fraction of the total organ radiance in the tumors is consistently higher for siRNA-L2 at both doses compared with jetPEI NPs, indicating more preferential tumor accumulation with siRNA-L2 relative to jetPEI NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further annotate the ability of siRNA-L2 to avoid the typical MPS organ accumulation of nanoparticles and accumulate preferentially within tumors, we evaluated the tumor:liver radiance ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the 10-mg/kg siRNA-L2 dose, a tumor:liver accumulation of more than 40:1 was observed at both 24 and 48 h, indicating successful accumulation at a nonhepatic site (Fig 3 E and F and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, jetPEI NPs displayed a tumor:liver ratio of below 3:1, a more than 15-fold decrease compared with siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg and also lower than that observed for siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg (which achieved a tumor:liver ratio of 15:1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The clear superiority of siRNA-L2 in the orthotopic model motivated investigation in a more clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of triple-negative breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dose-matched siRNA-L2 and in vivo jetPEI NPs at 1 mg/kg were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and biodistribution was evaluated at 24 h. siRNA-L2 attained 4.0-fold greater tumor distribution in the PDX model than jetPEI NPs (whereas there was a 2.2-fold increased tumor delivery in the dose-matched orthotopic model) at 24 h (Fig 3 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the orthotopic model, achieving tumor accumulation in the PDX model was more challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The added challenge of PDX tumors was more detrimental for the tumor delivery with jetPEI NPs than siRNA-L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total tumor accumulation in PDX tumors was 4.3-fold lower than orthotopic tumors for jetPEI NPs whereas it was only reduced by 2.4 fold for siRNA-L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower MPS accumulation of siRNA-L2 relative to NPs was consistent in the PDX model, with siRNA-L2 again showing a marked improvement in tumor:liver ratio (8:1 vs. 1:1) (SI Appendix, Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

siRNA-L2_Exhibits_Homogeneous_Distribution_and_High_Cellular_Internalization_at_the_Tumor_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The small size of albumin-bound siRNA-L2 is expected to increase tumor tissue penetration and homogeneity of distribution over nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an in vitro tumor spheroid model, the penetration and distribution of siRNA-L2 vs. jetPEI NPs throughout 3D tumor architecture was evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siRNA-L2 showed homogeneous and substantial cell uptake throughout the entirety of spheroids, whereas jetPEI NPs remained localized largely around the edges of the spheroid (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unmodified siRNA showed improved penetration into the interstitial spaces compared with the jetPEI complexes, but exhibited lower overall fluorescence than siRNA-L2 (SI Appendix, Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complement these results, flow cytometry was used to measure uptake per cell (as quantified by mean intracellular fluorescence) in tumor spheroids that were dissociated and analyzed following siRNA formulation treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular internalization of siRNA-L2 was twofold higher than that of unmodified siRNA, evidencing an uptake benefit derived from hydrophobic modification (SI Appendix, Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with jetPEI NPs, siRNA-L2 exhibited a greater than fivefold uptake increase (Fig 4B), with 84% of siRNA-L2treated cells positive for uptake compared with 27% of jetPEI-NPtreated cells (SI Appendix, Fig S8 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These in vitro tumor spheroid results inspired an investigation of tumor penetration and homogeneity of internalization by cells within orthotopic breast tumors in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of siRNA-L2 or jetPEI NPs, cells were isolated from excised tumors and evaluated by flow cytometry for cellular internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor cells were identified by expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 outperformed jetPEI NPs at both 30 min and 24 h, with siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg displaying 5- and 2-fold increased uptake at respective time points and siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg showing 45- and 20-fold increased uptake (Fig 4C and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 30 min, mice treated with siRNA-L2 at either dose displayed uptake in more than 96% of tumor cells, whereas jetPEI-NPtreated mice showed uptake in only 60% of cells (SI Appendix, Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preferential and homogeneous distribution of siRNA-L2 to tumor sites and high uptake by tumor cells makes it ideally suited for cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

siRNA-L2_Elicits_Sustained_Silencing_in_an_in_Vivo_Tumor_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The promising tumor penetration characteristics of siRNA-L2 inspired examination of its gene silencing efficacy in vivo in an orthotopic mouse tumor model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After treatment with luciferase-targeted siRNA or siRNA-L2 at days 0 and 1, luminescence was evaluated over 7 d, where an increase in luminescence indicates tumor growth and successful luciferase silencing abrogates the increase in luminescent signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2treated tumors exhibited significantly reduced tumor luminescence in comparison with tumors treated with unmodified luciferase-targeting siRNA or inactive, control siRNA-L2 sequences (Fig 4D and SI Appendix, Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing to the scrambled siRNA-L2 control, maximum silencing was more than 60% at day 1, with nearly 50% silencing sustained at day 7, revealing the prolonged gene silencing capacity of siRNA-L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No change in mouse body weight was observed over the course of treatment, further indicating that siRNA-L2 treatment is well-tolerated (SI Appendix, Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with jetPEI NPs at a dose of 1 mg/kg elicited significant (30%) silencing at day 3, but silencing was fully abrogated by day 7 (SI Appendix, Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an initial proof-of-concept of activity against a therapeutically relevant gene, siRNA-L2 that targets the negative regulator of apoptosis, myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL-1), was synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siRNA-L2 against MCL-1 achieved significant gene silencing in vitro at a reasonably low, 200-nM dose, and MCL-1 silencing correlated with a trend of functional increase in caspase activity (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simple conjugation of a hydrophobic albumin-binding diacyl lipid moiety to siRNA is a powerful delivery strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L2 conjugation increases circulation half-life, cellular internalization capacity, and tumor penetration and retention of siRNA while simultaneously reducing accumulation in clearance organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These myriad benefits lead to enhanced and prolonged in vivo gene silencing in tumors, supporting siRNA-L2 as a potential cancer therapy that can act on currently undruggable targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leveraging albumin as an endogenous nanocarrier is a relatively recent but extremely promising strategy to extend the circulation persistence of therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically relevant examples range from Abraxane, an albumin-based nanoparticle that encapsulates Taxol, to Levemir, a therapeutic peptide modified to associate noncovalently with endogenous albumin (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA, with its high potential medical impact but characteristically short circulation half-life, is an ideal candidate to develop with albumin as an in vivo chaperone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inducing high-affinity binding of siRNA to albumin via modification with a lipidic moiety is a logical strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown siRNA amenable to lipid modifications, which often confer improvements in nuclease resistance and cellular internalization without impacting gene silencing (10, 14, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation with L2 therefore has potential benefits on enhancing molecule stability and uptake while also prompting in situ albumin binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this binding is noncovalent and dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its physiological role as a fatty acid carrier, albumin facilitates the cellular uptake of lipids, likely through a variety of mechanisms that use receptors for both albumin and lipid domains (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation of L2 could allow siRNA-L2 to hijack these natural pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the hydrophobic interaction of the L2 moiety with the cellular membrane could encourage siRNA-L2 to be internalized independent of albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L2 modification as an albumin targeting approach is desirable for achieving pharmacokinetic improvements while maintaining simplicity and safety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the synthetic complexity of nanoparticle systems, siRNA-L2 possesses a circulation half-life above that of noncross-linked polyion nanoparticles (4, 53) and nearly equivalent to that observed in a relatively intricate cross-linked micelle system using cholesterol-modified siRNA (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps more striking is the complete lack of toxicity observed for siRNA-L2 at doses of 10 mg/kg, which sharply contrasts with the reported toxicity and immunogenicity of nanoparticulate carriers and our direct evaluation of in vivo jetPEI (25, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 couples an improved circulation half-life with a lack of dose-limiting side effects, and therefore is anticipated to enable very broad therapeutic windows when developed against specific targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our demonstration of MCL-1 gene silencing and its link to caspase induction demonstrates the applicability of siRNA-L2 to such therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we expect that the efficacy of siRNA-L2 could be further optimized through modifications to enhance in vivo stability and through identification of siRNA sequences with extremely potent silencing (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another associated challenge with nanoparticle delivery systems is their preferential accumulation within clearance organs, specifically the liver and spleen (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of synthetic and toxic/immunogenic nanoparticle components in these organs is the typical cause of dose-limiting toxicities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, siRNA-L2 avoids capture in the MPS organs, which is characteristic of nanoparticles, while also exhibiting a significant reduction in the rapid renal clearance associated with unmodified siRNA delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is exemplified by the tumor:liver accumulation ratio of more than 40:1 achieved by siRNA-L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disparity between in vivo jetPEI, with a ratio of less than 3:1, is pronounced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of siRNA-L2 retention in the liver is a key advantage over nanoparticulate delivery systems and will allow a greater percentage of the injected dose to be retained at its site of action in tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower tumor:liver ratio observed with in vivo jetPEI and nanoparticle systems in the literature is consistent with reported challenges in achieving efficient nanoparticle delivery to tumor sites; in a comprehensive analysis of nanoparticle delivery to solid tumors, the median injected dose delivered to the tumor site was 0.7% (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that even in recent, advanced, and promising nanoparticle systems, including those that use modifications for stealth or targeting mechanisms, the ratio of tumor:liver accumulation is consistently close to or below 1:1 (3, 5, 5762).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marked improvement of siRNA-L2 in relative tumor accumulation supports its translational promise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is also a significant tumor penetration benefit of siRNA-L2 due to its small size relative to nanoparticle carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in vivo jetPEI displays poor penetration of tumor tissue, siRNA-L2 distributes homogeneously throughout tumor tissue and achieves consistently high uptake in tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity of siRNA-L2 to offer superior tumor penetration is particularly significant given the highly inconsistent nature of human tumor vasculature and tissue morphology which limits consistent nanoparticle distribution (47, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we note that the PDX mouse model is less permissive to delivery than the orthotopic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDX models are considered more clinically relevant, as they preserve the native tissue architecture of the primary tumor through multiple in vivo passages and consistently recapitulate histopathologic and molecular characteristics, including drug responses and metastatic potential (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more challenging nature of the PDX model relative to the orthotopic model [which is considered more stringent than the flank model (21)] aligns with recent discussion suggesting that the permeable nature of commonly used mouse tumor models has led to an overestimation of the EPR effect (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas nanocarriers like in vivo jetPEI may achieve efficacy in highly vascularized or nonsolid tumors (20), they lack the ability to diffuse throughout the bulk of tumor architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faced with a more difficult delivery challenge in the PDX model, siRNA-L2 maintains tumor accumulation better than does in vivo jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the majority of human solid tumors contain regions of poor vascularization and display disparity in vessel permeability (20, 21), the performance of siRNA-L2 in the PDX model suggests applicability to a much broader range of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recognition of the limitations of the EPR effect and a developing understanding of tumor heterogeneity calls for innovative solutions for systemic RNAi cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 deviates enormously from the standard nanoparticle format, and its notable advantages should inspire further research into similar conjugate-based strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In situ targeting of albumin as an endogenous carrier is a powerful strategy to enhance the bioavailability of siRNA and avoid the issues associated with synthetic nanocarriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-L2 surpasses conventional delivery systems in circulation persistence, safety, biodistribution profile, tumor penetration, and cellular internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, siRNA-L2 achieves sustained gene silencing in tumors in vivo, providing strong proof-of-concept for therapeutic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work highlights the immense value of the siRNA-L2 conjugate as a translational and potentially transformative approach to improve i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In_Vitro_Gene_Silencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with siRNA or siRNA-L2 complexed with in vivo jetPEI according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siRNA was either designed against the luciferase gene (luc siRNA) or was a scrambled sequence (scr siRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were seeded at 2,000 cells/well in 96-well black-walled plates and allowed to adhere overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then treated in 10% serum for 24 h at a dose of 100 or 50 nM siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, media was replaced with luciferin-containing media (150 g/mL) before imaging with an IVIS Lumina III imaging system at 24 and 48 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fluorescent (Cy-5-labeled) DNA and DNA-L2 were injected into the tail vein of CD-1 mice (46-wk-old, Charles Rivers Laboratories) at 1 mg/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before injection, the mouse ear was placed on a coverslip on the Nikon C1si+ confocal microscope system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An artery within the ear was set in focus, and after injection, images of the artery were automatically collected every 2 s for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, animals were killed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum initial fluorescence of the artery was set to a time of 0 s. Artery fluorescence was evaluated by averaging pixel intensity values contained in a circular region of interest located entirely within the vessel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were fit to a one-phase exponential decay model (equation below) and half-life and area under the curve were determined from these fits.Fluorescenceblood=Fluor0×ekt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For the orthotopic mouse tumor model, athymic nude female mice (46-wk-old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in each mammary fat pad with 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:Matrigel (50:50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 21 d, tumor-bearing mice were injected via the tail vein with 1 mg/kg (nucleic acid dose) of fluorescent DNA, DNA-L2, or DNA loaded in in vivo jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h, animals were killed and the organs of interest (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and tumors) were excised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence intensity in the organs was quantified on an IVIS Lumina III imaging system at excitation wavelength of 620 ± 5 nm and emission wavelength of 670 ± 5 nm (n = 3 animals, n = 6 tumors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor radiance data were fit to a one-phase exponential decay model (equation below), and area under the curve was determined from these fits.Radiancetumor=Radiance0×ekt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the PDX mouse tumor model (70), the triple-negative line HCI-010 was transplanted into one inguinal mammary fat pad (surgically cleared of endogenous epithelium) of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (Jackson Laboratory) female mice of 34 wk of age (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 8 wk, PDX tumors were harvested, cut into 4 mm × 2-mm pieces, serially transplanted into the cleared inguinal mammary fat pads of a new cohort of NOD-SCID female mice, and grown to a volume of 300500 mm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-bearing mice were injected via the tail vein with 1 mg/kg (nucleic acid dose) of fluorescent DNA-L2 or DNA loaded in in vivo jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, animals were killed, and the organs of interest (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and tumors) were excised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence intensity in the organs was quantified on an IVIS Lumina III imaging system at excitation wavelength of 620 ± 5 nm and emission wavelength of 670 ± 5 nm (n = 2 animals, n = 2 tumors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acute_Toxicity_in_Liver_and_Kidney  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD-1 mice were injected with siRNA-L2 (10 mg/kg) or in vivo jetPEI-loaded siRNA (1, 2 mg/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, plasma was harvested and tested by the Vanderbilt Translational Pathology Shared Resource for systemic levels of ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor_Distribution_in_Vivo_After_iv_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the orthotopic tumor model, athymic nude female mice (46-wk-old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in each mammary fat pad with 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:Matrigel (50:50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 21 d, tumor-bearing mice were injected via the tail vein with saline, 1 or 10 mg/kg fluorescent DNA-L2, or 1 mg/kg DNA-loaded in in vivo jetPEI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumors were excised, and cells were isolated from each tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of collagenase and DNase was used to dissociate cells, and ammonium-chloride-potassium lysis buffer was used to remove red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uptake of fluorescent DNA or DNA-L2 was evaluated by flow cytometry (n = 4 animals, n = 8 tumors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor cells were identified as the cell population expressing GFP, whereas the GFP-negative cell population corresponded to native mouse cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Target_Gene_Silencing_After_iv_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Athymic nude female mice (46-wk-old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in each mammary fat pad with 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:Matrigel (50:50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After tumors reached a size of 50 mm2, tumor-bearing mice were injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with luciferin substrate (150 mg/kg) and imaged for bioluminescence on an IVIS Lumina III imaging system 30 min postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the mice were injected via the tail vein with 10 mg/kg (based on siRNA dose) luc siRNA or siRNA-L2 or scr siRNA-L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, mice were injected with 1 mg/kg in vivo jetPEI complexed with luc or scr siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were imaged and treated at days 0 and 1 following treatment injection and imaged for bioluminescence over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative luminescence was determined by measuring the raw luminescent intensity of each tumor on each day and comparing to the initial signal at day 0 (n = 10 tumors per group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse body weight was evaluated at each of these time points to investigate treatment toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The treatment groups were statistically compared using a one-way ANOVA test (for nonrepeated measures of more than two groups) or a two-way ANOVA (for measures repeated at multiple time points) coupled with a Tukey means comparison test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison between two groups, an independent two-tailed t test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P value less_than0.05 was deemed representative of a significant difference between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all data shown, the arithmetic mean and SE are reported, and the sample size (n) is indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ethics_Statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The animal studies were conducted with adherence to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments with animals were approved by Vanderbilt Universitys Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
