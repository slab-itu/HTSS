Myosin IIA interacts with the spectrin-actin membrane skeleton to control red blood cell membrane curvature and deformability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biconcave disk shape and deformability of the mammalian RBC are vital to its circulatory function and rely upon a 2D viscoelastic spectrinF-actin network attached to the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A role for nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) contractility in generating tension in this network and controlling RBC shape has not been tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that NMIIA forms bipolar filaments in RBCs, which associate with F-actin at the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMIIA motor activity regulates interactions with the spectrinF-actin network to control RBC biconcave shape and deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a previously undescribed mechanism for actomyosin force generation at the plasma membrane, and may apply to spectrinF-actinbased membrane skeleton networks in other cell types, such as neurons and polarized epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biconcave disk shape and deformability of mammalian RBCs rely on the membrane skeleton, a viscoelastic network of short, membrane-associated actin filaments (F-actin) cross-linked by long, flexible spectrin tetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) motors exert force on diverse F-actin networks to control cell shapes, but a function for NMII contractility in the 2D spectrinF-actin network of RBCs has not been tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that RBCs contain membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA puncta, identified as bipolar filaments by superresolution fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MgATP disrupts NMIIA association with the membrane skeleton, consistent with NMIIA motor domains binding to membrane skeleton F-actin and contributing to membrane mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the phosphorylation of the RBC NMIIA heavy and light chains in vivo indicates active regulation of NMIIA motor activity and filament assembly, while reduced heavy chain phosphorylation of membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA indicates assembly of stable filaments at the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of RBCs with blebbistatin, an inhibitor of NMII motor activity, decreases the number of NMIIA filaments associated with the membrane and enhances local, nanoscale membrane oscillations, suggesting decreased membrane tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebbistatin-treated RBCs also exhibit elongated shapes, loss of membrane curvature, and enhanced deformability, indicating a role for NMIIA contractility in promoting membrane stiffness and maintaining RBC biconcave disk cell shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As structures similar to the RBC membrane skeleton exist in many metazoan cell types, these data demonstrate a general function for NMII in controlling specialized membrane morphology and mechanical properties through contractile interactions with short F-actin in spectrinF-actin networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMIIA__the_Predominant_NMII_Isoform_in_Human_RBCs__Forms_Bipolar_Filaments_at_the_RBC_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The majority of cell types express more than one isoform of the NMII HC, typically the NMIIA HC encoded by the MYH9 gene and the NMIIB HC encoded by the MYH10 gene (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third NMIIC HC isoform, encoded by the MYH14 gene, is also present in some cell types but is not as widely expressed as the MYH9 and MYH10 genes (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess NMII isoform content during human erythroid differentiation, we induced human CD34+ cells to differentiate into erythroid cells in vitro (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirms previous microarray and RNA-sequencing analysis (27, 28), showing that early stages of erythroid culture express MYH9 and MYH10 transcripts, which decrease during the final stages of terminal erythroid maturation (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunoblots of the same samples show that NMIIB HC protein decreases below detectable levels by day 10 of differentiation, while NMIIA HC protein persists through day 16 of culture (Fig S1C), when most erythroblasts have extruded their nuclei to become reticulocytes, as shown in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extends a previous analysis of NMII HC isoform protein expression in earlier stages of erythroid culture (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting of human RBC membranes (ghosts) isolated by hypotonic hemolysis further indicates that NMIIA is the predominant NMII isoform in mature human RBCs (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data agree with previous 2D chymotryptic peptide maps, which are nearly identical for purified RBC NMII HC and platelet NMIIA HC (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the distribution of NMIIA in RBCs, we immunostained fixed, biconcave RBCs for the NMIIA motor domain and stained F-actin with phalloidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low abundance of NMIIA in RBCs [6,200 molecules per cell (5, 17)], the high concentration of fluorescence-quenching hemoglobin (30), and the small sizes of RBCs [8 m in diameter Ã— 2 m thick (31)] make imaging RBC NMIIA challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we imaged RBCs using sensitive, superresolution AiryScan confocal fluorescence microscopy (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional reconstructions of Z-stacks revealed 150 NMIIA motor domain puncta distributed throughout each RBC, distinct from the more continuous F-actin localization at the membrane (Fig 1 A and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single optical sections of individual RBCs showed NMIIA motor domain puncta throughout the RBC and at the edge of the RBC, localized with F-actin at the membrane (Fig 1B, arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified doublets of NMIIA motor domain puncta spaced 200450 nm apart (Fig 1B, arrows), similar to the lengths of NMIIA bipolar filaments observed in vitro and in other cells using electron and superresolution microscopy (3338).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional nearest neighbor analysis showed that 66% of NMIIA motor domain puncta form closely spaced doublets with one other punctum, which suggests that these doublets could represent NMIIA bipolar filaments (Fig 1 C, yellow dots and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide further evidence for the presence of NMIIA filaments in RBCs, we immunostained RBCs from mice expressing NMIIA tagged with GFP at the motor domain (39) with antibodies to GFP and the NMIIA tail domain (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cells, we observed groups of puncta with one tail domain punctum between two GFP (motor domain) puncta (Fig 1G), representing immunostained NMIIA bipolar filaments (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closely spaced pairs of motor and tail domain puncta and isolated single puncta may represent small, immature bipolar filaments below the resolution of AiryScan, unipolar NMIIA filaments (40), or bipolar NMIIA filaments not stained efficiently enough to be detected and resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine NMIIA motor domain association with F-actin at the membrane, we performed TIRF microscopy, which selectively illuminates fluorophores located within 100200 nm from the coverslip, at or near the plasma membrane (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TIRF images of F-actin in biconcave RBCs reveal a donut-shaped appearance where the membrane of the rim is in close contact with the coverslip (Fig 1I and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discrete NMIIA motor domain puncta appear scattered throughout this donut-shaped region, localizing with F-actin at the membrane at an average density of 0.5 puncta per square micrometer (Fig 1 I and J and Fig S2A), and are absent from secondary antibody-alone controls (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a total RBC surface area of 140 m2 (42), these data show that 70 NMIIA puncta are associated with the membrane of each RBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs stained with an antibody to the NMIIA tail domain (Fig S2 BD) or polyclonal antibodies to NMIIA (15) display similar patterns and numbers of NMIIA puncta to those stained with the antibody to the motor domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because the 2D epifluorescence and TIRF images are unable to resolve closely spaced doublets of motor domain puncta not parallel to the plane of the membrane, unlike the 3D AiryScan images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATP_Disrupts_NMIIA_Association_with_the_Triton_X-100Insoluble_Membrane_Skeleton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A contractile function for NMIIA bipolar filaments in RBCs should involve interactions of NMIIA motor domains with F-actin in the membrane skeleton (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro biochemical and biophysical studies show that MgATP weakens purified NMII motor domain binding to F-actin as part of the NMII catalytic cycle (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether MgATP disrupts RBC NMIIA association with F-actin, we isolated membrane skeletons by extracting RBC membranes (Mg2+ ghosts) with Triton X-100 (TX-100) to solubilize lipids and transmembrane proteins and to remove any remaining cytosolic components (15, 44) (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of MgATP, 40% of the NMIIA HC in Mg2+ ghosts is associated with the Triton-insoluble membrane skeleton pellet (Fig 2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of MgATP to the Triton lysis buffer disrupted this association, decreasing the percentage of pellet-associated NMIIA to 10% (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with these results, depletion of endogenous ATP with hexokinase and glucose in Triton lysate prepared from whole RBCs increased the levels of NMIIA associated with the Triton-insoluble membrane skeleton pellet (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By contrast, nearly all of the actin is associated with the membrane skeleton in both the absence and presence of MgATP (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both conditions, all of the spectrin and other membrane skeleton proteins are present in the Triton-insoluble pellet, as described previously (44, 45), while a significant fraction of band 3, a major integral membrane protein (100 kD), is extracted into the supernatant, as expected (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the disruption of NMIIA association with the membrane skeleton by MgATP is not due to selective extraction of actin or other membrane skeleton proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that NMIIA associates more stably with the membrane skeleton in the absence of MgATP, suggesting that NMIIA associates with the RBC membrane skeleton via motor domain binding to F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorylation_of_the_RBC_NMIIA_HC_and_RLC_Is_Consistent_with_Contractility_and_Regulated_Filament_Assembly  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signaling pathways that phosphorylate multiple sites of the NMII HC and RLC regulate NMII motor activity and filament assembly (2224, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether RBC NMIIA HC or RLC is phosphorylated in vivo, we metabolically labeled RBCs with 32P orthophosphate and then immunoprecipitated native NMIIA under conditions that preserve HC-LC associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDS/PAGE and autoradiography revealed that both the 19.5-kDa RLC and the HC are phosphorylated (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether NMIIA HC phosphorylation status affects association with the membrane skeleton, we extracted Mg2+ ghosts in TX-100 as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the ratio of NMIIA HC phosphorylated at serine 1943 to the total HC was about twofold greater in the Triton-soluble supernatant compared with the Triton-insoluble membrane skeleton pellet (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As HC phosphorylation at this residue inhibits filament assembly and promotes filament turnover (46), this suggests that membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA filaments have reduced HC phosphorylation and increased stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMIIA_Motor_Activity_Controls_NMIIA_Association_with_the_RBC_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional interactions of NMIIA filaments with F-actin in the RBC membrane skeleton should depend on motor domain activity, which may affect NMIIA and F-actin distribution at the RBC membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we treated live, intact RBCs with blebbistatin, an NMII-specific motor inhibitor that prevents phosphate release and stalls NMII in a weak F-actinbinding state (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated NMIIA association with the membrane by TIRF microscopy of fixed RBCs immunostained for the NMIIA motor domain and flattened by centrifugation onto glass coverslips before imaging to provide a greater membrane surface area to examine (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebbistatin treatment of RBCs resulted in an 30% reduction in NMIIA puncta density at the membrane relative to DMSO treatment, while the inactive blebbistatin enantiomer had no significant effect (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in NMIIA puncta density was not due to changes in the extent of RBC flattening, since blebbistatin treatment had no effect on the area of RBC F-actin visualized by TIRF microscopy (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether inhibition of NMIIA motor activity affects the organization of membrane skeleton F-actin, we examined TIRF images of phalloidin-stained RBCs treated with DMSO, active blebbistatin, or inactive blebbistatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actin appeared as a dense, reticular network, with no detectable differences in organization across all three treatment groups (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, treatment with active blebbistatin did not affect levels of G-actin in the cytosol, indicating that global F-actin stability was not altered (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that inhibition of NMIIA motor activity in RBCs affects the localization of NMIIA at the membrane but does not lead to global rearrangements or disassembly of the spectrinF-actin membrane skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMIIA_Motor_Activity_Controls_RBC_Morphology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through attachments to transmembrane proteins, the RBC membrane skeleton provides appropriate levels of membrane tension to maintain biconcave shape (1, 2, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because blebbistatin inhibition of NMIIA motor activity reduced NMIIA membrane association, we predicted that blebbistatin treatment would lead to a loss in membrane tension and changes in RBC membrane curvature and shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we evaluated RBC shapes in 3D confocal images after immunostaining for glycophorin A, a membrane marker (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 20 M active blebbistatin caused RBCs to variably elongate compared with the DMSO control, measured as an increased mean and variance of the aspect ratio (major/minor axis) in XY maximum intensity projections (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebbistatin treatment also caused a variable loss of biconcavity, measured as an increased mean and variance of the height ratio (minimum/maximum height) of XZ slices from the center of each RBC (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with the inactive blebbistatin enantiomer did not affect RBC aspect ratio or biconcavity, and increasing the concentration of active blebbistatin to 50 M did not lead to further changes in either parameter (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that NMIIA motor activity maintains the membrane curvature required for the characteristic RBC biconcave shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a positive correlation between the extent of elongation and biconcavity in RBCs treated with DMSO and active blebbistatin; however, these parameters varied independently in many cells, reducing the extent of this relationship (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, changes in biconcavity arose within 30 min of active blebbistatin treatment, but significant changes in the aspect ratio did not appear until after 2 h of treatment (Fig S6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that RBC aspect ratio and biconcavity may depend on different aspects of NMIIA motor activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether known NMIIA RLC kinases (2224) regulate NMII contractility to control RBC shape, we treated human RBCs with kinase inhibitors and then evaluated RBC shapes as above (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Rho kinase with Y-27632 (47) at 5 M and 20 M caused a loss in RBC biconcavity similar to that seen in blebbistatin-treated RBCs after both 30 min and 2 h of treatment (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 20 M Y-27632 also increased RBC aspect ratios after 2 h of treatment, although to a smaller extent than seen after blebbistatin treatment (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, inhibition of MLCK with 5 M Peptide 18 (P18) (48) did not affect RBC biconcavity or aspect ratios, even after 2 h of treatment (Fig S7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Rho kinase, but not MLCK, phosphorylates the NMIIA RLC to control RBC shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMIIA_Motor_Activity_Controls_RBC_Membrane_Deformability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that NMIIA motor activity controls RBC morphology, we predicted that NMIIA contractility maintains membrane curvature by promoting membrane tension and reducing local membrane deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoscale, ATP-dependent membrane oscillations of variable frequency observed in RBCs and other cell types are a sensitive measure of local membrane deformability (4953).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed these oscillations by filming changes in light scattering at the RBC surface using positive low-phase-contrast microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of NMIIA activity with blebbistatin increased the magnitude (Fig 5 A and B) and coefficient of variation (Fig 5 C and D) of oscillation amplitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that, in untreated RBCs, NMIIA contractility dampens spontaneous membrane oscillations and reduces local membrane deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global RBC deformability during transit through blood vessels in vivo depends on RBC biconcave shape and local membrane deformability (2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated global RBC deformability ex vivo by measuring rates of RBC flow through a microfluidic device with a 5-m channel, narrower than the 8-m diameter of human RBCs (54) (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs treated with 20 M and 50 M active blebbistatin traveled through the channel more rapidly than DMSO- and inactive blebbistatin-treated control RBCs (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs treated with 20 M and 50 M active blebbistatin also displayed greater shear-induced elongation as they passed through a wide (20 m) constriction in a 30-m channel (Fig 5 F and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blebbistatin treatment did not affect increases in RBC flow through narrow microchannels or RBC shear-induced elongation in response to decreases in oxygen pressure (PO2) (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that, in untreated RBCs, NMIIA motor activity promotes membrane tension to control local and global RBC deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The membrane skeleton, a long-range, 2D, periodic network of short F-actins cross-linked by flexible spectrin molecules, underlies the plasma membrane of metazoan cells, including RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identified NMIIA contractility as a mechanism controlling RBC biconcave shape and deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from fluorescence microscopy, as well as biochemical and biophysical approaches, lead us to propose that NMIIA forms bipolar filaments that exert contractile forces via binding of their motor domains to the short F-actins in the membrane skeleton (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this conclusion, inhibition of NMIIA contractile activity with blebbistatin reduces the association of NMIIA with F-actin at the membrane, as indicated schematically in Fig 6B, disrupting the RBC biconcave disk shape and increasing RBC deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMIIA bipolar filaments likely exert force on a small subset of RBC F-actins, since NMIIA puncta have a low density at the membrane (0.5 puncta per square micrometer) compared with 250 F-actins per square micrometer (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, blebbistatin-induced NMIIA dissociation from the membrane does not result in detectable changes in F-actin distribution by Western blotting and TIRF imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesize that NMIIA acts as a dynamic cross-linker between short F-actins, constrained by their linkages in the spectrinF-actin network (Fig 6A), rather than by inducing large-scale F-actin translocation and/or network rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMIIA/F-actin cross-linking activity in the membrane skeleton may be a conserved mechanism for actomyosin regulation of membrane tension, curvature, cell shape, and biomechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our mRNA and protein expression analyses confirm and extend previous studies, which show that immature erythroid progenitors express both the NMIIA and NMIIB HC isoforms (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of both isoforms decreases during later stages of terminal erythroid maturation, in agreement with recent proteomics studies (5558), but NMIIA becomes the predominant isoform in mature RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some proteomics studies also identify NMIIB in mature RBCs (56, 57), this apparent disagreement with our Western blot data could result from increased sensitivity of mass spectrometry and/or leukocyte contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of superresolution fluorescence microscopy images reveals 150 NMIIA motor domain puncta per RBC, and NMIIA bipolar filaments can be identified by colabeling of the motor and tail domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous biochemical analysis estimating that each RBC contains 6,200 NMII monomers that could form 210 bipolar filaments of 30 monomers each (15), this indicates that a significant fraction of RBC NMIIA may form bipolar filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of previous electron microscopy studies to detect NMII bipolar filaments, in either intact RBCs or ghosts, is likely due to the high concentration of electron-dense hemoglobin and the high density of the spectrinF-actin network at the membrane, together with the low density of bipolar NMIIA filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, common ghost preparation conditions, such as use of lysis buffers without Mg2+ or dialysis into very low ionic strength buffers during expansion of the membrane skeleton (5961), disrupt interactions between NMIIA and F-actin (15, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of NMIIA/F-actin interactions suggests that this association is mediated by NMIIA motor domains binding to membrane skeleton F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As originally observed for Dictyostelium discoideum NMII association with the membrane (62), MgATP reduces RBC NMIIA cosedimentation with the Triton-insoluble membrane skeleton several-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, spectrin, F-actin, and other membrane skeleton components exclusively associate with the membrane skeleton in the presence and absence of MgATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of RBCs with blebbistatin, which maintains myosin motor domains in a weak F-actin binding conformation (43), also decreases the amount of NMIIA associated with the membrane, as assessed by TIRF microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphorylation of the RBC NMIIA HC and RLC suggests that a significant fraction of RBC NMIIA is active and competent for filament assembly, while reduced HC phosphorylation indicates increased stability of membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the upstream signaling pathways that may activate or inhibit HC and RLC phosphorylation in RBCs remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs contain Rho/Rho-kinase pathway components that could phosphorylate the RLC (63), and Rho kinase inhibition with Y-27632 leads to a similar, although less pronounced, RBC shape change and increase in deformability (64) compared with blebbistatin-treated RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While blebbistatin specifically inhibits NMII motor activity, it is possible that the effects of Y-27632 are mediated by a Rho kinase target in addition to or other than the NMIIA RLC, such as adducin [which caps RBC membrane skeleton F-actins and promotes spectrinF-actin binding (6567)], or by an alternative signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibition of MLCK with P18 does not affect either RBC aspect ratio or biconcavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that MLCK may not contribute significantly to the regulation of RBC NMIIA contractility by RLC phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteomic studies indicate that RBCs also contain casein kinase and protein kinase C, which can phosphorylate either the NMII RLC or the C terminus of the HC (2224, 46) and may play a role in regulating RBC NMIIA activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, a portion of the phosphorylated RLC may be protected from turnover by RLC phosphatases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, sufficient NMIIA may remain stably phosphorylated and competent to assemble into bipolar filaments and interact with membrane skeleton F-actin to generate tension and control RBC shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this conclusion, RBCs do not undergo the regulated, dynamic, global F-actin rearrangements seen in migrating cells (68), suggesting that RBCs may also have lower levels of RLC phosphorylation-regulated turnover of NMIIA bipolar filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other F-actinbinding proteins could also modulate RBC NMIIA activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropomyosin isoforms regulate the F-actinactivated MgATPase and F-actin sliding velocity of NMIIA and other myosin isoforms (6971).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs contain two tropomyosins, Tpm3.1 and Tpm1.9, present in equimolar amounts and extending along the length of each short F-actin in the membrane skeleton (5, 7274).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs also contain caldesmon (two caldesmons per short F-actin), which, together with tropomyosin, regulates F-actinactivated myosin ATPase activity in vitro (5, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Tpm3.1-deficient mouse in which RBCs have abnormal shapes and deformability (75) will provide an opportunity to test whether Tpm3.1 regulates NMIIA in RBCs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibition of NMIIA motor activity with blebbistatin leads to an increase in variance, as well as mean values, for RBC aspect ratio and degree of biconcavity, suggesting cell-to-cell variability in dependence on NMIIA contractility to control RBC shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may result from changes in membrane skeleton mechanical properties during RBC aging in the circulation (50, 76, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human and mouse RBCs with mutations in integral membrane skeleton proteins have more dramatic shape changes than those observed in blebbistatin-treated RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations that disrupt spectrinF-actin linkages lead to highly elongated RBCs (elliptocytes), while mutations that disrupt network-membrane attachments lead to rounder RBCs with loss of membrane surface area (spherocytes) (2, 78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in magnitude of the phenotype further supports our conclusion that NMIIA is not an integral component of the membrane skeleton but associates with the spectrinF-actin network in a dynamic and transient manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In endothelial cells migrating in 3D collagen gels, NMII contractility is associated with regions of negative plasma membrane curvature (79), which is analogous to the central region (dimple) of the biconcave RBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not detect selective enrichment of NMIIA in the dimple region (or at the rim), it is possible that activated NMIIA with phosphorylated RLC could be differentially localized to the dimple or rim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, NMIIA contractility distributed across the entire membrane may maintain global tension in the spectrinF-actin network, which couples to the membrane bilayer, to promote membrane flattening and dimple formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, theoretical models for RBC biconcave shape (2, 80) have not considered an active role for myosin-based contractility in generating membrane tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to maintenance of RBC biconcave shape, blebbistatin treatments indicate that NMIIA contractility normally dampens spontaneous membrane flickering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of MgATP reduces membrane flickering (49, 5153), which could be due to further dampening by increased NMIIA/F-actin binding in these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As NMIIA contractility also controls global RBC deformability and shear-induced elongation during flow, NMIIA/F-actin cross-linking activity may be important for the ability of the spectrinF-actin membrane skeleton to enhance RBC resilience and preserve biconcave disk shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RBC membrane flickering and transit through narrow channels also depend on F-actin assembly (49, 68), suggesting NMIIA contractility and F-actin polymerization may synergistically modulate membrane mechanical properties in RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shear-induced deformation causes Ca2+ influx into RBCs through Piezo1 or other mechanosensitive channels (81, 82), which could influence NMIIA motor activity and F-actin polymerization to control membrane tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will investigate the role of NMIIA in RBC circulatory function in vivo and determine the importance of NMIIA and other NMII isoforms for the functions of spectrinF-actin networks in membrane morphology and mechanical resilience in other cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
