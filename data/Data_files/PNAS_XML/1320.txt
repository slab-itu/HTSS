TsixMecp2 female mouse model for Rett syndrome reveals that low-level MECP2 expression extends life and improves neuromotor function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To treat RTT, reactivating the dormant copy of MECP2 on the inactive X has been of considerable interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although potential therapeutics have been identified, their development has been hampered by the lack of a suitable female mouse model and uncertainty regarding how much MECP2 needs to be restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we create a female model with a more severe phenotype, including a short lifespan, neuromotor impairment, and repetitive behaviors often seen in human RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, 510% MECP2 restoration in brain extends lifespan by eightfold and improves RTT phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus provides a much-needed female model and implies potential therapeutic benefit with low-level MECP2 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is currently no disease-specific treatment, but MECP2 restoration through reactivation of the inactive X (Xi) has been of considerable interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progress toward an Xi-reactivation therapy has been hampered by a lack of suitable female mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of cellular mosaicism due to random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), Mecp2+/ heterozygous females develop only mild RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we create an improved female mouse model by introducing a mutation in Tsix, the antisense regulator of XCI allelic choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TsixMecp2 mice show reduced MECP2 mosaicism and closely phenocopy the severely affected Mecp2-null males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TsixMecp2 females demonstrate shortened lifespan, motor weakness, tremors, and gait disturbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, they also exhibit repetitive behaviors, as is often seen in human RTT, including excessive grooming and biting that result in self-injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a Tsix allelic series, we vary MECP2 levels in brain and demonstrate a direct, but nonlinear correlation between MECP2 levels and phenotypic improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As little as 510% MECP2 restoration improves neuromotor function and extends lifespan five- to eightfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus guides future pharmacological strategies and suggests that partial MECP2 restoration could have disproportionate therapeutic benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
XCI is directed by a noncoding master locus known as the X-inactivation center (Xic) that controls various steps of XCI, including chromosome counting, choice, and establishment of silencing (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Xic produces the long noncoding RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) (29), which spreads over the future Xi, recruiting silencer proteins, and thereby establishes the inactive state across the X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xist is, in turn, controlled by another noncoding locus, Tsix, which produces the antisense transcript that blocks expression and action of Xist in cis (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In female cells, deleting Tsix results in constitutive up-regulation of Xist in cis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in addition to controlling Xist expression, Tsix also controls the choice of which the X chromosome will be inactivated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the unperturbed state, each X chromosome has an equal chance of being inactivated, but the ratio can be skewed when mutations are introduced into Tsix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this knowledge, we took advantage of existing synthetic knockouts of Tsix (TsixF, TsixCpG) (31, 32) and generated a heterozygous mouse deficient for Tsix and Mecp2 on opposite X chromosomes (Tsix/+ Mecp2+/) (Fig 1 A and B), in an effort to create a female mouse in which the null Mecp2 allele would be preferentially expressed and the wild-type (WT) allele would lie dormant on the Xi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TsixF allele results from a 3.7-kb deletion of Tsixs CpG island (32) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed the TsixF allele into the Mecp2-null mice (19) to create TsixF/+ Mecp2+/ heterozygotes (Fig 1B, cross 2) and examined the effect on lifespan (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the average survival of TsixF/+ Mecp2+/ femaleshereafter F-RTT femaleswas 246 d, significantly lower than that of RTT (Mecp2+/) females whose life expectancy was typically 1 y (often normal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the TsixF allele was expected to lead to extreme skewing to favor expression of the null Mecp2 allele (31, 32), we were surprised that the F-RTT females still lived much longer than RTT (Mecp2/Y) males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average life expectancy of RTT males was only 68 or 76 d, depending on whether the father was WT (cross 1) or carried the TsixF allele (cross 2), respectively (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We surmised that a small percentage of MECP2+ cells might be positively selected in the brain, thereby ameliorating the RTT phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether XCI skewing may be less than expected, we followed F-RTT females across their lifespan and isolated fresh brain tissue from moribund mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined whole brain MECP2 protein levels by Western blot analysis and observed an intriguing variability in the amount of MECP2 protein, with some F-RTT females having no detectable MECP2, whereas others having levels as high as 20% of WT levels (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These levels of MECP expression were rather unexpected, given that the Tsix mutation generally skews XCI patterns to an extreme, with only 2.5% of cells typically choosing the WT X chromosome as the active X (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that mutant cells lacking MECP2 protein could indeed be at a selective disadvantage during development, enabling cells that express WT MECP2 to outgrow mutant cells and account for a larger fraction of somatic cells in the adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such skewed XCI patterns have been reported in patients with RTT (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated the TsixCpG allele, which has the identical 3.7-kb deletion of Tsix, but which still bears the oppositely oriented Neo cassette (31, 34) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TsixCpG allele exhibits a stronger skewing phenotype than TsixF, believed to be due to transcriptional interference caused by the antiparallel orientation of Neo transcription (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed TsixCpG/Y males with Mecp2+/ females (19) to obtain TsixCpG/+ Mecp2+/ female micehenceforth, CpG-RTT females (Fig 1B, cross 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of brain tissue from moribund animals suggested undetectable levels of MECP2 relative to WT, consistent with the expected near-complete skewing of XCI ratios to favor expression of the null Mecp2 allele (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MECP2 levels were similarly low in premorbid mice (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both premorbid and moribund CpG-RTT females, 10- to 20-fold overexposure of the Western blot revealed trace levels of MECP2, indicating levels that were less_thanless_than5% of WT (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CpG-RTT females demonstrated severe shortening of lifespan (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average lifespan of 102 d approximated the truncated life expectancy of the Mecp2/Y male model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to RTT and F-RTT females, there was little variability in life expectancy between CpG-RTT females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MECP2 confirmed loss of MECP2 expression in brain regions relevant for RTT (35), including the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, compared with TsixCpG/+ females with wild-type Mecp2, who showed MECP2 staining throughout the brain (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTT females without Tsix deletion exhibited strong MECP2 staining in about half of the cells, in accordance with cellular mosaicism, while RTT males showed no MECP2 staining at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the CpG-RTT females showed an occasional but rare MECP2+ cell, in agreement with an extreme but incomplete skewing of XCI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rare cells did not produce enough MECP2 (less_thanless_than5% of wild-type levels) to be detectable by Western blotting (Fig 3A), except when overexposed (SI Appendix, Fig S1), but would be consistent with secondary selection for MECP2+ cells in the brain and could also explain why CpG-RTT females live 3 wk longer than the fully null RTT males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasionally, MECP2+ cells showed regional clustering (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such clustering could potentially further contribute to the small degree of phenotypic variation between CpG-RTT females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by skewing XCI ratios to an extreme, we effectively decreased MECP2 mosaicism and increased disease penetrance in the female model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Tsix allelic series and the resulting variable expression of MECP2 provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between MECP2 levels and severity of RTT phenotypesand the larger question of how many MECP2+ cells in the brain are necessary for phenotypic improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated MECP2 protein levels with lifespan and found an intriguing nonlinear positive correlation (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpG-RTT females (dark purple Xs, Fig 3D) and F-RTT females (light purple Xs) with undetectable MECP2 levels showed a severely shortened lifespan of less_than100 d. Remarkably, an MECP2 protein level of only 5% doubled the lifespan to 160 d, and protein levels of 1020% further extended life to 400 d (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a small increase in MECP2 levels and in the number of MECP2-expressing cells has a disproportionately positive impact on phenotype as measured by life expectancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then asked whether extended life expectancy was accompanied by qualitative improvements in neuromotor function, an important readout for RTT symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subjected F-RTT and CpG-RTT females to mobility paradigms for RTT that are easy to score objectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such paradigm is the rotarod test, which examines forced muscle activity and provides a measure of both motor strength and coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed 9-wk-old mice on an accelerating rotating beam and recorded the length of time they stay engaged on the beam (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 9 wk, several RTT males had already perished, but enough remained healthy enough to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the groups in Fig 4A (P = 3.7 × 1039).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, RTT males performed poorly, relative to WT males (P less_than 0.001 for crosses 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTT females performed essentially equal as WT females (P = 0.73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, CpG-RTT and F-RTT females performed much worse than WT females (P = 9.8 × 1013 and P = 5.9 × 1012, respectively) and also relative to RTT females (P = 0.062 and P = 0.0032, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general differences were captured not only by the quantitative measurements but also by qualitative distinctions evident in video recordings (Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another oft-used mobility paradigm is gait analysis, in which paw prints of a mouse that traverses a runway toward a goal box are captured and the distance between the footfalls of the front and back paw measured (Fig 4B) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gait analysis further accentuated the difference between CpG-RTT, F-RTT, and RTT females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy mice demonstrate a characteristic manner of walking in which the front (red) and back (blue) paw prints overlap with each stride (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, RTT males displayed a severe gait disturbance in which there was clear separation of front and back paw prints (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Welchs ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the groups (P = 1.1 × 1011 for distance and P = 5.0 × 106 for number).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While RTT females did not show a strong gait phenotype yet at 9 wk (P = 0.22 for distance, Fig 4C and P = 0.98 for number, SI Appendix, Fig S1), the Tsix/+ Mecp2+/ females did, with the CpG-RTT females demonstrating a much stronger phenotype than the F-RTT in terms of both stride length and number of steps bigger than a chosen threshold value (F-RTT: P = 5.5 × 105 for distance and P = 0.010 for number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpG-RTT: P = 7.9 × 104 for distance and P = 0.054 for number) (Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gait disturbance was also evident from shorter stride lengths, with resulting greater number of steps required to complete the traversal, a more outward placement of back and inward placement of front paws, presumptively for increased stability due to muscle weakness, rendering the tracks more like bunny hops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, CpG-RTT females more closely phenocopied RTT male littermates on all neuromotor tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the CpG-RTT stood out among female RTT models, we investigated other aspects of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body mass in RTT has been reported to be variable in some female mouse models, but consistently drops rapidly in male models, especially at the end stage (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CpG-RTT females, a large weight variation was observed compared with WT females, potentially due to disease-induced weight fluctuations at various disease stages for CpG-RTT females (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance was nonhomogeneous between WT and CpG-RTT females as calculated by Levenes test at 9, 13, and 17 wk (P = 0.001, 0.009, and 0.003, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurological symptoms also became evident over the course of the shortened lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conventional RTT females, visible neurological symptoms such as hindlimb clasping, tremors, and gait abnormalities first appeared around 6 mo of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 17 wk, only 10% showed symptoms (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the CpG-RTT females showed early onset of symptoms, appearing from weaning age (34 wk) onwards and phenocopying the RTT males, albeit with slightly slower progression of the disease (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CpG-RTT females, a strong tremor was one of the first and clearest symptoms noticeable upon weaning (Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpG-RTT females also developed reduced movement, abnormal gait, and a later onset of hindlimb clasping (Movies S4S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presentation therefore differed significantly from that of RTT females, for whom hindlimb clasping was typically the first distinctively observable symptom, before reduced movement and abnormal gait (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a most compelling neurological phenotype in the CpG-RTT mouse model was repetitive behavior resulting in self-injurya condition potentially similar to that described for human RTT girls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This manifested among others by obsessive self-grooming and biting of the tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When under observation, WT mice typically self-groomed for only a few seconds in one sitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CpG-RTT mice often groomed continuously for minutes at a time, sometimes extending beyond 10 min (Movies S10 and S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When wounds occurred, they were initially confined to a small area but typically expanded over the course of days to a week to encompass nearly all of the tail (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 30% of CpG-RTT females were euthanized due to these severe injuries (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitive behavior and self-injury were not observed in any other RTT female model we tested, although others have reported such behavior in a mouse line with conditionally deleted Mecp2 in GABAergic neurons (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also did not observe repetitive or self-injurious behaviors in diseased RTT males, nor in littermates carrying only the TsixCpG mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age could be a factor, as the incidence of injuries rose to 42% among CpG-RTT females of 100 d old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because male RTT mice generally perished before 100 d, they may not live long enough or be too severely affected to manifest repetitive and/or self-injurious behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sexual dimorphism may be another factor (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our study shows that the CpG-RTT female mouse provides a good phenocopy of RTT disease for neurological and neuromotor phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By taking advantage of a modifier of X-chromosome inactivation, we have created a female RTT model with reduced cellular mosaicism, increased disease penetrance, and decreased disease variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CpG-RTT female closely phenocopies the severe disease of the industry standardthe Mecp2/Y male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to manifesting neuromotor dysfunction, a failure to thrive, and an acutely shortened lifespan, the CpG-RTT females also display a constellation of neurological symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong tremors arise by weaning age and about a third of CpG-RTT females mice develop repetitive behaviors such as obsessive grooming and self-biting, which result in injury and are potentially similar to those observed in human RTT girls, for whom hand wringing and self-biting can lead to self-injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the CpG-RTT mouse carries a dormant copy of Mecp2 on the Xi, the mouse would indeed serve as an excellent model to test candidate Xi-reactivating drugs, of which a number has now been proposed (1215, 17, 41), including a mixed-modality approach we developed recently (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, because the number of small animal models for repetitive and self-injurious behaviors is still limited and their pathophysiologies are poorly understood in general, the CpG-RTT females may be an additional resource beyond their proposed utility for RTT research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with neurological, behavioral, and motor phenotypes, additional physiological tests for core RTT and related symptomatologies (22) would be of interest in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key finding to arise from our study of this improved female model is that even the presence of 510% MECP2 protein in the brain significantly extends life and lessens the severity of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MECP2 is thought to be cell autonomous, serving its function within the cells that produce it (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefit of low-level expression for RTT could therefore in principle arise from either (i) a small number of cells expressing high-level MECP2, or (ii) a large number of cells expressing low-level MECP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both could improve fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the improved survival and phenotype of the Mecp2-lox-stop-lox male mice suggest that the latter possibilitya large number of cells expressing low-level MECP2 ameliorates the RTT phenotype due to a leaky termination cassette that enables some 510% readthrough Mecp2 transcription (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our immunostaining analysis of the brain suggests that the former possibilitya small number of cells expressing high-level MECP2also improves fitness significantly (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the known role of Tsix in skewing XCI ratios and with the differences in skewing associated with the two alleles (CpG and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher-than-expected level of MECP2 expression suggests positive selection in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also speculate that the rare MECP2+ cells may confer a survival advantage of 3 wk over the fully null males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As quantified by Western blot analysis of CpG-RTT females, the level of MECP2 required to confer the additional survival benefit is less_thanless_than5% of wild-type levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, our work shows a positive correlation between phenotypic improvement and MECP2 levels in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the full spectrum of RTT disease phenotypes in affected humans, from severely affected boys with MECP2-null mutations, to strongly affected mosaic females with unfavorable XCI skewing, to the mildly affected females with more favorable XCI skewing (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, in CpG-RTT and F-RTT mouse models, the positive correlation is nonlinear, with 510% increases extending life by five- to eightfold (Fig 3D), further underscoring the disproportionate benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are very welcome for the Xi-reactivation strategy, as it suggests that pharmaceutical mixtures need not boost MECP2 expression to the full extent for phenotypic impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, as a general point for consideration, the cellular mosaicism caused by XCIalong with the estrous cyclehave long been offered as reasons for excluding females in research studies, resulting in the general practice of regarding male and female subjects as being equivalent (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a recent metaanalysis of phenotypic data from 14,250 WT and 40,192 mutant mice found a large proportion of mammalian traits to be influenced by sex (45), with implications for interpretation of disease phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of RTT and other X-linked disorders further accentuate the need for female models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinction of having an Xi and the more variable symptomatology are important reasons for inclusion of females in future RTT research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
