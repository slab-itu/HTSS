Adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline alleviates axonopathy caused by human Tau K280  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tau-driven neurotoxicity occurs in multiple neurodegenerative diseases that have a severe impact on families and the society at large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its mode of toxicity is poorly understood, and therefore no effective drug treatments have been discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that aggregate-prone Tau accumulates in axons where it causes presynaptic dysfunction and matching neuronal hypoactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline, a drug developed for patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, normalizes neuronal functioning in vitro and restores cognition in Tau-transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that rolofylline could be used as a treatment by increasing bona fide neuronal activity, which is diminished in tauopathy patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, this should delay the onset or the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accumulation of Tau is a characteristic hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases but the mode of toxic action of Tau is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the Tau protein is toxic due to its aggregation propensity, whereas phosphorylation and/or missorting is not sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregate-prone Tau accumulates, when expressed in vitro at near-endogenous levels, in axons as spindle-shaped grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These axonal grains contain Tau that is folded in a pathological (MC-1) conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proaggregant Tau induces a reduction of neuronal ATP, concomitant with loss of dendritic spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterintuitively, axonal grains of Tau are not targeted for degradation and do not induce a molecular stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proaggregant Tau causes neuronal and astrocytic hypoactivity and presynaptic dysfunction instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline (KW-3902) is alleviating the presynaptic dysfunction and restores neuronal activity as well as dendritic spine levels in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral administration of rolofylline for 2-wk to 14-mo-old proaggregant Tau transgenic mice restores the spatial memory deficits and normalizes the basic synaptic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings make rolofylline an interesting candidate to combat the hypometabolism and neuronal dysfunction associated with Tau-induced neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

High_Aggregation_Propensity_Is_Not_Necessary_for_Tau_Missorting_but_Causes_Tau_to_Accumulate_in_Axons_as_Grains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In organotypic hippocampal slices, both proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau is missorted to the somatodendritic compartment as has been shown before (Fig 1 A and B, asterisks) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This missorted Tau in transgenic slices consists of, at least partially, transgenic human Tau (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only proaggregant Tau transgenic slices reveal Tau-positive beaded structures in the neuropil oriented mostly perpendicular to the apical dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig 1 C and D, arrowheads) resembling grains in human AGD (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that proaggregant Tau accumulates in the axons as grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic proaggregant Tau is expressed at 83% of wild-type Tau levels, whereas antiaggregant Tau is expressed at 50% of wild-type Tau levels in 30 d in vitro (DIV30) organotypic slices (Fig 1E), which is approximately threefold less as has been found in the in vivo Tau transgenic mouse brain (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative difference between proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau could be partially explained by the fact that proaggregant Tau accumulates in the neuropil as well, whereas antiaggregant Tau does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the axonal nature of the grains of Tau, we performed a biolistic cotransfection of the red fluorescent protein TandemTomato (for morphology) and proaggregant Tau (Fig 1 FI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single neurons are cotransfected, for example, in Fig 1F, which shows a transfected CA1 neuron or a dentate gyrus granule cell in Fig 1H and Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axons of transfected neurons (Fig 1 G and I) clearly reveal small inclusions of Tau (1 µm in size, arrowheads), although presynaptic boutons (e.g., giant mossy fiber boutons) are only marginally stained for Tau (Fig 1I and Fig S2 A and B; arrow), indicating that Tau does not accumulate at presynaptic boutons in these slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we did not see colocalization of the grains of Tau and presynaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that Tau missorts into a subgroup of proximal dendrites, which correlates with a dramatic spine loss in the affected dendrites (Fig S2 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, dendrites that do not contain Tau are richly decorated with spines ( greater than 1 spines per µm), indicating that there is only local impairment of dendritic function in case of proaggregant Tau missorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Both_Proaggregant_and_Antiaggregant_Tau_Are_Phosphorylated__but_Only_the_Grains_of_Proaggregant_Axonal_Tau_Appear_in_a_Pathological_Conformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proaggregant transgenic mice have aberrantly phosphorylated human Tau-K280, although the relation between these posttranslational modifications and Tau toxicity is poorly understood (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to differentiate between toxic and nontoxic modifications of Tau, we compared the phosphorylation status of Tau in proaggregant (K280) and antiaggregant (K280-PP) transgenic organotypic hippocampal slices (Fig 2 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices from both types of transgenic mice show the 12E8 epitope (pSer262/pSer356, Fig 2 A and B) in the somatodendritic compartment (asterisks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of these serines is known to induce detachment of Tau from microtubules and to promote missorting of Tau (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the axonal grains of Tau are not 12E8 positive (arrowheads), emphasizing that 12E8 staining is found only in mislocalized Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When corrected for the difference in total Tau, 12E8 phosphorylation does not differ between proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PHF-1 epitope (pSer396+pSer404, Fig 2 DF) is seen in both types of Tau transgenic slices where it appears in the somatodendritic compartment (asterisks) and in the axonal grains (arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHF-1 phosphorylation levels are similar for antiaggregant or proaggregant Tau when corrected for total Tau input (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody AT180 (Tau pThr231) (18) shows (very) weak staining in the cell soma of both types of Tau transgenic slices (Fig 2 G and H, asterisks) contrasting the high degree of Tau phosphorylated at Ser202/Thr205 [asterisks (somata) and long arrows (apical dendrites)] (AT8 antibody, Fig 2 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also studied pathologically folded Tau using the MC-1 antibody (Fig 2K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MC-1positive Tau accumulates in the axonal grains of proaggregant Tau as described above (arrowheads), whereas antiaggregant slices remain unstained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, Tau missorted in the somatodendritic compartment in either proaggregant or antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices is negative for the MC-1 epitope (asterisks), consistent with the absence of grains in dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also attempted to costain Tau (K9JA) with dendritic marker MAP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Tau frequently colocalized with MAP2 in dendrites (missorting), the grains never colocalized with MAP2, emphasizing the axonal nature of the grains (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the axonal grains of Tau appear to resist protein degradation because they are negative for markers of degradation (vimentin, ubiquitin, Lamp1, Sqstm1/P62, Hsc70, and Tia-1) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, most phosphoepitopes are present in both antiaggregant and proaggregant Tau transgenic slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grains of pathologically folded Tau accumulate only in the axons of proaggregant Tau transgenic neurons, which suggests that these grains play a critical role in Tau-induced neuronal dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these grains are not targeted for degradation, nor do they appear to induce an unfolded protein response within the axon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proaggregant_Tau_Causes_Spine_Loss__Reduces_Axonal_Mitochondria__and_Lowers_Cytoplasmic_ATP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We labeled neurons of the organotypic slices diolistically with DiI to investigate the effect of the proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau on spine density and morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proaggregant Tau transgenic slices showed a significant reduction of spines compared with littermate control slices, whereas spine density of antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices was similar to controls (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic spines are usually classified into different categories based on their shape, which represents different functional properties (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not detect a difference in classes of spines between slices of both transgenic lines and littermate controls (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined mitochondrial movements in live organotypic slices because aggregation-prone Tau is known to impair mitochondrial transport (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria transport is similar in both kinds of Tau transgenic slices (Fig 3E) with only a moderately lower mitochondrial density in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices compared with antiaggregant slices (Fig 3F and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the effect of proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau on energy status (ATP level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic slices were biolistically transfected with the FRET-based ATP sensor (ATeam) (Fig 3 G and H) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP is reduced in the proaggregant transgenic slices, matching the lower mitochondrial density, compared with littermate controls or antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the energy status of the neurons is compromised by proaggregant but not by antiaggregant Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Proaggregant_Tau-Induced_Phenotype_Can_Be_Rescued_with_the_Adenosine_A1_Receptor_Antagonist_Rolofylline  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The markers described so far did not reveal any clear mode of action of toxic proaggregant Tau despite the functional impairment reported previously in transgenic mice (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore designed a quantitative PCR-based miniscreen of key genes known to be (up-)regulated at the mRNA level as a result of specific stressors serving as markers for insults (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, expression of neuronal activity marker cFos, astrocytic activity marker Gfap, and oxidative stress marker Hmox1 were reduced in the proaggregant Tau transgenic slices, whereas antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices were not different from littermate controls (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signs of molecular stress (e.g., protein misfolding, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reflected by an increase in stress markers (Hspa1a, Osp94, Hmox1, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), however, could not be found in the proaggregant Tau transgenic slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms the lack of a classical cytotoxicity by this species of aggregate-prone Tau (e.g., chaperones, aggresomes, stress granules, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), as has been reported above (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that grains of Tau accumulate within axons (Fig 1) and that axonal mitochondria density is reduced (Fig 3), we tested next whether axonal (presynaptic) functioning is indeed impaired in organotypic hippocampal slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore measured the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) by applying a paired-pulse stimulus of the Schaffer collaterals (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a typical paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) response in littermate controls and antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices, whereas in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices, the same stimulus paradigm resulted in a paired-pulse depression (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that proaggregant Tau induces presynaptic impairment, whereas presynapses of antiaggregant Tau slices are unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine down-modulates neuronal activity (cFos levels), impairs the presynapse, and attenuates long-term potentiation (LTP) via the A1 receptor (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this resembles our presynaptic phenotype (Fig 4B) and the outcome of the miniscreen, we attempted to counterbalance the observed phenotype by using the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An adenosine A2A receptor antagonist (ZM-241385), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist (N6-cyclopentyladenosine), and a Tau aggregation inhibitor (BSc3094) were used as controls (Table S4) (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rolofylline increases neuronal activity (Fos mRNA) both in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices and controls, although in case of the proaggregant slices neuronal activity is almost doubled, yielding levels similar to those of treated littermate control slices (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these observations, the presynaptic impairment in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices can be reversed by rolofylline or BSc3094 without causing adverse effects in controls (Fig 4F and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rolofylline_Treatment_Restores_Dendritic_Spine_Levels_in_Proaggregant_Tau_Transgenic_Slices__Rescues_Long-Term_Memory_Deficits__and_Normalizes_Basal_Synaptic_Transmission_in_Proaggregant_Tau_Transgenic_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the electrophysiological parameters in the proaggregant Tau transgenic slices were normalized by rolofylline treatment, we investigated whether it would also restore the level of dendritic spines in these slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the reduced level of spines seen in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices are normalized when treated with rolofylline, whereas no significant changes are found in antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices or littermate controls (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axonal density of mitochondria, which is slightly lower in proaggregant compared with antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices, is marginally decreased by rolofylline treatment albeit in a genotype-independent manner (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having observed that rolofylline restores presynaptic functioning (i.e., PPF, Fig 4F), neuronal activity (induction of Fos, Fig 4D), and dendritic spine levels in proaggregant Tau transgenic organotypic slices (Fig 5 A and B), we tested whether we could restore long-term spatial memory in proaggregant Tau transgenic mice as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore performed the Y-maze test, novel object recognition test (NORT), and the fear conditioning test with 14-mo-old proaggregant Tau transgenic and littermate control mice within 1020 d of oral rolofylline treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Y-maze test, (treated) control mice spent more time in the novel arm, whereas untreated proaggregant mice did not show any arm preference (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rolofylline reestablished novel arm preference in proaggregant mice, suggesting that rolofylline restores spatial memory in these animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the NORT, (treated) control mice explored the novel object more compared with the old object, whereas the proaggregant mice did not show any preference for the new or the old object (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rolofylline treatment improved long-term object recognition memory in proaggregant Tau transgenic mice, as shown by increased novel object preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fear conditioning testing, the effects of systemic rolofylline administration on different stages of contextual and clue-based (sound) fear learning were investigated 24 h after the training session (Fig 5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contextual memory was unaltered as all groups showed similar freezing when reintroduced into the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control groups and the rolofylline-treated proaggregant group showed a clue-induced freezing response, whereas no effect was seen in the untreated proaggregant mice (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests an impaired learning association between the sound and the foot shock in proaggregant mice, which can be rescued by rolofylline treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten weeks of posttreatment (starting at 14 mo), we assessed the electrophysiological properties of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in treated proaggregant Tau transgenic animals and controls (Fig 5 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with untreated proaggregant Tau transgenic mice, treated mice (proaggregant Tau transgenics and littermate controls) have significantly larger maximal excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes (Fig 5 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the input/output (I/O) curve is significantly reduced in proaggregant Tau transgenic mice compared with controls, indicative of impaired basal synaptic transmission (Fig 5I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with rolofylline increases the slope of the I/O curve in both proaggregant Tau transgenic slices and littermate controls (Fig 5I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impairment of the presynapse, as determined by application of a paired-pulse protocol is ambiguous in the acute slices (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the shortest pulse interval (20 ms), PPF is normally strongly suppressed by the feedforward inhibition (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the proaggregant Tau transgenic slices, feedforward inhibition seems to be impaired because the PPR is as high as the ratios seen with larger pulse intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synaptic plasticity, measured as the ability to elicit LTP by theta-burst stimulation, is not altered in any condition compared with untreated littermate controls (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present paper, we compared an aggregation-prone species of Tau with its antiaggregant counterpart as well as nontransgenic littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an organotypic hippocampal slice model to show that both proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau is (hyper)phosphorylated and mislocalized to the somatodendritic compartment in the absence of frank Tau aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although missorting and/or hyperphosphorylation of Tau may be a prerequisite for Tau pathology to occur, we clearly show here that it is not sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This argues that increased aggregation propensity (the only difference between proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau) is essential for Tau toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite of the high ( greater than 99.5%) homology of the two Tau species, only proaggregant Tau accumulates as axonal spindle-shaped grains in a pathological pretangle conformation, similar to argyrophilic grains in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proaggregant Tau, but not antiaggregant Tau, decreases dendritic spine number and the ATP levels in neurons, which further supports the role of aggregation propensity as the mode of toxic action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the axonal aggregates of Tau do not colocalize with known aggregation markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, presynapses are impaired in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices, giving rise to a general reduction of neuronal activity, which has been reported previously for Tau P301L-expressing mice as well (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced ATP levels, dendritic spine loss, diminished neuronal activity, and impaired presynaptic functioning are reminiscent of adenosine A1 receptor signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of the adenosine A1 receptor signaling may be able to restore neuronal functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, presynaptic functioning, neuronal activity, as well as the reduction of dendritic spines in the proaggregant Tau transgenic organotypic slices are normalized by application of the highly selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When administrated orally to proaggregant Tau transgenic mice, rolofylline restores cognitive functioning and strengthens basal synaptic transmission, which is known to be subdued as a result of adenosine signaling (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine, when bound to the A1 receptor, has an inhibitory function on many organs including the brain where it reduces neurotransmitter release (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine is normally produced both extracellularly and intracellularly where adenosine is formed by degradation of AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because intracellular ATP levels are 50 times higher than AMP levels, small changes in the ATP catabolism lead to dramatic changes in AMP and subsequently adenosine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism by which Tau is able to reduce presynaptic functioning and subdue neuronal activity remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we see a reduction of ATP in proaggregant Tau transgenic neurons, which may be caused by a release of ATP from the neurons or a shift from ATP to AMP intraneuronally, both leading to high extracellular adenosine levels (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role for adenosine in the CNS is ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine is very important for the circadian rhythm and for neuroprotective effects when bound to the adenosine A1 receptor (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, the impaired neurotransmitter release by adenosine A1 receptor signaling blocks memory formation (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So adenosine A1 signaling seems to drive neuronal networks from the (highly) excitable state to the rest and repair state, both of which are important for maintaining synaptic functioning as well as learning and memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, prolonged activation of the adenosine A1 receptor (due to pathological Tau, A, or other chronic stressors) may bring the neurons in a permanent state of hypoexcitability impairing neuronal functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we provide evidence that antagonizing the adenosine A1 receptor can restore the Tau-induced neuronal dysfunction in a tauopathy mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rolofylline has never been tested as a treatment for any human neurodegenerative disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a diuretic, it failed in a phase III trial for patients suffering from acute heart failure due to unimproved renal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adverse effects were, however, limited (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that adenosine receptors are increased in neurons in the degenerating human brain and that administration of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist induces A production, Tau phosphorylation, and Tau missorting in vitro (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down syndrome patients, known to suffer from early-onset AD, have higher levels of adenosine than aged matched controls (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the very short half-life of adenosine (less_than10 s in blood), there have been no studies on adenosine levels in human brain (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain hypometabolism (i.e., neuronal hypoactivity), on the other hand, is a characteristic hallmark during and preceding neurodegeneration (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cognitively normal ApoE4 homozygous subjects show reduced glucose metabolism as is seen in AD patients (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same reduction of glucose metabolism occurs in preclinical individuals with a genetic predisposition for familial AD, long before the onset of cognitive decline (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic administration of GABAA agonists (benzodiazepines), which inhibit neuronal activity, almost double the risk for AD when taken for more than 6 mo (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the most common psychoactive drug in the world (caffeine), an adenosine receptor antagonist that boosts neuronal activity, protects against AD (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of the perforant path in an A-based mouse model is sufficient to restore memory retrieval (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans increases brain network activity and performance of associative memory, emphasizing the benefit of increased bona fide network activity (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, we show that Tau protein impairs neurons through its ability to aggregate, which in turn leads to reduced neuronal activity, lowered ATP levels, and dendritic spine loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the organotypic slice model as well as in transgenic mice, one can alleviate the process of neuronal dysfunction by administration of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline, a compound that is proven to be safe in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since neuronal hypoactivity/hypometabolism precedes human neurodegenerative diseases as well, restoration of normal neuronal activity by rolofylline administration may prove to be a successful treatment to counteract the Tau-induced brain dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

See SI Materials and Methods for detailed descriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were approved by an animal welfare committee of the agency for Nature, Environment, and Consumer Protection in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Slices were analyzed at DIV30 to DIV35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of (phosphorylated) Tau was examined by immunofluorescence in organotypic hippocampal slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axonal localization of Tau, intraneuronal ATP levels, and mitochondrial motility were studied by using biolistic transfection of organotypic hippocampal slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA quantification was performed by using real-time PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synaptic transmission was analyzed by assessing the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials applied in a paired-pulse protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic spine levels in organotypic slices were quantified by biolistic transfection of TandemTomato or diolistic labeling using DiI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organotypic proaggregant Tau transgenic mice and age-matched controls of 14 mo of age were used to test the effectiveness of rolofylline as a treatment for Tau-induced dysfunction by oral administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioral performance of mice treated with rolofylline was tested using the Y-maze, novel object recognition task, and fear conditioning testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic synaptic transmission in acute slices was assessed by measuring the I/O responses of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All results are presented as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons between two groups were tested using Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons among groups were tested using one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukeys test or Dunnetts test for post hoc testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P less_than 0.05 was considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenic mice coexpressing the human full-length Tau protein (2N4R, the largest isoform in human CNS) with the FTDP-17 mutation K280 (deletion of lysine 280) and the reporter firefly luciferase gene under control of a bidirectional tetO-responsive CMV promoter were crossed with a CaMKII-tTA transgenic mouse described before (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded a neuron-specific repressible mutant (K280) human Tau transgenic mouse expressing luciferase as a reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, another Tau transgenic mouse was generated with the same constructs as the human Tau K280 transgenic mouse albeit with two additional prolines in the hexapeptide motifs of the repeat domain of the Tau protein, which serve as -sheet breakers (human Tau K280-PP) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human Tau K280 and human Tau K280-PP transgenic mice are dubbed proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau transgenic mice, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before experiments, we have selected transgenic mice with comparable Tau expression by in vivo bioluminescence imaging to reduce interindividual variations (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were housed and tested according to standards of the German Animal Welfare Act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Organotypic_Hippocampal_Slice_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic slices of the hippocampus were prepared using a protocol published previously (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, mice (610 d old) were killed by decapitation, and brains were rapidly extracted, after which hippocampi were dissected and sliced in 400-µm slices with a McIlwain tissue chopper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were immediately transferred to semiporous cell culture inserts (Merck Millipore) in six-well plates containing 1 mL of preincubated culture medium [50% (vol/vol) MEM, 25% (vol/vol) horse serum, 25% (vol/vol) Hanks balanced salt solution, 4.5 mg/mL glucose, and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genotype was determined by detection of the bioluminescence due to luciferase activity by using the IVIS system (PerkinElmer) the next day after which medium was changed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium was subsequently changed every 3 d. Analysis of the slices was done after 30 d in vitro (DIV30), unless stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacological_Treatments_of_Organotypic_Hippocampal_Slice_Cultures_and_Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic slices of proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau transgenic mice with matching littermate controls were treated from the first medium change (DIV1) onward until time of analysis (DIV30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception was the for the dendritic spine count of the rolofylline and untreated slices, which were treated for 7 d from DIV30 onward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds were replaced with every medium change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds and concentrations are listed in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with custom-made food pellets (Ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH) containing 1.5 mg adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline (KW-3902) per kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dosage of rolofylline was 0.2 mgkg1d1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About eight to nine control littermates and proaggregant mice were treated with rolofylline during 10 d, and then behavior analysis was started, followed by electrophysiological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were continuously treated until the end of the electrophysiological study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic slices were fixed while being attached to the Millicell membrane in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with PBS and 0.1 M glycine in PBS, slices were incubated overnight in 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were incubated in 20% horse serum for 4 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies in PBS for 72 h at 4 °C (Table S5 for concentrations and sources).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with PBS, slices were incubated with secondary antibody for 2448 h. After rinsing and counterstaining with DAPI, slices were mounted using Permafluor mounting solution (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The biolistic transfection of the ATP sensor [ATeam (AT1.03)], RFP-mito, TandemTomato, and the cotransfection of TandemTomato+K280 Tau was done as was described previously using the Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, the plasmid(s) were diluted in 50 µL of PCR-grade water with a final concentration of 1 µg/µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gold bullets (68 mg, 1.6-µm diameter) were mixed with 100 µL of 50 mM spermidine after which the DNA solution was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 100 µL of 1 M CaCl2 was added to this solution in a dropwise manner followed by brief sonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, coated gold particles were rinsed in 100% ethanol for three times and resuspended in 3 mL of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (40 µg/mL ethanol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gold-coated cartridges were generated using the tube prepping station according to the previously described protocol (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cotransfection, we used the competitiveness between the two plasmids to favor the expression of TandemTomato at the expense of Tau to get human Tau levels similar to what is seen in neurons of Tau transgenic slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were transfected at DIV25 to DIV27 (DIV35 for TandemTomato) using the Helios gene gun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure used for transfection was 20.7 bar (300 psi) with a shooting distance of 4 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Millicell membrane inserts containing the slices were transferred to a glass-bottom culture dish (ø, 50 mm; Harvard Apparatus), which contained 1 mL of culture medium after 24 d for live-cell analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A longworking-distance 20× objective (Olympus) and 2.5× Optivar magnification combined with the Cell Observer microscope (Zeiss) and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) were used for image acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dendritic_Spines_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic hippocampal slices of Tau transgenic and littermate control mice (DIV30) were labeled using DiI-labeled gold particles using a previously described protocol with slight modifications (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, a suspension was made consisting of 60-mg gold particles in dimethylformamide containing 20 mg/mL DiI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was transferred to a glass Petri dish and left to dry, after which the DiI/gold was cut to a fine powder using a razor blade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DiI/gold powder was sonicated in water and resuspended in 2.5 mL of a 60 µg/mL PVP solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A circle was drawn on the microcarriers using a hydrophobic barrier pen after which 50 µL of the gold suspension was pipetted into the center of the circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organotypic slices were labeled using the PDS-1000/He System (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bombarded organotypic slices were immediately fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stored at 4 °C for 72 h to allow the DiI to diffuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TandemTomato-transfected slices were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stored at 4 °C until further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All slices (DiI stained and transfected) were rinsed in PBS and counterstained using DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using the FV1000 microscope (Olympus) with a 63× objective and 5× digital zoom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image Z stacks were acquired and processed by deconvolution applying the 3D Huygens Deconvolution and Analysis Software (Scientific Volume Imaging), after which spines were counted using the trainable spine classifier of the NeuronStudio software (Computational Neurobiology and Imaging Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FRET_Analysis_of_Transfected_(Transgenic)_Organotypic_Slices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measuring neuronal ATP, we transfected (transgenic) organotypic hippocampal slices with a plasmid coding for the ATeam (AT1.03) ATP sensor (a kind gift of Dr. H. Imamura, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected slices were analyzed using a Cell Observer microscope (Zeiss) with a matching Definite Focus unit and a DV2 Dual-View system (Photometrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were selected based on their morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure CFP and YFP emission simultaneously, the region of interest (axon, dendrite, or soma) was delineated as well as a neighboring untransfected region of the slice for background subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background-subtracted measurements were used for determining the net YFP/CFP ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we transfected organotypic slices with a plasmid coding for a mitochondrial target sequence fused to RFP (RFP-mito) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RFP-mito was measured for analysis of mitochondrial morphology and trafficking using the Cell Observer microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted by using the standard TRIzol/1-bromo-2 chloropropane extraction protocol with subsequent generation of cDNA using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were designed using the Primer3Plus program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were required to be intron spanning and yielding a PCR product of 70120 bp in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences are listed in Table S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best three housekeeping genes (Mprip, Gapdh, and Rs27a) were selected from a selection of five by using Gnorm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IQ5 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad) and the Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo) were used for the actual quantitative PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw fluorescence data were exported from the IQ5 software and subsequently loaded in the LinRegPCR program where relative mRNA expression levels were quantified based on an assumption-free analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic hippocampal slices of proaggregant Tau transgenic and littermate control mice were excised from the culture insert at DIV30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excised pieces of membrane were transferred to a Petri dish containing gelled medium (0.5% agarose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were left to recover in the incubator, after which they were transferred to the recording chamber and submerged in carbogenated aCSF (126 mM NaCl, 21 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.8 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4, 32 °C) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 using a broken tip filled with aCSF as a stimulus electrode and a 3-m aCSF filled glass pipette as a recording electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were sampled at 10 kHz, 10 times preamplified with a custom-made preamplifier, and processed using a HEKA double patch-clamp EPC 10 USB amplifier (HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acute_Slices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were sedated using isoflurane and killed by decapitation, after which the brain was rapidly extracted from the scull and submerged into cold (4 °C) carbonated aCSF (formulation as mentioned for the organotypic slices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transverse hippocampal slices (350 µm thick) were cut using a Leica VT 1200S vibratome and transferred to a storage chamber where they were left to recover for at least 1 h at room temperature in carbonated aCSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to four slices at a time were transferred to recording chambers of the multiple slice evaluation system Synchroslice [Lohmann Research Equipment (LRE)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were perfused with heated (32 °C ± 0.5 °C) aCSF with a flow rate of 1 mL per min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A monopolar (impedance, less_than100 k) electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum and a quartz glass insulated platinum/tungsten fiber electrode (Thomas Recording) was placed afferently from the stimulating electrode under visual control through a CCD camera system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data acquisition (sampling rate, 10 kHz per channel), electrical stimulation, and off-line analysis were done using the automated software (SynchroBrain; LRE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I/O curve amplitudes were averaged and fitted by a Boltzmann equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slopes were determined for PPR and LTP protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunoblot quantification of total Tau (antibody K9JA), phospho-Tau (12E8), and phospho-Tau (PHF-1), we performed a one-way ANOVA with Tukeys test for multiple comparisons as a post hoc test to test for statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spine density, mitochondrial density, and ATP levels were also tested for statistical significance by applying a one-way ANOVA with Tukeys test for multiple comparisons as a post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the qPCR-based miniscreen data, we used a two-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple-comparisons test for post hoc testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a two-way ANOVA with Tukeys test for multiple comparisons for post hoc testing to test differences in PPRs for statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the qPCR of the treated organotypic slices, we used a two-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple-comparisons test for post hoc testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a two-way ANOVA with Tukeys test for multiple comparisons for post hoc testing to test for the treatment effect of the treated organotypic slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For behavior testing (Y-maze, NORT, and fear conditioning), statistical analysis was performed using Students t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis of the electrophysiology data of acute slices (I/O curve slope, maximum EPSP amplitude, and the treatment effect in the PPR testing), we applied a two-way ANOVA with Tukeys test for multiple comparisons for post hoc testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
