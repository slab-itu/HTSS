Rewiring Yarrowia lipolytica toward triacetic acid lactone for materials generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polyketides are important molecules for both their bioactive traits and their potential as chemical building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, production of these molecules through chemistry and biocatalysts is restricted in yield and titer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that the nonconventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica can serve as a potent host for such production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of three separate pathways toward acetylCoA and malonylCoA in this host, enabling high-titer production of triacetic acid lactone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond achieving unprecedented titers and appreciable yields, this production capacity allows for both purification from fermentation broth and conversion into a material using simple reaction conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polyketides represent an extremely diverse class of secondary metabolites often explored for their bioactive traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules are also attractive building blocks for chemical catalysis and polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the use of polyketides in larger scale chemistry applications is stymied by limited titers and yields from both microbial and chemical production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that an oleaginous organism (specifically, Yarrowia lipolytica) can overcome such production limitations owing to a natural propensity for high flux through acetylCoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By exploring three distinct metabolic engineering strategies for acetylCoA precursor formation, we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized pyruvate bypass pathway supports increased production of the polyketide triacetic acid lactone (TAL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, we establish a strain capable of producing over 35% of the theoretical conversion yield to TAL in an unoptimized tube culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain also obtained an averaged maximum titer of 35.9 ± 3.9 g/L with an achieved maximum specific productivity of 0.21 ± 0.03 g/L/h in bioreactor fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we illustrate that a -oxidation-related overexpression (PEX10) can support high TAL production and is capable of achieving over 43% of the theoretical conversion yield under nitrogen starvation in a test tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, through use of this bioproduct, we demonstrate the utility of polyketides like TAL to modify commodity materials such as poly(epichlorohydrin), resulting in an increased molecular weight and shift in glass transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings establish an engineering strategy enabling unprecedented production from a type III polyketide synthase as well as establish a route through O-functionalization for converting polyketides into new materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Y_lipolytica_Can_Support_TAL_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High lipid flux in oleaginous organisms like Y. lipolytica suggests a strong potential for these organisms to produce alternative acetylCoA-derived products like polyketides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Y. lipolytica exhibits sufficient tolerance to many chemicals (20) including TAL to concentrations approaching the soluble limit (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these two features in place, we first established heterologous TAL production in Y. lipolytica through expression of the codon-optimized Gerbera hybrida 2-pyrone synthase gene, g2ps1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this initial strain produced TAL (SI Appendix, Fig S13), further amplifying the gene copy number to four enabled 2.1 g/L production in tube fermentations (defined medium including CSM, YNB, and glucose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain, named YT, was selected as the starting point for further metabolic engineering work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies of previously characterized mutants of g2ps1 established in E. coli (10) were also tested but produced lower titers than the wild-type allele (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Previously_Uncharacterized_Y_lipolytica_Pyruvate_Bypass_Pathway_Improves_TAL_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To increase metabolic flux through acetylCoA and malonylCoA, we investigated three independent metabolic engineering strategies (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we explored the citrate routea pathway that has been extensively studied for its capacity to increase lipid production in Y. lipolytica (2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of ACC1, which codes for the enzyme that converts acetylCoA to malonylCoA, has also been shown to promote lipid production (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the pathway genes (ACL1, ACL2, and AMPD) were concurrently overexpressed, TAL production was significantly reduced and only marginally improved with the addition of ACC1 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we explored the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex pathway [located in the mitochondria in S. cerevisiae (26)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the citrate route, this pathway has not been extensively studied in Y. lipolytica, but would theoretically enable a direct path to convert pyruvate to acetylCoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The related alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which shares one subunit with the PDH complex, has been previously overexpressed to promote alpha-ketoglutaric acid production (27), suggesting a similar strategy may be successful here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this approach, we established a coordinated overexpression of the different subunits for this complex (encoded by PDA1, PDE2, PDE3, and PDB1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining this pathway with ACC1 overexpression, overall TAL production was significantly improved by 23%, achieving 2.5 g/L (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, we investigated the pyruvate bypass pathway, which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde through pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), then to acetate through acetylaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD), and finally to acetylCoA via acetylCoA synthetase (ACS) (26, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has targeted this pathway using heterologous enzymes (29); however, the function and potential of the native Y. lipolytica pyruvate bypass pathway has not been previously explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a single ACS gene had been previously characterized in Y. lipolytica (27), two PDC homologs (arbitrarily named PDC1 and PDC2) and five potential ALD homologs were identified based on previous yeast homology studies (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we established a full combinatorial assembly of this pathway in the YT strain background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the previous two approaches, ACC1 overexpression did not consistently increase production for all combinations tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, four genetic combinations emerged as the top TAL-producing strains including ACS1, ALD5, PDC2, ACC1 (64.7% improvement over YT), ACS1, ALD3, PDC1, ACC1 (61.1% improvement), ACS1, ALD2, PDC2, ACC1 (31.7% improvement), and ACS1, ALD3, PDC2, ACC1 (17.9% improvement) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top strain from this effort (YT- ACS1, ALD5, PDC2, ACC1) produced 2.8 g/L of TAL in tube fermentations, equivalent to 30.4% of the theoretical yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modification_of_-oxidation_Can_Likewise_Improve_TAL_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative (and potentially complementary) approach to increase acetylCoA pools, we targeted participants in the -oxidation pathway for overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we evaluated the transcription factor Por1 [reported in other hosts to increase polyketide formation (31)] and the peroxisomal matrix protein Pex10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When overexpressed in the YT background, POR1 had no effect on TAL production, whereas PEX10 overexpression increased TAL titer by 22% (2.4 g/L) (Fig 3), suggesting -oxidation up-regulation as a strategy for acetylCoA recycling if it cannot be shuttled away from lipid synthesis effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is intriguing as Pex10p is not directly involved in the catalytic conversion of fatty acids to acetylCoA and thus provides an area for further biochemical study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strain_Engineering_Effectively_Diverted_Flux_from_Lipids_to_TAL  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the true efficacy of these four rewiring strategies, both lipid and TAL production were evaluated from tube fermentations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a clear, inverse correlation between TAL titer and lipid titer with an R2 of 0.89 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results demonstrate that the PDH complex, pyruvate bypass, and PEX10 overexpressions can divert acetylCoA from lipids into TAL, whereas the citrate pathway is strongly coupled to lipid formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Culture_Conditions_Differentially_Alter_TAL_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Y. lipolytica is highly responsive to environmental factors, and thus we evaluated a series of conditions for increased TAL production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we evaluated the impact of nitrogen starvation, a strategy commonly used in Y. lipolytica to induce lipid formation (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the impact was varied across the various rewiring schemes (SI Appendix, Fig S3A) with the most significant improvement observed in the PEX10 overexpression strain (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When grown in C20N2 media, this strain achieved a greater than twofold increase over the YT strain under normal conditions (reaching 4.1 g/L in a test tube, 43.4% theoretical yield).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further nitrogen limitation did not improve TAL production as a result of the expense to growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, a series of supplements (SI Appendix) and different carbon sources were tested as spikes or sole carbon sources along with glucose as a control (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest gains in TAL titer were realized through providing an acetate spike when the pyruvate bypass pathway was overexpressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the top strain from the pyruvate bypass pathway produced 4.9 g/L TAL in a test tube (representing over 35% of the theoretical conversion yield calculated from both glucose and acetate fed) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of acetate consumption indicates this result is not simply due to acetate acting as a carbon source for TAL production, as a substantial portion of the fed acetate still remains at the end of the fermentation (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests a more regulatory or redox-related impact on metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further to this point, in S. cerevisiae, acetate feeding has been shown to induce changes to metabolism mediated through protein acetylation (32, 33), a possible mechanism to be explored here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, acetylaldehyde dehydrogenase activity assays suggest pathway engineering (especially with ALD5) resulted in altered redox cofactor usage favoring NAD+ over NADP+ (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an overall redox and regulatory mechanism may explain the almost twofold increase in TAL production observed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, this improvement was not seen under nitrogen-limited conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S3B), suggesting that these two strategies (acetate feed and nitrogen starvation) are not compatible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bioreactor_Cultivation_Boosts_Overall_TAL_Titer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fermentation of the pyruvate bypass overexpression strain (YT- ACS1, ALD5, PDC2, ACC1) with acetate spiking was scaled up to the 3-L bioreactor scale (YP, 18% glucose, 13.7 g/L acetate spike).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After optimization, fermentation resulted in production of 35.9 ± 3.9 g/L of TAL (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scale-up, we achieve a substantially improved productivity over the previous batch cultures, upward of a fourfold increase to a glucose-phase maximum specific productivity of 0.21 ± 0.03 g/L/h (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a long fermentation time was necessary, this timescale is comparable to a previously published TAL study (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall productivity reported here [0.12 g/L/h (SI Appendix, Table S4)] improves upon the previous report in S. cerevisiae by greater than sixfold (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this production level is well outside the soluble range of TAL, substantial in situ precipitation occurred, an attractive feature for industrial production, but a unique source of sampling error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we observed a diauxic shift from glucose to (produced) citrate utilization (Fig 6A) that leads to an increased production as cell viability stagnates and even decreases throughout the process (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biosourced_TAL_Can_Be_Incorporated_into_a_Polymer_Through_O-Functionalization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we leveraged the newfound bulk-availability of polyketides such as TAL to demonstrate their utility in the modification of polymer properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL serves a dual role as both a polymer modifier but also a functional adduct for later chemical derivatization owing to its lactone and unsaturated functionalities (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL was rapidly extracted and purified from fermentation broth and ultimately used for the modification of structure and properties of commodity poly(epichlorohydrin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was achieved through heat and an activating organic base 1,8-Diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU) (Fig 7A) (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, the displacement of chloride through the O-functionalization of TAL was evident spectroscopically, chromatographically, and thermally through the use of NMR spectroscopy (Fig 7B and SI Appendix, Fig S8), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Table 1), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of TAL incorporated along the poly(epichlorohydrin) backbone was tuned stoichiometrically from 16 to 83% by mole resulting in poly[(epichlorohydrin)-co-(epoxy triacetic acid lactone)] or PETAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the compositionally dependent changes in the glassy amorphous solid based on molecular weight and glass transition temperature of PETAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular weight was seen to increase proportionately to the amount of TAL incorporated as measured by size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light-scattering detection to yield absolute number-average molecular weights (Mn) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While poly(epichlorohydrin) exhibits a native glass transition temperature (Tg) of 30 °C, this value was markedly increased and strongly dependent on TAL incorporation with the highest TAL composition (83% by mole) exhibiting a Tg of 70 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final product can be formed into a film and is seen to exhibit a unique hue and relative transparency (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the orange color of the polymer is due to the native color of covalently bound TAL, as no other characteristic spectroscopic differences were observed via UV-Vis spectroscopy (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the reaction rate obtained with this purified, biosourced TAL was comparable to a reaction conducted with commercially sourced TAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the biosourced PETAL structure and properties fall exactly along the trend observed using commercially sourced TAL, again supporting that there is no difference (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the residual lactone and unsaturated functionality from TAL repeat units offer a unique future strategy toward further modification of material properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strains used in this study were constructed in the wild-type Y. lipolytica strain, PO1f, through random genomic integration employing a sequential overexpression strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL concentrations were assessed via reverse-phase HPLC following 96-h tube fermentations at 28 °C in defined media containing 2% glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioreactor fermentations were performed at the 3-L scale at pH 6.5 in YP media with 18% glucose and a 13.7 g/L sodium acetate spike at 36 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, this work demonstrates the use of an oleaginous organism for high-level production of an acetylCoA and malonylCoA-derived polyketide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we establish a previously uncharacterized pyruvate bypass pathway as superior for rewiring CoA flux from lipid biosynthesis and into high-level TAL production reaching a titer of 35.9 ± 3.85 g/L in a bioreactor and overall yield of 0.164 g/g in a tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional engineering efforts related to the -oxidation pathway increased yields to 0.203 g/g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The achieved titer far exceeds previous efforts in the field with conventional organisms (a summary of the achieved titers and yields in this work is provided in SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-level production enabled rapid purification and conversion into a unique polymer with favorable molecular weight and glass transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work and resulting strain provides a path forward for microbial production of other acetylCoA and malonylCoA-derived polyketides for novel applications such as polymers and chemical conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
