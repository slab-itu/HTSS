Cross-genus rebooting of custom-made, synthetic bacteriophage genomes in L-form bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unique host specificity and antimicrobial activity of bacterial viruses have inspired many diagnostic and antibacterial applications in industry, agriculture, and medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections, phage therapy is a reemerging field of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many restrictions that are associated with the use of native, isolated phages can be overcome by genetic engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, efficient genome-editing tools are needed to unleash the full potential of phage therapy and biotechnology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro assembly of synthetic virus genomes and the rapid isolation of corresponding phages is an important step in this direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using L-form bacteria as rebooting compartments of synthetic genomes, we report a simple, highly efficient, and broadly applicable technology that enables engineering of diverse phage families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Engineered bacteriophages provide powerful tools for biotechnology, diagnostics, pathogen control, and therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current techniques for phage editing are experimentally challenging and limited to few phages and host organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viruses that target Gram-positive bacteria are particularly difficult to modify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a platform technology that enables rapid, accurate, and selection-free construction of synthetic, tailor-made phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, custom-designed, synthetic phage genomes were assembled in vitro from smaller DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that replicating, cell wall-deficient Listeria monocytogenes L-form bacteria can reboot synthetic phage genomes upon transfection, i.e., produce virus particles from naked, synthetic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, Listeria L-form cells not only support rebooting of native and synthetic Listeria phage genomes but also enable cross-genus reactivation of Bacillus and Staphylococcus phages from their DNA, thereby broadening the approach to phages that infect other important Gram-positive pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used this platform to generate virulent phages by targeted modification of temperate phage genomes and demonstrated their superior killing efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These synthetic, virulent phages were further armed by incorporation of enzybiotics into their genomes as a genetic payload, which allowed targeting of phage-resistant bystander cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, this straightforward and robust synthetic biology approach redefines the possibilities for the development of improved and completely new phage applications, including phage therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Rebooting_Genomic_Bacteriophage_DNA_in_Listeria_monocytogenes_L-Form_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L-form bacteria are pleomorphic, wall-deficient cells that undergo division and feature metabolic activity (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-forms have the ability to take up large molecules of DNA (25, 26) and should be able to replicate, transcribe, and translate newly introduced genetic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these assumptions, we evaluated L-form cells of Listeria monocytogenes as recipients and rebooting compartments for native, purified phage gDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Listeria L-form cells can be generated by prolonged subcultivation in the presence of cell wall-active antibiotics in an osmoprotective environment (24, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a L. monocytogenes EGDe strain variant designated Rev2, which can rapidly be induced to grow as an L-form (designated Rev2L) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide a proof of concept for the rebooting approach, we used gDNA of the virulent L. monocytogenes phage P35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its 35,822-bp linear gDNA (28) is too large for electroporation into walled Listeria cells, which only accept supercoiled plasmids of up to 10 kb with low efficiency (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We devised a workflow for PEG-mediated transfection of Rev2L bacteria with full-length phage DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, purified gDNA was mixed with cells from a growing penicillin G (PenG)-induced Rev2L culture, and gDNA uptake was mediated by addition of PEG-8000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following dilution in osmotically stabilized L-form medium (modified DM3), the transfection reaction was incubated to allow rebooting, i.e., DNA uptake, phage gene expression, and virus assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we assayed the transfection reaction for the presence of reactivated phages using a suitable phage propagation strain as an indicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A workflow is shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that P35 could be rebooted in a gDNA-, L-form-, and PEG-dependent process (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize phage yield, each step of the rebooting protocol was optimized (Fig S1 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a linear correlation between input DNA quantity and phage production (Fig 1C), with a lower detection limit of 2.6 pg of P35 gDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to about 66,000 genomes, assuming that the DNA used consisted solely of intact, infectious gDNA (the quality of phage DNA was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) (Fig S1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides P35, the L-form transfection protocol allowed rebooting of seven other Listeria phages (Fig 1D and Fig S2) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included both temperate (B025, B035, B056, PSA) and virulent (P70, P100, A511) phages, some with large genomes (130 kb; P100, A511), and morphologically diverse phages featuring either contractile (Myoviruses; P100, A511) or noncontractile (Siphoviruses; all other) tails.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phage genomes used featured either single-stranded overlapping cohesive ends (hereafter, cos phages; B025, PSA) or terminally redundant DNA molecules, with or without circular permutation (A511, P100, P70, P35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that rebooting is largely independent of virus morphology, genome structure, DNA packaging mode, replication strategy, and genome size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we were able to produce Listeria phages that would normally not infect the walled Rev2 strain (P70, B025, B035, B056, and PSA) (Fig S1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that virus attachment and/or genome translocation are the major barriers restricting the infectious range of these phages among the different serovars of Listeria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diverse features of the reactivated Listeria phages (summarized in Table S1) indicate that Rev2L represents a suitable rebooting compartment for all Listeria phage genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rebooting kinetics of phages P35, P70, and A511 (Fig 1E) revealed that virus production peaked at 24 h posttransfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large volume of the L-form cells and their attenuated metabolic activity (24, 27) may explain why rebooting is a slow process compared with infection of walled cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because L-forms are devoid of a cell wall, progeny phages are released by osmotic disruption when transfected Rev2L cells are diluted with nonstabilized medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption releases any viral particles produced from heterologous DNA, including phages that cannot bind or infect Rev2, and/or whose cell wall lytic enzymes (endolysins) are unable to degrade Listeria peptidoglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Listeria_L-Forms_Reboot_Phage_Genomes_from_Other_Gram-Positive_Bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By transfecting L-form bacteria, we were able to bypass the first and last steps of the phage infection cycle but not virus genome replication, gene expression, and virion morphogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system allowed us to explore whether Listeria L-forms could possibly reactivate genomes of phages specific for other Gram-positive pathogens (but which cannot infect Listeria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the 37.46-kb Siphovirus TP21-L (31) of Bacillus cereus (Fig 2A) as well as the large, 153.96-kb Myovirus Bastille (32) of Bacillus thuringiensis (Fig S3A) can be rebooted in Rev2L and subsequently infect their original Bacillus host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Listeria L-forms also supported rebooting of Staphylococcus aureus phage 2638A (33), a 41.32-kb Siphovirus (Fig S3B), and phage K (34), a large 127.40-kb Myovirus (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We de novo sequenced two reactivated L. monocytogenes phage P35 clones as well as two S. aureus phage 2638A clones and compared their sequence to the transfected DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one noncoding point mutation in one 2638A clone was found, suggesting that facilitating mutations are not required for rebooting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that Rev2L represents a highly versatile system for uptake and cross-genus rebooting of phages from linear gDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Efficient_Rebooting_of_Synthetic__in_Vitro-Assembled_Phage_Genomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To enable phage engineering, we tested rebooting of fully synthetic phage genomes (workflow in Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we amplified overlapping segments of phage DNA and reassembled them using the Gibson method (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most phages require circular genome replication intermediates (36), overlaps between fragments were designed to allow end-joining (circular closure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used six fragments of about 6 kb to assemble synthetic genomes of Listeria phage P35 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An incomplete assembly lacking fragment three (f3) served as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Rev2L efficiently reboots phage P35 from in vitro-assembled DNA (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, synthetic DNA yielded a higher rebooting efficiency than native phage gDNA (detection limit, 1.1 pg DNA) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be explained by the fact that synthetic gDNA is already circularized, whereas native genomes need to be closed inside the L-form cell after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the fraction of infectious genomes in native phage DNA preparations may have been low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to P35, we assembled and rebooted synthetic genomes of temperate Listeria phages PSA (37) and B025 (28) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate reactivation of synthetic phages from other genera, assembly and rebooting of B. cereus phage TP21-L was also established (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rebooting synthetic phage genomes in L-form bacteria offers a broadly applicable platform technology for phage engineering that enables full control of sequence composition and organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By modification, removal, addition, or reorganization of individual fragments in the assembly, any genome configuration can be realized in a single step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the input DNA is defined, all emerging phages have the desired sequence, which eliminates lengthy screening procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Rev2L cells also reboot phage genomes across otherwise conserved genus boundaries, the technology is applicable to other relevant Gram-positive pathogens, such as bacilli and staphylococci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, engineering is fast, requiring only 6 d from in silico phage design to isolation of the synthetic virus (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modifying_Temperate_Phage_Genomes_to_Create_Synthetic__Virulent_Phages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we applied the synthetic platform to create tailor-made phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any antibacterial phage application, including phage therapy, requires strictly lytic viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, virulent candidate phages that feature the desired host range, killing efficiency, and physical properties must be identified from natural isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we applied the rebooting platform to rapidly create virulent phages using temperate phages as genetic backbones, a process we call virulent conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we de novo assembled the genome of temperate Listeria phage B025 (28) but removed the gene cluster encoding the lysogeny control functions that mediate genome integration and prophage maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In B025, these genes are located on a 2.7-kb genetic module (28), the lysogeny control region (LCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed synthetic genomes to lack either just the repressor of the lytic cycle (B025 rep) or the entire LCR, including the integrase (B025 LCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembly strategy is shown in Fig 4A, and fragments for the assembly of mutant phage genomes are shown in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineered genomes were then rebooted, plaque phenotypes visualized (Fig 4C), and phage genomes validated by PCR (LCR-PCR) (Fig S7) and sequencing of the LCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the soft-agar overlay method to visualize multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent host-cell killing by the engineered B025 phages (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, synthetic B025 WT phages integrated readily, and lysogenization effectively prevented subsequent killing of the host, especially at higher MOIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a seemingly unperturbed bacterial lawn, which consisted of homoimmune WSLC 3009::B025 lysogens (Fig S8), was obtained after overnight incubation (B025 WT 105/106 pfu) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the virulent B025 derivatives B025 rep and B025 LCR displayed strongly enhanced killing efficacy and lysed almost all host cells at an identical MOI (105/106 pfu) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few survivors were able to regrow upon infection with the mutants after 48 h (Fig 4D, 3-fold magnified areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These survivors were not genetically resistant to B025 but regained sensitivity within one passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that they featured an empty integration site (Fig S8), confirming the lack of lysogenization by LCR-mutant phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar approach was applied to B. cereus phage TP21-L, from which we also removed either the repressor or the complete LCR (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that virulent conversion represents a fast and broadly applicable method to increase the arsenal of phages with strong lytic activity, an important prerequisite for applications in biocontrol and especially for phage therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_Arming_Enables_Control_of_Phage-Resistant_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence and selection of phage-resistant cells within a bacterial target population can hamper the potential application of bacteriophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proof of concept, we addressed this limitation using phage PSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temperate virus specifically infects L. monocytogenes serovar 4b cells (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same strategy as for B025, we first removed the LCR of PSA to yield a virulent derivative that can no longer integrate into the tRNA attB site (PSA LCR, virulent conversion) (37, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To target phage-resistant cells, we introduced an additional effector gene into synthetic PSA WT and PSA LCR phage genomes as genetic payload, a strategy we refer to as arming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effector is synthesized during the lytic cycle, coreleased upon host cell lysis, and subsequently acts on neighboring cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, PSA WT and PSA LCR phages were armed with an additional, heterologous endolysin gene derived from Listeria phage A511 (ply511).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to PSAs endogenous endolysin (PlyPSA), Ply511 efficiently degrades cells of all Listeria serovars, including serovar 1/2 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy for LCR deletion and incorporation of ply511 into the late gene cluster of PSA and PSA LCR and the validation of recombinants are shown in Fig S10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that expression of ply511 from modified PSA genomes results in the formation of very large plaques with a characteristic halo (Fig 5A) caused by the diffusion and enzymatic activity of the A511 endolysin effector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for phage B025, deletion of the PSA LCR induced a strong lytic phenotype in plate culture (Fig 5B, 106 pfu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PSA LCR, the combination of LCR deletion with ply511 expression (PSA LCR ply511) significantly reduced the occurrence of survivors (Fig 5B, magnified areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested the ability of all PSA derivatives to kill target bacteria in liquid culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A PSA-sensitive culture of L. monocytogenes serovar 4b cells was infected at an MOI of 0.1, and OD was monitored over time (Fig 5C, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, to determine the control of Listeria cells that are resistant to phage PSA infection, the sensitive host strain was mixed with a PSA-resistant strain (serovar 1/2) at a sensitive:resistant ratio of 10:1 (Fig 5C, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of rapid lysogenization and subsequent growth of homoimmune cells, both PSA WT and the armed but nonvirulent PSA derivative (PSA ply511) were unable to control bacterial growth in both assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While virulent conversion was sufficient to control phage-sensitive cells, the sensitive:resistant host cell mixture could not be cleared by the virulent PSA derivative (Fig 5C, PSA LCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by targeting via the released cell wall hydrolase payload, the combination of virulent conversion and enzymatic arming (Fig 5C, PSA LCR ply511) equipped the synthetic phage with the ability to efficiently control native host cells and PSA-resistant serovar 1/2 cells in mixed culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our results demonstrate that rational design of synthetic phages can provide antimicrobial agents with specifically tailored killing functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthetic genome rebooting allows rapid, selection-free engineering and production of genetically modified phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that, unlike CRISPR-based editing and other recombination-based strategies, this approach offers complete and unrestricted freedom of genome design and editing, including major rearrangements, hybrid phages, and even fully tailor-made genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple modifications can be incorporated at once, in a single assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is fully independent of transformation and recombination efficiencies of the host organism and circumvents cloning of genes potentially toxic to an intermediate host cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Rev2L L-forms can be employed not only for rebooting of Listeria phage genomes but also for reactivation of viruses infecting Bacillus, Staphylococcus and likely other Gram-positive hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the synthetic platform is broadly applicable and does not require any additional specialized strains for recombinant phage construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The virulent conversion and arming approach demonstrates the utility of rebooting for the construction of phages with customized antimicrobial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology will facilitate modifications that have previously been very difficult or impossible, such as incorporation of reporter genes for pathogen detection or host-range alterations by modification of receptor-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also allow the incorporation and phage-mediated production of any desired genetic payload.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be of particular interest for the delivery of therapeutic genes to specific bacterial populations within complex environments, such as the gut microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because rebooting of synthetic genomes is highly efficient (Fig S4), this platform technology will also permit screening of DNA fragment libraries in a directed evolution approach, for example using error-prone PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, directed evolution of defined genome fragments may allow the generation of phages with altered host range or increased stability and circulation half-life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, many aspects of basic phage biology are still poorly understood, mostly due to the lack of efficient genetic tools for mutation, deletion, and molecular tagging of phage genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are convinced that the approach presented here will contribute substantially to an enhanced understanding of the biology of these versatile self-replicating units and will pave the way for novel phage-based applications beyond their use as biocontrol and detection agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
