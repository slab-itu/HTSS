QTY code enables design of detergent-free chemokine receptors that retain ligand-binding activities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QTY (glutamine, threonine, and tyrosine) code-designed detergent-free chemokine receptors may be useful in many applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY variants may be useful not only as reagents in deorphanization studies but also for designing biologics to treat cancer and autoimmune or infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY code allows membrane proteins to be systematically designed through simple, specific amino acid substitutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY code is robust and straightforward: It is the simplest tool to carry out membrane protein design without sophisticated computer algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it can be used broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY code has implications for designing additional G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane proteins or, potentially, for rendering water-insoluble and aggregated proteins soluble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure and function studies of membrane proteins, particularly G protein-coupled receptors and multipass transmembrane proteins, require detergents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have devised a simple tool, the QTY code (glutamine, threonine, and tyrosine), for designing hydrophobic domains to become water soluble without detergents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report using the QTY code to systematically replace the hydrophobic amino acids leucine, valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine in the seven transmembrane -helices of CCR5, CXCR4, CCR10, and CXCR7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that QTY code-designed chemokine receptor variants retain their thermostabilities, -helical structures, and ligand-binding activities in buffer and 50% human serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, and CXCR7QTY also bind to HIV coat protein gp41-120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite substantial transmembrane domain changes, the detergent-free QTY variants maintain stable structures and retain their ligand-binding activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe the QTY code will be useful for designing water-soluble variants of membrane proteins and other water-insoluble aggregated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The QTY code and how it replaces L, V, I, and F with Q, T, and Y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Crystallographic electronic density maps of the following amino acids: leucine (L), asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), isoleucine (I), valine (V), threonine (T), phenylalanine (F), and tyrosine (Y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density maps of L, N, and Q are very similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the density maps of I, V, and T are similar, and the density maps of F and Y are similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The side chains of L, V, I, and F cannot form any hydrogen bonds with water, thus rendering them water insoluble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, N and Q can form four hydrogen bonds with four water molecules, two as hydrogen donors and two as hydrogen acceptors (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, three water molecules can form hydrogen bonds with the OH (two H-donors and one H-acceptor) of threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both L and Q have high tendencies to form -helices, but N frequently occurs at turns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Q was used to replace L but not N. I, V, and T are all -branched amino acids, and their density maps are very similar, indicating similar shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Helical wheels before (Left) and after (Right) applying the QTY code to transmembrane helical segment 1 (TM1) of CXCR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amino acids that interact with water molecules are light blue in color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY code conversions render the -helical segment water soluble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MT, mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence_Alignments_of_CCR5__CXCR4__CCR10__and_CXCR7_and_Their_QTY_Variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence alignments were performed for CCR5 vs. CCR5QTY, CXCR4 vs. CXCR4QTY, CCR10 vs. CCR10QTY, and CXCR7 vs. CXCR7QTY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows protein characteristics and alignments of the transmembrane (TM) -helical segments of the native receptors and their QTY variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the amino acids Q, T, and Y do not introduce any charges, despite substantial sequence QTY substitutions, there are minimal changes in pI units (0.11, 0.06, 0.24, and 0.02 for CCR5, CXCR4, CCR10, and CXCR7 and their QTY variants, respectively), and in molecular weight (1.13%, 1.15%, 1.97%, and 1.13% for CCR5, CXCR4, CCR10, and CXCR7 and their QTY variants, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After applying the QTY code, the hydrophobic amino acids in the transmembrane segments are replaced by Q, T, or Y, and the transmembrane segments are no longer hydrophobic (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Initial_Development_of_the_QTY_Variant_of_CXCR4QTY  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the X-ray crystal structure of CXCR4 (26), we initially used the QTY code to change only 28 positions (CXCR4QTY-v28) (SI Appendix, Fig S3) on the lipid-facing exterior surfaces of TM1, TM2, TM4, TM6, and TM7 but not on the interior surface or dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the protein could not be expressed and purified without detergents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then substituted 56 positions (CXCR4QTY-v56) in the 7TM region using a random library of 2 million variants using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we selected 16 possible Y2H variant candidates and tried to express them in both E. coli and yeast, they failed to express well (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our current report, we changed 85 LIVF positions in all 7TMs of CXCR4 (CXCR4QTY-v85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further increase the solubility of CXCR4QTY, we also applied the QTY code to the internal regions ICL1 (1L), ICL2 (2L), and ICL3 (3I) and to the C terminus (2F, 3L, 2V, and 1I) since these regions do not interact directly with the ligand CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One L was changed in EC1 since it was reported that EC2 and EC3 are most important for ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time, the protein expressed well in water-soluble form without any detergents and retained its ligand-binding activity for CXCL12 and gp41-120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of these results, QTY substitutions were introduced to all 7TMs of CCR10QTY and CXCR7QTY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Expressions_and_Purifications_of_QTY_Variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We synthesized the genes with organism-specific codons and first expressed CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY in SF9 insect cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each receptor carried a C-terminal His-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified protein yields from insect SF9 cells were low and inadequate for structural analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain sufficient protein for structural and other studies, CXCR4QTY was expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies that reached 10 mg/L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion bodies were extensively washed and denatured in 6 M guanidineHCl and 10 mM DTT, 1Ã— PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR4QTY was then purified with a His-tag and was re-refolded in a renaturing buffer containing 0.5 M l-arginine, which is a key ingredient required for correct refolding, but without DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEC (SI Appendix, Fig S5) of the renatured receptor showed either monomers (CCR10QTY) or dimers (CXCR4QTY).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is similar to the native CXCR4, since both crystal structures (27) and cell-based assays show CXCR4 is a dimer (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ligand-Binding_Measurements_in_Buffer_and_in_50%_Human_Serum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The optical method MST (3642) uses the fluorescence signal coming from labeled QTY proteins to monitor their movement in a thermal gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence in the optical focus is localized; hence active and inactive protein fractions will contribute to the signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in thermophoresis upon binding of a ligand to the QTY proteins is detected and plotted as a ligand concentration-dependent effect, which is then converted to affinity values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since thermophoresis of only active QTY proteins will change during a binding event, inactive proteins will influence the data only as background signal and will not contribute to the binding event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the derived binding data come from active protein fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MST was used for ligand-binding measurements in both buffer and in 50% human serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain unambiguous ligand-binding results, each sample was independently measured three times in duplicate (six total measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that the purified detergent-free forms of CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY retain their ligand-binding activities (Fig 3 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is known that natural CCR5, CXCR4, and CXCR7 bind to HIV1 coat protein gp41-120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus carried out binding measurements for CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, and CXCR7QTY (Fig 3E and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR5QTY from SF9 cells was independently purified twice in 6 mo and the ligand binding also was independently measured twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR4QTY from E. coli inclusion body purification and refolding was independently purified twice in 1 mo, and the ligand binding was also independently measured three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early purified CXCR4QTY had a Kd of 17 nM, and the late CXCR4QTY had a Kd of 13 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rule out nonspecific binding, we measured the affinity of human insulin for CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reproducible measurements demonstrate that these detergent-free variants do not bind to human insulin (Fig 3), suggesting that the QTY receptors bind to their ligands with some specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, CXCR7QTY has a lower Kd for CXCL12 and HIV gp41-120 than CXCR4QTY (Fig 3 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermal_Stability_of_the_QTY_Variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the thermal stability of the QTY variants, three independent nanoDSF (nano differential scanning fluorimetry) measurements were carried out (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the average Tms of 52.7 Â°C for CCR5QTY, 46.8 Â°C (Tm1) and 63.5 Â°C (Tm2) for CXCR4QTY, 54.8 Â°C for CCR10QTY, and 52.3 Â°C for CXCR7QTY are similar to the Tms of the natural receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, natural CXCR4 embedded in liposomes exhibited two Tms: 55 Â°C (Tm1) for monomers and 60 Â°C (Tm2) for dimers (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls were carried out by heating the proteins to 90 Â°C for 15 min before taking three independent measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were fully denatured and produced no measurable Tm (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that, despite significant QTY amino acid changes, the detergent-free CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY still fold and remain thermostable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that the QTY replacements introduce numerous hydrogen bonds from intra- and interhelical interactions (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD_and_Fluorescence_Studies_of_QTY-Variant_Protein_Structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QTY variant receptors were studied using CD, and they showed distinctive -helical spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the purified CCR5QTY and CXCR7QTY in buffer containing 150 mM NaF and 5 mM DTT to carry out the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Far UV spectra between 183 and 260 nm confirm typical -helical secondary structures for CCR5QTY and CXCR7QTY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the -helical content of CCR5QTY (55%) and CXCR7QTY (60%) is similar to that of native CCR5 (59%) (29) and CXCR7 (64%, from secondary structural prediction) (SI Appendix, Fig S6A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tryptophan fluorescence spectra with 295-nm excitation of CCR5QTY and CXCR7QTY displayed maximum emission at 334 nm and 338 nm, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S6B), suggesting the mean hydrophobic microenvironment of the tryptophan side chains is neither completely hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, as expected for a folded QTY protein (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both tryptophan and tyrosine were excited at 275 nm, the maxima of the fluorescence emission spectra shifted to 332 nm for both CCR5QTY and CXCR7QTY, which indicates weak emission by tyrosines (SI Appendix, Fig S6B, Inset) despite the high number of tyrosines in the QTY proteins (42 tyrosines and 5 tryptophans in CCR5QTY, 31 tyrosines and 7 tryptophans in CXCR7QTY).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weakening of tyrosine fluorescence centered at 303 nm is due to the FÃ¶rster energy transfer from tyrosine to nearby tryptophan residues (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the QTY proteins fold into a compact tertiary structure with the expected secondary structure content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computer_Simulations_of_the_QTY_Variants_in_an_Explicit_Water_Environment_at_2485_Â°C__pH_74__and_09%_NaCl_for_1_Âµs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution structures of CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, or CXCR7QTY are still in progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent advances in computer simulations of protein sequences make it possible to predict reasonably realistic structures based on homology (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether the CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY (Fig 5), CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY (SI Appendix, Fig S8) structures are stable by simulating them in an explicit water environment at 24.85 Â°C, pH 7.4, and 0.9% NaCl for 1 Âµs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they are not stable, these structures will not fold correctly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial 0.3 Âµs of simulations using the AMBER14 force field software (43), the overall structures were already formed and seemed to be stable; additional 0.7-Âµs simulations did not further stabilize these structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the simulations, CXCR4QTY and CCR5QTY were superimposed with crystal structures of the natural receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparisons showed that CXCR4QTY and CXCR4 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3ODU] (27) had a deviation of 1.9 Ã…, and CCR5QTY and CCR5 (PDB ID code 4MBS) (28) had a deviation of 2 Ã….  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Basis_of_the_QTY_Code  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The scientific and structural basis of the QTY code is the fact that the electronic density maps of Q and L, T and V/I, and Y and F are similar and that all 20 amino acids are found in -helices (1518), although some residues, e.g., L and Q, are preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the QTY code shows that amino acid structures rather than chemical properties may facilitate protein structures in transmembrane -helices (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite 50% changes in the transmembrane segments (SI Appendix, Fig S2), the QTY code-designed CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY not only maintained their overall structure but also bound their respective ligands (Fig 3 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measuring_Ligand_Binding_in_Human_Serum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured ligand binding of the QTY code-designed chemokine receptors in both buffer and 50% human serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptors have approximately two to four times lower affinity in serum than in buffer (Fig 3 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are expected since human serum is very complex and contains numerous substances, including 20 amino acids, metabolic intermediates, peptides, proteins, and more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the affinities measured in serum are perhaps more realistic for physiological conditions, since the receptors are often exposed to a serum-like environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible_Additional_Hydrogen_Bond_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We asked how the protein structures remain stable and retain ligand-binding activity even after substantial substitutions of the hydrophobic residues in 7TM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional hydrogen bonds (SI Appendix, Fig S7) created by the Q, T, and Y amino acid substitutions likely contribute to the observed stability: Numerous internal intrahelical and interhelical hydrogen bonds that stabilize the structures of the QTY variants are likely formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation is similar to the molecular structures of various collagens that have extensive water molecule bridges stabilizing their structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hydrogen bonds cannot form in the native CCR5, CXCR4, CCR10, and CXCR7, since the side chains of L, V, I, and F do not have hydrogen bond-forming capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible_Uses_of_the_QTY_Code-Designed_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QTY code-designed detergent-free chemokine receptors may be useful in many applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible to use QTY variant receptors in a manner similar to water-soluble kinases and proteases for drug discoveries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They may potentially be used as reagents in deorphanization studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also may be possible to use them as biologics to treat cancer and autoimmune or infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Latest_Work_by_Others  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, researchers in William DeGrados laboratory designed a 25-residue -helical peptide called AMmem that is intrinsically water-insoluble and forms a cross- amyloid-like structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They converted it into a water-soluble form called AMs by changing six residues: L5E, I8R, I9K, L16K, L19K, and I22E (6/25 = 24%) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They determined and compared these crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of the water-insoluble AMmem and water-soluble AMs are remarkably similar (figure 2 df in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their results further demonstrate that specific changes (6/25) in -helical segments can still preserve the stable -helical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simplicity_Is_the_Ultimate_Sophistication_(Leonard_da_Vinci)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QTY code may allow membrane proteins to be systematically designed through simple, specific amino acid substitutions (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the QTY code is robust and straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the simplest tool to carry out membrane protein design without sophisticated computer algorithms and can be used broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that the QTY code may have implications for designing additional GPCRs and other membrane proteins or perhaps water-insoluble and aggregated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bioinformatics_of_the_QTY_Variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The variant protein sequences were first evaluated to determine if transmembrane segments still existed using the web-based tool TMHMM Server v.2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) that predicts transmembrane helices (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Y2H_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We initially used a Y2H assay (SI Appendix, Fig S4) to study interactions between the QTY variants and their respective ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a Y2H system as an in vivo assay to test the QTY variants for ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the variants interacted with their ligands, the receptorligand pairs activated gene transcription, thus enabling yeast cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variants were further subjected to control assays to eliminate false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each protein, a two-step purification strategy of affinity chromatography combined with SEC was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the amount of protein binding to the affinity chromatography resin was initially low, we screened for different additives to improve the purification yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, ammonium sulfate and 10 mM DTT were very important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the early phase of purification, 10 mM DTT resulted in a higher amount of purified protein, since CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY have 12, 9, 10, and 14 cysteines, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Detailed methods are given in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Receptor_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CXCR7QTY, and CCR10QTY receptors and their respective ligands (CCL5, CXCL11, CXCL12, CCL27, and CCL28) contain tryptophans, the receptors need to be labeled with NT647 in 1Ã— PBS (pH 7.4) to reduce noise and obtain unique fluorescent signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These receptors were labeled according to the instructions of the Monolith NT Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS (NanoTemper Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of labeled proteins was determined using NanoDrop and Bradford assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MST_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ligand-binding experiments were carried out using MST with 5 nM NT647-labeled protein (CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10 QTY, or CXCR7 QTY) in binding buffer (1Ã— PBS and 5 mM DTT) with 0.09163,000 nM of Rantes or SDF1, 0.1535,000 nM insulin, 0.06512,000 nM CCL28 and CXCL11, 0.012400 nM CCL27, or 0.0153500 nM gp41-120 at 80% MST power, 15% LED power in premium capillaries on a Monolith NT.115 pico instrument at 25 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

nanoDSF_Determination_of_the_Thermal_Stability_of_the_QTY_Variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For thermal unfolding experiments, CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, or CXCR7QTY was diluted to a final concentration of 5 M in PBS plus 5 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each condition, 10 L of sample per capillary was prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were loaded into UV capillaries, and experiments were carried out using a Prometheus NT.48 instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature gradient was set to increase 1 Â°C/min in a range from 20 Â°C to 90 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For negative controls, CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY were heated to 90 Â°C for 15 min to denature them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD_and_Fluorescence_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD and fluorescence spectra were recorded using an Aviv 425 circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical, Inc.) equipped with a fluorescence emission-scanning monochromator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QTY protein sample was buffer exchanged by dialysis into CD buffer [10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaF, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was filtered through a 0.2-Âµm filter before measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For far UV CD, spectra between 183 nm and 260 nm were collected with a 1-nm step size, 1-nm bandwidth, and 15-s averaging time in 0.1-cm path length cuvettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein concentration was 1.2 ÂµM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computer_Simulations_of_the_QTY_Variants_in_an_Explicit_Water_Environment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The published crystal structures of CCR5 (PDB ID code 4MBS) and CXCR4 (PDB ID code 3ODU) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted initial structures of the QTY candidates were obtained from the predicted sequence and the GOMoDo modeling server (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CCR5QTY sequence is 78.12% identical to CCR5, and the CXCR4QTY sequence is 70.74% identical to CXCR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR5QTY, CXCR4QTY, CCR10QTY, and CXCR7QTY were simulated for 1 s each in explicit water at 24.85 Â°C at pH 7.4 and a 0.9% NaCl ion concentration, using the full-atom AMBER14 N (33) self-parameterizing force field within the simulation software YASARA (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
