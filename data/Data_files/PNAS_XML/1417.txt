Electron tomography reveals details of the internal microstructure of desalination membranes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of membrane materials is limited by our lack of tools to characterize their complex microstructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate how a combination of careful sample preparation, electron tomography, and quantitative analysis of 3D models can provide unique insights into the morphology of polyamide active layers used in reverse osmosis membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracting the 3D morphology is required to obtain accurate estimates of the top surface area and internal void fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mapping the internal heterogeneity shows that polymer density is highest near the top surface and suggests new models of how microstructure and membrane performance is connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As water availability becomes a growing challenge in various regions throughout the world, desalination and wastewater reclamation through technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO) are becoming more important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, many open questions remain regarding the internal structure of thin-film composite RO membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, fully aromatic polyamide films that serve as the active layer of state-of-the-art water filtration membranes were investigated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstructions of the 3D morphology reveal intricate aspects of the complex microstructure not visible from 2D projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that internal voids of the active layer of compressed commercial membranes account for less than 0.2% of the total polymer volume, contrary to previously reported values that are two orders of magnitude higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of the local variation in polyamide density from electron tomography reveal that the polymer density is highest at the permeable surface for the two membranes tested and establish the significance of surface area on RO membrane transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same type of analyses could provide explanations for different flux variations with surface area for other types of membranes where the density is distributed differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 3D reconstructions and quantitative analyses will be crucial to characterize the complex morphology of polymeric membranes used in next-generation water-purification membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polyamide_Isolation_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows a schematic of the polyamide isolation process; details can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we spin-coat poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) as a sacrificial layer onto a silicon substrate (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RO membrane top surface is applied to the substrate and organic solvents dissolve the support layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After drying in a vacuum oven (SI Appendix, Fig S1), the sacrificial layer is dissolved in water and the polyamide film is removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the use of a sacrificial layer enables characterization of the top surface of isolated polyamide films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compress membranes in a cross-flow system at 150 psi for 12 h to simulate operating conditions in RO modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2 and Table S1 show that membrane thicknesses decrease by 25% and 8% due to compression for brackish water (BWXLE) and seawater high-rejection (SWHR) membranes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We denote membranes that are compressed before analysis with a -C after the membrane abbreviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that examining the effects of the isolation procedure is important to ensure minimal introduction of artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyamide top surface of a compressed membrane (SWHR-C, Fig 1B) before and after polyamide isolation was characterized by AFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimal surface changes in terms of root-mean-squared roughness and surface area are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is contrary to uncompacted membranes, where the roughness and surface area decrease by 50% for both commercial SWHR and BWXLE membranes after isolation (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4 and Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute these changes in roughness and surface area to collapse of the structure in uncompressed membranes due to the isolation procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, compressing all membranes before characterization simulates conditions and the morphology present during module operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the variations between dry and hydrated polyamide films, we use in situ ellipsometry to determine changes in thickness of isolated polyamide films when the relative humidity (RH) is changed from 0 RH to 88% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the swollen, hydrated thickness of the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes increases by 23% and 10% from their dry-state morphologies, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we focus on characterization of dry membranes, as our results suggest significant morphological changes for hydrated membranes are not expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HAADF-STEM_Tomography_and_3D_Model_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained a tilt series by the acquisition of HAADF-STEM images at various tilt angles (Fig 1C) up to ±65° (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tilt series of the polyamide film were aligned and the 3D volume was reconstructed using FEI Inspect3D software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed grayscale 3D model was segmented using Avizo 3D software to obtain a binary volumetric model and visualize the polyamide film (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Video reconstructions as a function of z-height for each tomogram are shown in Movies S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstruction is segmented through thresholding individual XY planes and is therefore dependent on the grayscale intensity of each voxel (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gold nanoparticles, applied to the surface of the membrane before tomography, serve as fiduciary markers and permit high-quality volume reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The segmented binary volumetric model separates the selected tomogram space into three parts: polymer film, closed voids within the film, and vacuum (in the microscope).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2A shows an example of the resulting 3D reconstruction and corresponding thresholding for SWHR-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This segmentation enables analyses of the 3D volume in terms of multiple microstructural parameters; in this work, we focus on the closed void fraction (voids within the membranes), overall surface area, and void fraction along the depth of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work based on cross-sectional TEM images of 60- to 100-nm-thick ultramicrotomed sections suggests the presence of closed voids throughout polyamide active layers (25, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features are subject to the limitations imposed by the projection of the structure onto 2D images and overlapping features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our 3D reconstructions, we can select regions where a close pore is apparent in the cross-sectional view, such as in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C shows a series of images along the y axis (in XZ plane) of three 1-nm-thick cross-sectional slices with a spacing distance of 4 nm based on the region identified in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected region (left slice) indicates a closed void.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visualization of the same region a 4-nm step further along the y axis (middle slice) reveals this enclosed pore becomes larger, and another 4-nm extension (right slice) shows that the pore opens to the top surface, indicating it contributes to the surface area of the polyamide film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the polymer volume completely separates vacuum on either side, indicating that there are no observable pores at the current resolution (15 nm depending on local variations in polyamide thickness) that percolate through the thickness of the membrane (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If we define the void fraction as the ratio of the volume of the closed voids to the total polymer volume, we can compute this measure of the closed porosity for our entire 3D reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find the closed void fraction is 0.12% and 0.04% for SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in contrast to, and more than two orders of magnitude smaller than, recent reported values (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that overestimation of void fractions in the literature are from artifacts due to the thickness of the 2D projection cross-sectional images or from the use of pristine instead of compressed membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A near-zero void fraction of the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes suggests many features that were interpreted as closed voids in previous studies (1, 23, 25, 45, 47, 48) are actually accessible to the top surface and thus contribute to overall filtration surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the small amount of internal voids appears to have little variance between commercial RO membranes examined here and thus seems to have little significance on membrane transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculate the top surface area of each segmented model and normalize it by the projected area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized surface areas for the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C tomograms are 3.48 ± 0.15 and 3.07 ± 0.04, respectively, indicating that the unevenness of the polyamide surface contributes about three times more surface area per unit projected area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, values measured from AFM are about a factor of two lower, only 1.63 ± 0.08 for SWHR-C and 1.27 ± 0.05 for BWXLE-C membranes (SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3); AFM values agree with previously reported values (18, 21, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for the reduced surface area by AFM measurements is that an AFM tip cannot reach all of the accessible surface area due to the complex, or leaf-like, folding polyamide morphology formed during interfacial polymerization, as highlighted in SI Appendix, Fig S8 (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger surface area from 3D reconstructions compared with AFM images is consistent with previous work where nanoparticle filtration and 3D SEM data suggest that top surface nodules contribute to the permeable area (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses along the z axis yields polymer areal fraction as a function of depth and thus membrane thickness can be defined by this profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we define a low-porosity polyamide region as when the porosity, denoted as 1-polymer fraction (by volume), is less than 5% for a given z value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the first z-slice on the bottom of the tomogram is defined as z = 0 nm, and we evaluate the porosity as a function of height within the polymer film (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S9), where a porosity of 1 indicates all vacuum and 0 indicates all polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial decrease from 1 to 0 represents the roughness on the polyamide bottom surface (near the polysulfone interface), and the increase back to 1 is representative of the polyamide roughness on the top surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The porosity profiles indicate a portion of the polyamide film that is completely free of voids (within the tomographic resolution of about 5 nm) near the bottom polyamide surface, confirming the results from other studies (23, 36, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By our definition of a low-porosity region, we can quantify the low-porosity polymer layer thickness for each polyamide film (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-porosity layer thicknesses are 21 nm and 62 nm for the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes, respectively, and are consistent with apparent dense layers observed in previous electron micrographs of cross-sections (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed below, this definition of a low-porosity layer does not address the possibility of varying density within polymer regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1-polymer fraction profiles can also be used to estimate the maximum thickness of the polyamide film, or when the polymer fraction goes to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thicknesses of the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C films are about 170 nm and about 190 nm, consistent with previous reports (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these results present a different way of envisioning RO membranes; instead of a void-filled, 200-nm-thick active layer, the polyamide thin film may be a void-absent film of 60 nm or less with a surface area more than double what was previously measured (18, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HAADF-STEM image intensities are directly proportional to the density of the sample at a given position, enabling a local analysis of polymer density within membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if we examine a cross-section of the tomogram reconstruction such that only the polymer regions are visible (obtained via thresholding), we can examine local variations in density within polyamide thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4A and Movies S3 and S4, significant heterogeneity in polymer density is present throughout both SWHR-C and BWXLE-C active layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4B, integrating the tomogram intensities for only the polymer regions leads to a polymer density profile as a function of film thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes, polymer density is highest near the top surface, and in particular within protruding features that contribute to the surface roughness, or polyps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The profiles shown in Fig 4B also demonstrate that the bottom surface is on average of higher density compared with the middle of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, we speculate that limiting barrier layers of two high-performance, commercial RO membranes are near the polyamide top surface, although bottom layers may contribute as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the larger increase in density near the top surface for SWHR-C membranes compared with BWXLE-C membranes suggests a larger barrier layer, which is consistent with the lower permeability of SWHR membranes (30, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of regions of high polymer density may differ for other commercial and experimental membranes, and we propose that the density analysis developed here is needed to pinpoint crucial transport elements and barriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluating_Tomogram_Reproducibility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The choice of thresholding values is critical and can have large impact on the segmented binary models and the final obtained quantitative information from reconstructed 3D tomograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has explored the thresholding dependence on structural parameters of 3D reconstructions and in some cases even used an algorithm to determine the appropriate thresholding (5557).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, ambiguity could exist in accurately identifying the boundary between polyamide and vacuum or voids given the complex structure and modest contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we propose to systematically vary the intensity where thresholding takes place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different thresholding procedures create a set of segmented models for a given tomogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We controlled the thresholding starting from a conservative value that retains more of the polymer fraction (model 1) to a limit where the polymer layer was thin and broken through (model 5); details of the thresholding procedure can be found in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From segmented models 1 through 5, we observe a decreasing polyamide film thickness in 1-nm-thick XZ planes of the segmented models of the SWHR-C tomogram (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify our segmented models accurately represent the morphology of polyamide thin films, we compare with a cross-sectional TEM image of the identical membrane (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S10 displays the results of a similar analysis performed for the BWXLE-C tomogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further investigate the dependence of void fraction, surface area, low-porosity layer thickness, and porosity profile along the z direction on the subsequent segmented binary models using different thresholding values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systematic thresholding variations show only slight variations in low-porosity layer thickness and porosity profiles that is due to the influence of thresholding on the overall polyamide film thickness (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S9 and Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other parameters such as the void fraction and surface area show negligible dependence on tomogram thresholding, indicating that our thresholding procedure accurately represents the structure of the polyamide film (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tomogram reproducibility was analyzed by examining the variability of the polyamide surface area of the SWHR-C tomogram (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We progressively separate each tomogram into smaller tomograms with equivalent projection areas and examine the resulting variability in surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the standard deviation of the surface area increases as the subdivision area is reduced due to the higher variability in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, when the subdivision area is 3.4 m2 (four subdivisions) or 1.5 m2 (nine subdivisions), the standard deviations are nearly equivalent, suggesting a 1.5-m2 projected area is sufficient to statistically capture the heterogeneity in the microstructure; our projected area of our 3D reconstruction is nearly 10 times larger (13.4 m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The production rate of water from an RO membrane (Qw) is a function of both the area of the membrane, Am, as well as the membrane thickness, L, as described by widely used solution diffusion transport models that simplify to Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 for most RO applications [see, e.g., Geise et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (58)]:Qw=JwAm=AmPwLMwRT(P)[1]permeance=A=PwLMwRT,[2]where Jw is the water production rate per unit area, Pw is the pure water permeability of the membrane, Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in degrees kelvin, P is the pressure drop across the membrane, and the  is the osmotic difference across the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the apparent simplicity of Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, the challenge with applying these equations is obtaining values for Am and L for commercial RO membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the permeance A, commonly referred to as the A value, is currently used to characterize membrane performance; but, this lumps multiple parameters together and prohibits the development of structurefunction relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we demonstrate that the surface area of membranes is significantly higher than the projected area, and for any given point on the membrane the effective thickness varies significantly at the nanoscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work presents a method to identify and describe the relevant dense-layer thickness of RO membranes using quantitative analysis of RO tomography data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose that either the projected area or the actual surface area (that we determine using tomography) should be used to model flux depending on the distribution and location of the actual dense layer (that provides the highest resistance to flow) of the membrane (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a dense layer is identified close to the interface between the polyamide active layer and polysulfone support layer, as evidenced by high polymer density that is separated from the top rough surface (as depicted in Fig 5 A and B), we hypothesize that the use of projected area to model transport is appropriate because the top layers would then provide little resistance to flow compared with the layer of high density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, however, there is evidence that a barrier layer could be adjacent to the top surface area (Fig 5C), as based on recent nanoparticle filtration experiments (32), then the actual surface area would be more relevant to determine transport correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the density of the membrane is homogeneous, then membrane properties must be defined locally (at the nanoscale) to account for different thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that detailed tomographic studies on a wide range of membranes, possibly with higher resolution than those achieved in this work, will be crucial to unequivocally establish the location of the dense layer and enable modeling of transport properties as well as development of robust structurefunction relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case of commercial RO membranes examined here, we hypothesize that the higher polymer density near the top surface (Fig 4B) establishes a dense layer and suggest that membrane properties should be analyzed and predicted based on the actual surface area as determined from techniques such as tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that this area is much larger than the projected area, reported flux values are currently significantly overestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the length scale for resistance in transport models such as that represented in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 will likely correlate with the average thickness of the high-density layer adjacent to the top surface of the membrane and could be determined using techniques described in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, we show that the higher increase in polymer density for SWHR-C membranes near the top surface is consistent with lower permeability compared with BWXLE-C membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we demonstrate that compression of RO membranes via cross-flow filtration before characterization is both more representative of the membrane structure under operational conditions and minimizes structural rearrangement during solvent-based active layer isolation procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present an active layer isolation procedure that enables the confirmation of minimal polyamide structural rearrangements of compressed membranes using AFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We establish that HAADF-STEM tomography is an excellent tool to both visualize and quantify the internal nanostructure of polyamide films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that closed void fractions are 0.12% and 0.04% for the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes, respectively, and are more than two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the surface area of the polyamide top surface is double what has been conventionally measured with AFM, due to the increase in accessible area from presence of voids connected to the top surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract a polymer region on the polyamide bottom surface with a porosity of less than 5%, which can be calculated by the porosity curves from the tomograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-porosity layer thicknesses for the SWHR-C and BWXLE-C membranes were 21 nm and 62 nm, respectively, and agree with previous studies; nevertheless, we propose that these values are not the key step in connecting structure to transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we propose that polymer density and its distribution dictate flow, wherein membranes that show highest polyamide density near the top surface as shown here will require measurements of the actual surface area to determine relevant flux values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, using RO membranes as an example, our results demonstrate the importance of 3D characterization at the nanoscale to elucidate fundamental underpinnings of membrane properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that local variations in porosity, density, and surface area will lead to heterogeneity in flux within membranes, such that connecting chemistry, microstructure, and performance of membranes for RO, ultrafiltration, virus and protein filtration, and gas separations will require 3D reconstructions from techniques such as electron tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
