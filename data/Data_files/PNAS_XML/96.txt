Myeloid differentiation architecture of leukocyte transcriptome dynamics in perceived social isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perceived social isolation (PSI) (loneliness) is linked to increased risk of chronic disease and mortality, and previous research has implicated up-regulated inflammation and down-regulated antiviral gene expression (the conserved transcriptional response to adversity; CTRA) as a potential mechanism for such effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present studies used integrative analyses of transcriptome regulation in high-PSI humans and rhesus macaques to define the basis for such effects in neuroendocrine-related alterations in myeloid immune cell population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTRA up-regulation also preceded increases in PSI, suggesting a reciprocal mechanism by which CTRA gene expression may both propagate PSI and contribute to its related disease risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define the cellular mechanisms of up-regulated inflammatory gene expression and down-regulated antiviral response in people experiencing perceived social isolation (loneliness), we conducted integrative analyses of leukocyte gene regulation in humans and rhesus macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five longitudinal leukocyte transcriptome surveys in 141 older adults showed up-regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), monocyte population expansion, and up-regulation of the leukocyte conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic analyses in a macaque model of perceived social isolation confirmed CTRA activation and identified selective up-regulation of the CD14++/CD16 classical monocyte transcriptome, functional glucocorticoid desensitization, down-regulation of Type I and II interferons, and impaired response to infection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses identify neuroendocrine-related alterations in myeloid cell population dynamics as a key mediator of CTRA transcriptome skewing, which may both propagate perceived social isolation and contribute to its associated health risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the role of myeloid lineage gene expression in PSI-related CTRA up-regulation (1113), we analyzed 412 genome-wide transcriptome surveys of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected longitudinally from 141 participants in the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) (14) during study years 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subsample was representative of the overall CHASRS cohort (14), and 26% were classified as chronically high in PSI based on a previously established criterion of UCLA Loneliness Scale scores 41 in at least 60% of study years 15 (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Trait PSI was defined before gene expression profiling to rule out reverse causation.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants chronically high in PSI did not differ from those intermediate or low in PSI on any measured demographic or health behavior risk factor (all Ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they did show greater levels of perceived stress and depressive symptoms and lower levels of social support (Table S1), as previously observed (1517).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mixed effect linear model analyses relating chronically high PSI to a CTRA indicator gene contrast reflecting up-regulated inflammation and down-regulated type I IFN activity and antibody synthesis, results showed an average 6.5% elevation in the CTRA gene expression profile [adjusting for covariates: study year, age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, and household income] (Table 1, row A and Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CTRA profile was up-regulated by 12.2% after additional adjustments for stress, depression, and social support (Table 1, row B) whereas none of the latter three psychological risk factors was associated with increased CTRA expression (Table 1, row B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether high PSI might constitute an antecedent influence on CTRA expression, analyses examined relationships between longitudinal variations in continuous Loneliness Scale scores measured concurrently and 1 y before observed gene expression values in the entire study cohort (again controlling for covariates and stress, depression, and social support).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTRA gene expression was up-regulated in proportion to both concurrent and 1-y-antecedent PSI (Table 1, row C), and these effects emerged above and beyond individual differences in chronic (trait) high PSI (Table 1, row D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inflammation may potentially influence PSI (1820) so we also examined the reciprocal effects of concurrent and 1-y-antecedent CTRA expression on continuous PSI measures (Table 1, row E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSI was elevated in proportion to both concurrent and 1-y-antecedent CTRA expression, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between social cognition and immune system gene regulation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monocyte_Population_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic social threat perception may up-regulate CTRA gene expression via SNS stimulation of bone marrow myelopoiesis and consequent up-regulation of immature, proinflammatory classical monocytes (CD14++/CD16) in circulating PBMCs (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both categorical chronic PSI and longitudinal variations in state PSI were associated with increased circulating monocyte percentages (again controlling for covariates; cell percentage is the hematologic parameter relevant to dynamics of a fixed-mass RNA transcriptome) (Fig 1B and Table 1, row F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, increased circulating monocyte percentages were associated with CTRA up-regulation (Fig 1C and Table 1, row G), as were canonical mRNA markers of major leukocyte subsets including the monocyte marker CD14 (Table 1, row H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, control for leukocyte subset indicators could not account for the entire relationship between chronically high PSI and CTRA up-regulation (Table 1, row I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that CTRA up-regulation may be mediated not by expansion of the total CD14+ monocyte population, but rather by selective expansion of the immature CD14++/CD16 classical monocyte subset (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with neuronal SNS regulation of myelopoiesis (7, 8), longitudinal variations in state PSI were associated with concurrent elevations in urinary norepinephrine metabolites (indicative of neuronal SNS activity) (Fig 1D) but not with epinephrine (indicative of adrenal SNS activity) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cortisol levels were also up-regulated in chronic high PSI (Fig 1D), as previously observed (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Macaque_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate mechanistic analyses of PSI-related immunologic and behavioral processes, we established a rhesus macaque model that distinguished behaviorally between animals high in PSI versus controls (i.e., animals low or intermediate in PSI) based on (i) high vs. low rates of spontaneous social interaction and (ii) subdivision of low-social interaction animals into social threat-sensitive and -insensitive groups based on patterns of threat discrimination in spontaneous social behavior (i.e., a bias to approach safe social targets such as juveniles or adult females vs. risky adult males, and inability to convert social initiations into complex social interactions such as grooming), as described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting classification yields categories of low PSI (high sociability), intermediate PSI (low sociability, low social threat sensitivity), and high PSI (low sociability, high social threat sensitivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macaque PSI classification was relatively stable over time (1 y testretest,  = 0.51 in 30 animals) and similar to PSI stability in humans (mean 1 y testretest reliability of UCLA Loneliness score of 41,  = 0.56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral homology of the macaque model to human PSI was verified by assessing individual differences in behavioral sensitivity to social threat in 27 animals (high PSI, n = 7; intermediate PSI, n = 10; low PSI, n = 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-PSI macaques produced higher rates of preference-indicating behavior in response to video-presented affiliative behaviors generated by novel safe (juvenile) vs. risky (adult) male social partners whereas low-PSI animals showed no such target-based response discrimination (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social threat-sensitive behavioral response biases habituated over three daily exposure sessions, confirming that response biases stemmed from social novelty rather than an inherent preference for juveniles per se (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In analyses of archival data on urinary catecholamine metabolites from a previous study of 18 adult male macaques (21), high-PSI macaques were also homologous to human PSI in showing elevated norepinephrine but no differences in epinephrine (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In analyses of genome-wide transcriptional profiles from a new sample of 49 macaques (high PSI, n = 8; intermediate PSI, n = 19; low PSI, n = 22), mixed effect linear model analyses found high-PSI macaques to parallel high-PSI humans in showing up-regulated CTRA expression within the PBMC pool (Fig 3A) (contrast with low- and intermediate-PSI animals, b = 0.206 Â± 0.081 standardized RNA expression units, P = 0.0147).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript origin analyses (TOA) (12) of all genes showing 1.2-fold differential expression in high- vs. low- and intermediate-PSI animals confirmed that PBMC transcriptome differences originated predominantly from monocytes (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional TOAs using isolated CD14++/CD16 and CD14+/CD16+ monocyte samples as dimensional reference points confirmed that PBMC transcriptome differences originated specifically from the CD14++/CD16 classical monocyte subset (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with previous analyses of high-PSI humans (11, 22) and socially stressed mice (7, 2326), circulating immune cells from high-PSI macaques also showed reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) functional activity, including blunted neutrophil redistribution response to endogenous diurnal variation in cortisol levels (Fig 3D) and bioinformatic indications of down-regulated GR transcriptional activity and reciprocal up-regulation of NF-B (which is generally inhibited by GR signaling) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether chronically experienced social threat (a central mechanism of human chronic PSI) (46) can causally impact monocyte population dynamics, we analyzed archival hematologic data from a previous study in which 21 individually housed adult male macaques were randomized to socialize for 100 min/d on 35 d/wk with either a continually varying array of novel social partners or a stable group of social partners (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the familiar contact control condition, animals exposed to chronic social novelty over 5 wk showed up-regulated prevalence of circulating monocytes in general (Fig 4A) and CD14++/CD16 classical monocytes in particular (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD14+/CD16++ nonclassical monocytes were not significantly expanded (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the functional significance of PSI-related alterations in myeloid transcriptome regulation, we surveyed expression of type I and II IFNs in an additional sample of 17 macaques under basal physiologic conditions and after experimental infection with SIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline (2 wk preinfection), high-PSI animals showed up-regulated circulating monocyte frequencies (high PSI, mean Â± SE, 544 Â± 103 cells per mm3; low and intermediate PSI controls, 295 Â± 46; P = 0.0465) and percentages (high PSI, 4.5 Â± 0.9%; controls, 2.5 Â± 0.4%; P = 0.0540).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the monocyte population, high-PSI animals also showed up-regulation of CD14++/CD16 classical monocytes (413 Â± 71 cells per mm3 blood vs. 230 Â± 29 in controls; P = 0.0310) but no difference in CD14+/CD16++ nonclassical monocytes (71 Â± 71 cells per mm3 vs. 22 Â± 29; P = 0.5393).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline, high-PSI animals showed PBMC mRNA levels of IFNA, IFNB, and IFNG that were down-regulated by an average of 82%, 48%, and 92%, respectively, compared with controls (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 2 wk postinfection (peak of acute viral replication), IFN gene expression was significantly up-regulated across all groups (average  fourfold across all 3 IFNs; P less_than 0.0001) and did not differ significantly in high-PSI animals (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 10 wk postinfection, after the establishment of a long-term viral replication set point, high-PSI animals again showed reduced IFN gene expression (IFNA down-regulated by 64%, IFNB by 86%, and IFNG by 77%) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably as a consequence of this impaired antiviral response, high-PSI animals also showed poorer suppression of PBMC SIV gene expression from the 2-wk peak of acute viral replication to the long-term viral replication set point at 10 wk postinfection (Fig 5B), as well as elevated SIV viral load set point in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (Fig 5C) and reduced anti-SIV IgG antibody titers (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results show that the CTRA gene expression profile observed in PBMCs from chronically lonely individuals (1113) is mediated by selective up-regulation of the CD14++/CD16 classical monocyte transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lonely people showed elevated SNS and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenalaxis activity, relative expansion of the circulating monocyte pool, and monocyte-related activation of the CTRA transcriptome profile marked by up-regulated expression of proinflammatory genes and down-regulated expression of type I IFN- and antibody-related genes (4, 7, 19, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CTRA transcriptome skewing was not mediated by expansion of the total monocyte pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, analyses of gene regulation and cellular function in the macaque model of PSI (10) identified selective expansion of the CD14++/CD16 classical monocyte subset as the primary mechanism of CTRA up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-PSI macaques also showed heightened sensitivity to social threat, elevated SNS activity, down-regulated type I and II IFNs under basal conditions, impaired response to infectious challenge with SIV, and reduced cellular sensitivity to regulation by endogenous glucocorticoids (i.e., blunted redistribution responses to endogenous cortisol variations; reduced GR target gene expression; and reciprocal up-regulation of NF-B target genes, which are normally inhibited by GR activation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental studies in macaques also confirmed that CD14++/CD16 classical monocytes can be causally up-regulated by chronic exposure to novelty-related social threat, which constitutes a central psychological mechanism of human chronic PSI (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results support a mechanistic model in which lonely individuals chronic perception of social threat (6) results in SNS-mediated up-regulation of myelopoiesis (7, 8) and a consequent increase in the prevalence of immature, inflammation-primed, IFN-impaired, and glucocorticoid-insensitive myeloid-lineage immune cells within the circulating leukocyte pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associated cell-intrinsic glucocorticoid insensitivity may explain how lonely individuals can show up-regulated proinflammatory gene expression despite concurrent elevations in systemic cortisol levels (which generally exert antiinflammatory effects) (2832); reduced GR signaling activity may leave the myeloid lineage immune cells of lonely individuals relatively insensitive to the antiinflammatory effects of endogenous glucocorticoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present longitudinal associations also suggest that CTRA gene expression may reciprocally influence PSI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of circulating immature monocytes provides a plausible mechanism for such effects through the known ability of these cells to traffic into the brain where they act to promote anxiety and alter social behavior (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proinflammatory cytokines can also circulate to the brain to activate sickness behaviors (19, 34) that include affective, motivational, and perceptual processes that may amplify PSI and reduce social engagement (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammation-mediated reciprocal regulation could act to amplify or prolong socially originated PSI (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fact that these reciprocal associations emerge above and beyond the general effects of chronic (trait) PSI also implies that behavioral interventions to reduce PSI may trigger concomitant biological changes that help propagate social integration (as well as reduced CTRA gene expression) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings are limited by the correlational design of the human longitudinal study and the macaque PSI model (PSI may constitute both a cause and an effect of CTRA gene expression, and both may be commonly regulated by neural, endocrine, or epigenetic dynamics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was not designed to discover individual genes associated with PSI, and PSI may relate to other transcriptome dynamics that remain to be identified in future studies (e.g., blood informative transcript axes) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with epidemiologic data linking PSI to disease risk (1, 2, 37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental manipulations of PSI, SNS activity, and myelopoiesis will be required to more fully define the molecular mechanisms and health significance of these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to myelopoiesis (7, 8), the SNS may also regulate CTRA expression via per-cell transcriptional alterations (e.g., -adrenergic inhibition of IFN gene transcription) (39, 40) or transient mobilization of nonclassical monocytes from the vascular margin (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the latter dynamic cannot account for the present effects because acute SNS activation mobilizes nonclassical monocytes (41) whereas classical monocytes were up-regulated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important to note that the present analysis does not hypothesize any change in gene expression within classical vs. nonclassical monocytes (i.e., on a per-cell basis), only an increase in the relative prevalence of the (per-cell fixed) classical monocyte transcriptome within the overall PBMC pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research will be required to confirm the specific neuroimmune interactions mediating these monocyte population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This studys molecular, cellular, behavioral, and immunologic validation of a macaque model of human PSI provides a useful experimental system for mapping the causal interactions among social perception, neural activity, immunologic function, and health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human_Neuroendocrine__Immune__and_Transcriptome_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data came from the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) (14, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overnight urine concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were determined by HPLC (14), monocyte prevalence by automated complete blood counts (CBCs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptome profiles by Illumina bead array assays for all 144 participants who provided a blood sample for RNA assessment during CHASRS years 5, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Year 5, 7, and 8 samples were assayed by Ref8 arrays (Gene Expression Omnibus Series GSE65213, GSE65298, and GSE65317), year 910 samples were assayed by HT-12 BeadArrays (GSE65341 and GSE65403), and CTRA gene expression was analyzed using mixed effect linear models (43) testing association between average expression of 53 CTRA indicator transcripts (44, 45) and either continuous UCLA Loneliness Scale scores or a 1/0 indicator of chronically high PSI (12) (UCLA Loneliness Scale score of 41 in at least 60% of measurements taken during study years 15) while controlling for study year, age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, household income, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking history, and gene-specific differences in average expression level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants after the nature of this research was explained and all participant questions were addressed, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analytic details are available in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Macaque_Neuroendocrine__Hematologic__and_Transcriptome_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were classified as high, intermediate, or low PSI based on (i) high (0.5 SD above mean) and low (0.5 SD below mean) levels of ethologically assessed sociability and (ii) subdivision of low-sociable animals based on social threat discrimination in approach behavior (i.e., preferential approach to safe juveniles or females vs. risky adult males), yielding low PSI (high sociability), intermediate PSI (low sociability, low social threat sensitivity), and high PSI classifications (low sociability, high social threat sensitivity) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homology to social threat perception in human chronic PSI (46, 10) was assessed by behavioral response to videos depicting a novel safe (juvenile) vs. threatening (adult) male macaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urinary catecholamine metabolite levels and hematologic responses to experimentally imposed chronic social novelty were assessed in archival data from two published studies (21) by applying PSI classification to archival social behavior data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For transcriptome analyses, PBMCs from a new sample of 56 PSI-classified macaques were assayed by Illumina bead arrays (46)(GSE65243); the 53-gene CTRA indicator profile was analyzed by mixed effect linear models controlling for age; and bioinformatic analyses of all transcripts showing 1.2-fold differential expression between high-PSI and the average of low- and medium-PSI assessed (i) the cellular origins of differential gene expression using transcript origin analysis (12) [mapped to major leukocyte subsets (47, 48) or CD14++/CD16 vs. CD14+/CD16++ monocytes (49)] and (ii) functional glucocorticoid insensitivity using Transcription Element Listening System (TELiS) analysis of GR and NF-B response element distribution (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional glucocorticoid sensitivity was verified by neutrophil redistribution sensitivity to diurnal cortisol variation (22, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiviral response was assessed by inoculating macaques with SIVmac251 (or saline control) and assessing PBMC mRNA for IFNA, IFNB, IFNG, and SIV gag and env at baseline and 2 wk and 10 wk postinfection (21, 51), plasma SIV viral load set point (52, 53), and IgG antibody titers (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the California National Primate Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Methods contains additional details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human_Neuroendocrine__Immune__and_Transcriptome_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study design and sample characteristics of the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) have been previously described (14, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the present analyses, overnight urine concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were assayed by HPLC as described (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In study years 9 and 10, complete blood counts (CBCs) with white blood cell differential were performed on 6-mL venipuncture blood samples using a Sysmex XE-5000 automated hematology analyzer in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified Barnard Mitchell Hospital Blood Processing Laboratory at the University of Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from all 144 participants who agreed to provide at least one blood sample for RNA assessment during study years 5, 7, 8, 9, or 10, with assays performed using Illumina BeadArrays as previously described (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Year 5, 7, and 8 samples were assayed by Ref8 BeadArrays (data deposited as Gene Expression Omnibus Series GSE65213, GSE65298, and GSE65317), and year 910 samples were assayed by its successor HT-12 BeadArrays (GSE65341 and GSE65403).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene expression data were analyzed using mixed effect linear models (43) testing association between average expression of the 53 CTRA indicator transcripts and a 1/0 indicator of chronically high PSI as previously described (12) (UCLA Loneliness Scale score of 41 in at least 60% of measurements taken during study years 15) while controlling for study year, age, sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic), marital status, (ln) household income, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking history, and gene-specific differences in average expression level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antecedent effects of PSI on CTRA gene expression were evaluated in models predicting gene expression from concurrent and 1-y-antecedent continuous UCLA Loneliness Scale scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocal analyses examined changes in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores as a function of concurrent and 1-y-antecedent CTRA gene expression levels while controlling for the same covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contributions of leukocyte subset population dynamics were assessed in additional mixed models including eight mRNA transcripts indicating the relative prevalence of major leukocyte subsets within the circulating PBMC pool (CD14 for monocytes; CD3D, CD3E, CD4, and CD8A for T lymphocyte subsets; CD19 for B lymphocytes; and CD56/NCAM1 and CD16/FCGR3A for natural killer cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantile-normalized gene expression data were log2-transformed, sign-inverted for negative elements of the CTRA gene set (31 IFN-related genes and 3 antibody-related genes) (44), and analyzed using SAS PROC MIXED, with subjects treated as a random effect and models estimated by maximum likelihood (43, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing data reduced the 720 possible gene expression samples (5 y Ã 144 subjects who provided at least 1 blood specimen for RNA) to a final analyzed sample of 412 samples analyzed in 141 subjects (n = 3 subjects missing demographic or behavioral data and n = 308 unavailable blood samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ref8 arrays used to assay samples in years 5, 7, and 8 assessed 50 of the 53 CTRA indicator transcripts, and the HT-12 arrays used for years 9 and 10 assayed all 53 indicator transcripts, yielding a total of 21,155 gene expression values in primary analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar mixed model analyses also examined relationships between PSI and circulating monocyte percentages as determined by CBC (available in study years 910), and urinary concentrations of metabolites of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine (available in years 15 and 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unstructured covariance matrices were used for mixed model analyses of norepinephrine and epinephrine to accommodate their more complex residual variance structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Macaque_PSI_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As detailed previously (10), individual rhesus macaques were classified as high-, intermediate-, or low-PSI based on (i) high (0.5 SD above mean) and low (0.5 SD below mean) levels of observer-rated sociability based on 100 min of ethological focal animal observations and (ii) subsequent subdivision of low-sociable animals into groups based on social threat discrimination in their spontaneous social approach behavior (i.e., preferential approach to safe social targets such as juveniles or adult females vs. risky adult males), yielding three categories of low-PSI (high sociability), intermediate-PSI (low sociability, low social threat sensitivity), and high-PSI classifications (low sociability, high social threat sensitivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
