Emergence of functional subnetworks in layer 2/3 cortex induced by sequential spikes in vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Somatosensory information is transmitted and processed in the superficial layer (layer 2/3) of the cortex, giving rise to proper sensory perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes ought to be dependent on the patterns of neuronal connectivity among layer 2/3 neurons, but underlying cellular mechanisms that govern how one neuron makes specific connections with other neurons and eventually builds functional microcircuits are not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that spikes generated in multiple neurons in vivo induced the formation of a functional group of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further data demonstrated that functional connectivity was determined by the order of the spike sequence and the number of neurons but not by the physical distance among neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply that time-sensitive neuronal activity determines the pattern of circuit connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During cortical circuit development in the mammalian brain, groups of excitatory neurons that receive similar sensory information form microcircuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cellular mechanisms underlying cortical microcircuit development remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we implemented combined two-photon imaging and photolysis in vivo to monitor and manipulate neuronal activities to study the processes underlying activity-dependent circuit changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that repeated triggering of spike trains in a randomly chosen group of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex triggered long-term plasticity of circuits (LTPc), resulting in the increased probability that the selected neurons would fire when action potentials of individual neurons in the group were evoked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant firing pattern changes were observed more frequently in the selected group of neurons than in neighboring control neurons, and the induction was dependent on the time interval between spikes, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LTPc was associated with an increase of activity from a portion of neighboring neurons with different probabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results demonstrate that the formation of functional microcircuits requires broad network changes and that its directionality is nonrandom, which may be a general feature of cortical circuit assembly in the mammalian cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Two-Photon_Glutamate_Photolysis_Triggers_Action_Potentials_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first verified whether we could use photolysis of caged glutamate to control neuronal activity at single-cell resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected adeno-associated virus expressing GCaMP6f (AAV1 Syn GCaMP6f) into mouse layer 2/3 somatosensory cortex (postnatal days 1113) (Fig 1A) (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten to 21 d after viral injection, we observed many neurons expressing green fluorescence using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy at 910-nm wavelength (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether we could detect Ca2+ transients by triggering action potentials (APs) from single neurons, we circulated 2.5 mM 4-carboxymethoxy-5,7-dinitroindolinyl-glutamate (CDNI-Glu) within the microchamber (SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B) and then photolyzed CDNI-Glu at the edge of the cell body for 2 ms at a wavelength of 720 nm (Fig 1D) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant amounts of Ca2+ transients were observed from the target neuron upon uncaging (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial precision of Ca2+ responses triggered by two-photon glutamate photolysis was very high, such that redirecting the 720-nm light 3 m away from the cell body failed to elicit any Ca2+ transients (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This micron-level resolution in the xy plane is consistent with previous studies using in vitro brain slices (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to achieve high reliability with this light-induced control of Ca2+ activity, with a success rate of 97% (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the activity of each neuron could be controlled precisely even in areas where a large number of neurons were intermingled, we picked two neurons several microns apart and photolyzed glutamate onto each cell separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients were triggered only in the target cell without inducing Ca2+ rises in the other cell (SI Appendix, Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data strongly indicate that simultaneous in vivo uncaging and imaging has the precision required to stimulate and record the activity of individual neurons in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically encoded calcium indicators have been used to detect Ca2+ influx elicited by APs (17, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observed Ca2+ transients likely represent neuronal spiking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether glutamate uncaging onto neurons triggers APs, we further characterized the system using pharmacology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we confirmed that Ca2+ transients originated from the activation of glutamate receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of CDNI-Glu, no Ca2+ transients were detected (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish which glutamate receptors mediate APs and Ca2+ signals, we blocked NMDA or -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors with the selective antagonists (RS)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) or 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), respectively, and found that AMPA receptor activation was necessary for cell firing and Ca2+ activity (Fig 1 H, I, K, and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockade of sodium channels with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) also prevented any rises in Ca2+ (Fig 1 J and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pharmacological experiments indicate that glutamate photolysis triggers APs via AMPA receptor activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also gradually increased the laser power and observed all-or-none Ca2+ transients similar to AP firing, further supporting that the Ca2+ responses in our experiments arose mainly from neuronal APs rather than subthreshold depolarization in the cell body (SI Appendix, Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we recorded APs in response to glutamate uncaging by in vivo cell-attached recording (SI Appendix, Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success rate and spatial precision of APs were similar to those observed using Ca2+ imaging (SI Appendix, Fig S1G), and we could trigger repetitive APs reliably (Fig 1 M and N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested whether glutamate uncaging could activate (i) multiple neurons located right above or below the target neurons or (ii) layer 5 neurons by activating their dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we patched one neuron and released glutamate 1020 m above or below the target neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that glutamate release 10 m above or below the cell soma did not cause APs in neurons (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the soma size is about 10 m, the chance of activating other neurons located right above or below the target cell is very low; however, if another cell is located within 10 m, it is possible that more than one neuron can fire via glutamate uncaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we released glutamate at several locations of distal apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons, APs were triggered with a success rate of less than 10% (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there is only a small possibility that layer 5 neurons will be activated in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Repetitive_Triggering_of_Spike_Trains_in_a_Group_of_Neurons_Induced_Functional_Circuit_Rearrangement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurons tend to wire together when similar sensory inputs activate a subset of neurons repetitively, but how this occurs and eventually yields ensembles of neurons with similar functions is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is improbable that this process is random; thus, there are likely a trigger or igniting point to initiate this process and specific rules to connect discrete subpopulations of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STDP has been regarded as a central cellular mechanism of circuit plasticity in various brain areas including the somatosensory cortex (24, 25), visual cortex (26), and hippocampus (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an initial set of experiments, we developed a sequential activation paradigm for inducing plasticity in intact cortical circuits similar to STDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using glutamate photolysis, we sequentially triggered APs in seven closely localized neurons at 10-ms intervals (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequential activation was repeated three times followed by a 2-min rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 3 sequential activations/2-min rest intervals were repeated 15 times for a total of 45 (3 × 15) sequential activations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before initiating this induction procedure, we detected Ca2+ transients only from the neuron that received glutamate photolysis (Fig 3B), suggesting that APs in one neuron are not strong enough to trigger firing in neighboring neurons or that they are not synaptically connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, repetitive firing in several neurons in sequence caused a significant increase in the level of Ca2+ transients from other neurons in the selected group (Fig 3 BD and SI Appendix, Table S1; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, glutamate uncaging on the target neuron triggered a Ca2+ rise not only in the target neuron but also in other neurons within the group, suggesting the formation of functional microcircuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We named this plasticity long-term plasticity of circuits (LTPc) because it occurred in intact local circuits in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether these changes were selective for a specific neuronal group versus affecting the global network, we monitored Ca2+ signals by activating neurons proximal to the selected group of neurons that were not subjected to glutamate photolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the control neurons were activated, we did not observe a significant increase in Ca2+ amplitude in the selected group (Fig 3E and SI Appendix, Table S2; P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that increases in network responsiveness are not encoded in a random fashion but are somewhat specific for neurons highly active during the uncaging sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the chance of activating layer 5 neurons by glutamate uncaging is very low (Fig 2 C and D), it is presumed that major connectivity changes were made through the layer 2/3 network, as supported by relatively high connection probability between layer 2/3 neurons in the somatosensory cortex (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results also discard the possibility that the changes in fluorescence in the selected group of neurons were derived from nonspecific glutamate spillover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this, we performed glutamate uncaging with the same number of neurons at the same interval (10 ms) but 3 m away from the cell body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this setup, the amount of released glutamate should be the same as in the previous experiment, but APs should not be triggered (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, however, we did not detect a noticeable increase in Ca2+ response from the group of neurons (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the selected group of neurons, the stimulation paradigm produced no noticeable differences in the magnitude of Ca2+ responses to direct uncaging, but there was a tendency for the network effects to diminish with sequence distance (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In parallel with changes in Ca2+ responses, we verified the expression of LTPc by electrophysiological recording (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly chose seven neurons and performed juxtaposed cell recording from one neuron (target neuron) among this selected group of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then evoked APs in the other six neurons one by one and monitored whether triggering APs in these other neurons could drive firing in the initially chosen target neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before multiple spike trains, no neuron was able to trigger firing in the target cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after repetitive AP trains, triggering APs in the same population of neurons was able to induce APs in the target neuron (before: 0 neurons; after: 3.91 ± 0.31 out of six neurons; n = 42 neurons, P less_than 0.001) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of APs was mostly detected between 10 and 20 ms after uncaging (Fig 4D), suggesting that signals were relayed via polysynaptic connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the AP onset time was not well-synchronized (about 10-ms jittering).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This broad jittering window might indicate that the source of inputs did not originate from only one neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results strongly support that repetitive activation of a subgroup of neurons can induce circuit rearrangements that functionally link the stimulated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the induction of LTPc is dependent on spike timing between neurons, we stimulated neurons at various interstimulus intervals from 1 to 200 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shorter intervals between spike trains reliably triggered changes in the fluorescence level in the group of neurons, but longer intervals ( greater than 100 ms) failed to trigger Ca2+ transients in neighboring neurons when APs were triggered in the target cell (Fig 4 EG and SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data imply that two different excitatory inputs arriving at layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons within a short time window give a higher chance for those neurons to be linked directly or indirectly and possibly make a functional subnetwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LTPc_Is_Dependent_on_NMDA_Receptor_and_CaMKII_Activation_and_Is_Long-Lasting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dependence on spike timing suggested that LTPc also requires time-locked coincident synaptic inputs via NMDA receptor activation in the target neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we repeated the above experiments in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist CPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APs were triggered normally by glutamate uncaging in the presence of CPP (Fig 1H), but Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors at individual synapses was completely blocked (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockade of synaptic Ca2+ influx by inhibiting NMDA receptor activation also prevented the induction of LTPc (Fig 5C and SI Appendix, Table S5; P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar NMDA receptor-dependent circuit reorganization was recently reported in the visual cortex of anesthetized animals (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibiting a downstream signal of the NMDA receptor CaMKII by KN-62 or KN-93 (but not an inactive analog of KN-93) also prevented functional circuit reorganization (Fig 5 D and E and SI Appendix, Table S6; P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the glutamate photolysis-induced modification of functional connectivity in the network was dependent on plasticity triggered by NMDA receptor and CaMKII activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether LTPc is long-lasting, we monitored uncaging-evoked fluorescence-level changes for 1 h. We found that significantly elevated Ca2+ responses lasted for the full hour (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the circuit reorganization triggered in this study is not just a periodic cortical state change such as updown states but instead is a long-lasting modification of connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LTPc_Is_Dependent_on_the_Number_of_Active_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does sequential neuronal firing lead to rearrangement of functional connectivity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the pattern of connectivity changes?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the direct monosynaptic connections among neurons might be strengthened when repetitive APs are triggered in both neurons (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, randomly chosen neurons would be initially synaptically connected but with connections too weak to trigger APs in other neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitive spike trains induced by glutamate uncaging would then strengthen these synaptic connections enough to reach the AP threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second possibility is that the axons and dendrites of the stimulated neurons are densely mingled and close enough to make new synaptic connections, such that multiple trains of APs create de novo functional synapses among stimulated neurons (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third possibility is that the effects are not limited to changes in the strength of synaptic connections among the stimulated neurons but reflect changes in a broader network of neurons in which the stimulated neurons participate (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, there may be a preexisting pattern of connections that the stimulated neurons share that is strengthened by stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, stimulation could induce the formation of new connections in the networkof which the net effect is to augment the strength of the response in groups of neurons that fire together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine these possibilities, we triggered spike trains in only a few neurons, allowing us to test direct monosynaptic changes without causing large network activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the fluorescence change is due to strengthened preexisting or newly made monosynaptic connections, the probability of detecting Ca2+-level changes after repetitive spike trains should be similar when only two or three neurons are activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we triggered a short burst of firing on three neurons, we did not find coincidental firing on other neurons (Fig 6A and SI Appendix, Table S7; P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although these results do not discard the possibility of direct monosynaptic changes, the increase in probability of firing together shown in Fig 3D is not fully explained by the potentiation of existing synaptic strength among neurons or from the formation of new connections directly linking neurons within the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is possible that multiple trains of firing from a subset of neurons evoked broad activation of neuronal networks and led to a functional network rearrangement in the direction of connecting neurons indirectly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If broad network activity were involved through successive indirect polysynaptic activation, the capacity of incorporating network activity into the target neuron would increase when more neurons fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the percentage of inputs arriving at one target neuron would become higher when more neurons in the network are active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption predicts that the possibility of functional circuit rearrangement becomes higher when more neurons are active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we varied the number of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypothesis, the fluorescence-level change in the selected neurons was significantly increased as the number of neurons increased (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each neuron received the same number of photolysis reactions, the total number of uncaging events was less when a low number of neurons was chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the lack of fluorescence changes in three neurons was due to the reduced number of uncaging events, we increased the number of uncaging events for each neuron to match the total number of uncaging events as for seven activated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this setup, we still did not observe similar fluorescence changes when three neurons were chosen (seven neurons, F/F: 31.1 ± 3.73%, n = 19; three neurons, F/F: 4.3 ± 2.42%, n = 15; P less_than 0.005) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that coincident firing from a certain number of neurons is crucial for building functional microcircuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LTPc_Caused_Changes_in_Both_the_Number_and_Firing_Rate_of_Neurons_in_the_Network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that the probability of local connections among excitatory pyramidal neurons is distance-dependent (5, 3032); that is, the closer that neurons are located to each other, the higher the probability of connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined whether the direction of neuronal connectivity is determined by the temporal order of activity or by the physical distance between two neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, to determine whether LTPc depends on the distance between neurons, we reanalyzed the Ca2+ levels in different neuronal groups as a function of distance from the target neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most of the neurons we picked were located close to each other (Fig 3A), the majority of neurons were localized within 30 m from the target neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several neurons were chosen farther than 100 m from the target neuron, but we could not find any differences in Ca2+-level change within the imaging boundary of 150 m, suggesting that the formation of neuronal group firing together does not have a distance limit, at least up to 150 m (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another set of experiments, we randomized the order of activation, so that the distance between target neurons and n+1 or n1 neurons was not close to each other (the target neuron was always called n) (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This randomized sequential activation still showed a similar symmetric profile of fluorescence changes, as shown in Fig 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strengthen the conclusion that distance among neurons within a 150-m window is not critical during circuit reorganization (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize whether reorganization of functional connectivity was made in a random fashion, we performed a whole-frame scan to detect any changes of Ca2+ transients in all neurons within an imaging window (150 × 150 m) (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant increase in the number of neurons that became newly fluorescent after LTPc induction (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the third hypothesis that the pattern of functional connections in a network is specifically rearranged or formed in a direction toward increasing the strength of response in groups of neurons that are activated together (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further supporting that broad network activity arises during LTPc, we found that boosting network activation by blocking GABAA receptors with GABAzine showed a similar increase of newly fluorescent neurons even without triggering multiple spike trains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, preventing network activation by muscimol inhibited the increase of newly fluorescent neurons after AP trains (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To systematically analyze network connectivity changes, we performed a set of experiments monitoring a large number of control neurons (Fig 7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected 912 target neurons to induce LTPc and monitored Ca2+ transients from more than 30 control neurons in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After LTPc induction, when an individual target neuron was activated, the probability of firing in control neurons was significantly increased, indicating again that nearby unstimulated neurons are newly recruited into the circuit of the activated group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the pattern of connections did not appear to be equal among neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some neurons were activated more often than others, with 10% of control neurons in the network showing roughly a 50% probability of firing and the remaining 90% firing at less than 40%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, about 40% of total control neurons showed less than a 10% success rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implies that LTPc can increase not only the number of active neurons in the network but also the firing frequency of individual neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the number of newly fluorescent neurons was significantly increased after LTPc induction in both target neurons and neighboring control neurons (Fig 7H) (target neurons, before: 4.4 ± 2.3%, after: 51.4 ± 6.1%; control neurons, before: 6.2 ± 2.5%, after: 16.2 ± 2.1%; six mice, six groups, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Related to these findings, the number of not activated control neurons was significantly reduced (Fig 7I) (before: 93.8 ± 2.5%, after: 83.8 ± 2.1%; six mice, six groups, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of control neurons were not active, but about 10% of control neurons appeared to be newly recruited to the activated target group of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The newly fluorescent neurons did not show any noticeable direction selectivity from the target neurons, suggesting that a new network can be established toward multiple directions (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the effect on LTPc of enhancing or suppressing network activation by GABAzine or muscimol, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking inhibition (with GABAzine) did not affect the induction of LTPc; however, inhibiting network activation (with muscimol) completely blocked LTPc (Fig 8B and SI Appendix, Tables S8 and S9; GABAzine: P less_than 0.05; muscimol: P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we did not find physical directionality of newly fluorescent neurons, functional connectivity may still be reorganized toward a direction to build a functional subnetwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the level of network activity is gradually increased during sequential activation of neurons, the probability of coincident AP firing would be higher in neurons activated later in sequence (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario predicts that synaptic strength changes evoked from spike trains in circuits are made in the same direction as the activation sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when we photolyzed glutamate in five newly fluorescent neurons, the success rate of evoking Ca2+ transients in an originally selected group of neurons became higher toward the end of the sequence (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, neuronal connectivity in a microcircuit is likely to be built in a directional manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that time-sensitive sensory information from the periphery formulates neural circuit assembly asymmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we examined how the degree and directionality of functional connectivity among layer 2/3 neurons in the mammalian cortex are influenced by neuronal activity, and how the results integrate into sensory information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During cortical circuit development in the mammalian brain, functional microcircuits form from groups of excitatory neurons receiving similar sensory information (3337).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergence of functional populations is not limited to the sensory cortex but also occurs in other subcortical areas during normal development or learning, a phenomenon that is increasingly acknowledged as a general characteristic of neural coding in the mammalian brain (3843).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, changes in synaptic strength and/or modification of neuronal connectivity underlie this process, but we lack a systematic understanding of circuit rearrangement at a multineuron level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this fundamental question using electrophysiological and optical approaches that allowed us to manipulate and monitor neuronal activity at single-cell resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these methods, we studied the cellular underpinnings of functional microcircuit reorganization in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Imaging_Network_Plasticity_at_Single-Cell_Resolution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data showed that repetitive triggering of spike trains in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex led to the formation of a neuronal group that fired together through network activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the pattern of neuronal connectivity changes at single-cell resolution in the cortical network, we addressed two important issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we attempted to study intact brain circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cortical pyramidal neurons are densely interconnected and often project their axons to other cortical columns or even other brain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dense local connections and long projections are severely disrupted in brain slices, and thus render studies of the scope or directionality of circuit plasticity incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, functional in vivo circuit mechanisms underlying sensory perception or manipulation are difficult to investigate from slice experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid this limitation, we implemented cutting-edge techniques that enabled us to simultaneously control and monitor neuronal activity in intact cortical circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a microfluidic in vivo chamber through which caged compounds and other pharmacological drugs could circulate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of the chamber was covered with a glass coverslip to prevent evaporation of brain fluid and enabled imaging and uncaging through the glass window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thinness of the chamber (500 m) permitted high-resolution imaging with minimal degradation of signal (SI Appendix, Fig S4, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this highly sensitive approach, we could study network plasticity without impairing brain circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second key issue was using techniques that allowed us to manipulate activity at the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous control of large populations of neurons does not allow us to identify the timing-dependent mechanisms of neuronal connectivity changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporally unequal inputs into the cortex may influence neuronal connectivity, thereby rendering cortical circuit assembly asymmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work suggested that the sensitivity to the temporal input sequence was related to feature detection and the mode of neural coding of speed and directionality propagating in the cortex (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-photon photostimulation of glutamate made it possible to control neuronal activity with millisecond accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the high temporal resolution offered by this technique, we demonstrated that timing between spikes is important for plasticity in network connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spike_Timing_Dependency_in_Neural_Circuits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The STDP rule predicts that synaptic strength in a neuron that receives excitatory inputs 10 ms after the target neuron (n+1) will be potentiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that the magnitude of Ca2+ responses was significantly increased (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also detected a noticeable increase in Ca2+ response in neurons for which APs were triggered 10 ms before the target neuron (n1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the STDP rule, if n1 neurons receive synaptic inputs directly from a target neuron, long-term depression is to be expected between these two neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, how was the long-term increase of Ca2+ in n1 neurons elicited?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the plasticity-inducing paradigm used in this study evoked recurrent cortical network activity that was propagated back to a group of neurons that were photolyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, n1 neurons may have received indirect excitatory inputs within a window of tens of milliseconds, so the pattern of spiking in n1 neurons may have become similar to the pattern occurring in n+1 or n+2 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, neuronal spike patterns in vivo are more complex than in vitro, so the directionality of activity-dependent synaptic modification does not strictly follow an STDP rule such as potentiation in prepost cell activation or depression in postpre activation (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, STDP at the circuit level is more complicated than between two neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another possibility is the partial blockade of inhibition by caged glutamate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MNI (4-Methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl)-Glu is known to block GABAA receptors (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize this potential problem, we used CDNI-Glu, which is approximately five times more potent than MNI-Glu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could therefore use a much lower concentration that has minimal inhibitory action on GABAA receptors and does not cause firing pattern change (18, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experimental conditions, it was difficult to predict the exact final concentration of caged glutamate in vivo, but potential disinhibition by CDNI-Glu may have changed the magnitude of Ca2+ rise in local dendritic spines and facilitated LTP in the network (4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In most previous studies, sparse spiking and distributed sensory-evoked responses over a long interval were mainly observed by electrophysiological recordings or Ca2+ imaging evoked by stimulation with a single whisker or a few whiskers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, freely behaving mice use many whiskers at high frequency (1020 Hz) to explore external objects (5254).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, each external object is contacted by multiple whiskers in a short interval (generally much faster than 20 Hz) in sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal activity analysis during active whisking in freely moving animals has not yet been well-demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, other investigators have shown that a population of neurons activated by different whiskers is localized in one barrel area (equivalent to or smaller than the size of our imaging window) (7, 5557).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this were the case, a series of multiple-whisker stimulations at short interstimulus intervals would cause spiking at different layer 2/3 neurons in sequence at short intervals, a situation that may be similar to our experimental protocol and is likely to occur in freely moving animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, a recent study using multiple-whisker deflection demonstrated that spiking latency is slightly different (about 10 ms) depending on the direction of whisking (caudal vs. rostral) (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also demonstrated that such a short time separation of spikes carries meaningful sensory information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, physiological relevance of LTPc in this study does not have to be limited in the context of sensory stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other inputs, such as topdown signals from the motor cortex, come into layer 2/3 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These inputs, at least in part, should contribute to the reorganization of circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study will be helpful in understanding cellular mechanisms by which neurons in the sensory cortex integrate various sources of cortical inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Experimental_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals_and_Surgical_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience and National Institutes of Health guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adeno-associated virus (300 nL) containing the GCaMP6f gene, which follows the synapsin promoter (AV-1-PV2822; University of Pennsylvania Gene Therapy Program Vector Core), was injected into layer 2/3 primary somatosensory cortex at postnatal days 1113.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two to three weeks after viral injection, these C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with 5% (vol/vol) isoflurane for induction and the same anesthetic mixture dosage as used in virus injection for maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An 2- to 3-mm craniotomy was made at the virus-injected area, and the custom-designed in vivo microchamber was implanted onto the skull right around the craniotomy site and fixed by dental cement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This microchamber was made out of titanium and was not reused after the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a series of circular holes with the inside of diameter was cut in titanium metal sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cut them into small square chips using sheet-metal shears, and then cut the edge of the square to make a circular ring shape with the inside diameter, 2.1 mm, and the outside diameter, 2.7 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microchamber was connected with thin tubes (wall, 75 m; inner diameter, 150 m; Zeus) and CDNI-glutamate and pharmacological drugs were perfused through these tubes at a speed of 50100 L/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electrophysiological recording, a larger microchamber was used (inner diameter, 3 mm) and a cover glass did not cover the chamber for electrode access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A titanium head-holder adaptor was affixed onto the microchamber with glue [Loctite 454 (Henkel)], and the mouse head was stably fixed to the head post.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse body temperature was consistently kept at 3637 °C with a homeothermic blanket system with a flexible probe (Harvard Apparatus) during animal surgery and imaging experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Slice_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organotypic cortical slice cultures were prepared from 3-d-old C57BL/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brain was removed and immediately immersed in chilled and oxygenated dissection media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cortex was sliced at 400-µm thickness and, on a sterile culture plate insert, three slices were placed per well in six-well plates with prewarmed slice culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were performed at days in vitro 2226.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Photon_Microscope_Ca2+_Imaging_and_Uncaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a combined two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and two-photon laser photoactivation system purchased from Prairie Technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two mode-locked Ti:sapphire lasers (MaiTai HP and MaiTai HP DeepSee; Newport Spectra-Physics) were used for uncaging and imaging at wavelengths of 720 and 910 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser power for imaging was set at 510 mW, and uncaging laser power was normally used at a range of 1525 mW to trigger action potentials at individual neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical depth of target neurons was 100200 m from the surface of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total photolysis volume was increased by making a beam size underfilled to the back aperture of the objective lens [16×, 0.8 NA, WD (working distance) 3 mm] by 40% as similarly shown in a previous report (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, neurons did not move at all under the anesthetized state, but in a case in which Ca2+ signals were moving by pulsation more than 1 m (SI Appendix, Fig S4), we did not perform imaging and uncaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent change of F/F was calculated by averaging all responses, including failures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CPP, KN-62, and KN-93 were applied to block NMDA receptors and CaMKII, glutamate uncaging was initiated at least 15 min after application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photomultiplier tubes (7422P-40 GaAsP; Hamamatsu) were used for fluorescence image detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent cells in a bright field were identified by epifluorescence (X-cite 120; Lumen Dynamics) scanned by a digital CCD camera (QIClick-F-M-12; QImaging).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data acquisition was done with Prairie View and TriggerSync software (Prairie Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For glutamate uncaging, 2.5 mM CDNI-glutamate (synthesized by Shanghai Medicilon) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was perfused and circulated by peristaltic pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen units of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich) was also added to increase glutamate uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Line scan crossing the center of cell bodies was performed to measure Ca2+ fluorescence changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ images were analyzed as F/F in ImageJ (NIH) and plotted with Origin software (OriginLab Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LTPc induction protocols were as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the induction of LTPc, a group of neurons (usually 712) was randomly selected and each neuron was activated with a 2-ms-duration laser at 720 nm one by one to monitor baseline Ca2+ transients from the selected group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To trigger LTPc, sequential activation (from neuron 17 in the case of seven neurons) was repeated consecutively three times in the same order followed by a 2-min rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 3 sequential activations/2-min rest intervals (one cycle) were repeated 15 times for a total of 45 (3 × 15) sequential activations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten minutes after the induction protocol, Ca2+ transients were monitored again from the same group of neurons by activating individual neurons one by one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long-term monitoring of correlated activity, fluorescence level was monitored every 10 min up to 60 min by activating each neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CDNI-glutamate and all pharmacological drugs were dissolved in ACSF containing 127 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glass pipettes (812 M) were pulled by micropipette puller (P-1000; Sutter Instrument) and filled with internal solution: 135 mM KMeSO4, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na2GTP, and 10 mM phosphocreatine (pH 7.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recordings were made with MultiClamp700B (Axon Instruments) and data were analyzed and plotted with Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices) and Origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacology_and_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CPP, NBQX, KN-62, GABAzine, muscimol, and TTX were purchased from Tocris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KN-92 and KN-93 were obtained from EMD Millipore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as ±SEM unless otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired or unpaired two-tailed Students t tests were used to determine statistical significance as indicated by asterisks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishers exact test was used to determine the level of significance of the success rate of Ca2+ transients shown in Fig 8D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P less_than 0.05 was judged as significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
