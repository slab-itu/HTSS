MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma maintains an aggressive and undifferentiated phenotype by deregulation of estrogen and NGF signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-risk neuroblastoma (NB), a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, is challenging to treat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYCN is frequently amplified in high-risk NB and is linked to an undifferentiated phenotype and poor prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estrogen and nerve growth factor (NGF) are inducers of neural differentiation, a process associated with a favorable disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that MYCN suppresses estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and thereby NGF signaling and neural differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ER overexpression is sufficient to interfere with different tumorigenic processes and tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with NB, ER expression correlates with several clinical markers for good prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, not only ER but also the majority of other nuclear hormone receptors are linked to favorable NB, suggesting a potential prognostic and therapeutic value for these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a remarkably heterogenic childhood tumor of the sympathetic nervous system with clinical behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to poorly differentiated tumors and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYCN is amplified in 20% of cases and correlates with an undifferentiated, aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors TrkA and p75NTR are involved in neuronal differentiation and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that MYCN, via miR-18a, targets ER in NB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that interference with miR-18a or overexpression of ER is sufficient to induce NGF signaling and to modulate both basal and NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in MYCN-amplified NB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteomic analysis confirmed an increase of neuronal features and showed that processes linked to tumor initiation and progression were inhibited upon ER overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ectopic ER expression was sufficient to inhibit metabolic activity and tumorigenic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cell viability, migration, and anchorage independent growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ER overexpression reduced tumor burden in NB mouse models and high ER levels were linked to improved survival in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to ER, several other nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), including the glucocorticoid and the retinoic acid receptors, correlated with clinical markers for favorable and low-stage NB disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that MYCN targets ER and thereby NGF signaling to maintain an undifferentiated and aggressive phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified the estrogenNGF crosstalk, as well as a set of other NHRs, as potential prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic strategies against NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MiR-18a_Interference_or_Ectopic_Expression_of_ER_Enhances_NGF-Mediated_Neuronal_Differentiation_by_Up-Regulation_of_p75NTR_and_TrkA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that knockdown of miR-18a is sufficient to increase expression of ER and to induce profound neuronal differentiation in the MNA NB cell line SK-N-BE(2) when cultured in medium containing phenol red and 10% normal FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed similar effects after ectopic expression of the miR-18a target ER (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal FBS contains several cytokines and growth factors, including the ER ligand 17--estradiol (E2), and phenol red has structural similarities to estrogen and is a weak activator of ER (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the cells in this study were maintained in medium without phenol red supplemented with charcoal-stripped FBS (containing reduced levels of growth factors and cytokines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These culture conditions circumvent nonspecific activation and allow for a controlled activation of the studied pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these improved conditions, we observed a marked increase in neuronal differentiation in SK-N-BE(2) cells with stable miR-18a knockdown [BE(2) -miR-18a] compared with the scrambled control cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of the gene encoding ER, ESR1 (hereafter called ER) (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that the mRNA levels of the NGF receptors NTRK1 and NGFR (hereafter called TrkA and p75NTR, respectively) were significantly up-regulated in cells with suppressed miR-18a levels (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we activated the ER and NGF receptors with their respective ligands E2 and NGF and found that the combined treatment potentiated the observed induction of neuronal differentiation in BE(2) -miR-18a cells, but not in the scrambled control cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significantly altered expression of p75NTR or TrkA was seen upon treatment with E2 and/or NGF (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, compared with SK-N-BE(2) cells transduced with an empty vector [BE(2) EV], untreated ER-overexpressing cells [BE(2) ESR1 #1] showed a mildly differentiated phenotype as observed by neurite outgrowth (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found that the neuronal differentiation was potentiated by NGF alone or in combination with E2, while BE(2) EV cells were not affected by the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NGF receptors p75NTR and TrkA are markers for neuronal differentiation (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of p75NTR protein and mRNA were not altered by overexpression of ER alone, but were induced by E2 addition (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The up-regulation of p75NTR was concentrated in a subpopulation of cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2A), in which p75NTR was spread over the whole cytoplasm, indicating active signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BE(2) EV control cells on the other hand, p75NTR was localized close to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, down-regulation and inhibition of ER with its antagonist fulvestrant (also called ICI 182, 780) (34) interfered with E2-induced up-regulation of p75NTR (SI Appendix, Fig S2B), indicating that active estrogen signaling is essential for p75NTR induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent of the treatment, TrkA expression was strongly up-regulated in BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells in comparison with the control cells (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together our data revealed the ability of ER to induce NGF signaling in NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results were confirmed using cells derived from tumors of homozygous TH-MYCN mice, which overexpress MYCN in neural crest cells and develop NB in sympathetic ganglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in vivo model resembles MNA human NB based on histological and pathological features (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When isolated, TH-MYCN tumor cells can be maintained in a proliferative state as floating tumor spheres or cultured in differentiation conditions to obtain sympathetic neurons (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells, we observed a profound E2-dependent increase in p75NTR on protein and mRNA level upon induction of differentiation, which was absent in the proliferating conditions (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of ER with fulvestrant interfered with this increase in p75NTR expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiated sympathetic neurons were further characterized by reduced Mycn expression, elevated Trka levels, as well as an E2-dependent increase in Er expression (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our findings suggest a crosstalk between estrogen and NGF signaling in the induction of NB cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processes_Linked_to_Tumorigenesis_Are_Down-Regulated_in_ER_Overexpressing_Cells_as_Shown_by_Quantitative_Mass_Spectrometry-Based_Proteomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our in vitro data indicated that overexpression of ER is sufficient to induce a more differentiated phenotype in MNA SK-N-BE(2) NB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-differentiated tumor cells are usually linked to a less aggressive phenotype in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore performed a high-resolution quantitative proteomics analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S3A) to obtain a more detailed molecular phenotype of the observed differences between the BE(2) EV and BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells and to identify promising candidates for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 9,711 proteins were identified and quantified (Dataset S1), of which 1,395 were significantly up-regulated (1.2-fold change; P less_than 0.05) and 1,542 were significantly down-regulated (less_than0.833-fold change; P less_than 0.05) in BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells compared with the EV control (SI Appendix, Fig S3A and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteomic data were validated using Western blot analysis for ER and six other proteins, all of which showed a similar regulation as found in the proteomic data (SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed several relevant GO terms for up-regulated (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S4A) as well as down-regulated (SI Appendix, Fig S4 B and C) proteins in BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells, as highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the up-regulated hits were the GO terms axon guidance, asymmetric synapse, and neuron projection as well as several processes which suggest reduced metabolic activity and an interference with tumorigenic processes, such as proliferation and cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings supported our observation that overexpression of ER is sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation in SK-N-BE(2) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of neural differentiation by ectopic expression of ER was confirmed in a second ER-overexpressing clone, BE(2) ESR1 #2 (SI Appendix, Fig S5A), and similar to BE(2) ESR1 #1, E2 treatment resulted in an up-regulation of p75NTR (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the levels of the six different proteins analyzed for the validation of the proteomics were similar in both BE(2) ESR1 clones (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of NB cell lines, including SK-N-BE(2), consist of different subtypes, substrate (S), neuronal (N), and intermediate (I) type (which has characteristics of both subtypes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-type and I-type cells can transdifferentiate into the other subtypes (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that in comparison with the BE(2) ESR1 #1 and #2 cells, the BE(2) EV control cells were flatter and more tightly attached (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S5A), indicating that they have a larger population of substrate adherent (S type) cells, which are also described as glial or Schwann cell-like cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observed morphological shift from S to N type in BE(2) ESR1 cells was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis, showing increased gene expression of the neural differentiation markers neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Fig 3A) and decreased levels of the glial cell markers S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B) and vimentin (VIM) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using immunofluorescence, we observed an increased percentage of cells positive for the neural differentiation marker TH and a reduction in the number of cells positive for the glial differentiation markers VIM and S100A6 (Fig 3C), which was reflected in similar regulations in the proteomic data (SI Appendix, Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER_Interferes_with_Cell_Viability_but_Potentiates_Prosurvival_Stimuli_by_NGF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that ectopic expression of ER interferes with basal proliferation of SK-N-BE(2) cells (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, the enrichment analysis of the proteomic data presented in this study revealed a significant probability for up-regulated proteins belonging to the GO terms positive regulation of programmed cell death and negative regulation of cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus analyzed the effect of ER overexpression on the cell viability of MNA NB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BE(2) ESR1 #1 exhibited noticeably slower growth dynamics than their BE(2) EV counterpart (SI Appendix, Fig S6A), resulting in a more than fourfold significant decrease in cell number after 7 d in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of ER with fulvestrant led to significantly increased cell viability in both BE(2) ESR1 clones compared with the EV control cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the cell counting experiment (SI Appendix, Fig S6A), overexpression of ER resulted in a significantly reduced cell viability of BE(2) ESR1 #1 (Fig 4B) and #2 (SI Appendix, Fig S6B) cells, compared with BE(2) EV cells as analyzed by WST-1 assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with NGF alone or in combination with E2 significantly increased cell viability of BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells, whereas the EV control and BE(2) ESR1 #2 cells only showed a minor response to the treatments (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EdU incorporation and a cell death ELISA showed that proliferation and cell death rates of BE(2) EV and ESR1 #1 cells approached similar levels when treated with E2 and/or NGF (SI Appendix, Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was due to a weak but significant increase in proliferation and a concomitant decrease in cell death of BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results demonstrate that ectopic ER expression is sufficient to markedly reduce cell viability, which in part can be rescued by treatment with NGF and E2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overexpression_of_ER_Inhibits_Functional_Features_Typically_Involved_in_Tumorigenesis_and_Malignant_Transformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A differentiated cell morphology is usually linked to a less aggressive phenotype and an improved prognosis in several cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, together with our findings from the proteomic analysis, led us to ask whether ectopic expression of ER and its crosstalk with NGF signaling interferes with cellular processes, which contribute to malignant transformation and tumor aggressiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We indeed found that ER strongly interfered with the ability of SK-N-BE(2) cells to grow anchorage independently, which was echoed by a robust decrease in both colony number and size of BE(2) ESR1 cells (Fig 5A and SI Appendix, Fig S7 AC) in comparison with the control BE(2) EV cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with NGF and/or E2 did not alter the colony formation capacity of the BE(2) EV cells significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, BE(2) ESR1 cells showed increased colony numbers (SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and C) and, in the case of clone 1, also formed larger colonies (SI Appendix, Fig S7 D and E) when treated with NGF and/or E2 compared with control treatment, albeit not reaching the levels of the BE(2) EV cells (SI Appendix, Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell migration and invasion are crucial processes during metastasis and strongly contribute to the malignant transformation of a tumor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step during these processes is the detachment of the tumor cell from the cell network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions with components from the extracellular matrix provide anchorage for cell motility and invasion (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transwell migration assay revealed that the BE(2) EV control cells showed a significantly higher ability to migrate compared with the ER-overexpressing cells (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Fig S7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with E2 resulted in a minor inhibition of cell migration in both control as well as in BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, invasion was decreased in cells overexpressing ER compared with control cells (Fig 5C); however, when calculated as percentage of migration, it was similar in both cell lines (SI Appendix, Fig S7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Glycolytic_Rate_and_Oxidative_Phosphorylation_Are_Reduced_in_MNA_Neuroblastoma_Cells_Overexpressing_ER  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolic processes are frequently altered in cancer to provide sufficient energy and building blocks for rapidly dividing tumor cells (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data analysis of our quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics (SI Appendix, Fig S4B) indicated that several metabolic processes as well as mitochondrial organization were deregulated in BE(2) ESR #1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have previously demonstrated that neural differentiation and metabolic changes are linked in NB (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next analyzed the two main energy-producing cellular processes, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), using the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several glycolytic parameters can be identified through the reintroduction of glucose following a starving period before treatment with two specific inhibitors, oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor, therefore inhibiting OXPHOS) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glycolysis inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, glycolysis, maximal glycolytic capacity, and the glycolytic reserve were all significantly reduced in cells overexpressing ER and treatment with E2 and NGF had no additional effect on any of these parameters (Fig 6A and SI Appendix, Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study OXPHOS functionality, oligomycin, FCCP (which uncouples the respiratory chain from the ATP synthase), and the respiratory chain complex I and III inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A, respectively, were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that independent of treatment, all respiratory parameters were reduced in both BE(2) ESR1 clones compared with control cells (Fig 6B and SI Appendix, Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the clear effect in the functional assays, we refined the analysis of our proteomic data to identify significantly (P less_than 0.05) up- or down-regulated proteins in these processes (Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (SI Appendix, Fig S9A), an important process to deliver energy equivalents to the electron transport chain (ECT), and the respiratory chain composed of the ECT and OXPHOS (SI Appendix, Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the majority of affected proteins were down-regulated in all three processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the enzymes in the first steps of fatty acid degradation were also down-regulated in BE(2) ESR1 #1 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process provides acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle and therefore serves as an important energy source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with our proteomic data (SI Appendix, Fig S9C) and with our previous observations in NB cells differentiated by, e.g., interference with MYCN (40), we observed an accumulation of lipid droplets in BE(2) ESR1 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S9D), suggesting a reduced utilization of fatty acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our in vitro data demonstrated that overexpression of ER is sufficient to induce neuronal like differentiation and to interfere with tumorigenic processes in MYCN-amplified NB cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further validate these results, we performed key experiments in a second MYCN-amplified NB cell line, IMR32, transduced with a vector expressing the ER cDNA (IMR32 ESR1) or with an empty control vector (IMR32 EV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our data shown above, IMR32 cells with ectopic ER expression were characterized by induction of differentiation, which was further enhanced by activation of estrogen signaling (SI Appendix, Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as in BE(2) ESR1 cells, E2 treatment resulted in ER dependent up-regulation of p75NTR in IMR32 ESR1 but not in the control IMR32 EV cells (SI Appendix, Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, ER expression significantly reduced cell viability in both untreated and especially in E2-treated cells and this effect could be inhibited by the addition of the ER inhibitor fulvestrant (SI Appendix, Fig S10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cell migration was also significantly inhibited by E2 (SI Appendix, Fig S10D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER_Reduces_Tumor_Burden_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether our in vitro results were transferrable to in vivo conditions, we inoculated BE(2) EV and BE(2) ESR1 #2 cells into the groin fat pad of nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of ER indeed robustly inhibited tumor growth of MYCN-amplified NB cells in vivo (Fig 7A), which was reflected in significantly reduced tumor weight and size (Fig 7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, ER overexpression was confirmed (Fig 7D) and in line with our in vitro data (Fig 3), the neuronal differentiation markers NPY and TH were up-regulated, while the glial cell markers VIM and S100B were suppressed in ER-overexpressing tumors (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate that ER inhibits neuroblastoma growth in vivo, we performed a second xenograft experiment using SK-N-BE(2) cells containing a Tet-inducible ER expression system (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under cell culture conditions, doxycycline induced overexpression of ER, whereas no expression was observed in BE(2) TetEV cells (SI Appendix, Fig S11A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when analyzing the resulting tumors from the xenograft experiment, we noticed that the Tet-inducible system was leaky in vivo, as similar ER expression levels were seen in mice with BE(2) TetESR1 cells whether untreated or induced with doxycycline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse Er levels were consistently low in all four groups (SI Appendix, Fig S11A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since human ER levels were similar in doxycycline-treated versus untreated tumors, we pooled the two groups of mice bearing TetESR1 or TetEV tumors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that ER also reduced tumor growth in this model (SI Appendix, Fig S11B), albeit less efficiently than in the BE(2) ESR1 model (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_of_ER_and_Other_NHRs_Correlates_with_Favorable_Prognosis_in_Patients_with_NB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that overexpression of ER was sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation and to interfere with tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study, we showed that ER mRNA expression correlates with improved EFS in patients with NB and that ER is down-regulated by MYCN in MNA NB cells in vitro (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYCN-amplified NBs are classified as high-risk tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we extended our analysis and found an inverse correlation between MYCN expression quartiles (SI Appendix, Fig S12A) and ER mRNA levels, being lowest in MNA NB in a cohort of 498 patients with NB (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ER levels were significantly reduced in tumors of the international NB staging system (INSS) stages 3 and 4 compared with the favorable stages 1 and 2, as well as 4S (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, overall survival (OS) and EFS of patients with NB significantly decreased with reduced ER expression (SI Appendix, Fig S12 B and C), and low-risk patients with NB exhibited higher ER mRNA levels than high-risk patients (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ER expression was reduced in children with NB above the age of 18 mo (Fig 8D), age being another independent prognostic factor (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared ER expression levels in MNA versus non-MNA tumor samples with regard to survival (Fig 8E and SI Appendix, Fig S12D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ER levels were generally lower in MNA patients but there was no difference between surviving versus diseased patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ER mRNA expression was significantly lower in patients who died of non-MNA NB compared with those still alive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decreased expression was similar to the levels found in MNA tumor samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that MYCN suppresses ER expression to a level at which it cannot exert its antitumorigenic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, based on our observation that ER can induce p75NTR expression in vitro (Fig 1 BE and SI Appendix, Fig S10B), we analyzed expression of the genes encoding these proteins in the NB patient dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we observed a strong positive Spearman correlation between p75NTR and ER mRNA gene expression (SI Appendix, Fig S12E), and p75NTR was further linked to a favorable INSS stage (SI Appendix, Fig S12F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our in vitro, in vivo, and patient data analyses suggest that ER exerts antitumorigenic effects in NB, which are suppressed by MYCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently demonstrated that MYCN apart from ER, directly targets an additional five members of the NHR family and that high mRNA expression of these genes was linked to a favorable overall survival (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we showed that, similar to ER (27) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S10), expression of the GR is also linked to a more differentiated phenotype in NB (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effects of these two NHRs alone on neuronal-like differentiation are only partial, as not all cells in our model systems are differentiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous findings, together with the data presented in this study, therefore led us to hypothesize that several NHRs may act in concert to promote neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn prompted us to extend our previous patient data analysis by surveying the clinical and prognostic importance of the entire NHR family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the genes encoding all 48 human NHRs can be subdivided into five different subgroups according to expression levels correlating to INSS stage (Fig 9, SI Appendix, Fig S13, and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest group is composed of 21 NHRs, among them ER, GR, NURR1, PPARD, and the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), for which expressions were significantly lower in INSS stage 4 compared with stage 1 and in most cases, also for stage 4S (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group 2 has 10 members, including the genes encoding the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), which are specifically overexpressed in INSS stage 4S (SI Appendix, Fig S13A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a small number of NHRs were up-regulated in stage 4 (group 3; SI Appendix, Fig S13B) or down-regulated in 4S (group 4; SI Appendix, Fig S13C) while 12 NHRs did not show any significant changes (group 5; see Dataset S4 for all five groups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the majority of NHRs in group 1, which were correlated to favorable INSS stage, also showed a positive correlation to low age (less_than18 mo) and were linked to low-risk NB (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA) family members are important coactivators of different NHRs (4144).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we previously found that NCOA1 is targeted by MYCN via miR-1792 and that low expression is linked to poor survival (32), we included this protein family in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the NHRs in group 1 (Fig 9), NCOA1 was linked to favorable disease according to INSS (SI Appendix, Fig S13D), age, and risk status (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter two criteria also correlated to NCOA2, while NCOA3 did not show any relation to these prognostic groups (Datasets S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our patient data analysis clearly links high expression of ER and a large set of the other NHRs to low-stage NB with favorable outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuroblastoma is a highly heterogenic childhood tumor with limited treatment strategies and low survival rates for high-risk patients (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYCN amplification (7, 8) but also hyperactive MYC signaling (12) correlates to an undifferentiated and more aggressive tumor type and to decreased survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we extend our previous findings showing that MYCN-amplified NBs, via the miR-1792 cluster, maintain an undifferentiated phenotype by interference with the expression of ER (27) (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate that ER-induced differentiation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) is reflected in a shift from a glial- (S type) to a neural-like (N type) phenotype (Fig 3) and in increased expression of TrkA and p75NTR (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NGF receptors p75NTR and TrkA are neuronal differentiation markers with the latter being a powerful indicator for a good prognosis (17) and believed to be a major factor during spontaneous regression in patients with NB (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that ER interfered with the undifferentiated phenotype of the MNA NB cell line SK-N-BE(2) by promoting NGF-induced neuronal differentiation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that this observation is TrkA dependent, since this effect is also prominent in BE(2) ESR1 cells treated with NGF alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in line with other studies, which suggest that estrogens are able to modulate the synthesis and regulation of TrkA and p75NTR and their ligand NGF in sensory neurons (4549).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the effects of estrogen in inducing differentiation as well as neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in various different neuronal cells (5054) and in two NB cell lines (5557) are documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated estrogen signaling has also been shown to enhance NGF-induced neuronal outgrowth in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, until the present study, little was known about possible collaborative effects of estrogen and NGF signaling in NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYC family members regulate various normal cellular processes, and when activated, are involved in different hallmarks of cancer (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed whether the observed differentiation induction in ER-overexpressing SK-N-BE(2) cells resulted in a less malignant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our proteomic data demonstrated that ER overexpression interfered with processes linked to tumor initiation and malignant transformation (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance to apoptotic stimuli (survival) and induction of continuous proliferation are important and early steps of carcinogenesis (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional assays confirmed increased basal cell death rates as well as inhibition of proliferation (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S6) in BE(2) ESR1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGF exerts neuroprotective functions (17, 18) and, as expected, increased cell viability in BE(2) ESR1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The less neuronal-like BE(2) EV control cells, on the other hand, did not respond to NGF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the MNA NB cells overexpressing ER seem to mimic low-stage NBs, which show enhanced cell viability and induction of terminal differentiation upon treatment with NGF (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether the reduced cell viability and the enhanced basal and NGF-induced differentiation in BE(2) ESR1 cells had any effect on cellular processes involved in tumor progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to grow anchorage independently is a good indicator for the tumorigenic and metastatic potential (62) and we therefore performed in vitro migration and anchorage-independent growth assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic expression of ER was sufficient to interfere with both colony formation as well as motility (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Fig S7), supporting our hypothesis that up-regulation of ER interferes with a more malignant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment with NGF resulted not only in antitumorigenic effects such as induction of differentiation, but also in weak potentially protumorigenic effects, as observed in slightly increased cell viability and anchorage-independent growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both NGF and ER are known to promote neuronal differentiation and to exert neuroprotective as well as neurotrophic functions, thereby enhancing survival and proliferation of neuronal cells (see discussion above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the observed increase in survival in NGF-treated BE(2) ESR1 cells is due to a more neuronal like phenotype and thus potentially less aggressive NB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that tumors can have different bioenergetic phenotypes with OXPHOS moving into the spotlight of cancer metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some tumors mainly rely on aerobic glycolysis or OXPHOS, others have been shown to be able to adjust their metabolic program according to their corresponding needs (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed changes in the morphological and functional phenotype of SK-N-BE(2) cells with ectopic expression of ER were accompanied by a reduced activity and decreased overall levels of proteins involved in the two main energy-generating cellular processes, glycolysis and OXPHOS (Fig 6 and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this could be a consequence of a reduced demand of energy and metabolic building blocks, BE(2) ESR1 cells seemed to be closer to their maximal capacity in general, as reflected by low glycolytic and, especially, respiratory reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with our previous findings that inhibition of MYCN results in impaired glycolysis, TCA cycle, respiratory chain as well as fatty acid -oxidation, which in turn can be directly linked to an accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, our in vitro data demonstrate that ER overexpression is sufficient to interfere with classical processes linked to tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our key findings in BE(2) ESR1 cells were confirmed in a second MNA NB cell line, IMR32, in which ER also exerted antitumorigenic effects (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we emphasized the biological importance of our in vitro findings in two different in vivo NB xenograft models (Fig 7 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our data suggest that ectopic expression of ER and its crosstalk to NGF signaling can push MNA NB cells from an aggressive phenotype to one resembling low-risk NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, those findings can be related to NB patient data: firstly, we found an inverse correlation between ER and MYCN and a positive correlation between ER and p75NTR mRNA expression in patients with NB (Fig 8A and SI Appendix, Fig S12 A and E), which was in accordance with our in vitro data showing that MYCN via miR-18a down-regulates ER, which in turn can induce p75NTR expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, we showed that ER can be linked to a good prognosis, as established by higher ER expression levels in low INSS stages, higher age, and low-risk NB (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our study extend prior findings from our group, which identified ER and GR and four other NHRs (27, 32) as direct targets of MYCN and as proteins associated with improved survival in NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, both ER and GR are linked to induction of differentiation and to decreased cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the observed effects were only partial, we hypothesized that several NHRs act in concert to promote neuronal differentiation and thereby interfere with tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support, we found that high expression levels of the majority of NHRs can be linked to low INSS NB stages and/or to the favorable 4S stage (Fig 9, SI Appendix, Fig S13A, and Dataset S4) and that high mRNA expression for most of the 21 NHR members in group 1 (favorable INSS stage, Fig 9) were linked to lower age and low-risk status (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the high mRNA levels of the NHR coactivators NCOA1 and NCOA2 also correlated to a favorable NB disease (Datasets S4 and S5) potentially by increasing the activity of NHRs, which may contribute to neural differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, several human NHRs [e.g., NR1D1 (64), NR2E1 (65), NR5A1 (66), as well as RAR and RXR (67)] are implicated in neurogenesis, maintenance, and a functional neuronal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of NHRs is further highlighted by the fact that 7 of 18 NHRs are linked to neuronal remodeling in Drosophila melanogaster (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn indicates that at least some of their functions as protectors and modulators of the nervous system are evolutionally conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to fully understand the role of NHRs in NB, to evaluate whether a NHRs score can be used as prognostic marker, and if this information can help in developing novel differentiating strategies for NB treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our data suggest a mechanism which contributes to an undifferentiated phenotype in MYCN-amplified NB cells: MYCN-induced miR-18a down-regulates ER and thereby interferes with estradiol and NGF-stimulated neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that ER overexpression is partly sufficient to overcome the malignant phenotype associated with MYCN overexpression both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ER enhances the expression of the NGF receptors TrkA and, after activation, p75NTR, which are both crucial for NGF-induced differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that not only ER but also several other NHRs, including GR and RARA as well as the coactivators NCOA1 and NCOA2, are linked to a favorable NB disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, our data suggest that MYCN down-regulates several NHRs in concert to suppress their cumulative effect on neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support, we identified a large group of NHRs, including ER, with potential prognostic relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this study provides insights into the ERNGF cross-talk and suggests that activation of ER and/or NGF receptors could be a strategy to treat certain subtypes of NB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
