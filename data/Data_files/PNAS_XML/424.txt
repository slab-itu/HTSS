Hurricane Sandys flood frequency increasing from year 1800 to 2100  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study demonstrates quantitatively that the frequency of Hurricane Sandy-like extreme flood events has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coastal flood hazard varies in response to changes in storm surge climatology and the sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine probabilistic projections of the sea level and storm surge climatology to estimate the temporal evolution of flood hazard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that New York Citys flood hazard has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the effect of sea level rise, the return period of Hurricane Sandys flood height decreased by a factor of 3× from year 1800 to 2000 and is estimated to decrease by a further 4.4× from 2000 to 2100 under a moderate-emissions pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When potential storm climatology change over the 21st century is also accounted for, Sandys return period is estimated to decrease by 3× to 17× from 2000 to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We integrate the estimated storm surge climatology and RSL to estimate the return periods for various flood heights (0 m to 6 m) for NYC for every decade from 1800 to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the estimated flood return period curves for the years 1800, 2000, and 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return period of a storm surge (also flood height) of 2.8 m, similar to Hurricane Sandy, is 398 y in 2000 (RSL = 0 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimate is lower than the 516-y estimate found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9, indicating that neglecting the storm size variation can significantly underestimate the surge hazard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by the substantial shift of the flood return period curve, the flood hazard for NYC has increased significantly from 1800 to 2000 and will increase even more sharply to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering only the effect of RSL rise, the return period of Sandys flood height (2.8 m) is estimated to be 1,200 y in 1800 and 90 y in 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Storm surge climatology change can also significantly affect the flood return periods over the 21st century; when it is accounted for, the estimated return period of Sandys flood height in 2100 becomes 23 y to 130 y, depending on the applied climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flood height with Sandys return period (398 y) is estimated to be about 2.3 m in 1800 and 3.7 m in 2100, considering only the effect of RSL rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the change of storm climatology is also accounted for, this flood magnitude becomes about 3.5 m to 4.3 m in 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better demonstrate the temporal evolution of the frequency and magnitude of Sandys flood in NYC, we display time series of the estimated return period for Sandys flood height (2.8 m) and flood height with Sandys estimated return period (398 y) from 1800 to 2100, along with the estimated/projected RSL (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1800 and 2000, RSL in NYC rose by 50 ± 8 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this same interval, global mean sea level rose by about 13 cm to 18 cm [14 cm in the 20th century and 1 cm to +4 cm in the 19th century, depending upon modeling assumptions (24)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half of the RSL rise in NYC was due to GIA [about 1.3 mm/y to 1.5 mm/y, or 26 cm to 30 cm total (24, 25)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder of the difference between NYC and global sea level likely reflects ocean dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under RCP 4.5, RSL rise in NYC over the course of the 21st century will likely (67% probability) be between 0.5 m and 1.0 m and will very likely (90% probability) be between 0.4 m and 1.2 m, with a worst case (1-in-1,000 probability) rise of 2.6 m (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected RSL rise in NYC is higher than the projected global mean sea level rise (likely 0.5 m to 0.8 m under RCP 4.5) because of the combined effects of (i) GIA, (ii) potential changes in ocean dynamics (likely 5 cm to +23 cm over the 21st century under RCP 4.5), and (iii) increased sensitivity of RSL rise in NYC to mass loss from Antarctica (by about a factor of 20% for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and 4% for the East Antarctic Ice Sheet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NYC experiences a less-than-global rise due to mass loss from Greenland (by about 60%) and glaciers (by about 40%) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the accelerating rise in RSL, NYCs flood hazard will increase more significantly over the 21st century than over the past two centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect of RSL rise may, again, be further intensified by the change of surge climatology, although relatively large uncertainty exists in the storm climatology projections by the GCMs [largely due to their very different projections of the storm frequency (9)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of this analysis demonstrate how dramatically the frequency and magnitude of NYCs extreme floods may increase over time, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute value of the return period of extreme surges like Sandy (i.e., about 400 y), however, may be overestimated, because the physically based hurricane modeling (necessary for analyzing the impact of climate change) does not account for the effect of extratropical transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With Hurricane Sandy as a pronounced example, a significant portion of tropical cyclones moving into high latitudes of the US Atlantic coast undergo extratropical transition (28); improved understanding of extratropical transition and its impact on surge hazard warrants future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At least two well-documented hurricane strikes in NYC in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1788 and 1821) (29, 30) likely resulted in storm surges similar to or greater than that of Hurricane Sandy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, based on a sediment record of coastal inundation events in the region (2), a series of coarse-grained flood-induced event beds were deposited over the last 350 y (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute maximum water levels cannot be directly estimated from these storm deposits, but at least six of these event beds are coarser than the event bed associated with Hurricane Sandy, which suggests that these events had more energetic currents and/or waves capable of transporting coarser material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of historical archives and geological proxies (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) points toward higher probabilities of extreme coastal flooding in NYC compared with estimates derived from physical modeling as in this study and from instrumental water level records (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimating the return period of extreme flood events is challenging, and the process of risk analysis requires continuous updates wherein improved modeling and new data inform frequency estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, large uncertainties exist in GCM projections on both future storm activity and RSL rise, as shown in this study; future research should examine the GCMs on their capability to accurately project the key atmospheric and ocean variables that control hurricane activity and sea level dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, proxy storm records that span centuries to millennia, over various climate states, may provide critical information for evaluating model projections of both the frequency of extreme floods (31, 32) and how they change with the climate (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We apply the nine storm datasets generated by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 for NYC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nine datasets were generated for the 19812000 climate estimated by NCEP reanalysis and the 19812000 and 20812100 climates estimated by each of the four GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each dataset includes 5,000 storms that pass within 200 km of the Battery with maximum wind speed greater than 21 m/s, with estimated annual frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These storms were generated with a statistical deterministic approach (10), which models the storm track and intensity deterministically given the storm environmental conditions, which in turn were simulated or sampled based on statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model also estimates the storm radius of maximum wind deterministically, given an externally supplied storm outer radius (storm size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9, the observed basin mean storm size was applied to all storms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we account for the variation of the storm size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each storm, we sample the storm size from a statistical log-normal distribution (12) for the Atlantic basin and assume it is constant over the lifecycle of the storm [as it is observed not to change much over the storm lifetime (13)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we apply a recently developed theoretical wind model (13) that connects inner ascending and outer descending regions of the storm to estimate the radius of maximum wind from the storm outer size and intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the updated storm characteristics, we use the same method as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 to estimate the storm surface wind and pressure to drive the storm surge simulation using a high-resolution hydrodynamic model (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hydrodynamic modeling has been validated by previous studies (8, 9) and is relatively accurate (error less_than 10%) in simulating historical NYC surge events, including Hurricanes Irene and Sandy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not resolve relatively small factors such as wave setup, riverine flow, and stratification (34), as these conditions are either not defined for synthetic storms or too computationally demanding to incorporate for this case involving 45,000 simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the current coastline and bathymetry are applied for the end-of-the-century simulations, and we focus on the first-order impact of climate change and sea level rise; future study may also investigate the effect of the long-term changes of the shoreline and estuaries (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the simulated storm surge peaks at the Battery, we perform statistical analysis on each dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the storm surge CDF, we apply the peaks-over-threshold method to model the tail of the distribution with a generalized Pareto distribution, using the maximum likelihood method, and we model the rest of the distribution with nonparametric density estimation, as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical confidence intervals of the estimated return levels (estimated using the Delta Method as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) are similar across the datasets and are relatively small, as very large numbers of numerical samples are applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate model projections can be biased, and thus they should be bias-corrected before applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the GCM projected surge climatology should be unbiased before being combined with RSL distributions to estimate flood hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We bias-correct the storm frequency and storm surge CDF separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider the storm frequency and storm surge CDF estimates based on the NCEP reanalysis to be accurate for the 19812000 climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We unbias the GCM-projected storm frequency by multiplying it with a correction factor, which is simply the ratio of the NCEP-estimated frequency and GCM-estimated frequency for the 19812000 climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We unbias the storm surge CDF through quantilequantile mapping (15): The GCM-estimated surge CDF for the 19812000 climate is first matched with the NCEP-estimated surge CDF, generating a correction function depending on the quantile, which is then used to unbias the GCM-projected surge CDF for the 20812100 climate quantile by quantile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unbiased storm surge climatology is then interpolated over time and combined with RSL estimates to investigate the evolution of the flood hazard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RSL estimates are 19-y running averages (16), and thus, here, we neglect the interannual variation of the sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many previous studies (9, 36) have considered deterministic RSL estimates (e.g., 1 m or the 90th percentile).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we incorporate the uncertainty in RSL estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We neglect the relatively small nonlinear interaction between the surge and RSL at the Battery (9, 36) and estimate the flood height (Hf) as the sum of surge (H) and RSL (S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CDF of the flood height is then obtained simply through a convolution operation over the CDF of the surge and the PDF of RSLP{Hfh}=P{H+Sh}=P{Hhs}fS(s)ds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Then, assuming that, under a given climate, the storms arrive as a stationary Poisson process with the rate as the annual storm frequency , we estimate the (mean) return period of (storms with) floods exceeding level h asT¯Hf(h)=1(1P{Hfh}).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We perform this analysis for every 10-y time point between 1800 and 2100 to obtain the time-varying flood height return periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PDF of RSL for each decade over 20002100 is obtained simply through kernel density estimation using the 10,000 MC samples generated by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reconstruct past RSL over 18002000, we apply a spatiotemporal empirical hierarchical model developed by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the sea level field is viewed as the sum of a time-varying, spatially uniform term g(t), a spatially varying, temporally linear term l(x)(t-t0), and a temporally and spatially varying term m(x,t)f(x,t)=g(t)+l(x)(tt0)+m(x,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual observations yi are modeled as noisy observations of f(x,t)yi=f(xi,ti)+w(xi,ti)+y0(xi)+iy,[4]ti=t^i+it,[5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where xi is the spatial location of observation i, ti is its age, w(xi,ti) is a white noise process that captures sea level variability at a subdecadal level (which we treat here as noise), t^i is the mean observed age, it and iy are errors in the age and sea level observations, and y0(xi) is a site-specific datum offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terms g, l, m, w, and y0 have mean zero Gaussian process priors with Matérn covariance functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The covariance functions are characterized by hyperparameters reflecting prior expectations about the amplitude, spatial scale, and temporal scales of variability, which we set using a maximum likelihood method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To apply the model to the New York and New Jersey region, we use the high-resolution (1 errors of approximately ±3 cm) Barnegat Bay, NJ, proxy record of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25; the Common Era NJ proxy database of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24, which has a lower resolution (approximately ±10 cm or more) but provides more extensive spatial coverage; and tide gauge data from the Battery, from Sandy Hook, Atlantic City, and Cape May, NJ, from Philadelphia, PA, from Lewes, DE, from Willets Point, Long Island, and from Bridgeport, CT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results shown in the paper are for the site of the Battery tide gauge, and the PDF of RSL at each time point is Gaussian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of astronomical tide can be significant for flood risk, and it should be investigated in future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect may be incorporated through applying joint probability analysis on the surge and tidal distributions (9) and accounting for the effects of surge-tide nonlinearity (9) and surge duration (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the tidal effect is included, Sandys return period based on its storm tide level (3.44 m) will be significantly longer than the return period estimated here based on its storm surge level (2.8 m), because Sandys surge peak at the Battery happened very unusually on the abnormal high tide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tidal effect will not change with the climate, and thus the trend of flood frequency change will be similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
