Helical antimicrobial polypeptides with radial amphiphilicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPs) with unprecedented radial amphiphilicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike typical AMPs characterized by facial amphiphilicity or biomimetic antimicrobial polymers with randomly distributed charged and hydrophobic groups, this class of AMPs is made up of homo-polypeptides that feature a radially amphiphilic (RA) structure and adopt a stable -helical conformation with a hydrophobic helical core and a charged exterior shell, which is formed by flexible hydrophobic side chains with terminal charge group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA polypeptides appear to offer several advantages over conventional AMPs with regard to stability against proteases and simplicity of design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also exhibit high antibacterial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and low hemolytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design may become a general platform for developing AMPs to treat drug-resistant bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
-Helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) generally have facially amphiphilic structures that may lead to undesired peptide interactions with blood proteins and self-aggregation due to exposed hydrophobic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the design of a class of cationic, helical homo-polypeptide antimicrobials with a hydrophobic internal helical core and a charged exterior shell, possessing unprecedented radial amphiphilicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radially amphiphilic structure enables the polypeptide to bind effectively to the negatively charged bacterial surface and exhibit high antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the shielding of the hydrophobic core by the charged exterior shell decreases nonspecific interactions with eukaryotic cells, as evidenced by low hemolytic activity, and protects the polypeptide backbone from proteolytic degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radially amphiphilic polypeptides can also be used as effective adjuvants, allowing improved permeation of commercial antibiotics in bacteria and enhanced antimicrobial activity by one to two orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Designing AMPs bearing this unprecedented, unique radially amphiphilic structure represents an alternative direction of AMP development; radially amphiphilic polypeptides may become a general platform for developing AMPs to treat drug-resistant bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

RA_Polypeptide_Displays_High_Antibacterial_Activity_and_Selectivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a class of helical, charged polypeptides with long hydrophobic side chains and terminal charge groups that demonstrated remarkable helical stability against changes in pH, salts, temperature, and various denaturing conditions (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopted this architecture to design RA polypeptides and explored their applications as AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHLG-BIm (Fig 1C) was a specific cationic -helical polypeptide with RA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was synthesized through ring-opening polymerization of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) (46), followed by amination with 1-methylbenzimidazole (SI Appendix, Scheme S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a separation of 11 -bonds between the backbone and positive charges, PHLG-BIm, with DP of 40 and 28, adopts -helical conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The helical conformation of polypeptides was evident from the characteristic double minima at 208 and 222 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra at a concentration of 0.40 mg/mL in water (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding nonhelical PHDLG-BIm40 was synthesized through the polymerization of dl-NCA to study the effect of helical structure on the antibacterial activity of polypeptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our molecular simulations provide molecular-level theoretical support for the RA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simulation snapshot in Fig 1E illustrates the cationic side chains forming a hydrophilic shell around the hydrophobic aliphatic side chains and helical core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation movies are presented in Movies S1S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discounting the two terminal residues to eliminate end effects, the peptide backbone is close to the ideal helix, RMSDhelix = (0.04 ± 0.01) nm, with a radius rhelix = (0.232 ± 0.002) nm and twist helix = (100 ± 1)° also nearly ideal (rhelixideal = 0.23 nm, helixideal = 100°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean per residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm computed from our simulations using Dichro-Calc (comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dichrocalc/bin/getparams.cgi) (47) of []222 nm = (21 ± 1) × 103 degrees (deg) cm2/dmol is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 23 × 103 deg cm2/dmol for PHLG-BIm40 and 19 × 103 deg cm2/dmol for PHLG-BIm28 reported in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the RA structure, we computed the probability distribution of the side chain N12 atoms after aligning the peptide backbone to a reference structure and discarding the four side chains at the termini to eliminate end effects (Fig 1 F and G) (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the probability distribution of side chain lengths from the C to the N12 atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mode of the distribution is 1.24 nm, and the mean value is 1.15 nm with a 95% CI of [0.90, 1.33] nm (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result was further confirmed by nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy, with no NOE detected between protons around the nitrogen atoms on the benzimidazole (N12) (d, b, b, c, c, e) and protons around C (h, i, g) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the positive charge in the cationic side chains resides primarily in the termini, these distributions are a proxy for the positive charge distribution, providing strong support for an RA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The antibacterial activity of PHLG-BIm was evaluated by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the polypeptide against bacteria (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an RA structure, PHLG-BIm40 showed strong antibacterial activity against both gram-negative bacteria, DH5 and MG1655, and gram-positive bacteria, ATCC12608 and ATCC11778, with MIC values of 3.3, 26.1, 13.1, and 13.1 µM, respectively (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The helical PHLG-BIm40 showed higher antibacterial activity than the nonhelical PHDLG-BIm40, with MIC values 16, 4, 4, and 4 times lower against DH5, MG1655, ATCC12608, and ATCC11778, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Length was also found to influence the antimicrobial activity of the RA polypeptides, as PHLG-BIm28, with DP of 28, showed lower antimicrobial activity compared with PHLG-BIm40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the antimicrobial activity of RA polypeptides against other bacterial strains, including clinically isolated Helicobacter pylori strains (B107, J291, J99, J99-AF, J99-A9, and J99-A11) (50, 51) and drug-resistant strains (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, NRS382, NRS383, NRS384).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among those H. pylori strains, J99-AF, J99-A9, and J99-A11 are clarithromycin-resistant strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA polypeptides showed high antibacterial activity against these clinically isolated and drug-resistant strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, the antimicrobial activity of the RA polypeptide remained stable against DH5 and ATCC12608 in the presence of different salts (physiological concentrations of 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM CaCl2), and mucin, the main component of mucosa (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MIC values of RA polypeptide against DH5 and ATCC12608 decreased in the presence of human serum, fetal bovine serum (FBS), plasma, and artificial tears in comparison with RA polypeptide-only treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrate that the RA polypeptides are stable in serum and plasma, and polyanionic compounds do not dramatically affect their antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased MIC in serum and plasma may be attributed to the serum complement system, which provides innate defense against microbial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHLG-BIm40 exhibited low hemolytic activity with an HC50 (50% hemolytic concentration) value higher than 104.6 µM, which indicates a high selectivity of 32 (defined as HC50/MIC), as opposed to a selectivity of 2 for PHDLG-Blm40 against DH5 bacterial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to point out that the RA polypeptide is not just bacteriostatic but bacteriocidal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly 100% killing of all four bacterial species was observed at their respective MIC or double MIC within 2 h (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the RA polypeptides showed concentration-dependent antimicrobial killing in medium and in conditions with NaCl, human serum, plasma, and artificial tears (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although many AMPs with high antibacterial activity have been developed, the application of AMPs is usually limited by the short durations of activity due to their rapid digestion by endogenous proteases (5, 16, 17, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA polypeptides, with densely packed hydrophobic side chains forming a hydrophobic cortex that can protect the amide bonds of the polypeptide backbone, in principle should be more stable against proteolysis compared with typical AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incubated PHLG-BIm40 with trypsin, pronase, and elastase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa or elastase from human leukocytes for 8 h and analyzed polypeptide degradation by HPLC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHLG-BIm40 exhibited excellent proteolytic stability and experienced almost no degradation by the proteases (Fig 1F), whereas LL-37, a positive control peptide, was readily degraded under the same conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, after 8 h of protease or trypsin treatment, the antibacterial activity of PHLG-BIm40 remained unchanged, as demonstrated by having the same MIC value against DH5 as the untreated RA polypeptide (3.3 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RA_Polypeptide_Kills_Bacteria_by_Directly_Disrupting_the_Bacterial_Cell_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that the RA PHLG-BIm kills bacteria by directly disrupting the bacterial cell membrane in a manner similar to typical AMPs, through vesicle leakage, bacterial membrane permeabilization, and bacteria morphology assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first investigated the membrane-disruptive activity of helical PHLG-BIm40 and nonhelical PHDLG-BIm40 polypeptides on anionic liposomes 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG) and neutral liposomes 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (POPC), which were used to model phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-rich bacteria and eukaryotic cell membranes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same concentration, PHLG-BIm40 induced greater dye leakage from both anionic and neutral liposomes than PHDLG-BIm40, suggesting that the helical polypeptide has higher membrane disruption capability (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHLG-BIm40 also caused more leakage from the anionic liposomes than the neutral liposomes, which is well-correlated with the observed selectivity against bacterial over mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leakage results also showed the capability of PHLG-BIm to permeabilize model bacteria membranes rich in negative intrinsic curvature-forming lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used flow cytometry to evaluate permeabilization of PHLG-BIm through bacterial membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MG1655 bacteria cells were incubated with PHLG-BIm40 and propidium iodide (PI), a membrane impermeable dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of PI-containing bacteria cells was greater for those treated with PHLG-Blm40 than PHDLG-BIm40 and increased with higher concentration of RA polypeptide (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An uptake study analyzed by fluorescence imaging provided additional evidence of enhanced membrane activity of PHLG-BIm40, which permeabilized MG1655 bacterial cell membranes more effectively than PHDLG-BIm40 when the bacterial cells were coincubated with polypeptide and dye (PI and SYTO9) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed drastic changes and damage of the bacterial membranes after incubation with PHLG-BIm40, whereas PHDLG-BIm40 minimally affected bacteria morphology (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the results indicate that membrane disruption and permeation are an important component of the antimicrobial activity of PHLG-BIm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine in detail the root causes of selective membrane activity for RA polypeptides, we use synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate the type and quantity of membrane curvature deformations induced by PHLG-BIm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared with lipid compositions representative of bacterial (DOPG/DOPE = 20/80) and eukaryotic (DOPS/DOPC = 20/80) membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compositions DOPG/DOPE/DOPC = 20/60/20 and 20/40/40 were also used as model systems to isolate the role of negative intrinsic curvature lipids such as PE, because eukaryotic membranes are known to have lower PE content relative to bacterial membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SUVs were incubated with PHLG-BIm40 at a peptide/lipid (P/L) molar ratio of 1/400, which is equivalent to a charge ratio of 1/2, and the resulting structures were characterized using SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchrotron SAXS spectra from the lipid vesicle solutions showed a broad characteristic feature consistent with a single lipid bilayer form factor of unilamellar vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposed to PHLG-BIm40, the lipid vesicles undergo a structural transition, resulting in correlation peaks with specific ratios of Q values in the diffraction data (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each membrane composition, we found a set of correlation peaks having integral Q-ratios of 1:2 consistent with a lamellar (L) phase, characterized by d-spacings of 6.78.8 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lamellar phases resulting from exposure of PHLG-BIm to the SUVs indicate intermembrane attraction without the generation of significant curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, for the model bacterial membrane composition, we identified a second set of correlation peaks with characteristic Q-ratios of 2:3:4:6, which indexed to a cubic (QII) Pn3m double-diamond lattice having a lattice parameter of 24.8 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bicontinuous cubic phases, such as the Pn3m, consist of two nonintersecting water channels that are separated by a lipid bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The center of this bilayer traces out a minimum surface characterized by negative Gaussian curvature (NGC), also known as saddle-splay curvature, at every point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our SAXS data showed that PHLG-BIm promotes saddle-shaped membrane deformations in model bacteria membranes to stabilize a bulk Pn3m cubic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGC is the saddle-shaped curvature that manifests along the inside of pores, around the base of a bleb, and the neck of a bud, the basic membrane permeation mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies have found a strong correlation between the formation of cubic phases and membrane permeation induced by AMPs (1, 14, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of PHLG-BIm to generate cubic phases in bacteria-like PE-rich membranes suggests that the RA polypeptide may permeate bacteria membranes via the induction of NGC consistent with that of natural AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By systematically examining a range of membranes, we determined how lipid composition affects the ability of PHLG-BIm to restructure vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the general trend of decreasing PE content resulting in the suppression of nonlamellar phase formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we found that the peptide does not disrupt membranes (no NGC generation) with a PE content of 60% and lower, which includes those representative of eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preference for PHLG-BIm to generate cubic phases at high PE levels of 80% suggests a mechanism of selectivity for bacterial over animal membranes based on their specific lipid distributions, again consistent with generic AMP trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RA_Polypeptide_Enhances_the_Antibacterial_Effects_of_Traditional_Antibiotics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because PHLG-BIm can cause membrane disruption and permeabilization, we explored its potential to enhance the antibacterial effect of traditional antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synergistic-like enhancement of bacteria killing has been previously reported from coadministration of membrane-disruptive agents with commercial antibiotics (41, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected four antibiotics: streptomycin (aminoglycoside), doxycycline (tetracycline), rifampicin (rifamycin), and gentamicin (aminoglycoside).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Streptomycin, doxycycline, and gentamicin are protein synthesis inhibitors, whereas rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the antibacterial activity of these antibiotics coadministered with helical PHLG-BIm40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonhelical PHDLG-BIm40 served as the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria were incubated with either antibiotic alone, antibiotic coadministered with PHDLG-BIm40, or antibiotic coadministered with PHLG-BIm40 at varying concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MG1655 bacteria, coadministration of streptomycin with PHDLG-BIm40 resulted in MIC values identical to those of streptomycin alone (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when streptomycin was coadministered with PHLG-BIm40 at concentrations of 1.6, 3.3, and 6.5 µM, the respective MIC values against MG1655 were 2, 133, and 400 times lower than that of streptomycin alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the MIC against MG1655 with PHLG-BIm40 alone was 26.1 µM, this result suggested a synergistic effect from combining treatments of streptomycin and PHLG-BIm40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a similar synergistic effect of PHLG-BIm40 and antibiotics against C101 (P. aeruginosa), a bacterium with high resistance to many antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For C101 bacteria, the MIC of PHLG-BIm alone was 52.3 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A synergistic effect when streptomycin was coadministered with PHLG-BIm40 (13.1 µM) was indicated by an MIC that was 128 times lower than that of streptomycin alone (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synergistic effect of combination therapy was also detected against three other bacterial strains, DH5, ATCC11778, and ATCC12608 (SI Appendix, Table S3) and for three other antibiotics: doxycycline, rifampicin, and gentamicin (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synergistic effect of combination therapy may be a result of enhanced antibiotic uptake due to RA polypeptide-induced membrane permeation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, bacterial cells were incubated with rifampicin without or with RA polypeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 0.5- or 1-h incubation with RA polypeptide, we observed increased intracellular uptake of rifampicin in MG1655 and C101 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the synergy from coadministering antibiotics with RA polypeptides may potentially result from increased antibiotic uptake, such as that caused by peptide-induced defects, or suppressed efflux activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study showed combination therapy to be a promising application for this class of membrane-active RA polypeptides, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of traditional commercial antibiotics by killing bacteria through a distinct mode of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a class of cationic, helical antimicrobial homo-polypeptides with unprecedented radial amphiphilicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike typical AMPs characterized by facial amphiphilicity or biomimetic antimicrobial polymers with randomly distributed charged and hydrophobic groups, these AMPs are homo-polypeptides with RA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They adopt a stable -helical conformation with a hydrophobic helical core and a charged exterior shell, formed by long hydrophobic side chains with terminal charge group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA polypeptides offer several advantages over typical AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can be easily synthesized through controllable NCA polymerization followed by side chain modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA structure enables the polypeptides to bind effectively to the negatively charged bacterial surface, and exhibit high antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the shielding of the hydrophobic core by the charged exterior shell decreases nonspecific interactions with eukaryotic cells and contributes to low mammalian cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA polypeptides also demonstrate excellent stability against enzymatic degradation, potentially due to suppressed protease access to the polypeptide backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the antibacterial and hemolytic activities of the RA polypeptides can be tuned by varying the terminal amine group and the hydrophobicity of helical core, both of which can be easily attainable based on our previous studies (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the RA polypeptides provide an excellent platform for the design of new AMP analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The antibacterial activity of these RA polypeptides likely results from electrostatic interactions between their cationic groups and anionic bacteria cell membranes, followed by the disruption of the bacteria cell membranes by the membrane-active polypeptide helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional factors are involved in bacterial membrane destabilization, as suggested by our SAXS studies on model bacterial membranes in which helical polypeptide PHLG-BIm promoted saddle-shaped membrane deformations (NGC), a topological requirement for membrane destabilizing events such as pore-formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tested model membranes had a fixed anionic charge, yet we observed selective generation of NGC in the PE-rich bacteria model membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with previous work, which showed that membranes with greater amounts of negative intrinsic curvature lipids promote destabilization and are more susceptible to pore formation (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both anionic and negative intrinsic curvature lipids are necessary for activity, whereas neither alone is sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the preference for the helical RA polypeptides to generate NGC at high PE content points to a mechanism of selectivity that involves membrane curvature effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed synergistic bactericidal effect may result from increased cellular penetration of antibiotics that is facilitated by the membrane permeabilization activity of the RA polypeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced NGC is broadly enabling in the context of membrane permeation mechanisms, such as transmembrane pores, blebbing, budding, and scission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that permeation can involve a hierarchy of mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe NGC in the form of a cubic phase; the size of the defect on a 2D membrane will depend on the type of defect it is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pn3m cubic phase induced by the RA polypeptide PHLG-BIm40 has an average Gaussian curvature K value of 0.01065 nm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, this is the amount of NGC found in a transmembrane pore with a size of 40 nm, if we ignore all other effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If on the other hand, the destabilization mechanism is that of a budding event followed by scission, then we can estimate the size of the defect using a catenoid surface, which is an approximate representation of the surface of a scission pore (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Gaussian curvature of a minimal catenoid surface with a neck radius of c along its z axis is defined by K(z) = [sech4(zc)]/c2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured K value corresponds to a catenoid neck diameter of 19.4 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we account for the approximate bilayer membrane thickness of 4 nm, this diameter translates to a pore size of 15.4 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both of the above cases, the size of the defect is significantly larger than the size of a typical antibiotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, designing AMPs bearing the unique RA structure represents an alternative direction of AMP development; the RA polypeptide may become a general platform for developing AMPs to treat drug-resistant bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although outside the scope of this investigation, specifics pertaining to the mechanism and selectivity of these polypeptides can aid the design and optimization of future synthetic AMPs based on a RA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest further studies on this class of polypeptides using ellipsometry, electrochemistry, NMR, and atomic force microscopes to examine these details (5861).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies to determine the toxicity of the degradation products will also be necessary to assess the potential applicability of the peptide as a clinical therapeutic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PHLG-BIm was synthesized by mixing PCHLG, NaI, and 1-methylbenzimidazole in DMF and acetonitrile in a 25-mL Schlenk tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 48 h. Molecular dynamics simulations of PHLG-BIm with a DP of 20 follow a procedure similar to that we previously detailed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details describing preparation and characterization of PHLG-BIm; simulation methods; antibacterial assays and hemolytic assay; and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
