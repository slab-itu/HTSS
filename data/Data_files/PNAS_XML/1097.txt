Grip and slip of L1-CAM on adhesive substrates direct growth cone haptotaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell migration directed by substrate-bound chemical cues is called haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that grip and slip between the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) L1-CAM and the adhesive substrates, which occur asymmetrically under the growth cone, direct growth cone migration mediated by laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is disrupted in a human patient of L1-CAM syndrome, suffering corpus callosum agenesis and corticospinal tract hypoplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding the regulation and dysregulation of cell migration on the bases of force generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemical cues presented on the adhesive substrate direct cell migration, a process termed haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To migrate, cells must generate traction forces upon the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how cells probe substrate-bound cues and generate directional forces for migration remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) L1-CAM is involved in laminin-induced haptotaxis of axonal growth cones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L1-CAM underwent grip and slip on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the grip state was higher on laminin than on the control substrate polylysine; this was accompanied by an increase in the traction force upon laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the directional force for laminin-induced growth cone haptotaxis is generated by the grip and slip of L1-CAM on the substrates, which occur asymmetrically under the growth cone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is distinct from the conventional cell signaling models for directional cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that this mechanism is disrupted in a human patient with L1-CAM syndrome, suffering corpus callosum agenesis and corticospinal tract hypoplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Myosin_II__F-Actin_Retrograde_Flow__L1-CAM__Shootin1a__and_Cortactin_Are_Involved_in_the_Laminin-Induced_Growth_Cone_Haptotaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the molecular mechanics underlying laminin-induced growth cone haptotaxis, we prepared microscale patterns of laminin on polylysine-coated coverslips (Fig 1A and Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons can extend their axons either on laminin or polylysine, but prefer laminin (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse imaging showed that axonal growth cones of cultured rat hippocampal neurons dynamically search for substrates, thereby preferentially migrating along laminin-coated pathways (Fig 1A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actins polymerize at the leading edge of growth cones and disassemble proximally (2, 10); this, together with myosin II activity, induces F-actin retrograde flow (yellow arrow, Fig 1B) (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, shootin1a and cortactin couple the F-actin flow and L1-CAM as clutch molecules, producing traction force on the substrate for growth cone migration (red arrow, Fig 1B) (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a previous report (28), in the presence of the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (50 M or 100 M), axons frequently crossed the borders between laminin and polylysine and extended onto both substrates (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar data were obtained by inhibiting actin polymerization with 1 M cytochalasin D (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, suppression of shootin1a (Fig 1D), cortactin (Fig 1E), or L1-CAM (Fig 1F) by RNAi significantly decreased the ratio of axons which extended on laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported previously that the amino acid residues 261 to 377 of shootin1a act as a dominant negative mutant (DN) that disrupts the interaction between shootin1a and cortactin, thereby inhibiting the coupling between F-actins and the adhesive substrate (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of shootin1a DN disturbed laminin-mediated growth cone haptotaxis (Fig S1E), indicating that the clutch coupling mediated by shootin1acortactin interaction is required for laminin-mediated growth cone haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that the molecular machinery composed of myosin II, retrogradely flowing F-actin, shootin1a, cortactin, and L1-CAM (Fig 1B) is involved in laminin-induced growth cone haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Laminin_Promotes_Traction_Force_Generated_by_Growth_Cones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the molecular mechanics underlying laminin-induced axonal haptotaxis, we next measured traction force generated by axonal growth cones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were cultured on polyacrylamide gels coated with polylysine alone (polylysine) or polylysine plus laminin (laminin); 200-nm fluorescent beads were also embedded in the gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traction force under the axonal growth cones was monitored by visualizing force-induced deformation of the elastic gel, which is reflected by displacement of the beads from their original positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously (17, 21), the reporter beads under the growth cones moved dynamically (Fig 2 A and B and Movie S2), and the net force produced by the growth cones was oriented toward the rear of the growth cones as noted by the angle of averaged stress near 0 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the traction force produced on the polylysine-coated substrate was 2.1 ± 0.4 pN/m2 (mean ± SEM, n = 11 growth cones) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the magnitude of the force produced on the laminin-coated substrate was 8.2 ± 2.2 pN/m2 (n = 14 growth cones), and significantly greater than that produced on polylysine (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Laminin_Reduces_the_Retrograde_Flow_Speeds_of_F-Actin_and_Shootin1a_in_Growth_Cones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the growth cone produces greater force on laminin than on polylysine, we analyzed actin dynamics in growth cones by monitoring mRFP-actin expressed in hippocampal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported (21, 33), F-actin retrograde flow was observed at the leading edge of axonal growth cones as retrogradely moving fluorescent features of mRFP-actin (Fig 2D and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the polylysine-coated substrate, F-actins in growth cones moved retrogradely at 4.7 ± 0.2 m/min (mean ± SEM, n = 301 signals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, F-actins showed retrograde movement at 2.6 ± 0.4 m/min (n = 306 signals) in the growth cones on the laminin-coated substrates; the speed of F-actin flow was significantly slower on laminin than on polylysine (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar data for F-actin flow were reported recently using Xenopus spinal neurons (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the report that the clutch molecule shootin1a interacts with F-actin retrograde flow through cortactin (Fig 1B) (17), EGFP-shootin1a expressed in hippocampal neurons underwent retrograde flow in the growth cones (Fig 2E and Movie S4); the speed of shootin1a flow was also significantly slower on laminin than on polylysine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous report proposed that laminin stimulates myosin II contractile activity, thereby causing laminin-induced growth cone haptotaxis (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider that this mechanism does not play a dominant role here, because the stimulation of myosin II is associated with an increase in F-actin retrograde flow speed (Fig S2 A and C) (11), whereas the present case is accompanied by decreases in the flow speeds of F-actin and shootin1a (Fig 2 D and E and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

L1-CAM_in_Growth_Cones_Undergoes_Grip_and_Slip_on_the_Substrates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further analyze the mechanism for laminin-mediated axonal haptotaxis, we next monitored the movement of L1-CAM, which is linked to the F-actin flow through shootin1a and cortactin (Fig 1B), in the growth cone membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L1-CAM-HaloTag expressed in hippocampal neurons was labeled by tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) ligand and observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Fig 3A and Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of L1-CAM signals were observed: immobile L1-CAM puncta (pink dashed lines, Fig 3A) and retrogradely flowing L1-CAM puncta (blue dashed lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed signals that stopped and then flowed and vice versa, suggesting that the same molecules switch between these stop and flow phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On polylysine, 22% of L1-CAM signals displayed stop phase and 78% displayed flow phase (n = 1,076 phases, 235 signals), while 51% of the signals stopped and 49% flowed on laminin (n = 1,531 phases, 268 signals) (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of the stop phase was significantly larger on laminin than on polylysine (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The durations of the stop phase of L1-CAM on laminin and on polylysine were not statistically different (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these data, the mean flow speed of L1-CAM was slower on laminin (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study reported that integrin linked to F-actin retrograde flow undergoes frictional slippage on the substrate (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in the case of integrin (22), we found that the traction force under the growth cone correlated inversely with the flow speed of L1-CAM: An increase in the traction force on laminin (Fig 2C) is accompanied by a decrease in the L1-CAM flow speed (Fig 3D and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2C and S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that promotion of the mechanical coupling between F-actin flow and L1-CAM by cell signaling decreases the F-actin flow rate and increases the traction force (17, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we consider that an increase in F-actinL1-CAM coupling does not occur here, because it would increase the L1-CAM flow rate (Fig S2 B and C), whereas the present case is accompanied by a decrease of the flow rate (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2C and S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate directly that the slippage occurs mainly between L1-CAM and the substrate, not between F-actin flow and L1-CAM, we monitored F-actin flow and L1-CAM flow in the growth cones simultaneously (Fig S3D and Movies S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actins and L1-CAM flowed at similar rates, which were significantly slower on laminin than on polylysine (Fig S3E), indicating that the slippage occurs mainly between L1-CAM and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that L1-CAM switches between two adhesive states: L1-CAM that is immobilized (grip) and that undergoes slippage (slip) on the substrate, and that ratio of the grip state increases on laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Grip_and_Slip_Model_for_Laminin-Induced_Growth_Cone_Haptotaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether such differential grip and slip states occur within single growth cones, L1-CAM movement was analyzed in growth cones located on the border between laminin and polylysine (Fig 3B and Movie S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3 B and C, the percentage of the grip state was significantly larger on the laminin side of the growth cones, while that of the slip state was larger on the polylysine side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these observations, the mean flow speed of L1-CAM was significantly slower on the laminin side than on the polylysine side (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings led us to propose a mechanism by which growth cones generate directional force for laminin-induced axonal haptotaxis (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force of F-actin flow (yellow arrows) is transmitted to the substrate (red arrows) through cortactin, shootin1a, and L1-CAM (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As laminin interacts specifically with L1-CAM (25, 26), while polylysine alone permits L1-CAM-independent cell adhesion, laminin presents a more adhesive substrate for L1-CAM than polylysine, as observed here (Fig 3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, within a growth cone on the lamininpolylysine border, larger numbers of L1-CAM molecules are in the grip state on the laminin side in comparison with the polylysine side, allowing for more efficient transmission of the force on the laminin side (red arrows, Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differential grip and slip states within a growth cone generate directional force for axonal haptotaxis toward laminin (green arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Axonal_Haptotaxis_Mediated_by_the_Grip_and_Slip_Mechanism_Is_Disrupted_in_a_Human_Patient_of_L1-CAM_CRASH_Syndrome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutations in human L1-CAM gene cause X-linked disorders called L1-CAM syndrome or CRASH syndrome, with characteristic symptoms: corpus callosum hypoplasia, mental retardation, adducted thumbs, spastic paraplegia, and hydrocephalus (19, 24, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we analyzed L1-CAM from a patient having this syndrome in which Thr273 of the extracellular domain (ECD) is deleted (L1-CAM-T273) (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient was aborted in the 21st week of gestation, suffering corpus callosum agenesis, corticospinal tract hypoplasia, hydrocephalus, and adducted thumb (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the behavior of L1-CAM-T273 in axonal growth cones, neurons were cotransfected with an L1-CAM miRNA, which reduces the endogenous L1-CAM level, and RNAi-refractory L1-CAM-HaloTag (T273).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments were performed using RNAi-refractory L1-CAM-HaloTag [wild-type (WT)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 4 A and B (see also Movie S9), the grip state of L1-CAM-T273 on laminin was significantly lower than that of L1-CAM-WT, concurrent with its increased retrograde flow velocity (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T273 mutation also increased the retrograde flow speed of shootin1a on laminin (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the significant differences in the percentage of grip and slip states of L1-CAM-WT observed on laminin and on polylysine were lost in L1-CAM-T273 (Fig 4B), and the duration of the stop phase of L1-CAM was reduced by T273 mutation (Fig S3F), thereby indicating that the deletion of Thr273 in L1-CAM leads to dysfunction of the differential grip and slip mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the decreased grip state of L1-CAM-T273 on laminin (Fig 4B and Fig S3F), this mutation decreased significantly the magnitude of the traction force produced on laminin (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in vitro binding assay demonstrated that the T273 mutation also reduced the interaction between L1-CAM ECD and laminin (Fig 4F), suggesting that the decreased grip state of L1-CAM-T273 on laminin results from its reduced interaction with the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we analyzed the effect of the T273 mutation on laminin-mediated axonal haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of RNAi-refractory L1-CAM rescued the L1-CAM RNAi-induced reduction of the ratio of axons that extended on laminin (74% rescue, Fig 1F and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the rescue of the ratio was significantly reduced when RNAi-refractory L1-CAM-T273 was expressed (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, time-lapse imaging showed that the majority (77%) of the growth cones expressing WT L1-CAM did not cross the border from laminin to polylysine successfully, while the remainder (23%) exited from laminin to polylysine in error (Fig 4G and Movie S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the error ratio was significantly increased by the Thr273 deletion (Fig 4G), indicating that the mutation disrupts laminin-induced axonal haptotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T273 mutation did not have a significant effect on growth cone exit from polylysine to laminin (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data not only demonstrate a linkage between L1-CAM syndrome and the differential grip and slip mechanism, but also correlate functionally the differential grip and slip states (Fig 4 A and B) and laminin-induced axonal haptotaxis (Fig 4G and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study proposes a mechanical model of haptotaxis in which differential grip and slip of L1-CAM on the substrates direct growth cone migration (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study on fish keratocytes proposed two mechanisms for F-actin retrograde flow that have distinct effects on traction force (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is slippage between CAMs and substrates, where the adhesion substrate slip positively correlates with traction force; this mechanism is compatible with the signaling model in which receptor activation promotes actin polymerization or myosin II activation (Fig S2A) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other is slippage between F-actin flow and CAMs; this corresponds to the classic slip clutch mechanism, which can be also regulated by cell signaling (Fig S2B) (10, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our data on growth cones showed a slippage between L1-CAM and substrates and demonstrated a negative correlation between the L1-CAM slippage and force generation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2C and 3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present model (Fig 3E) is distinct from the above two models (Fig S2 A and B): L1-CAM acts as both a chemosensor and a mechano-effector for generating directional force to drive growth cone migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, dysfunction of this mechanism is associated with L1-CAM syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L1-CAM also interacts with CAMs, such as L1-CAM itself, axonin-1/TAG-1, F3/F11/contactin, and DM1-GRASP as well as the extracellular matrix component phosphacan (19, 25), raising the possibility that the grip and slip mechanism may be involved not only in extracellular matrix-based but also in cellcell contact-based growth cone migration (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, L1-CAM is associated with cancer metastasis as well as with L1-CAM syndrome (24, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its potential versatility, the present mechanism may also account for haptotaxis mediated by other CAMs on the basis of force generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
