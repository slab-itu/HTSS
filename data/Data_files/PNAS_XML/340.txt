Defective HIV-1 proviruses produce novel protein-coding RNA species in HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of defective HIV-1 proviruses in HIV-infected patients has been well documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current consensus view of the defective proviruses is that these are dead-end products that do not give rise to progeny virus and thus collectively represent a graveyard of viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the presence of defective HIV-1 proviruses capable of transcribing novel unspliced HIV-RNA species in HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the proviruses persistently present in combination antiretroviral therapy-treated patients are not defective in a conventional sense, but rather represent incomplete forms of proviruses encoding translationally competent HIV-RNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies directed toward curing HIV-1 infection and eliminating the state of persistent immune activation need to include approaches designed to eliminate cells harboring such proviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite years of plasma HIV-RNA levels less_than40 copies per milliliter during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the majority of HIV-infected patients exhibit persistent seropositivity to HIV-1 and evidence of immune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patients also show persistence of proviruses of HIV-1 in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these proviruses have been characterized as defective and thus thought to contribute little to HIV-1 pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining 5LTR-to-3LTR single-genome amplification and direct amplicon sequencing, we have identified the presence of defective proviruses capable of transcribing novel unspliced HIV-RNA (usHIV-RNA) species in patients at all stages of HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these novel usHIV-RNA transcripts had exon structures that were different from those of the known spliced HIV-RNA variants, they maintained translationally competent ORFs, involving elements of gag, pol, env, rev, and nef to encode a series of novel HIV-1 chimeric proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These novel usHIV-RNAs were detected in five of five patients, including four of four patients with prolonged viral suppression of HIV-RNA levels less_than40 copies per milliliter for more than 6 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that the persistent defective proviruses of HIV-1 are not silent, but rather may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by stimulating host-defense pathways that target foreign nucleic acids and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterization_of_HIV-1_Proviruses_in_Patients_with_HIV-1_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 5LTR-to-3LTR single genome amplification and direct amplicon sequencing of HIV-1 proviruses were performed for four patients with pVL  40 copies per milliliter (range 26,758225,658); four patients with pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter for  greater than 6 y (range 6.111.9 y); and one patient before and after suppressive cART.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proviral DNA lengths were estimated based on migration distances of the 5LTR-to-3LTR PCR-amplified DNA fragments on agarose gels and confirmed by sequencing (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the four patients with pVL  40 copies per milliliter, 42 of 48 (88%) full-length proviral genomes encoded for an intact virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for the four patients with pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter, full-length genomes were found in only one patient [patient (Pt) 8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that patient, six of the seven sequenced proviruses were defective with lethal mutations in their genomes (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher proportion of full-length proviruses observed in patients with pVL  40 copies per milliliter likely reflects the presence of substantial ongoing viral replication that was taking place in these patients at the time of sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, such truncated proviruses were not detected when either a plasmid DNA containing the full-length NL4.3 strain of HIV-1 or genomic DNA from the chronically infected 8E5 cell line were used as PCR templates (Fig S1), thus minimizing the possibility that these findings were a result of PCR artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these truncated proviruses could be detected as early as 24 h following in vitro infection of primary CD4+ T cells with the DH12 clone of HIV-1 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of clonally expanded defective provirus populations was evident in all four patients with pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter (Fig 1B, clones ivii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular note, the 3.0-kb clone ii proviruses (Fig 1B) accounted for 56% (15 of 27) of the total number of proviruses found in patient 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonally expanded proviruses were not detected in any of the four patients with pVL  40 copies per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this dichotomy likely reflects the relative proportions of intact and truncated proviruses in these two subpopulations of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly determine the effects of therapy and to evaluate changes in the distribution of HIV-1 proviral DNA lengths over time, samples from a single patient (patient 9) from 1995 and 2001 were examined (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before initiation of cART and in the setting of a higher viral load (pVL = 89,449 copies per milliliter), the frequency of full-length proviruses was 36% (14 of 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six years later and 3 y after achieving pVL less_than 50 copies per milliliter, this percentage had decreased to 6% (2 of 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the cross-sectional data presented in Fig 1 A and B in that the frequencies of full-length proviruses were higher when there was evidence of active viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deletion_Junction_Analysis_of_HIV-1_Proviruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the truncated proviruses derived from the nine patients, deletion sizes ranging from 251 bp to 8,033 bp in length were identified (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 40% of deletions were associated with directly repeated sequences at the deletion junctions, suggesting that they had occurred during the negative-strand synthesis phase of reverse transcription (Fig S3) (15, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one instance in patient 5 and two instances in patient 9 (Fig S3A), these deletions included the 15-nt stretch of purine-rich sequence referred to as the polypurine tract (PPT) that is located in the pol gene (cPPT) and the nef/U3 region of HIV-1 (3PPT) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms responsible for the remaining 60% of deletions are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in patient 9, we identified a provirus with a deletion-insertion-deletion with insertion of host sequence B4GALT5 (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion-inversion-deletion complex genome structures were found in patient 2 (Fig 1A and Fig S3A), patient 9 (Fig 1 E and F), and patient 5 (Fig 1B and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence analyses of these proviruses indicated that incorporation of the host sequence by readthrough of HIV-1 polyadenylation signal transcription (2022) or a single polymerase jump during reverse transcription (15, 17, 18) were unlikely mechanisms to explain the unique insertion or inversion in deletions genome structures we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings highlight the fact that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for alterations in the HIV-1 proviral genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted below, some of these alterations may lead to unique ORFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As seen in Fig S3A, many of the sequenced truncated proviruses contained, at a minimum, a short stretch of the 5 end of the gag-pol intronic region and a part of the Nef coding region, although lacking the second intronic region encoding most of the accessory proteins and Env (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If transcription occurred from any of these truncated proviruses, the transcripts would resemble unspliced (genomic) HIV-RNA with removal of the second intronic region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Novel_usHIV-1_RNA_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether or not any of these defective proviruses led to the production of novel usHIV-RNA that could lead to the production of novel proteins in the setting of prolonged viral suppression, we performed limiting-dilution single-genome amplification and directly sequenced the resulting single-genome amplicons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nested PCR reactions were performed with two forward PCR primers located immediately downstream of the major 5 splice donor site (D1) within the gag-pol intronic region (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These custom-designed PCR primers enabled us to selectively amplify unspliced forms of HIV-RNA species of up to 8.4 kb in size from patient 1 (pVL = 225,638 copies per milliliter) and patients 58 (pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of cell-associated usHIV-RNA lengths are shown in Fig 2A and plotted alongside the length distributions of the proviral DNA genomes derived from the same populations of CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the patient with clear evidence of substantial active virus replication (Pt 1 in Fig 2A and Fig S5), 12 of 25 (48%) of HIV-1 proviruses were full-length, as were 8 of 11 (73%) of the cell-associated usHIV-RNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for the four patients (Pts 58) with pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter, full-length proviruses were found in only one patient (Pt 8) and full-length usHIV-RNA species were not detected in any of these patients (Fig 2A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in vivo presence of clonally expanded proviral populations has been reported by ourselves and others (14, 2326).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is minimal evidence for transcription of defective proviruses (14, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we were able to identify the presence of clonally expanded defective provirus populations and to demonstrate ongoing transcription of these expanded defective proviral clones in two different patients (Pts 5 and 7) with pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter (clones ii and vi in Fig 2A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two additional instances (pairs a and b) in the same two patients (Pts 5 and 7), we were able to identify proviral DNAusHIV-RNA pairs, providing strong evidence that, at best, some of these defective proviruses were responsible for the production of novel usHIV-RNA species in patients with undetectable plasma viremia (Fig 2A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence analyses of these novel usHIV-RNA transcripts revealed exon structures that were very different from those of the known spliced HIV-1 mRNA variants and they ranged in size from 0.5 kb to 2.6 kb (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These novel usHIV-RNA transcripts had appropriate transcription start and stop signals and thus possessed translationally competent ORFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a minimum, a part of the gag and nef genes were retained in all of these truncated novel usHIV-RNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some also included elements of pol, env, and rev to encode a series of novel HIV-1 chimeric proteins (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As noted in Fig 2B, the novel usHIV-RNA transcripts reported in this study did not contain any of the classic splice acceptor/donor sites in their genomes (28), nor did they contain cryptic splice sites that have been reported elsewhere (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support the hypothesis that the defective proviruses seen in patients with HIV-1 infection lead to the production of novel HIV-RNA transcripts faithfully transcribed from these proviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the usHIV-RNA transcripts found in patients 58 were missing a gene segment encoding the Rev response element (RRE) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two usHIV-RNA transcripts contained a partial rev gene without the RRE (2.0 kb in Pt 5 and 1.3 kb in Pt 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, HIV-RNAs without any intact introns (i.e., fully spliced 2-kb HIV-RNA transcripts) or cis-acting repressive sequences (CRS) elements can be exported to the cytoplasm independent of Rev/RRE via the host cell TAP-dependent mRNA export pathway that mediates general mRNA export (28, 31) and are able to productively engage the host cells translational machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a partial removal of the CRS elements (the ones within pol) has led to Rev/RRE-independent nuclear export of the transcripts and protein production, albeit at low levels in in vitro systems (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that novel usHIV-RNAs reported in the present study do not contain any intact intronic regions (defined by splice donor/acceptor sites: D1-A1 and D2-A7) (Fig 2B) or the CRS element within pol and thus are of intron-free structures might explain the Rev/RRE-independent nuclear export of these variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_the_Pattern_of_HIV-1_Protein_Production_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that patients with HIV-1 infection, despite plasma pVL less_than 40 copies per milliliter, may still be capable of producing viral proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may help explain the persistence of antibodies to HIV-1 proteins greater than 10 y following initiation of suppressive cART (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the stochastic element to the fading of bands suggest an asynchronous decay in the viral proteins and is consistent with the production and decay of novel chimeric proteins, which can be seen by comparing the persistence of antibodies to Env in patient 5 and the relative persistence of antibodies to Gag in patient 6 with the uniform presence of antibodies to all viral proteins in patients 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, cells harboring defective proviral DNA capable of transcribing novel usHIV-RNAs with translationally competent ORFs can be seen in HIV-infected patients even despite a period of prolonged viral suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we were able to detect matching defective proviral DNAs and RNA transcripts in four instances in two separate patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of transcription-competent defective proviruses is a consistent finding in patients at all stages of HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have referred to these proviruses as zombie proviruses (34), as they are not really alive given that they lack the ability to produce intact viruses but can inflict harm by producing foreign nucleic acids and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear what fraction of cells harboring defective proviruses produce RNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that differences in the activation status of the host-infected cells or epigenetic state of the HIV-1 proviruses might play a role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistence of these proviruses may explain the persistent seropositivity to HIV-1 and persistent immune activation seen in patients with undetectable virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to eliciting persistent antibody responses, HIV-1 proteins derived from defective proviruses could also be associated with CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will hopefully further delineate the effects of the transcription or translation of defective proviruses on immune responses and immune activation in cART-treated HIV-infected individuals with prolonged viral suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies directed toward curing HIV-1 infection and eliminating the state of persistent immune activation associated with HIV-1 infection need to include approaches designed to eliminate cells harboring such proviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All participants were enrolled in National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board-approved HIV-1 clinical research protocols and provided written informed consent before study participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients (Pts 19) were chronically infected with HIV-1 and had been known to be positive for HIV-1 for  greater than 10 y (range: 1025 y) at the time of sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples from patients 14 and patient 9 (1995 sample) were obtained from time points when these patients had HIV-RNA levels 40 copies per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients (Pts 19) currently receive combination antiretroviral therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Purification_of_CD4+_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained either from leukapheresis packs (Pts 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and Pt 9s 2001 sample) or whole blood (Pts 3, 6, and patient 9s 1995 sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs by negative selection using the CD4+ T-cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simultaneous_Isolation_of_HIV-1_DNA_and_HIV-1_RNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total HIV-1 DNA and cell-associated HIV-1 RNA were simultaneously isolated from the same populations of CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in Fig S6, 410 × 106 CD4+ T cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in CER I lysis buffer (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents, Pierce) after addition of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (final 1 unit per microliter; Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were further incubated on ice for 1 min after addition of CER II lysis buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were centrifugated for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatants and the nuclei pellets were served as sources for cytoplasmic RNA and genomic DNA, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic diagram summarizing the major steps involved in these procedures is shown in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from the supernatants using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the protocol (including an on-column DNase digestion step) provided by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Completeness of the fractionation of cytoplasmic RNAs was confirmed as shown in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was extracted from the pelleted nuclei using the PicoPure kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Amplification_of_Near_Full-Length_HIV-1_DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was subjected to limiting dilution before amplification with a near full-length outer PCR followed by nested amplification with an inner PCR (Fig S4 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR was performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart (KAPA Biosystems) with the initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 20 s, annealing at 65 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 6 min, with the final extension at 72 °C for 6 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR reactions were performed in volumes of 25 or 50 µL in 0.2 mL PCR microtubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final concentrations of both primers were 400 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR products were purified with either 0.6× (a Bead:DNA ratio) AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) or the BluePippin (Sage Science) using the 0.75%DF Marker S1 high-pass 410 kb vs.2 cassette definition with BP-Start: 6,700 and BP-end: 10,000, followed by purification with 1.0× AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Amplification_of_Near_Full-Length_usHIV-1_RNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
cDNA was synthesized from RNA that was diluted to an endpoint with the SuperScript IV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an anchored oligo(dT)20 primer that consists of a string of 20 deoxythymidylic acid resides followed by five nucleotides (TGAAG) complementary to the R region of the HIV-1 3 LTR (Primer 5T25) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single molecules of an 8.4-kb fragment, encompassing near full-length unspliced HIV-1 RNA, obtained through limiting dilution, were PCR-amplified using the PCR primers listed in Fig S4 and Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For second-round PCR reactions, a primer pair, RNA F2 (796816)/RNA R2 (91459171), was used in most cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate primer pair, RNA F2 (796816)/RNA R2 (94389458) was used in cases where the RNA R2 primer failed to yield an adequate band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spliced (singly spliced and multiply spliced) HIV-1 mRNAs are spliced at the major 5 splice donor site (D1, 743 in HXB2) and lack intron 1 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, selective amplification of usHIV-RNA was achieved through using forward PCR primers (RNA F1 and RNA F2) located immediately downstream of the 5 major splice donor site (D1, 743 in HXB2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR conditions were the same as the ones used for amplification of near full-length HIV-1 DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single molecules were sequenced as near-full-length amplicons directly from PCR products using the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-molecule direct sequencing was also performed for a subset of patient 9 samples using a PacBio RS II instrument without shearing using commercially available chemistries and protocols (P4/C2, 180-min movies) or the MiSeq System (Illumina) with a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During postsequencing analyses of data, samples that contained more than one template (evidenced by having heterogeneous peaks on sequencing chromatograms or having degenerate sequences) were discarded and excluded from the further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessment_of_Simultaneous_Isolation_of_HIV-1_DNA_and_HIV-1_RNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The efficacy of cytoplasmic-nuclear RNA fractionation was assessed by amplification of a precursor form (pre-mRNA, intron-containing, residing exclusively in the nucleus) and a mature form (fully spliced mRNA) of GAPDH RNA as previously done elsewhere (36), except using the following PCR primer pairs: (i) GAPDH pre-mRNA, sense, 5-CCACCAACTGCTTAGCACC-3 and antisense, 5-CTCCCCACCTTGAAAGGAAAT-3; and (ii) GAPDH mRNA, sense, 5-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT-3 and antisense, 5-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Completeness of the fractionation of cytoplasmic RNAs was confirmed by the absence of unspliced GAPDH pre-mRNA in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimation of cell equivalents for the extracted DNA was done by quantitative PCR using a primer pair that amplifies the RNaseP gene (two copies per diploid cell) (Thermo Fisher Scientific; TaqMan Copy Number Reference Assay, human, RNaseP, 4403326).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA from PBMCs of a healthy volunteer was serially diluted (five 10-fold dilutions, dynamic range: 20,0002 cell equivalent/reaction) and used as external controls to generate a standard curve for quantitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_the_HIV-1_DNA_PCR_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The newly developed HIV-1 DNA PCR system was validated using genomic DNA from the 8E5 cell line (NIH AIDS reagent program, Catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  95) and plasmid DNA containing full-length NL4.3 strain of HIV-1 as templates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the nested PCR reactions yielded single bands corresponding to 8.9-kb DNA fragments on agarose gels (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity (100% detection rate) of the nested PCR, when using genomic DNA from the 8E5 cell line as a template, was assessed to be around 10 copies per reaction (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification of near full-length HIV-DNA was successful in 26 of 26 patients (plasma viral load range: less_than40 to  greater than 500,000 copies per milliliter) tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the possibility of PCR primer bias, an alternative second round PCR primer pair: DNA F3 (646666)/DNA R3 (96509676) was used to amplify near full-length HIV DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results (sensitivity and HIV-1 provirus length profile) were obtained with using the alternative second round PCR primer pair, except that this primer pair had lower amplification yields compared with the original second round PCR primer pair (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequence_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct sequencing results were analyzed with the HIVAlign program (www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/VIRALIGN/viralign.html) (37) to map the regions that the input sequences touched relative to the reference sequence HXB2 of HIV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypermutants were detected using the HyperMut program (www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Highlighter program (v2.2.3, www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIGHLIGHT/HIGHLIGHT_XYPLOT/highlighter.html), AliView (v1.17.1) (38) and the Sequencher program (v5.3, Gene Codes Corporation) were used to generate sequence alignments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method with the PhyML 3.0 program (www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/PHYML/interface.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORF finder program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) was used to detect presence of valid ORFs in unspliced HIV-1 RNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
