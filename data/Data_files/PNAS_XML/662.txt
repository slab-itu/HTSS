Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 triggers a biophysical change in the red blood cell that facilitates invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The blood-stage malaria parasite, the merozoite, invades the human red blood cell (RBC) using receptorligand interactions between the parasite and host cell surface, yet the function of these interactions to invasion is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have analyzed the binding between one key merozoite invasion ligand, called erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), and glycophorin A on the RBC surface (the most dominant surface antigen) and explored how this interaction affects the biophysical properties of the red cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a combination of imaging techniques, we demonstrate that the malaria parasite changes the biophysical nature of the red cell, facilitating its own entry by effectively reducing the energy barrier to invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates a red cell biophysical contribution to merozoite entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Invasion of the red blood cell (RBC) by the Plasmodium parasite defines the start of malaria disease pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, experimental investigations into invasion have focused predominantly on the role of parasite adhesins or signaling pathways and the identity of binding receptors on the red cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential role for signaling pathways within the erythrocyte, which might alter red cell biophysical properties to facilitate invasion, has largely been ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), a protein required for entry in most parasite strains, plays a key role by binding to glycophorin A (GPA) on the red cell surface, although the function of this binding interaction is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using real-time deformability cytometry and flicker spectroscopy to define biophysical properties of the erythrocyte, we show that EBA175 binding to GPA leads to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a reduction in the bending modulus of the cells membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolate the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that reduction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly imply that the malaria parasite primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, altering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a critical energy barrier to invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding would constitute a major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces working together to facilitate entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

EBA175_Region_II_Binding_to_GPA_Alters_RBC_Deformability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theoretical models and phosphoproteomic studies suggest that the P. falciparum merozoite triggers host changes to facilitate its invasion on binding to the RBC (7, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore whether these changes are mediated by EBAs, we investigated the effect of EBA175 binding to its RBC receptor, GPA, on overall erythrocyte biophysical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This receptorligand interaction is specific; it is mediated by glycosylated residues on GPA that are absent in other glycophorin molecules (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a recombinantly expressed receptor-binding region (region II) of EBA175 (rEBA175-RII) (19, 20), we first validated receptor specificity of the protein incubated with untreated or neuraminidase (Neu)-treated human RBCs (Fig 1A), with the latter ablating sialic acid residues on GPA, which are known to be crucial for binding (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having demonstrated the Neu-binding specificity of the rEBA175-RII ligand, we next incubated RBCs with different concentrations of the protein before analyzing cells using real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flow cytometry-based technique permits the label-free analysis of 1,000 cells per second, making it particularly useful for analyzing cells that show natural variability in their biophysical characteristics, such as RBCs (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For untreated cells, analysis of deformation versus cell size (cross-sectional area) found that most cells were contained within one population, with an average cross-sectional area of 36.5 m2 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second population of larger cells (50 m2), when manually inspected, was found to contain cell clumps, predominantly doublets (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because RT-DC analysis is based on extracting cell contours to quantify cell deformation, and contours of doublets could potentially lead to a skew in the data dependent on the shape of the cell clump, such clumps were removed from downstream analyses by creating a gate containing the singlet RBC population (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of RBCs with rEBA175-RII resulted in many of the cells forming larger clumps (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aggregates were removed from our analysis as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-DC measurements of RBCs treated with 2550 g/mL rEBA175-RII, a concentration similar to the concentration previously used for antibody studies (24), revealed a significant reduction in RBC deformability (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher concentrations of rEBA175-RII, a significant proportion of RBCs were present in cell doublets or clumps, complicating analysis using this technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the specificity of these identified biophysical changes, rEBA175-RII was also incubated with Neu-treated RBCs (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells do not show a decrease in deformability, confirming this effect to be specific to rEBA175-RII binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flicker_Spectroscopy_of_RBC_Biophysical_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the cause of biophysical changes seen by RT-DC, we sought to use a method that would permit independent measurement of the tension and bending modulus of the RBC surface on EBA175 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane fluctuation analysis (flicker spectroscopy) has been used extensively as a method for mechanical characterization of vesicles (25, 26) and erythrocytes (2729) at the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically for our purposes, the cytoskeletal and lipid membrane properties dominate different ranges of the fluctuation spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that tension in RBCs largely arises from the cytoskeleton underlying the erythrocyte bilayer and that changes in tension are primarily reflected in the lower fluctuation mode numbers (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, variations in the RBC bending modulus are largely expected to come from changes to the cell membrane, and this parameter is reflected in the higher mode numbers (27) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although many chemicals known to induce cellular biophysical changes have wide-ranging effects causing both cytoskeletal and membrane alterations, we sought to validate the assumptions outlined above by inducing several controlled biophysical changes in RBCs to confirm the reliability of flicker spectroscopy in detecting erythrocyte cytoskeletal and membrane changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutaraldehyde preferentially cross-links proteins, and is therefore expected to affect cytoskeletal properties (i.e., tension), although it can interact with and cross-link amino groups on phospholipids (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this expectation, at 0.01% glutaraldehyde, RBC tension increased significantly (Fig 2A), with no significant effect on bending modulus (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2A shows representative spectra of individual RBCs from each treatment sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher concentrations, membrane oscillations were reduced to negligible levels (Fig S2A), suggesting that all protein and membrane constituents had been cross-linked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a further test, we explored diamide, an oxidizing reagent that has previously been shown to cause tightening of the RBC cytoskeleton and reduce RBC deformability (31) (Fig 2 C and D and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of RBCs with 50 M and 500 M diamide resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in tension (Fig 2C) in line with previously published work (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact effect of RBC treatment with diamide on its bending modulus has not previously been tested, the bending modulus change (Fig 2D) is comparable to that seen with other oxidative reagents, which cause lipid peroxidation resulting in higher bending modulus (32) as well as reduced membrane fluidity (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to isolate the effect of changing bending modulus, specifically targeting RBC lipid properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction measurements and molecular dynamic simulations suggest that DMSO disrupts interactions between the headgroups of different lipids, decreasing bilayer thickness and increasing membrane fluidity (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations suggest that at a DMSO concentration of 5%, the average area between the inner and outer membrane layers would be reduced by 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, at 15% DMSO, the area reduction would be expected to be 55%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tests at both concentrations by flicker spectroscopy (Fig 2 E and F and Fig S2C) demonstrated that the bending modulus was indeed reduced at both 5% and 15% DMSO (Fig 2F); however, this reduction was only statistically significant at 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, at this concentration, some RBCs (omitted from analysis) undergo morphological changes wherein tension (Fig 2E) is also affected, likely due to the stress caused by the high percentage of DMSO used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a final way of experimentally validating our flicker approach, we investigated use of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), a probe that reduces lipid packing and lipid order by integrating into the RBC membrane (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 7-KC significantly and specifically reduces bending modulus without affecting tension properties (Fig 2 G and H and Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate our ability to decouple membrane and cytoskeletal changes in the RBC using flicker spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EBA175_Binding_to_GPA_Triggers_Specific_RBC_Cytoskeletal_and_Membrane_Changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established adequate controls, we next investigated how EBA175 binding to the RBC affects cytoskeletal and membrane properties of the target cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the RT-DC data as well as previous biophysical data examining GPA binding by antibody moieties (24), we found a clear concentration-dependent increase in RBC tension on addition of rEBA175-RII (Fig 3A and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At very low concentrations, we noticed a small but reproducible reduction in tension at low rEBA175-RII concentrations, suggesting the RBC biophysical response to rEBA175-RII might be a nonlinear concentration-dependent effect at low concentrations (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, this reduction in tension was also present using RBCs pretreated with Neu, supporting the notion that a small number of binding sites are still present following enzyme treatment, giving rise to the small effect alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bending modulus, rEBA175-RII binding significantly reduced values across a wide range of concentrations (Fig 3B and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was dependent on sialic acid residues, confirming that the change is binding-specific (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of rEBA175-RII on RBC biophysical properties were reproducible across different RBC samples (Fig 3 C and D and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance_of_RBC_Tension_for_Parasite_Invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the relevance of the rEBA175-RIImediated tension and bending modulus changes to parasite invasion, each component was isolated to test its importance independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies using anti-GPA antibodies have shown that the binding-mediated decrease in deformability occurs through signaling involving the GPA cytoplasmic tail (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that in the absence of this region, rEBA175-RII would not initiate an increase in tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we used RBCs isolated from an individual with an extremely rare human glycophorin variant, the Miltenberger class V (MiV) condition, in which GPA and GPB are replaced with a hybrid GPA-GPB protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein contains the extracellular regions of GPA, but the shortened intracellular tail of GPB (18, 37), which is not predicted to interact with the underlying cytoskeleton as wild-type GPA does.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entirely in line with predictions, rEBA175-RII did not cause an increase in tension in MiV RBCs (Fig 4A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the absence of the cytoplasmic GPA tail, EBA175 binding caused a small but noticeable decrease in tension instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the bending modulus decrease still occurred in MiV cells (Fig 4B and Fig S4), suggesting that this biophysical change is independent of the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of GPA and the RBC interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the importance of the glycophorins for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum is indisputable (12, 18, 38), some parasite strains have evolved to invade independent of GPA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the GPA tail-mediated tension change following EBA175 binding was required for invasion, parasites that relied on GPA for invasion would be expected to invade MiV RBCs less efficiently than parasites invading via a GPA-independent pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we purified mature schizonts from two strains, W2mefRh4 and W2mefEBA175, and incubated these schizonts with either MiV cells or normal RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  W2mefRh4 parasites, lacking Rh4, rely on EBA175GPA interaction for invasion (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  W2mefEBA175 parasites are, in contrast, able to invade RBCs independent of EBA175GPA interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were found in the ability of either parasite strain to invade MiV RBCs (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that, contrary to expectations, the tension increase triggered by the cytoskeletal tail of GPA is not required for invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance_of_RBC_Bending_Modulus_for_Parasite_Invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having assessed the role of tension in invasion, we next sought to assess the relationship between bending modulus and P. falciparum invasion directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because bending modulus describes the amount of energy required to bend a lipid bilayer, a reduction in this property would also decrease the energy barrier to invasion and, as such, would be predicted to increase parasite invasion efficiency (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bending modulus reduction might derive from changes in lipid composition [e.g., the percentage of cholesterol (39)], asymmetry between inner and outer membrane leaflets (25), or the extent of lipid chain saturation or modification (40), each of which has been described to affect membrane thickness and bending modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to assess whether the decrease in bending modulus following GPA binding resulted from changes in membrane asymmetry, we tested whether binding of rEBA175-RII to its RBC receptor triggered calcium changes (associated with scramblase activation in the RBC) or externalization of lipid moieties normally limited to the internal membrane leaflet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluro-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-4 AM) and Annexin V labeling of RBCs in the presence or absence of rEBA175-RII found no evidence for calcium signaling (marked by Fluo-4 AM) (Fig 5A) or for a differential externalization of phosphatidylserine (marked by Annexin V) (Fig 5B), as opposed to incubation with the calcium channel activator Yoda 1 (used here as a positive control) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests asymmetry is not the direct cause of the reduction in bending modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, therefore, the direct cause of the reduction in bending modulus remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the significance of a reduction in bending modulus, and given the essential role of the GPA invasion route for sialic acid-dependent invasion, which is not attributable to the changes in tension, we investigated whether an experimentally induced reduction in this parameter improved invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with 7-KC has been shown to reduce lipid packing/order in membranes (42), and as demonstrated above (Fig 2 G and H and Fig S2D), it leads to a reduction in bending modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment of RBCs with 7-KC would therefore be predicted to increase invasion efficiency if parasite-induced reduction of bending modulus is a key parameter for invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs pretreated with 7-KC to decrease the bending modulus were more readily invaded by P. falciparum merozoites (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate a clear linkage between parasite-induced changes in the RBC surface and invasion ligand binding, the direct consequence of which is to change RBC biophysical properties to increase invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, these data strongly imply that P. falciparum merozoites alter the target erythrocytes biophysical properties before invasion to facilitate their own entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, complementary biophysical approaches demonstrate that binding of the malaria parasite invasion ligand EBA175 to its host cell receptor GPA triggers a biophysical response in the RBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploration of this change identified a reduction in the RBC bending modulus on binding, which itself significantly increases invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, consistent with biophysical predictions of the energetics involved in invasion (15), the malaria parasite does appear to alter the RBC surface to facilitate its own entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the key challenges with biophysical approaches that explore changes in RBC properties is differentiating between contributions arising from cytoskeletal and membrane changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a number of chemical reagents previously described to affect cytoskeletal and lipid properties (i.e., glutaraldehyde, diamide, DMSO, 7-KC), we confirm that we can distinguish between changes occurring within the cytoskeletal and lipid membrane components described by tension and bending modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability provides a key foundation for investigating the RBC biophysical response to binding by the invasion ligand EBA175.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both biophysical techniques used in this study identified an increased rigidification (reduction in RBC deformability/increase in tension) at the higher concentrations tested (10 g/mL rEBA175-RII), which is in agreement with previous work using GPA antibodies (24, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, we measured a small, but repeatable, reduction in tension at low concentrations by flicker spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result would suggest that the interaction between EBA175 and GPA, and resulting changes in the RBC, is not a linear relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of merozoite invasion, where the absolute number of EBA175 molecules at the RBC interface is unknown, several different scenarios could arise that have an impact on the invasion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the invasion site, a higher local EBA175 concentration could significantly change the local tension and bending modulus conducive to invasion (model in Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, diffuse EBA175 on the RBC surface [or shed from the parasite surface (45)] may affect the wider RBC, either triggering further changes conducive to invasion or potentially binding to bystander RBCs, thereby lowering their energy barrier for invasion events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the two key changes in tension and bending modulus, it is surprising that the cytoskeletal changes, as mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of GPA, were not found to be essential for invasion in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding contradicted our expectation that increased cross-linking of the GPA tail upon EBA175 binding might be functional for invasion, for instance, serving as a focal point where the RBC cytoskeleton could be opened up around the invading parasite or providing stability for the tight junction (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that direct cross-linking of GPA to the cytoskeleton via its cytoplasmic tail does not significantly impact invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, a reduction in bending modulus, which still occurred in MiV cells, appears to be one of the critical roles of EBA175 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bending modulus is an intrinsic property of the lipid bilayer that describes the amount of energy required to bend it and is affected by lipid composition, membrane thickness, and membrane asymmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties regulate numerous cellular functions through membrane curvature (47), endocytosis (48), opening of protein channels (49), and initiation of signaling processes (50), and, unsurprisingly, they are often exploited by intracellular pathogens (40, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were therefore intrigued by the possibility that the architecture of the lipid bilayer might be exploited by the merozoite during invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invasion into RBCs pretreated with 7-KC, mimicking the bending modulus decrease caused by GPA binding, demonstrated that invasion efficiency for both sialic acid-dependent (W2mefRh4) and -independent (W2mefEBA175) strains significantly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result strongly suggests that parasitehost interactions trigger RBC biophysical responses that contribute to invasion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the nature of this change?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the decrease in bending modulus is not dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of GPA, this change might arise through a reduction in the lateral pressure within the membrane caused by a conformational change in GPA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as transmembrane proteins (i.e., mechanosensors) can be regulated by forces exerted on them by the lipid bilayer, transmembrane- and membrane-associated proteins are also capable of affecting membrane properties by modulating the bilayer structure (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dimerization of EBA175 around GPA could lead to a conformational change in GPA within the membrane, effectively freeing up space in the bilayer and reducing lateral pressure (and hence bending modulus) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that EBA175 binding causes a signaling cascade in the RBC is not surprising, given that the strong RBC deformations that occur during invasion are dependent on the EBA175GPA interactions (6, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future efforts should focus on identifying molecular and/or signaling events that lead to these biophysical changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methods for parasite culture, measuring invasion efficiency, erythrocyte binding, and flow cytometry followed standard approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full description of these methods and details of statistical analysis are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RT-DC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fifty microliters of packed RBCs were incubated with appropriate concentrations of EBA175-RII at room temperature for 1 h before being drawn into a 1-mL syringe and connected to a custom-made polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were recorded at 2,000 frames per second (fps) using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based camera (MC1362; Mikrotron) and an NI-1433 Frame Grabber (National Instruments) as they travel through the PDMS chip at flow rates of 0.40.12 Ls1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of deformation is extracted from the cross-sectional area calculated using a custom-derived contour-tracking algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full discussion of the technique and analysis is provided by Otto et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flicker_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RBCs were diluted into RPMI-1640 (SigmaAldrich) at 0.5% hematocrit and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluctuation videotapes were recorded on a Nikon Ti Microscope (objective lens: Nikon Plan Apo 100× 1.4-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oil immersion) using an OrcaFlash4.0 CMOS camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 4,500 frames were recorded at a frame rate of 150 fps and an exposure time of 1 ms. Data analysis was carried out using a custom-built LabVIEW (National Instruments) program that detects and extracts membrane contours from each frame with subpixel resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details of membrane fluctuation analysis are given elsewhere (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the deviation of each contour from the mean membrane position was decomposed into fluctuation modes by Fourier transforming to give a fluctuation power spectrum of mean square mode amplitudes at the cell equator [h2(qx, y = 0)] as a function of mode wavenumber (qx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, the bending modulus () and tension () can be fitted using the following equation:h(qx,y=0)2=1LkBT2(1qx1kc+qx2),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and L is mean circumference of the cell contour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model assumes that the cell surface behaves as a flat sheet and that we image the equator of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When fitting the fluctuation data, mode numbers 4 and below were excluded due to significant influence of the cell shape (breakdown of the flat sheet assumption) and mode numbers above 20 were removed because these fluctuations lie outside the spatial and temporal resolution of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tension and bending modulus terms dominate different parts of the fluctuation power spectrum (and can be attributed to distinct cellular properties as described below), and so can be resolved independently using a double-parameter nonlinear fit to the model above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Parasite_Culturing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmodium falciparum parasites (strains W2mefRh4 and W2mefEBA175) were maintained in standard culture conditions (53) in human O+ erythrocytes at 4% hematocrit in complete RPMI-1640 media (Life Technologies) and synchronized using 5% sorbitol (SigmaAldrich) (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs were provided by the blood bank, with MiV cells generously provided by Nicole Thornton, International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (IBGRL), Bristol, UK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen MiV cells were thawed in Alsevers solution (SigmaAldrich) at 37 °C and centrifuged at 500 × g, and the supernatant was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then washed in PBS and stored at 4 °C in Alsevers solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Invasion_and_Growth_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Schizont parasites were magnetically purified using a commercially available Magnetic Cell Separation (MACS) system (Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schizonts were added directly to fresh RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For invasion experiments with 7-KC (SigmaAldrich), RBCs were incubated with 7-KC (1 M, 5 M, and 10 M) or equivalent DMSO control (0.2% final volume) for 45 min at 37 °C before being resuspended into fresh media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 16 h, cells were washed in PBS, stained with SybrGreen (1:2,000 in PBS; SigmaAldrich) for 20 min at room temperature protected from light, and washed before invasion was quantified by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 100,000 cells were acquired per well using the FITC channel of a BD Fortessa flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP fluorescence was plotted against forward scatter, and a gate was drawn for GFP-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uninfected RBCs were used as a gating control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Erythrocyte-Binding_Assay_and_Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Binding assays were performed as described (56), with eluate analyzed for the presence of rEBA175-RII by Western blotting using standard methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary antibody used was mouse antiEBA-175 (57) antibody (1:1,000), and the secondary antibody was antimouse-HRP (1:5,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blots were developed using ECL (Amersham).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Annexin_V_and_Fluo-4_AM_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RBCs were washed in complete RPMI media and stained with Fluo-4 AM (3 M) for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed, incubated with 1 g/mL rEBA175-RII, an equivalent volume of buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl], or 10 M Yoda1 for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBCs were resuspended into 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2 with 1% Annexin V for 10 min, and then transferred into fresh binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 100,000 cells were acquired per well using the FITC channel of the BD Fortessa Flow cytometer (Fluo-4 AM) and the Cy-5 channel (Annexin V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RT-DC data were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model in R (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models were defined using the package lme4 (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model M1 allows varying mean level and effect (random intercept and random slope model), whereas model M2 (null hypothesis) assumes no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models M1 and M2 are then compared using a likelihood ratio test (60), and the Wilks theorem (61) allows calculation of the P value for the effect, with P less_than 0.05 considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for analyzing the statistical significance of flicker spectroscopy experiments and P. falciparum RBC invasion data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before statistical analysis, the distribution of flicker spectroscopy data was assessed for normality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the data were not normally distributed across all experiments, analysis was carried out using the MannWhitney test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was kept consistent across all flicker spectroscopy experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum RBC invasion data were analyzed using the Students t test (unpaired, two-tailed), with P less_than 0.05 considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
