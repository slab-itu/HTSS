Contribution of cyanobacterial alkane production to the ocean hydrocarbon cycle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of organisms synthesize hydrocarbons, but the scale at which this occurs in the environment is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide the first global estimates of hydrocarbon production by the two most abundant cyanobacteria on Earth, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that these organisms represent a significant and widespread source of hydrocarbons to the worlds oceans, which in turn may sustain populations of obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria known to be important in consuming anthropogenic oil spills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates the role cyanobacteria play in the ocean hydrocarbon cycle and reveals the massive scale of this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widespread distribution of cyanobacteria and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments suggests the hydrocarbon cycle is pervasive in many natural ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the ocean, where alkanes such as pentadecane and heptadecane can be found even in waters minimally polluted with crude oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Populations of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, which are responsible for the turnover of these compounds, are also found throughout marine systems, including in unpolluted waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest the existence of an unknown and widespread source of hydrocarbons in the oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that strains of the two most abundant marine cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, produce and accumulate hydrocarbons, predominantly C15 and C17 alkanes, between 0.022 and 0.368% of dry cell weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on global population sizes and turnover rates, we estimate that these species have the capacity to produce 2540 pg alkanes per mL per day, which translates into a global ocean yield of 308771 million tons of hydrocarbons annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that both obligate and facultative marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria can consume cyanobacterial alkanes, which likely prevents these hydrocarbons from accumulating in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings implicate cyanobacteria and hydrocarbon degraders as key players in a notable internal hydrocarbon cycle within the upper ocean, where alkanes are continually produced and subsequently consumed within days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore we show that cyanobacterial alkane production is likely sufficient to sustain populations of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, whose abundances can rapidly expand upon localized release of crude oil from natural seepage and human activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine_Cyanobacteria_Encode_Alkane_Biosynthetic_Pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the genetic capability for hydrocarbon production in marine cyanobacterial genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathways are conserved in sequenced cyanobacteria, encompassing isolates from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that hydrocarbons have a key, as-yet-unidentified, function in cyanobacteria that is independent of the ecosystem these organisms inhabit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended this work by including newly sequenced Prochlorococcus strains, isolated from diverse regions of the ocean (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 36 Prochlorococcus and 15 marine Synechococcus strains examined have the predicted capacity to synthesize alkanes via FAR/FAD enzymes (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of Leptolyngbya sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC7376 and Moorea producens 3L, which encode Ols homologs, all of the other marine cyanobacteria including Cyanobium, Acaryochloris, Crocosphaera, Trichodesmium, Lyngbya, Oscillatoria, Nodularia, and Microcoleus species encode FAR/FAD homologs (15, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that alkanes are the predominant hydrocarbons released by cyanobacteria into the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homologs of FAR/FAD and Ols were not identified in any other bacterial, plant, or algal species, suggesting that these pathways for hydrocarbon production are unique to cyanobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prochlorococcus_and_Synechococcus_Accumulate_Predominantly_Heptadecane_and_Pentadecane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we measured the hydrocarbon contents of cultured Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus cells via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrocarbon content has been quantified in a wide range of freshwater and terrestrial cyanobacteria, all of which produced either alkanes or alkenes, ranging between 0.024 and 0.262% of dry cell weight (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the hydrocarbon content of Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus species has not been quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis included axenic cultures of three Prochlorococcus strains: CCMP1986 (MED4) and MIT9312both high-light-adapted strains, representative of the most numerically abundant Prochlorococcus ecotypes (21)and one low-light-adapted strain, Prochlorococcus MIT9313.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axenic cultures of three diverse marine Synechococcus strains, WH7803, WH7805, and WH8102 (16), and one estuarine strain, WH5701, were also examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all Prochlorococcus strains examined, pentadecane was the dominant hydrocarbon, 96% of the total, with the remainder consisting of heptadecane (Table 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentadecane was previously identified as the dominant hydrocarbon in Prochlorococcus CCMP1986, although the presence of heptadecane was not observed (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total hydrocarbon contents were between 0.350 and 0.711 fg per cell or 0.1490.368% of dry cell weight (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentadecane was also the dominant hydrocarbon in Synechococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WH7803, WH7805, and WH8102, ranging between 79 and 92% of total hydrocarbons (Table 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder consisted of 8-heptadecene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrocarbon composition of Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus species differs from that of other alkane-producing cyanobacteria, where heptadecane was the dominant hydrocarbon (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrocarbon composition of Synechococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WH5701 was significantly different from the marine strains, consisting of 3.7% pentadecane, 45.3% heptadecane, and 50.9% 8-heptadecene (Fig S1), which may reflect its evolutionary distance from the other Synechococcus strains examined here (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total hydrocarbons in Synechococcus were between 0.304 and 2.580 fg per cell or 0.0220.138% of dry cell weight (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of Prochlorococcus CCMP1986, which has the highest hydrocarbon yields so far observed in a cyanobacterium, hydrocarbon contents were within the range previously observed for other cyanobacteria (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significant_Potential_for_Hydrocarbon_Production_by_Prochlorococcus_and_Synechococcus_in_the_Oceans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the average measured abundances of hydrocarbons in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cells and their population sizes, we estimate that, at any given point in time, these cyanobacteria represent a pool of 2.12 million tons of alkanes in the oceans (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although total population sizes of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus remain largely stable on an annual timescale, their turnover rates are high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prochlorococcus divide once every 12 d (2325), with cellular losses balancing division in a quasi-steady-state manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyanobacterial mortality can be mediated by a variety of factors, including predation by grazers or viruses, UV-induced lysis, or spontaneous cell death (18), resulting in release of organic carbon compounds, including alkanes, into the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these cellular turnover rates, production of alkanes by Prochlorococcus globally is estimated to be between 269 and 539 million tons per annum (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synechococcus maximum growth rates are comparable to or slighter faster than those of Prochlorococcus (25, 26), with similar mechanisms of mortality (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, estimates of in situ specific growth rates are broader, between 16 d (29, 30), due to the varying environments Synechococcus occupies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, total annual production of hydrocarbons by Synechococcus could vary between 39 and 232 million tons per annum (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural oil seepage from within marine sediments is estimated to be between 0.2 and 2 million tons per annum and is geographically concentrated at the continental margins (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equivalent release of hydrocarbons into the ocean is thought to result from human activities such as oil leakage from drilling rigs and shipping vessels (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized events such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which released 0.435 million tons of oil (7), can further increase anthropogenic hydrocarbon inputs into the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the 308771 million tons of hydrocarbons produced annually by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus significantly exceeds the inputs from these other natural and anthropogenic sources and, due to the broad distribution of cyanobacteria across the worlds surface oceans, is more widespread (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, measurements of pentadecane and heptadecane in marine surface waters indicate that they are present only at femtogram- to picogram-per-mL levels (2, 4, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our analyses, we estimate that the amounts of hydrocarbons produced by marine cyanobacteria to be on the order of 2540 pgmL1d1 (Materials and Methods), indicating that the majority of pentadecane and heptadecane in surface waters may derive from cyanobacteria and that these compounds do not accumulate significantly; hence, the continuous production of cyanobacterial hydrocarbons must be balanced by degradation or loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some hydrocarbon exchange occurs between the ocean and the atmosphere (2, 32), but not at rates sufficient to balance estimated cyanobacterial production rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the temperature-dependent half-life of pentadecane and heptadecane is between 0.8 and 5 d at surface ocean temperatures, a significant fraction of the hydrocarbons will likely escape these abiotic loss pathways (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, biological degradation is likely to be responsible for the majority of turnover (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Both_Obligate_and_Facultative_Hydrocarbon-Degrading_Bacteria_Can_Metabolize_Cyanobacterial_Alkanes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alkane degradation pathways have not been identified in grazers of cyanobacteria (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the majority of cyanobacterially produced hydrocarbons are likely to be released into the environment and subsequently degraded by bacteria (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including Cycloclasticus, Thalassolituus, Oleiphilus, Oleispira, and Alcanivorax species, have been isolated from geographically diverse coastal and open-ocean regions in all seas, in sediments and both surface and deep waters, including areas with minimal oil pollution (911, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcanivorax species are typically among the dominant bacteria found metabolizing crude oil during large spill events (3438).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other bacteria, including Marinobacter, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter species, which can use hydrocarbons in addition to a broader range of carbon sources, have also been detected in oil-polluted ocean samples (10, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether cyanobacterial alkanes can support the growth of both obligate as well as nonobligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, we tested the ability of three axenic and well-characterized oil degraders (5, 8) to grow on either heptadecane or crude oil: Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2, an obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium (39), and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and Marinobacter aquaolei VT8, two strains that can facultatively grow on crude oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that all three strains could grow in media containing either oil or heptadecane as the only source of reduced carbon (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that diverse groups of marine hydrocarbon degraders may contribute to the degradation of the hydrocarbons produced by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cyanobacterial_Hydrocarbon_Production_Can_Support_Populations_of_A_borkumensis_SK2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. borkumensis SK2 has previously been demonstrated to use a broad range of alkanes, with similar growth rates observed when either pentadecane or heptadecane was added as the sole carbon source (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both this study and the previous report (40) an excess of alkanes, similar to concentrations in oil spills, was used (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether cyanobacterial alkane production is sufficient to support hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations in minimally polluted seawater has not been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information on population sizes of specific hydrocarbon degraders in the environment is limited, with estimates of Alcanivorax varying between 101 and 5 × 103 cells/mL (35, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in most studies Alcanivorax cell numbers are below the detection limit (34), as assayed via quantitative PCR (5, 6) or in situ hybridization (36), and their population dynamics in the oligotrophic ocean are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the yield of A. borkumensis SK2 on cyanobacterial alkanes, cells were grown in artificial sea water (ASW) medium either without any organic carbon or containing only the minimum amount of heptadecane that could be added to the culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small increase in cell number was observed in cultures containing heptadecane, before declining to the original cell number by day 3 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of heptadecane to this culture sustained cell numbers for a further 3 d, although a smaller increase in population size was observed compared with the initial growth period, suggesting that some other component of the medium became limiting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we find that the yield of A. borkumensis SK2 is 0.1 pg dry cell weight per pg heptadecane (Materials and Methods)lower than other yields previously reported for other hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, which range from 0.5 to 1.77 pg/pg hydrocarbon (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expect that a marine cyanobacterial hydrocarbon production rate of 2540 pg1mLd1 could support a population of 1.5 × 101 to 4.1 × 103 A. borkumensis SK2 cells per mL if used as the only source of reduced carbon, comparable to the population of obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria observed in natural environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the cultures to which no heptadecane was added, cell numbers decreased significantly over the course of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that populations of Alcanivorax, and possibly other obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the oceans, may be unable to persist for long in the absence of a constant hydrocarbon supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the widespread distribution of both Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus, it is highly likely that hydrocarbon production is continuous and therefore hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are constantly supplied with a fresh source of alkanes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although pyruvate is present in the oceans (43, 44), and A. borkumensis SK2 can use it as an energy and carbon source (40), it likely faces greater competition from other heterotrophs for pyruvate than for alkanes (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other compounds, predominantly hydrocarbons but possibly other unidentified substrates, may also contribute to the pool available to sustain obligate hydrocarbon-degrading species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include pristane, a C19 saturated terpenoid alkane produced in significant quantities by some algal species (45), which A. borkumensis SK2 can use (10), and a branched C21 alkane produced by some algae (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Ocean_Hydrocarbon_Cycle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catabolic degradation of hydrocarbons by marine bacteria produces significant amounts of CO2, which can be incorporated back into alkanes within cyanobacteria (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our estimates of cyanobacterial alkane production rates and observed concentrations in the ocean, we expect that this short-term hydrocarbon cycle (46) occurs on the order of days (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the significant contribution of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus to marine carbon flux, the levels of hydrocarbon production we have measured indicate that there must be a notable biogeochemical cycle of these compounds in the worlds upper oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of annual hydrocarbon fluxes within the ocean, the short-term hydrocarbon cycle occurs at rates several orders of magnitude greater than the long-term hydrocarbon cycle, whereby organic matter is converted to oil in sediments over a period of thousands to millions of years before release into the marine environment by natural seepage or human activity and subsequent breakdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The short- and long-term hydrocarbon cycles are linked in that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are responsible for removing both cyanobacterial alkanes and crude oil from the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon release of crude oil, a significant increase in hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria is observed (57, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crude oil is a complex mixture of 20,000 compounds broadly grouped into four categories: saturated hydrocarbons, predominantly C5C40 alkanes (4060%), aromatic hydrocarbons (2040%), resins (520%), and asphaltenes (110%) (8, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that after release of crude oil into the environment, saturated hydrocarbons are the first to be degraded by bacteria (7, 9, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that populations of bacteria, which normally degrade cyanobacterial alkanes and other hydrocarbons derived from biological sources, quickly acclimate to metabolize crude oil hydrocarbons, followed by rapid population expansion to use this new energy source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although cyanobacterial hydrocarbons are only a small proportion (0.00032%) of the estimated 662 billion tons of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present in the ocean at any point in time (47), only a relatively small fraction of this bulk DOC (0.2 billion tons) is turned over within days (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyanobacterial hydrocarbons, with an estimated pool of 2.12 million tons, likely belong to the labile subset of rapidly cycled DOC and constitute a notable proportion (1%) of that bioavailable fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short-term hydrocarbon cycle should therefore be considered a component of the microbial loop within marine food webs (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study sets a minimum estimate for the total amount of hydrocarbons produced by cyanobacteria in marine environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other abundant marine cyanobacteria, notably Trichodesmium species (51), may add significantly to hydrocarbon output, as might some algal species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although population sizes of freshwater and terrestrial cyanobacteria are not well constrained, given that these organisms are also capable of producing hydrocarbons (19), alkane and alkene production is likely to be considerable here as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widespread distribution of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments suggests that the short-term hydrocarbon cycle is pervasive in many natural ecosystems (9, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bioinformatics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FASTA BLAST comparisons (52) were performed using inferred protein sequences for Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC6803 sll0209 (FAR) and sll0208 (FAD) and Synechococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC7002 Syn7002_A1173 (Ols) (WP_012306795) with the 115 completed cyanobacterial genomes listed in the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/) and Biller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synechococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC7002 was not classified as a marine species because it was isolated from mud flats in Puerto Rico, is evolutionarily distant from other Synechococcus species (16, 22), and has not been detected in the open ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Strains__Media__and_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Axenic cultures of Prochlorococcus CCMP1986 (MED4), MIT9312, and MIT9313 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were routinely assessed for purity by confirming a lack of turbidity after inoculation into three different purity test broths (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triplicate 2-L cultures of each strain were grown in Pro99 medium (54) prepared with 0.2 µm filtered, autoclaved seawater (collected from Vineyard Sound, MA) and supplemented with 10 mM filter-sterilized sodium bicarbonate upon inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown under constant light flux (3040 µmol photonsm2s1 for CCMP1986 and MIT9312; 1020 µmol photonsm2s1 for MIT9313) at 24 °C, in acid-washed polycarbonate containers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth was monitored by measuring bulk culture fluorescence using a 10-AU fluorometer (Turner Designs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All Synechococcus species were grown in ASW medium (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synechococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WH5701 was cultured in conical flasks at 30 °C and 40 µmol photonsm2s1 with shaking at 160 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synechococcus spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WH7803, WH7805, and WH8102 were cultured in culture flasks at 24 °C and 40 µmol photonsm2s1 without shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were routinely assessed for purity by plating aliquots on ASW solid medium containing 0.8% wt/vol yeast extract and 1.5% wt/vol agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were cultured at 30 °C with shaking at 160 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (56) was routinely grown in BHI medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 (39) was routinely grown in A. borkumensis medium 809 (DSMZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marinobacter aquaolei VT8 (57) was routinely grown in Marinobacter medium 970 (DSMZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test growth on hydrocarbons cultures were grown to stationary phase and washed twice with ASW medium before being cultured in 10 mL ASW medium with no carbon source or with either 1% (vol/vol) crude oil (Nigerian bonny light crude oil) or filter-sterilized, analytical standard-grade (99.5%) heptadecane (100 µL equivalent to 77.7 mg) (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of ASW medium, ASW medium and crude oil, and ASW medium and heptadecane were also set up as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm, and specific growth rate constants (µ) were calculated during exponential phase (2145 h for A. borkumensis, 2171 h for A. baylyi, and 21138 h for M. aquaolei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three biological replicates of each sample were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were routinely assessed for purity by plating aliquots on ASW solid medium containing 0.8% wt/vol yeast extract and 1.5% wt/vol agar and on either BHI medium, A. borkumensis medium 809, or Marinobacter medium 970 with 1.5% wt/vol agar for A. baylyi ADP1, A. borkumensis SK2, and M. aquaolei VT8 cultures, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For growth of A. borkumensis SK2 in 40 µg/mL heptadecane, 4 × 107 cells per mL were inoculated so that hydrocarbon amounts were equivalent to 1 pg of heptadecane per cell at the time of inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was necessary because a heptadecane concentration of 40 µg/mL, equivalent to 0.5 µL per 10 mL, was the minimum amount that could be used in this experiment, without diluting heptadecane in another similar solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These could be either used by A. borkumensis SK2 as an energy and carbon source or demonstrate high cellular toxicity or growth inhibition, which has been shown with alkanols (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher inoculum population size was also essential to accurately count cell numbers using a Beckman Coulter 2Z particle counter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three biological replicates of each sample were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dry cell weight of A. borkumensis SK2 was determined by culturing three biological replicates in ASW medium and heptadecane (100 µL in 10 mL) to late exponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were washed three times with water and cell counts per milliliter determined using a Beckman Coulter 2Z particle counter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dry cell weight was determined by first washing 10 mL of culture three times with water, filtering the solution via Whatman glass microfiber filters (GE Healthcare), and drying the samples before measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dry cell weights were recorded using an Adam PW 214 analytical balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mass of 0.39 ± 0.042 pg per A. borkumensis SK2 cell was calculated via dividing the dry cell weight by the cell count.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the growth yield the increase in cell population of 1.01 × 107 observed in the first 2 d in media containing 40 µg/mL of heptadecane was multiplied by the average mass of a cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amount was then divided by the mass of heptadecane per mL, resulting in a growth yield of 0.1 pg dry cell weight per pg of heptadecane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Counting_and_Sample_Preparation_for_GC-MS_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prochlorococcus cultures were harvested in exponential phase by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min in a JLA-8.1000 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellets were resuspended in fresh Pro99 medium and transferred into tared glass vials and lyophilized for 48 h. Total Prochlorococcus cells in each sample were enumerated by flow cytometry using an Influx Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) as previously described (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synechococcus samples were harvested in exponential phase (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aliquot was removed and cells counted by flow cytometry using a BD FACScan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell counting was performed by running 12 µL of sample per minute through the FACS device until 100,000 particles were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background particle count from the media (200 counts per second) was subtracted from the total count.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell counts were performed in triplicate for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen milliliters of each sample was centrifuged at 2,800 × g, washed twice with water, and freeze-dried using a ScanVac CoolSafe Freeze Dryer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dry cell weights were recorded using an Adam PW 214 analytical balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_and_Analysis_of_Total_Hydrocarbons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract total hydrocarbons, dichloromethane (1.5 mL for Prochlorococcus and 1 mL for Synechococcus) was added to pelleted dried cells in glass vials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were placed in a sonicator bath for 30 min then centrifuged (GeneVac EZ-2; SP Scientific) for 10 min (1,800 × g) to pellet any remaining material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was transferred to a glass GC sample vial and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were extracted twice more in dichloromethane as above to ensure complete extraction of hydrocarbons (8090% of hydrocarbons were extracted in the first extraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For negative controls, extraction blanks were carried out on growth media without cyanobacteria and positive controls consisted of adding 1 mg/mL standard alkane mix (C8-C20 alkane mix; Sigma) to the extraction procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three biological replicates of each sample were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_and_Quantification_of_Hydrocarbons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrocarbons were identified by GC-MS (Thermo Scientific Trace GC 1310  ISQ LT Single Quadruple EI MS, A1-1310 Auto sampler) with a Thermo TG-SQC GC column (15 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-µm film thickness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injection volume was 1 µL with a 10:1 split ratio with an injector temperature of 230 °C, using helium as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 mLmin1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following gradient was used: initial oven temperature 30 °C, 2 min; 150 °C at 15 °Cmin1; 230 °C at 3.4 °Cmin1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transfer line temperature of 240 °C was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS conditions in the positive mode were as follows: ion source, 250 °C; mass range 45650 Da; scan time of 0.35 s. Pentadecane and heptadecane were identified by co-retention with standards and NIST mass spectral search libraries (National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST v2.0); two peaks were identified as 8-heptadecene using the NIST library alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentadecane and heptadecane were quantified using standard curves derived from peak areas of pentadecane and heptadecane alkane standards (0.0631 µg/mL) and 8-heptadecene was quantified using peak areas derived from heptadecane standards (0.0631 µg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any background signal in the extraction blank was subtracted when determining hydrocarbon amounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Amounts of hydrocarbons produced by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus per mL of seawater were calculated by multiplying the numbers in the ocean, which range from 3 × 103 to 1 × 106 cells per mL and 3 × 103 to 5 × 104 cells per mL, respectively (14), at the sea surface, by the average amount of hydrocarbons per cell (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This equates to 1.5509 pg/mL of hydrocarbons produced every 12 d by Prochlorococcus and 1.931.7 pg/mL of hydrocarbons produced every 16 d by Synechococcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
