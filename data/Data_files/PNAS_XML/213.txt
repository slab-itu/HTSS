Functional architecture of the Reb1-Ter complex of Schizosaccharomyces pombe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcription termination of rRNA genes by RNA polymerase I (pol I) in fission yeast requires the binding of the Reb1 protein to a terminator site (Ter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Termination is physiologically necessary because its elimination can cause replicationtranscription collision and induction of genome instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, without termination, pol I can become unproductively sequestered on the DNA templates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have determined the crystal structure of fission yeast terminator protein Reb1-Ter complex revealing its functional architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure-guided functional analysis revealed that it is not just tight binding of the protein to Ter but proteinprotein interactions with the Rpa12 subunit of RNA polymerase I that causes transcriptional arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reb1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe represents a family of multifunctional proteins that bind to specific terminator sites (Ter) and cause polar termination of transcription catalyzed by RNA polymerase I (pol I) and arrest of replication forks approaching the Ter sites from the opposite direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains to be investigated whether the same mechanism causes arrest of both DNA transactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the structure of Reb1 as a complex with a Ter site at a resolution of 2.7 Å. Structure-guided molecular genetic analyses revealed that it has distinct and well-defined DNA binding and transcription termination (TTD) domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region of the protein involved in replication termination is distinct from the TTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, the data support the conclusion that transcription termination is not caused by just high affinity Reb1-Ter proteinDNA interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, proteinprotein interactions between the TTD with the Rpa12 subunit of RNA pol I seem to be an integral part of the mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is further supported by the observation that double mutations in TTD that abolished its interaction with Rpa12 also greatly reduced transcription termination thereby revealing a conduit for functional communications between RNA pol I and the terminator protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Overview_of_the_Reb1-Ter3_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We and others have previously reported that an N-terminally truncated version of the Reb1 protein from residues 146504 is necessary and sufficient for both replication and transcription termination on binding to the Ter2 and/ or Ter3 sites (8, 29, 30, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This truncated form of Reb1 (Reb1N) was cocrystallized with a 26-mer double-stranded DNA containing the complete Ter3 sequence (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) using selenomethionine-substituted protein, and the complex was refined to a resolution of 2.7 Å (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit with almost identical conformations, with main chain atoms of protein and DNA superimposing with a RMS deviation (RMSD) of 1.09 and 0.95 Å, respectively (Fig S1 and SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure showed that Reb1N is almost entirely -helical with five distinct domains that straddle the DNA forming a saddle-shaped structure (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two Myb-associated domains (MybADs) bind to contiguous major grooves separated by a full turn on one face of the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each MybAD consists of four -helices, AD for mybAD1, and AD for MybAD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A short linker leads to two Myb repeats (MybRs), with MybR1 sharing the same major groove with MybAD2 resulting in a change of direction of the polypeptide chain, which results in the second Myb repeat (MybR2) to be positioned almost opposite MybAD1 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final C-terminal domain labeled TTD from here on steers away from DNA and consists of five -helices (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique domain arrangement covers 23 bp of DNA in agreement with previous chemical footprinting studies (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distance-matrix alignment (DALI) search did not find similar structures containing the complete quadripartite DNA binding domain (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure shows that, although the MybADs make the majority of the phosphate contacts with the Ter3 site (90%), the Myb repeats make most of the base-specific contacts with the central bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, Reb1 binding to the Ter3 site occupied 4,700 Å2 of surface area inducing significant bending of the DNA of 56° toward the two MybADs (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reb1_MybADs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two MybADs are related by a twofold axis of symmetry perpendicular to the DNA axis that reflects their docking positions into the contiguous major grooves (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are connected by a 20 residue linker (L1) with a small helical region at its N-terminal end that interacts with the DNA backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second half of the linker forms a hairpin that docks into MybAD2 and interacts with the DNA backbone of the minor groove (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, although the two MybADs shared an overall sequence identity of only 15%, they superimposed well with an RMSD of 1.36 Å (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural alignment shows that MybAD helices A, C, and D superimpose with the three helices of a typical HTH protein such as MAT-2, with helix D corresponding to the recognition helix (Fig 2B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topology and arrangement of the helices suggested that the MybAD represented a new variation of the HTH proteins containing an insertion of an -helix between helix1 and helix2 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reb1_Myb_Repeats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual Reb1 Myb repeats have a higher sequence homology with the first repeat of c-Myb and superimposed it with an RMSD of 1.8 Å (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major difference with classical Myb repeats is found in the second Myb repeat that has an insertion of 11 residues in loop l2 connecting helix E and helix F (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it lacks the signature tryptophan residue in the third helix, being replaced instead by phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of loop l2 is one of the most divergent features among this family of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In S. cerevisiae Reb1, the loop contains 128 residues, whereas in murine TTF-I, it is 25 residues long (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recognition_and_Specificity_for_Ter3_DNA_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quadripartite Reb1 DBD shows a unique mode of interaction with DNA in which four domains containing two versions of the helix-turn-helix motif cooperate in binding to a 23-bp stretch of DNA that defines the transcription and replication termination site Ter3 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large DNA footprint appears to be a signature of the Reb1 family of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the Sal boxes (mammalian equivalent of Ter) are recognized by TTF-I protein and are 18 bp long (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific contacts that SpReb1 makes with the Ter3 site define the recognition sequence as 5-GTANGGGTAANNC-3, where the specificity of the central core 5-GGGTAA-3 is determined by the Myb repeats, whereas the upstream or downstream flanking sequences are recognized by MybAD2 and MybAD1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MybAD-Ter3_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MybAD domains contact one face of the DNA making a large number of interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone atoms and delineate two contiguous major grooves and three minor grooves over a region of 21 bp (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C and 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helices D and D dock into the major grooves, whereas the linker that connects the MybADs interacts with the minor groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the loops between the second and third helices of each MybAD contact the minor grooves at both ends on the Ter3 site with 12 residues interacting with opposite strands of the phosphate backbone atoms, thus stabilizing the docking of MybAD1 into the major groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of proteinphosphate backbone contacts is similar in MybAD2, with 13 residues contacting a DNA region spanning 11 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MybAD domains make few base-specific DNA contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of MybAD1, it makes only two specific interactions (underline) downstream of the core recognition sequence 5-GGGTAANNC-3, where R216 contacts the methyl group of the paired thymine via van der Waals interactions and R212 hydrogen bonds with N7 of Guanine 8 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small number of specific contacts is a reflection of the docking mode of the recognition helix that only inserts its C-terminal end into the major groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MybAD2 specifies the first three bases of the core sequence (underline) GTANGGGTAA with residue K297, making a bidentate interaction with Guanine N7 and the adenine in the opposite strand (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, H301 donates a hydrogen bond to the O4 of adenine of the A-T pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, several residues from the linker connecting the MybADs interact with the minor groove backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Myb-Ter3_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Myb repeats specify the central core GGGTAA (underline denotes direct base contacts by Myb repeats) of the Ter3 sequence as shown in Fig 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first Myb repeat binds two G-C pairs with R350 and R354, making bipartite hydrogen bonds with Guanine12 and Guanine13, respectively, whereas D351 makes a hydrogen bond with Cytosine40 and N347 with Cytosine41 in the complementary strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MybR1 makes only four contacts with the phosphate backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second Myb repeat (MybR2) specifies the final 4 bp (underline) of the recognition sequence GTAGGGTAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue R407 makes a bidentate contact with Guanine14, whereas L408 makes van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of both Thymine15 and Thymine37 in the opposite strand (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final specific contact is made by Y412, which makes van der Waal contacts with the methyl group of Thymine36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteinDNA interactions are consistent with baseprotein contacts as previously reported by site-directed mutagenesis of Ter3, deletions in Reb1, and chemical footprinting data (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Individual_Domains_in_DNA_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The four HTH domains synergistically bind to the Ter3 site over a region of 23 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is, however, a specialization of function that divides affinity/specificity among the domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MybADs make up about 85% of all of the backbone contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Myb repeats supply about 80% of all of the base-specific contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the contribution of each pair of domains to the DNA binding affinity of the Reb1 protein, we carried out DNA binding assays of Reb1N and three other Reb1 constructs namely Reb1N-TTD (146418), Reb1-MybADs (146308), and the Reb1-Myb repeats (314418).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were carried out using fluorescent polarization and are shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the Reb1N construct binds with an affinity of 30 nM, deletion of the TTD has only a small effect on the binding affinity (42 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Reb1-MybADs bind with almost fivefold lower affinity (200 nM) and the Myb repeats with an affinity close to 1 M. Our results are in agreement with our previous data showing that any Reb1 construct that is truncated beyond residue 156 is critically impaired in its ability to bind DNA and to promote fork arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Reb1 DNA-specific contacts are consistent with binding studies on mutated Ter3 sites and DNA interference studies (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The binding of Reb1 to the Ter3 site induces an overall DNA curvature of 56° as calculated by the program Curves+ (Fig 4B) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA bending angle is directed toward the MybAD domains presumably due to neutralization of negative charges on one face of the complex but not of the opposite one (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformations of the DNA molecules in the two complexes present in the asymmetric unit are essentially the same and superimpose with an RMSD of less_than1 Å for all atoms, suggesting that the DNA curvature is not produced by crystal contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in agreement with previous analysis using the circular permutation method that determined Reb1 induced bending of the Ter3 site (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the conformation of Reb1 in the complex is also found in the apoprotein, which could not be crystallized without the DNA ligand, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of Reb1N at different protein concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental parameters including the radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum particle dimension (Vmax) calculated from experimental scattering profiles suggests that apo-Reb1N is more elongated than the Ter3 bound protein (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these results, we calculated molecular envelopes using the program DAMMIN (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ab initio calculated envelope of Reb1N is very elongated compared with the Reb1 conformation in the complex (Fig 5 A and B), suggesting that on DNA binding, Reb1 undergoes a large conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We divided the structure into five rigid bodies (Myb-ADs, MybR1, MybR2, and TTD) for modeling with CORAL (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best model fits the experimental data with a  of 0.3 (Fig 5C) and shows an almost linear structure (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Reb1_C-Terminal_Region_Contains_a_TTD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-terminal domain (TTD; residues 419504) consists of five -helices (15) that form a new fold (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DALI search failed to find any structural homologs (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain has three of the helices (1, 2, and 5) forming a plane, with helix 3 sitting perpendicularly across them (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the hydrophobic residues in the TTD are conserved among members of this family, with the highest region of conservation located in -helix 1 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TTD helix 3 wedges loosely against MybR2 helices E and G, burying 400 Å2 of accessible surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superposition of the two Reb1 molecules in the asymmetric unit shows a small movement of TTD helix 3 with respect to the core of the protein of 2.5°, suggesting a small degree of flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the function of the TTD, we first proceeded to measure transcription termination in the homologous host promoted by the WT Reb1 and its C-terminally truncated form by transcription run-on (TRO) experiments (Fig 6 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incomplete rRNA transcripts generated in S. pombe in vivo were further extended in vitro in permeabilized cells in the presence of [32P]-CTP and [32P]-UTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labeled RNA was hybridized to a set of unlabeled oligonucleotide probes that were slot blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the intensity of the image of each slot was quantified (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data unequivocally showed that transcription was terminated at or very close to the Ter site when full-length Reb1 was present (Fig 6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a significant proportion of the transcripts passed through the Ter site in cells expressing Reb1 lacking its C terminus (TTD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that even in the absence of TTD, there was significant termination of transcription at Ter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this to the previously reported parallel mechanism of termination caused by transcriptional coprocessing (16, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in a reb1 strain, a similar result was obtained, suggesting that the other domains of Reb1 had minimal contributions to the process excepting perhaps in anchoring the protein to the Ter sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two pieces of evidence argue against the possibility that deletion of the TTD caused misfolding of the remainder of Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the DNA binding affinities of Reb1 with or without the TTD were very similar (Fig 4A), and second, the protein without the TTD was still capable of arresting replication forks in vivo as revealed by BrewerFangman 2D gels (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the data not only showed that the protein with or without the TTD was biologically functional but also was separable from its replication termination and DNA-binding domain(s) (DBD/RTD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the data supported the conclusion that the C-terminal residues 419504 of Reb1 contained a TTD that is loosely packed against the core of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reb1_Interacts_with_RNA_pol_I_Rpa12_Subunit_Through_the_TTD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does the Reb1 TTD terminate transcription?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest an active mechanism promoted by physical interactions between Reb1 TTD and RNA pol I rather than a passive roadblock imposed by the tight binding of Reb1 to Ter DNA sites (7, 47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which subunit(s) of RNA pol I interacted with Reb1, we took advantage of the S. pombe genetic database (www.pombase.org) that reports genetic interactions between Reb1 and other component proteins of RNA pol I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This search revealed Rpa12 as a possible candidate for proteinprotein interaction with Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the structurally and functionally related Rpa12 of S. cerevisiae is known to be involved in termination of transcription catalyzed by pol I (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, there are currently no reports of any other genetic or physical interaction between TTD and component proteins of S. pombe RNA pol I, such interactions cannot be precluded at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the possibility of a physical interaction between Rpa12/Reb1-TTD by using ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We functionally confirmed it further by isolation of mutations that disrupted the proteinprotein interaction, using a yeast reverse two-hybrid technique (YR2H; SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For technical reasons, we found that evidence of interactions between purified proteins by the ELISA, in this case, was more reliable than the yeast forward two-hybrid procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutants causing noninteraction between the two proteins were investigated functionally for their ability to terminate transcription by the TRO analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rpa12 immobilized on plastic surfaces was challenged with potential interacting proteins (peptides) and control protein [maltose binding protein (MBP)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data showed that both Reb1N and Reb1-TTD interacted with Rpa12 (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction with the Reb1 N-terminal domain (1145) was low, and the control MBP of Escherichia coli showed only background levels of interaction (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The authenticity of the interaction was further verified by the reverse yeast two-hybrid (YR2H) method that selected for noninteracting mutants and functional analysis of the mutants as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Y2RH selection, we isolated a double mutant W460R and L485P that was efficient in knocking down the proteinprotein interaction between Rpa12 and TTD of Sp.Reb1 (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that both W460 and L485 residues are solvent exposed and therefore should be available for proteinprotein interactions in vivo (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mutant form of TTD showed significant reduction in interaction with Rpa12 (Fig 8C and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analyses were performed using only the double mutant that was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the WT ORF of full-length Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed TRO analyses of the WT and the mutant form of Reb1 by comparing and contrasting transcription termination by the TRO assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results repeatedly and unequivocally showed that the noninteracting mutant form of Reb1 caused transcriptional read through at the Ter site (Fig 8 D and E), although a complete deletion of the TTD elicited a stronger read through in comparison with that of the double mutant (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggested that proteinprotein interactions between the TTD with Rpa12 played a critical role in transcription termination by establishing communication between the TTD and the RNA pol I through this portal for proteinprotein interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Y2H_and_YR2H_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Y2H interactions were carried out using the yeast strain PJ69-4A as described previously (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT genes were cloned in pGAD424 and pGBT9 vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids were transformed in pairs into PJ69-4A and colonies containing the plasmid pair were patched on SD/LeuTrp and SD/LeuTrpAde plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies that grew on SD/LeuTrpAde were considered putative positive interactors and their counterparts from SD/LeuTrp plates were analyzed further by -galactosidase assays as described in the Clontech manual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YR2H selections were carried out by mutagenizing one of the ORFs (e.g., 419504Reb1) of an interacting pair by low fidelity PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mutagenesis reaction was carried out by vent exo DNA polymerase in four reaction tubes containing three deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) at 0.25 mM each and one dNTP at 0.0625 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After PCR amplification four PCR products were mixed to generate a pool of mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast competent cells containing pGBT9Rpa12 were transformed with mutagenized 419504Reb1 PCR products along with linearized pGAD424 vector for in vivo recombination and circularization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformed cells were diluted and plated on SD/LeuTrp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies that grew on the SD/LeuTrp but not on the SD/LeuTrpAde were expected to contain either a putative noninteracting mutant of 419504Reb1 or a blank vector that circularized without an insert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction of plasmid followed by PCR amplification and sequencing was done to confirm whether the pGAD424 plasmid contained the correct 419-504Reb1 ORF with potential mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_and_Purification_of_Reb1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reb1N(146504) cDNA fragment was generated using the PCR as described previously (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, protein was expressed at 18 °C and purified using Sp-Sepharose and Ni-NTA affinity column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal His6 tag was proteolytically cleaved using human -thrombin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrated protein was purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex200 prep grade (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated with size exclusion buffer [20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 1 mM EDTA, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractions with target protein were pooled, and protein was spin concentrated to 5 mg/mL and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence_Anisotropy_DNA_Binding_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Binding assays were performed using 5 nM fluorescein-labeled 26-mer Ter3 DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reb1 constructs at different concentrations were mixed with DNA at a final volume of 300 µL using the following buffer: 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence readings were taken on a PC1 fluorimeter (ISS) with excitation and emission filters at 490 and 520 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubes were equilibrated at 20 °C for 20 min before measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each anisotropy point is the average of 10 measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anisotropy was calculated as the ratio of the difference between vertical and horizontal emission intensities over the total normalized intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of DNA bound (B) was calculated usingB=([A]x[A]DNA)/([A]FINAL[A]DNA),[S1]where [A]x represents the anisotropy measured at protein concentration X, [A]DNA is the anisotropy of free fluorescence DNA, and [A]FINAL is the anisotropy at saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were fit to a single binding site model using the program Origin (Origin Labs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment was done in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titrations for MybADs and Myb repeats proteins were carried out to a concentration of 3 µM to reach saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2D_Gel_Analysis_of_Replication_Intermediates  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we presented the first structure, to our knowledge, of a eukaryotic replication and transcription terminator protein and determined its functional architecture and the proteinprotein interaction involved in its communication with RNA pol I, which mediates transcription termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will discuss first the structural aspects of the terminator protein followed by a delineation of the proteinprotein interaction with the Rpa12 subunit of RNA pol I and its biological significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure_of_Reb1_Defines_the_Prototypic_Architecture_of_a_Eukaryotic_Transcription_Replication_Termination_Family  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence of a quadripartite, composite DBD (two MybADs, two MybRs) and a TTD appears to be a signature of multifunctional eukaryotic proteins involved in termination of transcription of RNA pol I and of replication termination in rRNA genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural alignment of Reb1 with other terminator proteins such as S. pombe Rtf1, S. cerevisiae Reb1p, S. cerevisiae Nsi1 (Ytt1), Xenopus tropicalis Rib2, and mammalian TTF-I is shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure prediction of the protein sequences was also calculated, confirming that most of the -helices found in Reb1 appear to be conserved in all other family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence conservation is high in the MybR and lower in the MybAD domains, with MybAD1 having the lowest sequence conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even between the two Reb1 MybADs, the sequence identity is only 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reb1 shows an unexpected arrangement of four HTH motifs that form a composite DNA binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This composite DBD arrangement appears to be conserved in all of the different members of the terminator protein family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure prediction and domain mapping studies of TTF-I and Rtf1 showed that protein constructs with impaired DNA binding properties have deletions in regions that we now predict to have the first MybAD (27, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment shows structural differences among family members in the composite DBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One occurs in the linker region between MybAD1 and MybAD2, with almost 30 additional residues in the case of Sc.Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is found as a large loop between the first and second helices of MybR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the loop varies from 12 residues in Sp.Reb1 to 128 in Sc.Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of this loop in the second Myb repeat is one of the signatures of this family of terminator proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammalian TTF-I also has an insertion in the TTD domain between 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences represent regions that could be involved in proteinprotein interactions or proteinDNA interactions that are species specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_DNA_Terminator_Sequence_Motif_Is_Modular_and_Is_Conserved_Across_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quadripartite DBD interaction with DNA delineates a modular, composite termination site that can be divided into three sections (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central section (box 2) with sequence 5-GGGTNN-3 is recognized primarily by the two Myb repeats with minor contributions from MybAD1 (Fig 3A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of this element is highly conserved across species from yeast to human and is characterized by the GGG triplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences found in the upstream box 1 and downstream box 3 are highly diverse among species and are recognized by MybAD2 and MybAD1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of sequence conservation in these regions reflects the fact that the MybADs make few base-specific contacts with DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quadripartite nature of the DBD and different binding modes used by the MybAD and Myb domains make the composite DBD flexible enough to accommodate large variations in the sequence of their terminator binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, TTF-I binds to a series of 10 termination sites found at the downstream end of the rRNA transcriptional unit that is needed for transcription termination (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These termination sites (T1T10) have the conserved Sal box (5-AGGTCGACCAG-3; underlined nucleotides are contacted by myb repeats) with adenine instead of guanine in the first position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This core sequence is followed by a 3-bp spacer and the 5-TCCG-3 sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the TCCG sequence and the Sal box suggests that the first MybAD domain in TTF-I may make additional interactions with the TCCG sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results showed that binding of Reb1 to the Ter3 site induces a large bend in the DNA, which confirms our previous results that were derived from the measurements of the mobility of circularly permuted linear DNA containing a Ter3 bound to purified Reb1 protein (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bend appears to be conserved in this family of terminator proteins on binding to their cognate sites (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a previous report showed that binding of TTF-I induces bending of the Sal box motif of about 40°, although no structural data corroborating this observation are available for any other member of this family (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it was reported that S. cerevisiae Reb1p also induces a strong bend in the DNA (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional significance of DNA bending is not clear, but the latter report suggests that it may be involved in nucleosome positioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In S. pombe, two Ter sites are separated by 157 bp of DNA, and it is not clear whether the local DNA bending would be enough to bring the two sites together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that all point mutations and deletions of a Ter site that reduce Reb1-induced DNA bending are also defective in fork arrest, an observation that suggests its possible functional significance, namely promotion of optimal DNAprotein interaction (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Reb1_in_Transcription_Termination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What are the structural determinants that cause the polarity of transcriptional arrest by Reb1?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the relative stereo-chemical orientation of the TTD with respect to the DBD could generate polarity by making the domain accessible to interaction with the transcription apparatus in one orientation of the Ter-Reb1 complex but not in the opposite one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that a particular orientation is required during the higher-order interaction between the promoter and the termination sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments are in progress to test these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work showed that pol I transcription termination is not caused by a passive Reb1-Ter barrier but instead suggests that interaction between Reb1-TTD and Rpa12 is important for this function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is also consistent with recent data showing that binding of S. cerevisiae terminator Nsi1 (also known as Ytt1) to its DNA binding site is sufficient to terminate RNA pol I transcription (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at this time, we do not know the details of exactly how the TTD-Rpa12 interaction causes transcription termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on the basis of the known biochemical functions of Rpa12 of S. cerevisiae and of other proteins, we suggest the following potential mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that Rpa12 and its functional homologs Rpb9, TFIIS (both specific for pol II), and Rpc11 of pol III promote cleavage of the nascent transcript and that the C termini of Rpa12 and TFIIS are part of the catalytic center of RNA pol I and pol II (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of pol II, TFIIS stimulates endonuclease activity when the polymerase encounters an obstacle that causes the enzyme to backtrack (5254).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the interactions of Reb1 with Rpa12 induces an allosteric conformational change that leads to the suppression of the endonuclease and/or the polymerase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prevention of backtracking and trapping the enzyme at the U-rich release element could destabilize the RNADNA hybrid, causing enzyme and transcript release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our present work provides the structure of a prototypical eukaryotic transcription and replication terminator protein at high resolution and identifies its functional domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also clearly identifies proteinprotein interaction between Rpa12 and Reb1 to be an integral part of the mechanism of termination of transcription catalyzed by RNA pol I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it provides us with hypotheses that can be tested in the immediate future to further unravel the mechanistic details of the functions of Reb1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
