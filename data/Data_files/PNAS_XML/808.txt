Human genetic variation in VAC14 regulates Salmonella invasion and typhoid fever through modulation of cholesterol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) causes 20 million cases of typhoid fever every year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out a genome-wide association study to identify genetic differences that correlate with the susceptibility of cells from hundreds of individuals to S. Typhi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A SNP in VAC14 was associated with susceptibility to S. Typhi invasion and VAC14 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells mutated for VAC14 displayed increased S. Typhi docking due to increased plasma membrane cholesterol levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same SNP was associated with risk of typhoid fever in a Vietnamese population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treating zebrafish with a cholesterol-lowering drug reduced their susceptibility to S. Typhi infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this work demonstrates the power of coupling multiple genetic association studies with mechanistic dissection for understanding infectious disease susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Risk, severity, and outcome of infection depend on the interplay of pathogen virulence and host susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic identification of genetic susceptibility to infection is being undertaken through genome-wide association studies, but how to expeditiously move from genetic differences to functional mechanisms is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use genetic association of molecular, cellular, and human disease traits and experimental validation to demonstrate that genetic variation affects expression of VAC14, a phosphoinositide-regulating protein, to influence susceptibility to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased VAC14 expression increased plasma membrane cholesterol, facilitating Salmonella docking and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased susceptibility at the cellular level manifests as increased susceptibility to typhoid fever in a Vietnamese population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treating zebrafish with a cholesterol-lowering agent, ezetimibe, reduced susceptibility to S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, coupling multiple genetic association studies with mechanistic dissection revealed how VAC14 regulates Salmonella invasion and typhoid fever susceptibility and may open doors to new prophylactic/therapeutic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S_typhi_Invasion_into_LCLs_Requires_SPI1_Effectors_and_Is_Regulated_by_Heritable_Genetic_Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As invasion of S. Typhi into LCLs had not been previously characterized, we determined whether the process was similar to that observed in other human cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCLs are immortalized B cells, and, notably, B cells have been shown to be in vivo targets of Salmonella infection (2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively measure Salmonella invasion into cells, we used a modified gentamicin protection assay where cell entry and early intracellular survival into cells was assessed with flow cytometric measurement of GFP (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salmonella invasion into HeLa cells has been extensively characterized (2628) and is known to occur through macropinocytosis (29), mediated by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) effectors sopB and sopE/E2 (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, sopB and sopE are necessary for invasion in LCLs, as seen by the decrease in infected cells when each gene is deleted individually and the nearly complete loss of invasion when both are deleted (sopE2 is not present in S. Typhi Ty2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig 1B for data from an LCL from the CEU population [Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the Centre dÉtude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection] and Fig S1 for data from an LCL from the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, deletion of prgH, encoding a component of the type three secretion system (TTSS) and necessary for the translocation of sopB and sopE into the host cell, also abrogates invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis, amiloride (30), also blocked the ability of S. Typhi to invade (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The similarity of S. Typhi invasion into LCLs to epithelial cell invasion prompted us to assess the feasibility of carrying out a Hi-HOST cellular GWAS screen of invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed repeatable invasion measurements with the between-individual component of variance at 68% (the remainder of the variance being intraindividual variation for the same LCL measured on different days) (Fig 1D and invasion measurements from Hi-HOST screen in Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar means (P = 0.35 by t test) and distributions (Fig 1E) were observed in 352 LCLs from two different human populations from the HapMap collection (31, 32), CEU and YRI (Fig 1D), indicating no evidence of population differentiation for this trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a substantial portion of the variation (47%) was heritable, based on parentoffspring regression of these LCL trios (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouraged by the high repeatability and heritability of this trait, we carried out genome-wide association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hi-HOST_Cellular_GWAS_Reveals_a_SNP_in_VAC14_Associated_with_S_typhi_Invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome-wide association was carried out on data from 352 LCLs using family-based association analysis in PLINK (33) on HapMap phase 3 (32) genotypes with imputation based on 1,000 Genomes phase 1 haplotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this relatively modest sample size, we focused on SNPs associated with the expression level of nearby genes (cis-eQTLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GWAS signals are enriched for cis-eQTLs (34), and we previously demonstrated that focusing on cis-eQTLs in a Hi-HOST screen of pyroptosis revealed true-positive hits based on subsequent experimental validation and genotyping in clinical samples (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used cis-eQTLs found in the same LCLs used in our Hi-HOST screening (7) to limit our search space to SNPs that have a robust association between SNP and gene expression in the cell type used in our screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that cis-eQTLs deviated toward lower P values than expected by chance in a quantilequantile (QQ) plot of S. Typhi invasion (Fig 1G and Fig S2 show a QQ plot of all SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the three cis-eQTLs that deviated from neutrality (Table S1), rs8060947, located within an intron of VAC14, was particularly intriguing because of the known function of VAC14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VAC14 encodes a phosphoinositide scaffolding protein that regulates levels of the phosphatidylinositol PtdIns(3,5)P2 through its binding partners PIKfyve and FIG4 (3537).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Salmonella-secreted effector sopB has been demonstrated to regulate phosphoinositides (3840), how host regulation of phosphoinositides impacts invasion is poorly characterized, and the role of human genetic variation in this process is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining text focuses on the association of VAC14 with S. Typhi invasion, its mechanism of action, and how variation in VAC14 impacts Salmonella infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
rs8060947 is associated with both the expression of VAC14 and the level of S. Typhi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A regional association plot demonstrates that rs8060947 is within the first intron of VAC14 and is the SNP in the region showing the strongest association with S. Typhi invasion (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although family-based genome-wide association was conducted on both CEU and YRI families combined to detect this association (P = 1.4 × 104), we also observed the association when CEU and YRI populations were analyzed separately (P = 0.004 in CEU, P = 0.02 in YRI) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both populations, the A allele was associated with higher levels of invasion (Fig 2B) as well as with lower levels of VAC14 mRNA (P = 5.9 × 106 based on microarray data of LCLs) (Fig 2C) (7), protein levels by Western blot (P = 0.02 from 22 LCLs randomly selected with representation of each genotype) (Fig 2D), and protein levels by proteomics (P = 0.0001 based on mass spectrometry LCL data in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the association of rs8060947 with VAC14 expression was observed with three different methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While not part of our initial screen, we also tested the association of rs8060947 with VAC14 expression and invasion in HapMap Asian LCLs in the Chinese from Beijing (CHB) and Japanese from Tokyo (JPT) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the data from CEU and YRI, the A allele was associated with lower levels of VAC14 mRNA (P = 0.002) (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For invasion, the predicted trend of AA  AG  GG was observed, but there was no significant association (P = 0.42); this result is not entirely surprising given the limited power from 85 Asian LCLs with only one of the GG genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The A allele, which is the derived allele based on the chimpanzee genome, is found at a higher frequency in the CEU (80%) than in the YRI (46%) population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs8060947 shows the strongest association in the region, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) extends for 100 kb with numerous other SNPs showing an association; any of these SNPs could be the true causal variant(s) in the region regulating VAC14 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One plausible causal variant is rs8044133, which shows the fourth strongest association in the region (P = 7.6 × 104) and is on a DNA segment bound by the serum response factor (SRF) transcription factor in ENCODE ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VAC14_Is_an_Inhibitor_of_S_typhi_Invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The association data demonstrated strong correlations between rs8060947 and VAC14 expression and between rs8060947 and S. Typhi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of effects for the different alleles led to the hypothesis that reducing VAC14 expression would increase S. Typhi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was tested through both RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the VAC14 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In LCLs, RNAi decreased VAC14 protein expression by 40% and increased S. Typhi invasion by 16% (P = 0.008) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was mirrored in HeLa cells (P = 0.04) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory activity of VAC14 on invasion was confirmed using CRISPR knockout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective targeting of VAC14 was demonstrated by Western blot (Fig 3C) and through sequencing of a characterized clone of the targeted region (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the phenotype of vac14/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (42), these vac14/ mutant HeLa cells have abnormally enlarged vacuoles (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmid complementation of the vacuolation phenotype demonstrated that the phenotype was indeed attributable to VAC14 (P = 0.01) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the vac14/ mutant HeLa cells had an even larger increase in invasion than vac14 RNAi (P = 0.005) (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the relative decrease in VAC14 expression seen with natural variation (AA vs. GG genotype; 28% decrease) or with RNAi in LCLs (40% decrease) or HeLa cells (84% decrease) or with vac14 knockout (100% decrease) was inversely correlated with the relative increases in S. Typhi invasion (8% AA/GG, 16% by RNAi in LCLs, 32% by RNAi in HeLa cells, and 89% by CRISPR knockout in HeLa cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, decreased VAC14 expression resulted in higher levels of invasion, and the magnitude of the increase in invasion was larger the more VAC14 expression was diminished (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While RNAi and CRISPR can have off-target effects, we were able to complement the invasion phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient transfection of VAC14 plasmid into WT HeLa cells had no effect, while VAC14 plasmid transfection into vac14/ mutant cells reduced invasion toward WT levels (P = 0.02) (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lack of effect for overexpression of VAC14 in the presence of endogenous VAC14 is consistent with VAC14 being part of a protein complex, where overexpression of single components have been observed to have no phenotype in yeast (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, using RNAi, CRISPR knockout, and complementation, we have demonstrated that VAC14 negatively regulates S. Typhi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VAC14_Inhibits_Invasion_at_the_Step_of_SPI-1_TTSS_Docking_to_the_Plasma_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We systematically determined which step in invasion (docking, membrane ruffling, or early intracellular survival) was being affected by VAC14 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased S. Typhi invasion could be due to greater docking of the bacteria to the host cell plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion to host cells by bacterial flagellin and LPS is reversible, but once a bacterium has injected its TTSS into a host cell, it is docked and attached firmly to the plasma membrane (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective staining of intracellular vs. extracellular bacteria was used to compare levels of invasion vs. docking (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prgH bacterial mutant, lacking the needle complex, exhibited very low invasion and docking in both WT and vac14/ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sopBsopE double mutant, lacking the effectors necessary to induce macropinocytosis, could effectively dock but had dramatically reduced invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, WT and sopBsopE bacteria demonstrated higher levels of docking in vac14/ mutant cells, indicating that the increase in invasion could be explained by an increase in this early step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, there were no gross defects of the vac14/ mutant in the area of the plasma membrane ruffles engulfing the bacteria (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no increase in intracellular survival was detected by median fluorescence of GFP Salmonella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our data demonstrate VAC14 regulates the level of S. Typhi invasion at the early step of docking to the host cell plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VAC14_Inhibits_Docking_by_Reducing_the_Cholesterol_Content_of_the_Plasma_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A role for VAC14 in plasma membrane attachment was unexpected, as VAC14 and the signaling lipids it regulates are cytosolic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that VAC14-mediated effects on phosphoinositide localization/abundance could alter abundance of plasma membrane constituents regulating docking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, attachment of the SPI-1 TTSS is partially mediated by direct binding of sipB to plasma membrane cholesterol (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we compared cholesterol localization and levels in WT vs. vac14/ mutant cells by staining with the fluorescent cholesterol-binding molecule filipin (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of vac14 increased cellular cholesterol content measured by both flow cytometry and microscopy (P = 0.009) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of VAC14 plasmid decreased cholesterol in vac14/ cells but had no effect on WT cells (Fig 5B), mirroring the effect on S. Typhi invasion (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increased cholesterol localized to the plasma membrane based on imaging flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw no difference in the intensity of a nonspecific plasma membrane stain (wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) (47) at the plasma membrane, but vac14/ cells had significantly higher filipin intensity when intracellular fluorescence in images was masked (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increase in plasma membrane cholesterol was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in both cholesterol uptake and synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR of the LDL receptor (LDLR) showed a 40% increase, and HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (48), showed a 125% increase (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, vac14/ cells have elevated plasma membrane cholesterol and increased expression of genes regulating uptake and synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether cellular cholesterol levels were also associated with natural variation influencing VAC14, we used LCLs from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) simvastatin clinical trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 49 LCLs from African American participants, rs8060947 showed a trend toward significance in the predicted direction: the A allele was associated with higher free cholesterol (P = 0.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs8044133, a SNP in high LD with rs8060947 (r2 = 0.74 in CEU; r2 = 0.94 in YRI) that demonstrated an association with S. Typhi invasion nearly as strong as rs8060947 (Fig 2A), was weakly associated with free cholesterol levels (P = 0.028) (Fig 5E and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No association was noted in 98 European American LCLs (Fig S5); however, due to the reduced minor allele frequency of this SNP in Europeans, only two LCLs homozygous for the minor allele were present in the dataset, and therefore power was limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, elevated cholesterol was observed not only in the vac14/ cells but also with natural genetic variation that reduces VAC14 levels, although the association was observed only in the African American LCLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the role of cholesterol in S. Typhi invasion, we depleted cholesterol at the plasma membrane using methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD), a compound that sequesters cholesterol (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing doses of MCD in WT cells caused a decrease in invasion, consistent with S. Typhi binding to cholesterol to facilitate invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vac14/ cells were modestly resistant to the effects of MCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EC50 increased from 4.0 to 5.9 (P = 0.02) (Fig 5F), consistent with an overabundance of cholesterol requiring a higher dose of MCD to see an effect on invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, exogenous cholesterol increased S. Typhi invasion and at higher doses resulted in equivalent levels of invasion between WT and vac14/ cells (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vac14/ cells appear already to have reached a nearly maximal level of invasion that is minimally enhanced with exogenous cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the elevated plasma membrane cholesterol in the vac14/ cells and the dependence of S. Typhi docking on plasma membrane cholesterol, we conclude that VAC14 inhibits S. Typhi invasion by modulating cholesterol at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VAC14_Is_Associated_with_Susceptibility_to_Typhoid_Fever_in_People  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While our cellular studies demonstrated that rs8060947 is associated with S. Typhi invasion into cells and that VAC14 inhibits invasion through the regulation of cellular cholesterol, we turned to human genotyping to assess the relevance of VAC14 to the risk of typhoid fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We genotyped rs8060947 and compared the allele frequencies in 496 typhoid fever cases and 500 population controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs8060947 was in HardyWeinberg equilibrium in controls (P = 0.97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 shows that rs8060947 was associated with typhoid fever in this Vietnamese cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, people who carry the rs8060947 A allele, which results in more invasion in Hi-HOST, had increased susceptibility to typhoid fever [P = 0.01; allelic odds ratio (OR) = 1.38; recessive OR = 3.60].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effect of rs8060947 is not as large as, for example, the protection afforded by the sickle cell allele against malaria (OR = 10) (51), the effect is comparable to other infectious disease susceptibility loci, such as ABO and malaria (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacologic_Reduction_of_Cholesterol_Is_Protective_Against_S_Typhi_in_Zebrafish  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To experimentally assess the importance of cholesterol modulation during Salmonella infection in vivo, we developed a zebrafish S. Typhi infection model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has described zebrafish as a useful model to study pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine efficacy of Salmonella Typhimurium (54, 55), but infection models using S. Typhi, a human-specific pathogen, had not been previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zebrafish larva is optically transparent and contains canonically organized epithelial surfaces and a functional innate immune system by 48 h postfertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the invasion phenotype in whole animals, we made use of a previously developed epithelial infection model using the zebrafish swim bladder, an organ with a well-defined and visually accessible epithelial layer (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A SPI-1 mutant (prgH) was used to demonstrate the relevance of this model for studying invasion and infection outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival curves demonstrated improved survival of animals infected with prgH compared with animals infected with WT bacteria (P = 0.01) (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appreciating that zebrafish larvae are optically transparent, we imaged the swim bladders 24 h post infection to better assess the infection process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infections were categorized as cleared, localized, disseminated, or dead (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swim bladder infections with the prgH mutant bacterial strain were more effectively cleared than WT infections (P = 0.03) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that pharmacologic reduction of cholesterol could reduce the amount of invasion during S. Typhi infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we treated the fish with ezetimibe, a drug that has been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol levels in zebrafish larvae (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ezetimibe did not cause any morphological abnormalities in the fish, even at higher doses, and had no effect on bacterial growth (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filipin staining of whole fish embryos showed a significant decrease in fluorescence consistent with ezetimibe inhibiting cholesterol transport (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ezetimibe-treated fish showed both improved survival (P = 0.03) (Fig 6F) and increased bacterial clearance (P = 0.009) (Fig 6G) compared with DMSO-treated fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through a multidisciplinary approach, we have discovered that modulation of plasma membrane cholesterol, through natural genetic variation in VAC14 or pharmacological manipulation, decreases risk of S. Typhi infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cellular GWAS with Hi-HOST identified the association of the SNP in VAC14 with Salmonella invasion, association studies of different phenotypic scales (molecular, cellular, and organismal) were necessary to fully delineate the chain of causality leading from SNP to typhoid fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mechanistic studies were necessary to uncover the unexpected role of VAC14 in limiting bacterial docking through cholesterol regulation at the host cell plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has demonstrated a role for cholesterol metabolism and localization in bacterial invasion and survival (44, 5961).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides host genetic evidence supporting this role and leads to the hypothesis that repurposing FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe, could have potential prophylactic or therapeutic use against typhoid fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides evidence for a role for VAC14 in cholesterol metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has emphasized the role of VAC14 in late endosomal trafficking based on localization of VAC14 and its binding partners to late endosomes (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the inhibition of the VAC14 complex causes large endosomal vacuoles to form, and VAC14 has been reported to physically interact with regulators of the endolysosomal pathway, including Rab proteins (37, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As LDL-derived cholesteryl esters are delivered to late endosomes for hydrolysis before being trafficked to subsequent cellular sites, including the plasma membrane (65), it is perhaps not surprising that VAC14 and the phosphoinositide it regulates, PtdIns(3,5)P2, could play an important role in cellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of VAC14 increased intracellular cholesterol levels, including at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the effect size of common genetic variation influencing VAC14 and Salmonella invasion is constrained by the crucial role of plasma membrane cholesterol in cellular functions that operate within an optimal range (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our findings in cells, zebrafish, and humans demonstrate that moderate changes in cellular hostpathogen phenotypes can significantly alter infectious disease risk and severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future studies will be necessary to determine the exact mechanism by which VAC14 is altering cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining localization of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in WT and vac14/ cells will be important, and a PtdIns(3,5)P2 fluorescent probe has been described (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent work calls into question the specificity of this probe (68), and therefore new tools will likely be required before PtdIns(3,5)P2 localization can be accurately assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a key mechanism of nonvesicular lipid trafficking has been demonstrated to involve sterol-binding proteins facilitating countercurrent exchange of cholesterol and phospholipids at membrane contact sites (MCS) (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been most extensively characterized for OshP4 mediating the exchange of PtdIns(4)P and cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi (71, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate a similar mechanism may be at work to regulate plasma membrane cholesterol levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our data with increased expression levels of LDL receptor (LDLR) and HMG-CoA reductase could support a model where impaired trafficking from the plasma membrane to the ER leads to a depletion of ER cholesterol and up-regulation of SREBP2 targets despite high total cholesterol levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While our studies provide a demonstration of the role of VAC14 in infectious disease, most studies on VAC14 have focused on its role in neurodegenerative disorders (42, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons appear highly sensitive to loss of vac14 as seen by the lethal neurodegeneration of the CNS and peripheral nervous system in vac14/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, recessive mutations of vac14 in humans also lead to progressive neurodegeneration (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was also found that the VAC14 protein complex binds to amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein essential to the development of Alzheimers disease (7577).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been several studies of the link between cholesterol and Alzheimers disease (7880) and even trials of cholesterol-reducing drugs as potential therapeutics for patients with the disease (81, 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our elucidation of the functional links between VAC14, cholesterol, and disease could inform not only our understanding of Salmonella infection but also neurodegenerative disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the clinical presentation of CharcotMarieTooth type 1 caused by mutation in the phosphatase FIG4 can be quite variable, onset can range from childhood to late adulthood, and severity can vary from loss of mobility to death (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As VAC14 stabilizes the FIG4 protein from degradation, we hypothesize the genotype of rs8060947 and subsequent levels of VAC14 could help determine the severity of this disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While vaccines for S. Typhi exist, they are only moderately effective (5560%) (83), have limited protection duration, and are not suitable in young children, the population most at risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the current vaccines are not widely deployed to populations in need.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new generation of conjugate vaccines for typhoid fever becoming available is showing considerably greater efficacy and applicability to younger children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no effective vaccines exist against enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi pathovars, and unfortunately the incidence of S. Paratyphi A is increasing in many at-risk nations (84, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is therefore a need for further development of typhoid vaccines, and our work suggests that the use of cholesterol-reducing drugs in combination with vaccines may potentially improve protection against typhoid fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolomic approaches have recently reported significantly higher plasma cholesterol levels in afebrile controls compared with enteric fever patients during infection (86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these data provide evidence for a role for cholesterol in typhoid fever, it is unclear how these levels measured during infection would correlate with cellular cholesterol levels before infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it is important to note that Salmonella spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are not the only pathogens that use cholesterol to facilitate invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ebola (87), Chlamydia (88), HCV (89), and malaria (90) are part of a growing list of pathogens whose entry into cells is regulated by cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, our work leads to two predictions that will be important to test in future work: (i) rs8060947 may be predictive of risk of other infectious diseases regulated by plasma membrane cholesterol, and (ii) ezetimibe might prove useful as a potential adjunctive therapy to prevent/treat not only typhoid fever but other infectious diseases as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For RNAi, LCLs were treated for 3 d in Accell medium (Dharmacon) with either nontargeting Accell siRNA #1 or an Accell SmartPool directed against human vac14 (1 M total siRNA) (Dharmacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were treated for 2 d in 100 L of DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with either nontargeting siGENOME siRNA #5 or a siGENOME SMARTpool directed against human vac14 (0.33 M total siRNA) (Dharmacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts, targeting vectors for the mutation of VAC14 were constructed following the protocol described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  94.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For plasmid complementation, HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturers instructions (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bacterial docking assay was performed by infecting both WT HeLa and vac14/ cells with isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-induced S. Typhi at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at RT for 30 min, washed twice again, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum (NDS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated with rabbit anti-Salmonella (MA183451; Fisher), 1:500 dilution, overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary antibody used was donkey anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained for 20 min with Hoechst dye before imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Filipin staining was quantified using the BD FACSCanto II from the Duke Flow Cytometry Shared Resource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging flow cytometry was performed on 1 million cells per sample, which were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% PFA for 20 min at RT, and stained with WGA Alexa Fluor 680 (Thermo Fisher) for 10 min, 0.05 mg/mL Filipin (Sigma) for 2 h, or both stains and were run through the ImageStream X Flow Cytometer (Amnis Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was performed using the ISX software to determine colocalization and intensity of WGA and filipin at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels of genes that regulate cholesterol synthesis (HMGCR) and uptake (LDLR) were determined by TaqMan qPCR assays (Thermo Fisher) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR machine (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol depletion was performed by pretreating the cells with MCD (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h. After treatment, cell medium was changed and cells were subsequently infected with S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol repletion in cells was done by pretreating cells with water-soluble cholesterol (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, changing medium, and infection with S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CAP LCLs, free cholesterol was quantified using the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Typhoid_Fever_Association_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA samples from typhoid patients (n = 500) were collected as part of larger epidemiological or clinical studies that were undertaken in Viet Nam between 1992 and 2002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clinical studies, which have been described previously (9598), took place at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and Dong Thap Provincial Hospital, Vietnam, and the samples have been previously used in human genetic studies (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients were defined as children or adults with clinical signs and symptoms of typhoid fever with culture-confirmed S. Typhi in their blood or bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population control group comprised 496 DNA samples extracted from the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies born in 2003 at Hung Vuong Obstetric Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Written informed consent for clinical study participation was obtained by the treating physician from the patient or the patients parent/guardian and from the babys mother for population controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All protocols were approved by the scientific and ethical committees at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Dong Thap Provincial Hospital, and the Health Services of Dong Thap Province in Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethical approval was also granted by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom, the Duke University IRB, and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
rs8060947 was genotyped by Taqman using a predesigned assay kit (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons 2 test was performed to assess an association between disease phenotype, allele frequencies, and recessive genotype (AA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR and 95% CI were used to measure the risk of disease associated with a specific allele (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The typhoid fever case and control samples used in this candidate gene study are primarily a subset of a larger Vietnamese sample set that has undergone genome-wide genotyping (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis of this GWAS dataset found that all enteric fever cases had sufficiently matched controls (figures S2 and S3 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), which provides strong evidence that no significant population stratification is present in our candidate gene study population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Zebrafish_Infections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies involving zebrafish (strain AB*) were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with national and institutional guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT zebrafish embryos (strain AB*) were injected in the swim bladder at 4 d postfertilization (dpf) with 100 cfu of S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ezetimibe (10 µM) dissolved in DMSO was added to the fish water 24 h before S. Typhi injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filipin staining was performed on whole fixed fish at 5 dpf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Descriptive statistics, parentoffspring regression, and QQ plots were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) and with R (99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide association analysis was conducted with PLINK v1.07 (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was carried out with QFAM-parents with adaptive permutation under default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CHB+JPT LCLs, which are all unrelated, GWAS was conducted in PLINK using a linear model with the top two principal components as covariates (using default parameters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes were from HapMap phase 3 release 2 (1,439,782 SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imputation of autosomal genotypes included two steps: a prephasing step using SHAPEIT2 (100) and an imputation step using IMPUTE2 (101) with 1,000 Genomes phase 1 haplotypes (201312 version provided by IMPUTE2 software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A regional Manhattan plot of the VAC14 region was made using LocusZoom (102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values for eQTL analysis were calculated using linear regression in GraphPad Prism using unrelated individuals (parents only in trio data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HapMap LCLs (352) from CEU and YRI HapMap populations (31, 32) were purchased from the Coriell Institute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCLs used in cholesterol measurement were established from the CAP simvastatin clinical trial as previously described (91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCLs were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin-G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin-G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
S. typhi Ty2 was tagged with an inducible GFP plasmid [pMMB67GFP from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  92].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  prgH, sopB, sopE, and sopB; sopE deletion mutants were constructed with lambda red (93) and verified by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assaying LCLs and HeLa cells for Salmonella spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infection was conducted as previously described (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were subcultured with a 1:33 dilution and grown for 2 h 40 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Hi-HOST screening of LCLs, invasion was conducted for 1 h at a MOI of 10, followed by the addition of gentamicin (50 g/mL) for 1 h and then IPTG (1.5 mM) for 75 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For HeLa cells, bacterial invasion was conducted for 30 min at an MOI of 30 (or 50 where indicated), followed by gentamicin (50 g/mL) treatment for 1 h and IPTG (1.5 mM) for 75 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular invasion and cell death were assessed by staining with 7-AAD 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (Enzo Life Sciences) and measuring green and red fluorescence on a Guava easyCyte Plus flow cytometer (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure intracellular survival, the infection assay was kept the same, but cells were read 8 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After infection for 30 min at an MOI of 30, cells were incubated with gentamicin (50 g/mL) for 6.25 h followed by IPTG (1.5 mM) for 75 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In amiloride-treatment experiments cells were pretreated with 1 mM amiloride for 1 h before Salmonella infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNAi_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LCLs (2 × 105 cells) were treated for 3 d in 500 L of Accell medium (Dharmacon) with either nontargeting Accell siRNA #1 or an Accell SMARTPool directed against human vac14 (1 M total siRNA; Dharmacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before infection, cells were plated at 1 × 105 in 100 L RPMI complete medium (without antibiotics) in 96-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salmonella infections were conducted as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell invasion by S. Typhi was assessed after 3.5 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cells (1.5 × 105 cells) were treated for 2 d in 100 L of DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with either nontargeting siGENOME siRNA #5 or a siGENOME SMARTpool directed against human vac14 (0.33 M total siRNA; Dharmacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salmonella infections were conducted as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For LCLs, 1,000,000 cells were harvested after 3 d of culture in 30 L RIPA buffer and were rocked at 4 °C for 15 min; then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane using TE77X Semi-Dry transfer units (Hoefer) at 60 mA for 1 h. Blots were probed overnight at 4 °C (antibody dilutions are specific to each antibody and are indicated in figure legends) followed by 1:10,000 HRP- or LI-COR IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were developed using ECL substrate (Pierce) with X-ray film or the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray film was scanned and quantified using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRDye Western blots were quantified using LI-COR Odyssey Software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measuring the association of VAC14 protein and genotype in LCLs, 22 LCLs were randomly selected to provide several individuals of each genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More homozygous individuals were included (8GG, 5AG, 9 AA), as we reasoned the difference between homozygous individuals would be greatest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For HeLa cells, 300,000 cells were harvested after 48 h of RNAi treatment and processed as above using LI-COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_VAC14_CRISPR_Mutant_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Targeting vectors for the mutation of VAC14 were constructed following the protocol described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  94. pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro gRNAs were selected from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence-confirmed constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using the Fugene6 transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were selected using puromycin at 1 g/mL and subsequently split into 96-well plates to grow individual clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that some cells had been mutated by the CRISPR constructs, a SURVEYOR assay (Transgenomic) was performed on the cells after selection to detect heteroduplexes that result from successful targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clone 364C displayed increased invasion that could be complemented by VAC14 plasmid expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted from clone 364C by QuickExtract (Epicentre), and the region was PCR amplified with Herculase II DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and cloned using the Zero-Blunt TOPP PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmid was transformed into One Shot Top10 Competent Escherichia coli, and six individual colonies were chosen for sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three clones had a 1-bp insertion, and three clones had a 158-bp insertion, both resulting in a premature stop codon early in the VAC14 ORF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HeLa_Transfection_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 96-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturers instructions (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids used included human VAC14mycDDK (OriGene clone #RC214195) and VAC14-gfp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BglII and XhoI were used to move VAC14-mycDDK into the BglII and SalI sites of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For assessing inhibition of Salmonella spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  invasion, each well contained 100 ng of plasmid, 0.2 µL p3000, and 0.1 µL of Lipofectamine 3000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h cells were imaged to determine rescue of the vacuolated phenotype by scoring 100 cells as either vacuoles or no vacuoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 48 h the invasion assay was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels were assessed by Western blot for human vac14 (1:500) (SAB4200074; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Docking_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bacterial docking assay was performed by infecting both WT HeLa and vac14/ cells with IPTG-induced S. Typhi at an MOI of 50 for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% PFA at RT for 30 min, washed twice again, and blocked with 5% NDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated with rabbit anti-Salmonella (1:500 dilution) (MA183451; Fisher) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary antibody used was donkey anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained for 20 min with Hoechst dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed, mounted, and imaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten images were taken per well at 40×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear staining was quantified using Fiji (threshold, particle analysis), and green- and red-stained bacteria were counted manually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cholesterol_Quantification_and_Modulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Filipin staining was quantified using the BD FACSCanto II system (Becton Dickinson) from the Duke Flow Cytometry Shared Resource.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both WT HeLa and vac14/ cells were trypsinized and fixed with 3% PFA for 30 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then stained with 0.05 mg/mL filipin diluted in PBS (Sigma F9765) for 2 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten thousand cells were counted, and the mean intensity was used to determine the relative amount of cholesterol in the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging flow cytometry was performed on 1 million cells per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% PFA for 20 min at RT, and stained with WGA Alexa Fluor 680 (Thermo) for 10 min, 0.05 mg/mL filipin (Sigma) for 2 h, or both and were run through the ImageStream X Flow Cytometer (Amnis Corp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was performed using ISX software to determine the colocalization and intensity of WGA and filipin at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels of genes that regulate cholesterol synthesis (HMGCR) and uptake (LDLR) were determined by TaqMan qPCR assays (Thermo) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR machine (Thermo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cholesterol depletion was performed by pretreating the cells with MCD (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h. After treatment, cell medium was changed, and cells were subsequently infected with S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol repletion in cells was done by pretreating cells with water-soluble cholesterol (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, changing medium, and infecting cells with S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the CAP LCLs, free cholesterol was quantified using the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 17 batches of 12 LCLs per batch and was normalized to total cellular protein content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs8060947 and rs8044133 were imputed from Omni2.5+Exome and Cardio-MetaboChip genotypes using MaCH-Admix (CAP African Americans) or as previously described for the CAP European Americans (105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cells were fixed at the indicated times with 3.7% PFA for 20 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking and permeabilization were carried out for 30 min with 0.2% saponin, 5% NDS in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibody staining was carried out against anti-VAC14 (1:500 dilution) (Abnova H00055697-B01P) or anti-Salmonella (1:500 dilution) (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (1:500 dilution) (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of ruffling around Salmonella bacteria was calculated using Fiji by drawing a circle around the ruffles and calculating the area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol staining was performed using 0.05 mg/mL filipin (Sigma) for 2 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was done with a Zeiss 710 inverted fluorescence microscope and an EVOS fluorescent microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Typhoid_Fever_Association_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA samples from typhoid patients (n = 500) were collected as part of larger epidemiological or clinical studies that were undertaken in Viet Nam between 1992 and 2002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clinical studies, which have been described previously (9598), took place at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and Dong Thap Provincial Hospital, Vietnam, and the samples have been previously used in human genetic studies (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients were defined as children or adults with clinical signs and symptoms of typhoid fever with culture-confirmed S. Typhi in their blood or bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood samples for DNA extraction were collected at the time of patient recruitment to the clinical study, and case report forms were used to record demographic and clinical information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The population control group comprised 496 DNA samples extracted from the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies born in 2003 at Hung Vuong Obstetric Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients and controls were unrelated, and the majority of individuals were ethnic Vietnamese Kinh (98%) as assessed by questionnaire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Written informed consent for clinical study participation was obtained by the treating physician from the patients or the patients\ir parent/guardian and from the babys mother for population controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All protocols were approved by the scientific and ethical committees at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Dong Thap Provincial Hospital and the Health Services of Dong Thap Province in Vietnam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethical approval was also granted by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom, the Duke IRB, and the Human Research Ethics committee of the University of Melbourne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant, and genomic DNA was extracted from the blood pellet using Qiagen blood midi or maxi kits (Qiagen) or the Nucleon BACC genomic DNA extraction kits (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was quantified by PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
rs8060947 was genotyped by Taqman using a predesigned assay kit (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was performed using a LightCycler 480 Probes Master kit on the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genotypic deviations from HardyWeinberg equilibrium were assessed using a 2 statistical test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons 2 test was performed to assess an association between disease phenotype, allele frequencies, and recessive genotype (AA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OR and 95% CI were used to measure the risk of disease associated with a specific allele (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The typhoid fever case and control samples used in this candidate gene study are primarily a subset of a larger Vietnamese sample set that has undergone genome-wide genotyping (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis of this GWAS dataset found that all enteric fever cases had sufficiently matched controls (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), which provides strong evidence no significant population stratification is present in our candidate gene study population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Zebrafish_Infections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies involving zebrafish (strain AB*) were approved by Duke Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with national and institutional guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT zebrafish embryos (strain AB*) were injected in the swim bladder at 4 dpf with 100 cfu of S. Typhi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were taken 24 h postinfection at 2× and 10× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish were scored based on bacterial localization as cleared, localized to the swim bladder, disseminated out of the swim bladder, or dead due to bacterial burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25 fish were injected per bacterial strain for each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ezetimibe (10 M) dissolved in DMSO was added to the fish water 24 h before S. Typhi injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filipin staining was performed on whole fixed fish at 5 dpf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish were initially fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS, and then stained with filipin (0.05 mg/mL) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently imaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Descriptive statistics, parentoffspring regression, and QQ plots were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) and with R (99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide association analysis was conducted with PLINK v1.07 (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was carried out with QFAM-parents with adaptive permutation under default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QFAM procedures implemented in PLINK use linear regression to test for association while using permutation of within- and between-family components separately to control for family structure (106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes were from HapMap phase 3 release 2 (1,439,782 SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imputation of autosomal genotypes included two steps: a prephasing step using SHAPEIT2 (100) and an imputation step using IMPUTE2 (101).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After filtering out imputation accuracy scores (IMPUTEs INFO) less_than0.9 and minor allele frequency less_than0.01, we obtained 17,759,517 SNPs (6,967,393 SNPs have minor allele frequency 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QQ plots were plotted using the quantilequantile function in R. A regional Manhattan plot of the VAC14 region was made using LocusZoom (102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values for eQTL analysis were calculated using linear regression in GraphPad Prism using unrelated individuals (parents only in trio data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
