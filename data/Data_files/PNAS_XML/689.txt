Impact of savings groups on the lives of the poor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted a large randomized evaluation of a savings-led microfinance program across three countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evaluation provides important evidence on the impact of a popular development intervention on the lives of low-income households in rural communities by looking at its effects on usage of financial services, microenterprise activity, income, female empowerment, consumption, and the ability to cope with shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Savings-led microfinance programs operate in poor rural communities in developing countries to establish groups that save and then lend out the accumulated savings to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonprofit organizations train villagers to create and lead these groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a clustered randomized evaluation spanning three African countries (Ghana, Malawi, and Uganda), we find that the promotion of these community-based microfinance groups leads to an improvement in household business outcomes and womens empowerment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not find evidence of impacts on average consumption or other livelihoods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Program  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Implemented by CARE and 13 local partner NGOs in the study areas, the VSLA program has three main components: (i) a group-based commitment savings mechanism, (ii) a process for members to request loans from the group at any point, and (iii) a social or emergency fund financed by members with a regular contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each site, after an initial community meeting to introduce the program, trained officers or agents form and guide VSLAs for an initial cycle (usually 812 mo) and provide oversight and support for a second cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups are comprised of 1930 members, mostly women, who choose to come together as a result of an agents promotional activity in the community or after having observed other groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table S1 compares the implementation strategies and characteristics of VSLAs across the three sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each country, the role and mandate of the trainers were slightly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, officers from the NGO (called field officers) were in charge of creating VSLAs in each of their villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda and Malawi, however, implementation was designed to facilitate scaling the program in a sustainable way: Local people were trained as village agents, who then trained other groups in the village and surrounding areas for a fee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Malawi program was designed to rely heavily on these agents at the onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Program data from the last 3 mo of the study (2nd quarter, 2011) show that 90.3% of the groups created by study partners were created by village agents.§ In Uganda, the field officer was given the mandate to work in a group of villages and begin training agents only later on in the programs timeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in strategy is reflected in the fact that, in the same period, only 20.4% of the groups were formed by village agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, research in Kenya finds important differences in the efficacy of savings-led microfinance groups managed by NGO-paid agents and village agents paid by group members themselves: the village-paid agent model is less expensive; generates more borrowing, savings, and enterprise investment; and likely does this by attracting more business-oriented members (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Take-up rates at the end of the study averaged 31.6% across the three sites, with a steady increase over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find evidence of the program successfully replicating VSLAs beyond the primary target village, with take up increasing over time and also reaching the control villages, which had a take-up rate of 6.2% by end line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Take-up trends and overall numbers varied slightly across sites as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the time of the end-line survey, respondents who had joined a group had been members for a median value of 14 mo, with over 61% of them having completed a full savings cycle and receiving at least one share out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members made small weekly savings contributions, with median values ranging between purchasing power parity (PPP) 2011 US$0.66 and $0.84 across the three countries.¶ The main reported uses for savings share outs (median value of PPP 2011 US$38.5) were agricultural investments (22%), food (16%), and education costs (16%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At end line, 68% of members had received at least one loan from the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median loan was PPP 2011 US$19.7, with a median interest charge of 10% flat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main stated uses for loans were business (29%), food (13%), and education (13%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Research_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present the results from randomized, controlled trials of the VSLA program across a total of 561 clusters, 282 of which were randomly assigned to treatment and the remaining of which were randomly assigned to control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment clusters received initial promotion and group formation activities by agents of the implementing organizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S2 presents key features of the research design across the three research sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Ghana, a cluster consisted of one community identified by the partnering NGO as a viable village for implementation of the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi and Uganda, to measure organic replication activities of the program, a cluster consisted of two villages: one was identified as the primary village, and a second one was randomly chosen from other villages within a few kilometers of the primary village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the secondary village was not disclosed to the partner NGOs to avoid targeting and, thereby, permit us to measure organic replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Random assignment was stratified at the district level in all three countries and on other variables depending on the country, as specified in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In each country, the village representatives were first approached to help identify adequate households for surveying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveyors then created a list of household heads in the village, from which they randomly selected participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Uganda and Malawi, a majority was selected from the primary village, and a smaller number was selected from the secondary village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we collected panel survey data on 15,221 households from the three sites (survey instruments are available from the authors); 13,564 households were surveyed at baseline, 91.2% of which were resurveyed in the follow-up, and an additional 2,845 households were surveyed in Ghana at end line to mitigate concerns about lower than expected take-up rates in treatment villages and the proximity of control villages to treatment villages, which caused some of the former to adopt the VSLA program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four surveys were administered within each wave of data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a household survey collected information on indicators, such as agricultural production, income-generating activities, and economic shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, an adult survey collected information on the individuals experience of gender issues and community involvement and on their savings and loans activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the majority of our sample (13,502 households), the adult survey was administered to an adult woman in the household.# Third, a village survey gathered information about various characteristics of the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, a market survey was used to record the market prices of a variety of staple foods grown by respondents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As is the standard practice for multisite trials, we estimate a pooled model controlling for baseline values of our outcome variables, country, and district, which was used as a stratification variable in each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEs are clustered at the village level (comprised of a primarysecondary village pair for Uganda and Malawi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each column in Table 1 is a result of an independent ordinary least squares regression modeled with the following specification:Yick=+1Assignmentc+2Zick+TCountry+VStratification+ic,where Yick is the index k of interest for either the household or the female primary respondent i in cluster c. Assignmentc is an indicator variable for whether the cluster was randomly assigned to receive the VSLA program or not, Zick is the household or female primary respondent baseline value of the outcome index k (if not available, the baseline value is replaced with 9, with a dummy variable indicating a missing value), TCountry is a vector of dummy variables for each of three countries in the study, and VStratification is a vector of dummy variables for districts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis used here is an intent to treat method, where we compare those who were randomly assigned to receive treatment with those who were not, irrespective of actual take up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is important for interpretation and also in accordance with the programs promotion as a community-level intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two main reasons that we do not estimate the treatment on the treated, in which we would use random assignment as an instrumental variable for participation in a savings-led microfinance group to estimate the effect of participation on the outcomes of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, participation in a VSLA is a continuous variable, with some just having started participation and others participating for a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, such a specification requires there to be no indirect effects on others in the community, which contradicts one of the main arguments for savings-led microfinance programs: that they improve overall community wellbeing and social capital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the program was multifaceted and we collected data on a large number of outcome variables, we are concerned with multiple hypothesis testing, which we address in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we create indices for six of eight families of outcomes, which avoids interpreting one individual outcome measured with noise as indicative of a genuine change in an outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we calculate q values across outcomes using the BenjaminiHochberg step-up method (17) to control for false discovery rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, theory and evidence from elsewhere on impacts of improved financial inclusion (3) suggest that not all families of outcomes should be considered as equally likely to shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the outcomes, we define six main indices and two aggregate measures: consumption and income.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each measure is formed by grouping together variables of related outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The financial inclusion index measures the extent of female primary respondents involvement in the informal credit and savings sector and includes savings balances, loans taken in the last 12 mo, total amount of loans received, whether a person has savings, and whether the respondent is a member of a savings group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The food security index uses metrics on meal patterns to determine food consumption during the 12 mo prior to surveying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes food intake reduction, days without eating for adults and children, and a variable indicating whether the household resorted to borrowing food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Income is an aggregate measure of household income and revenues from all common sources: agriculture, livestock, business profits, and paid labor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All income measures refer to households reported monthly values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monthly household income is calculated as self-reported revenues minus expenses for all income-generating activities carried out by the household in the 12 mo before the survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual microenterprise income is coded as zero for microenterprises operating less than 1 mo that year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Livestock income is the sales proceeds derived from livestock in a month minus the cost of livestock purchases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not deduct other input costs when calculating livestock income.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Business profits are the profits earned through the households enterprise(s) calculated as revenues minus costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a business operated for less than 1 mo, its profits were not included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, income from paid labor is the income earned by a household member by being a paid employee, including agricultural day laborers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The business outcomes index measures nonmonetary performance of microenterprises run by household members over the 12 mo preceding a survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes the total number of businesses operated by household members, the sum of months that these businesses were in operation in the year preceding surveying, and whether any of the households businesses employs labor from outside the household.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The assets index combines two standardized indices measuring household assets and productive assets held by the household.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation of values of assets was standardized across the three countries and time periods by expressing each asset value in relative terms: specifically as the number of bicycles needed to purchase one unit of the asset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More information on the construction of this index is provided in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consumption is an aggregate measure of monthly per capita expenditure on food and nonfood items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food consumption expenditure used a 1-wk recall, and included only those items for which data were collected across the three sites (grains, tubers, nuts, and beans), meaning it presents only a partial view of the households consumption basket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonfood consumption measure includes monthly per capita household expenditure on transport, clothes, electricity, and petrol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The womens empowerment index captures womens self-reported influence on household decisions, particularly in relation to food expenses for the household, education and healthcare expenses for the children, business expenses if the household operates a business, and the womens ability to visit friends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the community participation index captures self-reported involvement in community affairs based on whether the female primary respondent has raised an issue before a village chief, government authority, or village council; whether she has attended a community meeting in the 12 mo preceding surveying; and whether she has participated in any social group within the community (a womens or workers group, for instance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 presents the main results of all eight outcome variables, and Tables S3S10 show their breakdown by components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indices are constructed as Yifck, interpreted as the outcome variable k for adult respondent (or household) i in family of outcomes f within a country c. All indices and variables have been defined, such that a higher value corresponds with improved outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed explanation on the method followed for index construction is provided in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information on drought and bad harvest interactions in Tables S3S10 examines a critical heterogeneity: whether the program had a differential impact during times of drought or among households reporting a bad harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained rainfall data from the daily Africa Rainfall Climatology 2 dataset (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we created an indicator variable for all villages that experienced a drought (defined as an annual rainfall less than 1 SD below a historic average) 12 mo before the end-line survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda and Malawi, 34.6 and 15.4%, respectively, of villages experienced drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ghana is excluded from this analysis because the period of our study was exceptionally rainy; all but one village had a larger than average rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have end-line data from Uganda and Malawi on households self-reported experience of a bad harvest over the previous year (80.1 and 33.2% of households, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At end line, we find substantial positive impacts on financial inclusion as a direct outcome of the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S3 shows that overall participation in informal savings groups (including ROSCAs and other types of groups) is 17.4% points (SE = 0.015) greater for female primary respondents in program areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total reported savings are also significantly higher by PPP 2011 US$13.7 (SE = 4.488), equivalent to a 34.5% increase relative to savings balances of respondents in control areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the program improves access to credit as well: 42.1% of women obtained a loan in the year leading up to the end-line survey, an 11% point difference (SE = 0.012) from the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average amount borrowed in a year is 16.2% higher or PPP 2011 US$6.6 (SE = 3.851) in program communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drought and bad harvest interactions in Table 1 find no evidence that the positive impact on financial inclusion is any stronger for households in treatment villages who experienced a poor harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1, food security index (household) shows that the program, on average, had no significant positive impacts on food security.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer look at bad shocks (Table 1, drought and bad harvest interactions) shows that drought has a strong negative impact (0.119 SD, SE = 0.043) on food security for households in control villages as does a poor harvest (0.590 SD, SE = 0.036).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no evidence that the program improves food security for treatment households reporting a poor harvest or those who experienced drought [although the point estimate for the latter is large enough to be important (0.092 SD with SE = 0.057); thus, we cannot rule out positive and important impacts on food security].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, the program does not show a positive effect on income for the overall sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do find, however, a positive program effect (PPP US$26.4, SE = 15.002) for treatment villages suffering from a drought event, although it is not statistically significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (q value = 0.260).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we analyze components of the household income measure in Table S5, we find that the program has an overall positive impact on monthly household business profits of PPP US$5.6 (SE = 1.857) or 24.4%, but it does not affect income for other household activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no evidence that the program improves income or revenues for households reporting a poor harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the VSLA program has an overall effect on business profits and also insulates members from adverse aggregate shocks on their economic activity more broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we find a 0.06-SD (SE = 0.023) positive impact of the program on an index of business outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S6 shows that VSLAs lead to a slight increase in the total number of businesses operated by the household (0.024 businesses, SE = 0.014; equivalent to a 6.3% increase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Households in treatment communities operated businesses 0.20 mo (SE = 0.098) longer than the control group, equivalent to an 8.6% increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that businesses operated by households in the sample are mostly short-term seasonal businesses, with an average total of 2.33 mo of business operation per household in the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is fairly uncommon for businesses to use outside labor, we find that VSLAs lead to a 1.0% point increase (SE = 0.004)a 26.3% increase compared with a 3.8% control group average in the number of households with at least one employee in its business(es).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the VSLA program stimulates investments to extend and expand businesses operated by the households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information on drought and bad harvest interactions in Table S6 shows no evidence that these positive effects on business activities are any different among households that experience a bad harvest or in communities that experience drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1, total asset index (household) and Table S7 find no impact on total assets owned by households nor any differential impacts for those experiencing bad shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1, monthly per capita consumption ($; household) and Table S8 find no impact on consumption in both the aggregate or the component measures, nor do they find a differential impact for those experiencing drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, it should be noted that the consumption measure refers only to 30 d preceding the interview and therefore, could miss consumption smoothing benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1, womens empowerment index (adult female respondent) shows a significant impact of the VSLA program on the empowerment of female primary respondents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveyed women in program communities display a 0.06-SD (SE = 0.034) increase in their influence on household decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S9 shows that this impact is strong across the board, with a 4.2% point (SE = 0.016) improvement in the share of women who have a high degree of control over household business decisions, a 3.7% point (SE = 0.014) increase in control over food expenses, and a 2.9% point (SE = 0.015) increase in women with influence on education expenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in Table 1, drought and bad harvest interactions suggest that this increase in influence occurs only in communities that are not experiencing a drought: there is a 0.119-SD (SE = 0.065) decrease in female influence on household decision-making in treatment communities that suffer from drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we do not find evidence of a similar impact on female primary respondents community participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Table S10 does show a significant 2.3% points (SE = 0.011) increase in the number of women who attended a community meeting in the last 12 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Datasets S1S7 provide some additional results of interest, such as balance and attrition analyses, and breakdowns of impact by country and components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find important impacts after 23 y of treatment beginning: VSLAs facilitate investment and empower women.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find no evidence of differential impacts on any of the outcomes after an idiosyncratic agricultural shock (experiencing a bad harvest after controlling for bad rainfall).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the VSLA treatment could affect the likelihood of a poor harvest conditional on the aggregate shock by changing agricultural investment or technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the unobserved characteristics of farmers reporting a poor harvest conditional on bad rainfall in a VSLA community might be different from those of farmers reporting the same in a control community, making the coefficient of this interaction difficult to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find no evidence of a VSLA impact on farming activities (Table S5, all countries), suggesting that any such selection effect is minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The positive impact on income after bad rainfall (an aggregate community shock) could suggest that VSLAs may work through a savings mechanism, not merely an insurance mechanism that builds risk-sharing within the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally, the two are not mutually exclusive channels through which the program can generate impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that these results do not maintain statistical significance after correcting for multiple hypotheses, we encourage replication of these evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond establishing the base evidence for the average impact of these programs, three key and related questions remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What exactly is new?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why does the specific pattern of impacts vary across countries?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the mechanism through which these programs generate change?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A VSLA requires no external capital and no legal infrastructure to issue and collect loans and is, in fact, similar to existing informal mechanisms, such as ROSCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, average impact ensued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average household in a community offered an opportunity to form a VSLA increased its financial savings by almost 35% or $14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average household monthly consumption expenditure is about $200, and therefore, this change in savings balances is significant, albeit unlikely to be transformative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is unsurprising that there is no evidence of average impacts on household income, consumption, food security, or asset ownership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We instead find changes in the realms most directly linked to the VSLA: nonfarm business operations and womens empowerment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, these effects vary across populations and countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed exploration of differences in implementation across the three countries may help us understand the mechanism through which it generates the average impacts that we have documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A savings-led microfinance group might be thought of as a new social technology, one for which all of the necessary components existed beforehand but that still required some external agent to promote and train groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, researchers in Mali found that, when villages started these groups via word of mouth rather than through direct NGO promotion and training, they did not work as well (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terms of mechanisms, we start with the simple: the near-zero transaction costs (i.e., no travel time required, merely time to attend a meeting) can explain its impact vis à vis formal banking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, low costs do not explain the impact when compared with preexisting informal options, such as cash stored at home.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with these options, savings-led microfinance groups can be best thought of as a social commitment savings account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This logic relies on models of temptation, time-inconsistent preferences, or household bargaining inefficiencies to explain the demand for commitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although some informal savings vehicles do have a form of commitment (e.g., livestock), such vehicles can be costly and not as effective as a commitment device that uses social capital to help ensure compliance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Last, we consider the benefits relative to the costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find no evidence that the VSLA program changes average income or consumption, which poses complications for a benefitcost analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits of the program are subtle: possible improved income in the face of drought, empowerment of women within the treated communities, and improvements in a broad array of business outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asserting a monetary value for these improvements would require a series of strong modeling assumptions that would of necessity be tentative and are beyond the scope of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the lack of a benefit-cost analysis, it is important to note that the programs cost per household is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained data on program costs from Malawi and Uganda as of June of 2011, but such data were unavailable for Ghana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most conservative estimate yields an average cost per member of $26 in Malawi and $20 in Uganda over 22 mo of program implementation (not including the opportunity cost of the participants time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the take-up rates of 22 and 36% among female primary respondents in Malawi and Uganda, respectively, and the fact that 20 and 36% of VSLA members are men in Malawi and Uganda, respectively, the most conservative estimate of the costs of the program per household in the cluster would be based on the assumptions that all of the male members have the same take-up rate as that evidenced in female members and that the former come from different households than the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these assumptions, the average costs of the program per household in Malawi and Uganda are $7 and $11, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Program_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2008, we began a series of evaluations to study CAREs savings group model and measure its impact on the lives of the people in program communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies were conducted on the occasion of three scale-up efforts by CARE: the ESCAPE Program in Ghana and the SAVE UP Programs in Uganda and Malawi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The scale-up efforts replicated the same savings group methodology in a large number of communities across the three countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The operational models in the three sites, however, followed three different models, with implications for our study design and analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, the program was implemented by NGO trainers who were in charge of creating VSLAs within the limits of their own villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda and Malawi, CARE tested a replication model meant to more rapidly and cost-effectively form groups in target villages and surrounding regions (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all sites, CARE worked closely with local organizations rooted in the area to implement the VSLA program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Village agents are VSLA members with particular leadership qualities who are selected from an initial set of VSLA groups established by the implementing organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These agents serve as promoters of new VSLAs, supporting these groups for the first year of activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This replication model stems from observing the natural spread of savings groups in other countries, where the simple presence of a savings group was enough to spur the spontaneous creation of new savings groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is designed to maintain the quality and core elements of the VSLA methodology for these new VSLA offshoots and develop a team of trainers who can sustainably replicate the model through a fee for service arrangement, in which group members pay for the training services provided by the independent agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Malawi, officers of the implementing organizations were each asked to create 12 groups in 12 different villages and follow them through their first savings cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each of these groups, officers selected, on average, one member to be trained to become an agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of this initial cycle, the field officers transitioned into a supervisory role monitoring between 10 and 15 agents, each tasked with forming a minimum of 8 new groups on a fee for service basis (approximately $15/y per group) within the timeframe of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Uganda, implementing organizations used officers who resided within a target village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each officer had the responsibility of forming and overseeing a target number of 24 groups in the village and its surrounding areas within 3 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the second year of activities, officers were tasked with identifying and training three agents (from existing groups) and mentoring them as they each formed two new groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To meet the implementation requirements of the scale-up program in Malawi and Uganda and measure the extent of the success of these replication strategies, we created clusters of villages as the randomization unit for our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters were designed in close collaboration with CARE and comprised a sufficient number of villages and households to meet the replication targets of the implementing partner organizations according to their model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each cluster, we selected a primary village that would be targeted as the initial center of activities by the implementing partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secondary community was then selected within a 4- or 2.5-km radius of the primary village in Uganda and Malawi, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations of secondary villages were not disclosed to implementing partners to avoid targeting of these villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data collected on households from these secondary villages allowed us to measure the extent to which the program extended beyond the primary village selected for implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In each country, village representatives were first approached to help identify adequate households for surveying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda, a list of all household heads was created; then, 15 and 8 households were randomly selected for the study sample from each primary and secondary village, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before initiating the survey, the surveyor verified that at least one eligible woman (in the 17- to 50-y-old age group; married or had been married before) was present in the household selected for the survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If none was present, another household was randomly selected from the list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The household questionnaire was then administered to the head of the household and his wife or the person most knowledgeable about the household in case the former was not available or not knowledgeable about household matters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi, listing agents collected basic information one by one for a total of 60 households for the primary village and 45 households for the secondary village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Listing agents collected the name of the head of the household and the full list of all eligible women (1750 y of age who were married or had been married) residing in the household.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conduct the process efficiently, the village map was divided into zones with the help of the village chief: a central zone, defined as the area with the largest concentration of households, and several peripheral zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the primary village, 45 households were listed among those living closer to the center of the village, and 15 were sampled from a peripheral zone randomly selected among those identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the secondary villages, 30 people were listed from the center and 15 were listed from the periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the completion of the sampling, 15 and 9 households (from the center and periphery, respectively) were randomly selected to participate in the survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, 30 households from each village were randomly selected for the interviews; adult surveys were administered in a randomly chosen 50% of households to one randomly chosen female adult, aged 1860 y old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three countries, paper surveys were used at baseline, whereas end-line surveys were conducted exclusively on netbook computers using specialized software for computer-assisted interviewing to ensure high-quality data that could be rapidly translated into analysis results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The baseline in Ghana included 4,487 households (April to June of 2008), of which 4,076 (90.8%) were found and surveyed at end line (February to April of 2011) and 2,845 additional households were added at end line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline in Malawi included 4,538 households (April to June of 2009), of which 4,106 (90.5%) were found and surveyed at end line (April to July of 2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline in Uganda included 4,539 households (April to June of 2009), of which 4,194 (92.4%) were found and surveyed at end line (April to July of 2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Program_Uptake_and_Member_Characteristics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all three countries, program implementation began with a series of community mobilization efforts in each of the target villages (in Ghana) or the primary village within each program cluster (in Malawi and Uganda).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The officers, in agreement with local village leaders, organized a community meeting to explain the VSLA idea to the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interested members of the community formed an initial group by starting to save and receiving a series of trainings by the officer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar process was followed by officers and agents in communities surrounding the primary villages in Malawi and Uganda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of the presence of other types of informal savings groups (ROSCAs and accumulating savings and credit associations, known as ASCAs) in the community and the lack of a standard, universally recognized name to identify VSLAs in the program areas, we identify membership through a series of questions asked to female primary respondents in our sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respondents were asked whether they had saved with a group in the 12 mo leading up to the end-line survey as well as about the characteristics and frequency of group meetings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this information, we defined a VSLA as a savings group that met on a weekly basis, accumulated money over time using a box, was formed with the help of a trainer, and allowed members to take a loan from the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1 depicts the take-up rate over time for each country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The figure shows a progressively increasing number of members over the duration of the program because of a gradual increase in demand and formation of new groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Dataset S3B shows, in Uganda and Malawi, we observe different take-up rates for primary and secondary villages, where secondary villages began forming groups later in the life of the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we register a 32% take-up rate among female primary adult respondents in treatment villages compared with a 6% rate in control villages, with Malawi having the lowest take-up rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compare VSLA members with nonmembers across a number of characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dataset S3A Panel A compares members with nonmembers with respect to baseline values of the outcome measures used in our impact analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that those who join a VSLA group are significantly better off compared with nonmembers, suggesting that, although the program is effective in attracting low-income households in rural communities, these households are not necessarily the poorest and most marginal in the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If capital constraints are binding, too many ultrapoor in the group may actually lead to more rationing (evidence from Uganda from a different study supports this concern) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Dataset S3A depicts, female primary respondents who joined a VSLA have significantly better access to financial services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their households are not necessarily more food secure than others, but they do register higher income on average, significantly better business-level outcomes, and greater asset ownership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, these households are still poor by conventional standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, these households report a monthly per capita consumption of only $19 and a monthly income of $74.37, a measure which, as explained in Construction of Indexed Outcomes, is overestimated as it does not deduct all livestock costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Member women also recorded having significantly stronger decision-making power in the household and engaging more directly in the community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dataset S3A Panel B compares baseline characteristics of VSLA members with those of nonmembers in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that women with larger households and fewer children under 5 y old at the time of baseline are more likely to join the VSLA program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members are also significantly more likely to have taken loans at baseline and have higher loan amounts, on average, than non-VSLA members across all three countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Construction_of_Indexed_Outcomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each index is calculated by subtracting from each outcome in the index the survey round control mean of that outcome and dividing by the corresponding SD to form a z score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After we have z scores for each outcome, they are averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This average is then standardized once again by subtracting the survey wave control group mean and dividing by the corresponding SD to transform the index into a z score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All components are weighed equally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The asset index was constructed by expressing each asset value in relative terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each site, the survey collected information about the number of units of an asset that a household owned but did not collect information on the value of each of these assets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the cost of each asset differed by site and some assets were specific to a country, it became difficult to estimate the true value of these assets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remedy this issue, we express the value of each asset as the number of bicycles needed to purchase one unit of that asset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a bicycle as a relative measure, because we have data on bicycle ownership and median bike prices in all three sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data on median bicycle prices were drawn from previous studies: specifically an ongoing study by Dupas et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) for Uganda and Malawi and the study by Banerjee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) in Ghana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construction was as follows: (i) The median value of each asset for each site was calculated by dividing the value of one unit of that asset by the value of one bicycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) For every durable good and type of livestock, the medians from each of the three sites were combined to create a single value of each asset in terms of a bicycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The total value of assets owned by a household was calculated by multiplying the number of assets that the household owns and the single value obtained in the previous step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) The total values of assets owned were standardized (with respect to the control group) by site and survey round and reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Added_Detail_on_Data_Collected_and_Differences_Across_Countries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The food security components differed considerably across the three sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda, baseline values present a standardized count of the number of daily meals consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, neither survey included measures on food borrowing or children going an entire day without eating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi, the baseline index comprises measures of skipped meals for children and adults as well as resorting to borrowing to satisfy household basic needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agricultural income also differed across sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi, total expenses include expenditure on chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer, herbicides or insecticides, and paid labor costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline, the index excludes labor costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, it includes expenses on chemical fertilizer, additional inputs (insecticides and herbicides), and labor costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline, the measure also includes the cost of renting an animal to plow the land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda, expenses include those on chemical and organic fertilizers and additional inputs (herbicides or insecticides).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At baseline, the business outcomes index for the three countries excludes whether the business has any employees; for Uganda, it also excludes the total number of months that a business has been in operation over the preceding year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At baseline, we lacked data on the number of each asset owned by the household in Ghana and therefore, we could not calculate the asset index by using the bike prices mechanism explained above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the baseline value of the asset index for Ghana is a standardized count of the categories of assets owned by a household.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The consumption measure at baseline in Uganda and Ghana captures only nonfood monthly expenditure per capita.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For womens empowerment, baseline values in Ghana exclude a womans ability to visit a friend and her influence on business expenses, whereas in Uganda, baseline values exclude the womans influence on decisions regarding food expenses for the household.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rainfall data come from the Africa Rainfall Climatology 2 dataset (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dataset consists of daily rainfall estimates using satellite gauge data and geostationary IR imagery as inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the data are gridded 0.1° × 0.1° (10-km precision), we were able to match them to each of our sample villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historic averages and SDs were calculated for the 10-y period before the 12 mo covered by the surveys food security questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Baseline_Balance_and_Attrition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study involved a sample of over 15,000 households across the three countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ghana, our study covers a sample of 175 villages, of which 87 were assigned to serve as a control group and 88 were assigned to receive the program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each Ghanaian village, we sampled 30 households to respond to our survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Uganda sample comprises 391 villages divided over 196 clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each cluster, we collected data for 15 households in the primary village and 8 households in the secondary village.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi, we identified 190 clusters for a total of 380 villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We surveyed 15 households in primary villages and 9 households in secondary villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the baseline, we conducted adult surveys in Uganda and Malawi with the head of the household and his/her spouse, whereas we made an effort to interview women respondents privately in Ghana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At end line, only one adult was interviewed in depth per household in all three countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Malawi, we tracked down the baseline female respondents to reinterview them at end line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Uganda, we randomly selected either the male or female adult baseline respondent to reinterview, whereas in Ghana, we randomly selected one female respondent per household to participate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Table S2 summarizes, the clusters were stratified by district before randomization to control for geographic location being predictive of outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each country also used additional variables for stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dataset S4 Panel A presents baseline data on each outcome measure for the pooled and country samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present both the results of an ordinary least squares regression of each outcome variable on treatment controlling for stratification variables and country-fixed effects and the P value from an equality of means test with no control variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When controlling for stratification variables, the pooled sample is balanced across all measures, whereas Ghana is unbalanced at baseline in the food security index (at the 10% level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dataset S4 Panel B shows the results of a regression of treatment on all outcome measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the pooled and country-specific samples, the outcome measures at baseline do not seem to be predictive of treatment status after we control for stratification variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dataset S5 Panel A depicts whether treatment status influences the likelihood of a respondent to drop out from the study sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define attrition as the respondent who declined to be a part of our end-line survey after having been in our baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the VSLA program was opt in, we are not considering the people who left the savings group as attritors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Households and female primary respondents who were added to our sample at end line are not considered in Dataset S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we see from Dataset S5 Panel A, although our control group in Malawi seems to have lost significantly more respondents (1.8%) than our treatment group, our pooled sample is not significantly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can conclude that attrition is not significantly different across treatment arms and will not weaken the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
