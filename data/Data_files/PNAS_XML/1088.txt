Targeting JAK2 reduces GVHD and xenograft rejection through regulation of T cell differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among allogeneic stem-cell transplantation recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effort to identify selective immune suppression whereby GVHD is reduced and the antitumor activity of the graft is preserved is key to improving the success of blood and marrow transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) significantly decreases GVHD and maintains tumor killing by the donor T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacologic blockade of JAK1 and JAK2 in myelofibrosis patients is known to impair human T cell subsets broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, we show that JAK2 inhibition impairs alloreactive T cells yet promotes beneficial regulatory T cell and Th2 differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study emphasizes the relevance of JAK2 in GVHD pathogenesis and prevention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signal transduction is a critical mediator of the immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAK2 is implicated in the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is a significant cause of transplant-related mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfer of JAK2/ donor T cells to allogeneic recipients leads to attenuated GVHD yet maintains graft-versus-leukemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th1 differentiation among JAK2/ T cells is significantly decreased compared with wild-type controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, iTreg and Th2 polarization is significantly increased among JAK2/ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib is a multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against JAK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib significantly reduces GVHD and xenogeneic skin graft rejection in distinct rodent models and maintains donor antitumor immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, pacritinib spares iTregs and polarizes Th2 responses as observed among JAK2/ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data clearly identify JAK2 as a therapeutic target to control donor alloreactivity and promote iTreg responses after allo-HCT or solid organ transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, a phase I/II acute GVHD prevention trial combining pacritinib with standard immune suppression after allo-HCT is actively being investigated (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02891603).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JAK2_Signaling_Promotes_Th1_Differentiation__but_Inhibits_Th2_and_Treg_Responses_by_Allo-Activation_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effect of JAK2 in regulating T cell activation and function, we used mice in which JAK2 was conditionally deleted in T cells (JAK2flox/flox Ã— CD4 Cre+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of CD4+ T cells among JAK2/ mice was decreased compared with naive B6 mice (Fig S1 A and D), although proportions of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ Tregs were similar (Fig S1 A, B, D, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of T cell subsets within the naive and central memory compartments was also similar between JAK2/ and WT mice (Fig S1 CG) with only a subtle increase in CD8+ effector memory T cells in JAK2/ mice (Fig S1 CG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to alloantigen stimulation, proliferating (CFSElow) JAK2/ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produced significantly less IFN, yet higher levels of IL-4/5 and IL-10 compared with WT T cells (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that JAK2 signaling is critical for Th1 differentiation and argue against Th2 and Treg development after alloantigen stimulation in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

JAK2_Contributes_to_T_Cell-Mediated_GVHD__but_Is_Dispensable_for_the_GVL_Effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study how JAK2 affects T cell responses to alloantigen in vivo, we first evaluated GVHD severity after transfer of JAK2/ or WT T cells to major MHC-mismatched recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAK2/ T cells had a significantly reduced ability to induce lethal GVHD compared with WT T cells (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the reduced alloresponse observed in cohorts that received JAK2/ T cells was replicated in a minor MHC-mismatch model of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired immune reconstitution is associated with GVHD (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined donor-derived T- and B-cell reconstitution in surviving BALB/c recipients 80 d post BMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the thymus, the percentage and absolute number of double-positive thymocytes (CD4+CD8+) were comparable to cohorts receiving T cell-depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) only (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spleen, the absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells and B cells in recipients of JAK2/ T cells were reduced compared with those of TCD-BM alone (Fig S3B); the frequencies of donor-derived CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and of B cells were comparable (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that JAK2 signaling in T cells facilitates recipient thymic damage typically associated with GVHD (22), yet may enhance peripheral T- and B-cell numbers after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on in vivo bioluminescence measurements of tumor growth, recipients of JAK2/ or WT donor T cells exhibited significantly less tumor mortality compared with those that did not receive T cells, indicating that JAK2/ T cells mediate GVL (Fig 1 E and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumor mortality among recipients of JAK2 KO T cells was not significantly different (P = 0.15, log-rank test) compared with that of WT T cells (Fig 1 E and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments demonstrate that JAK2 signaling in donor T cells contributes to GVHD but is partially dispensable for the GVL effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

JAK2_Inhibits_Th2_and_Treg_Polarization_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the cytokine production profile of WT and JAK2/ T cells in allogeneic recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAK2/ T cells had significantly less IFN+ Th1 differentiation in the spleen (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, JAK2/ T cells had significantly enhanced IL-4/5+ Th2 and Foxp3+ Treg polarization (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAK2/ CD8+ T cells also produced less IFN compared with WT controls (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although limited to a small positive population of cells, JAK2/ T cells exhibited increased Th17 differentiation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed in recipient livers (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

JAK2_Contributes_to_the_Migratory_Capacity_of_Donor_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the impact of JAK2 signaling on donor T cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and the integrin 47 was significantly decreased among CD4+ JAK2/ T cells in the spleen of recipients (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in CXCR3 expression is indicative of reduced trafficking among Th1 cells (23), while decreased 47 demonstrates impaired migration to intestinal tissues (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression of CCR6l, a key Th17 chemokine receptor, was similar among cohorts (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that JAK2 activation promotes T cell homing potential to GVHD target organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the observed decrease in 47 expression, recipients of JAK2/ T cells had significantly less tissue damage in the small and large intestine (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GVHD was also significantly reduced in the skin and liver of JAK2/ T cell recipients (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results do not directly assess T cell trafficking, the data suggest that JAK2 contributes to the expression of necessary chemokines and integrins required for lymphocyte migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacologic_Inhibition_of_JAK2_with_Pacritinib_Reduces_GVHD_and_Spares_GVL  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To translate the observations made using the JAK2/ T cells, host WT BALB/c mice received B6 allografts and were treated with pacritinib, a JAK2 inhibitor, or vehicle for 3 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib significantly reduced acute GVHD mortality among the recipient BALB/c mice (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the JAK2 KO T cells, pacritinib significantly reduced CD4+ T cell production of IFN and the proliferation of Th1 cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, pacritinib treatment did not significantly impact JAK2/ T cells in these studies, indicating that the potential off-target effects of pacritinib in this context were minimal (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) impaired murine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity against tumor in vitro (Fig S5), neither pacritinib nor ruxolitinib interfered with the GVL effect in vivo (Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, ruxolitinib demonstrated greater immune suppression against GVHD (P less_than 0.05, Fig S6 AC), indicating that dual JAK1/2 inhibition induces broad donor T cell inactivation compared with pacritinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib had no direct effect on P815 cells (Fig S6 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pacritinib_Polarizes_a_Th2_Response_Among_Allostimulated_Human_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We went on to verify the immune suppressive effects of pacritinib in a human system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cytokine- or dendritic cell (DC)-stimulated human T cells, pacritinib inhibited JAK2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 and significantly suppressed alloreactive T cell proliferation (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-2mediated STAT5 signal transduction, required by Treg and CTL alike, was largely preserved among T cells exposed to pacritinib (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JAK2 inhibition of human T cells directed robust Th2 polarization and significantly decreased Th1 and Th17 differentiation (Fig 5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib also suppressed lymphocyte production of IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, and TNF-alpha (26) (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated in rodents (14), both pacritinib and ruxolitinib reduced IFN-mediated signaling in human T cells (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pacritinib_Permits_the_Differentiation_of_Suppressive_Human-Induced_Treg  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD4+ T cells were purified, depleted of natural Tregs as previously described ( greater than 99% non-Treg), and stimulated with allogeneic, cytokine-matured DCs for 5 d with pacritinib or DMSO added once on day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced Treg (iTreg) differentiation was similar following DC allostimulation, regardless of pacritinib treatment (Fig 5 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, pacritinib significantly increased the ratio of iTreg to activated conventional T cells (Tconv) compared with DMSO (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suppressive potency of pacritinib- or DMSO-pretreated iTregs was similar, suggesting that JAK2 is not required for human iTreg function (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pacritinib_Reduces_Xenograft_Rejection_but_Maintains_CD8+_CTL_Activity_Against_Tumor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The immune-suppressive effect of pacritinib on human T cells was tested in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunodeficient nonobese diabetic-scid gamma-deficient (NSG) mice received a dorsally positioned, 1-cm2, split-thickness human skin graft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 30-d rest period, 5 Ã— 106 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), allogeneic to the skin donor, were injected into the mouse (18, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice received pacritinib (100 mg/kg) or vehicle twice a day by oral gavage from day 0 until day +14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib significantly delayed skin graft rejection by allogeneic T cells compared with vehicle (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin xenografts from pacritinib-treated mice therefore exhibited significantly less pathologic rejection at day +21 (Fig 6 C and D), compared with the vehicle-treated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry analysis suggested a modest reduction in Th1 cells (CD4+, T-BET+) in the skin of pacritinib-treated mice (Fig 6 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an established method to generate human antitumor CTL in vivo and then tested specific killing by the T cells in vitro (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSG mice received human PBMCs (30 Ã— 106) and were inoculated with irradiated U937 cells (10 Ã— 106) on days 0 and +7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with pacritinib, ruxolitinib [30 mg/kg twice a day (4)], or vehicle as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human CD8+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of euthanized recipients during days +1012 and cultured against fresh U937 target cells without further drug exposure in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ruxolitinib significantly impaired antitumor activity, while CTL function was preserved among mice treated with pacritinib or vehicle controls (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While it is known that JAK2 inhibition spares Tregs and reduces Th1 responses (3, 18), we demonstrate that genetic ablation of JAK2 on donor T cells or treatment with pacritinib significantly enhances Th2 differentiation after allo-HCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies to modulate Th2 over Th1 have proven effective in reducing GVHD lethality in rodents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-18 promotes STAT6-dependent Th2 polarization, suppresses Th1 cells, and reduces GVHD yet spares GVL (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th2 cells are also required for myeloid-derived suppressor-cellmediated immune suppression and GVHD prevention (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the GVHD biomarker, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), orchestrates alloreactivity in part by binding IL-33 and preventing Th2 differentiation (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we surmise that Th2 polarization contributes to the immune suppressive activity of JAK2 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recipients of JAK2/ T cells had longer survival, higher body weights, and less GVHD pathology compared with WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed significantly less Th1 differentiation and CXCR3 expression among JAK2/ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, JAK2/ donor T cells had reduced expression of the 47 integrin that is required for gut homing by Th1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that targeting JAK2 may reduce GVHD in part by limiting Th1 differentiation and the migratory capacity of alloreactive T cells (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Species-specific immune effects were observed among the murine GVHD experiments compared with the human in vitro and xenogeneic tissue rejection experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib significantly reduced human Th17 differentiation, which is similar to the published results using the JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 (3, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, recipients of JAK2/ T cells and those treated with pacritinib exhibited moderately increased Th17 cells after allo-HCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is distinct from STAT3 KO donor T cells, which result in reduced Th17 differentiation in transplanted mice (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF can promiscuously activate STAT3 in T cells to facilitate murine Th17 development (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of JAK2 countered by STAT3 activity via alternative pathways may enhance Th17 differentiation in mice but not humans due to the species-specific effects of TGF (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the observation that JAK2/ T cells exhibited significant Treg differentiation compared with WT controls, which may serve as a source of TGF in vivo (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro human data demonstrated that JAK2 inhibition with pacritinib spared Treg differentiation, but did not increase the amount of Tregs compared with controls (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the ratio of Tregs to activated Tconv was increased with pacritinib (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important limitation of these data is that pacritinib is a multikinase inhibitor with effects on pathways potentially relevant to GVHD (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib potently inhibits JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1, TNK1, ROS, and HIPK (IC50 less_than 50 nM) and also has activity against JAK3 and TYK2 (IC50 50100 nM) in the JAK-STAT system (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such activity by pacritinib may be important to differences seen between JAK2/ T cells and the studies using pacritinib as a JAK2 inhibitor in GVHD prevention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the anti-JAK3 activity of pacritinib did not prevent IL-2mediated phosphorylation of STAT5, which is required by Tregs and CTL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyk2 and JAK2 regulate p40 cytokine receptor signal transduction (36), and Tyk2 inhibition by pacritinib might also impact Th1 and Th17 differentiation beyond the effects of the JAK2 blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, suppression of IRAK1 and IL-1 receptor activity may modulate donor alloresponses (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, ruxolitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2 equally (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ruxolitinib is known to suppress STAT5 phosphorylation in human T cells and NK cells via JAK1 inhibition (15, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others and we show that ruxolitinib, as opposed to pacritinib, significantly impairs human CTL function (15), although this is not observed among murine T cells in vivo (Fig S6 AC) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that human and mouse T cells have a somewhat different sensitivity to Jak inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to ruxolitinib, we show that pacritinib also limits human NK-cell proliferation and function in vitro (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While pacritinib spares JAK1, we surmise that its effect on NK cells is due to suppression of Tyk2 and impaired IL-12 activity (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that pacritinib permits common gamma-chain cytokine signal transduction, such as IL-2, its effect on JAK3 does not explain the drugs inhibition of NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also support that ruxolitinib induces profound immune suppression compared with pacritinib, yet potentially at the cost of CTL function required for antitumor activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data support that neutralization or pharmacologic blockade of JAK2 with pacritinib preserves donor T cell-mediated GVL activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that targeting JAK2, but sparing JAK1, with agents such as pacritinib is sufficient to control alloreactivity without impairing normal T-effector and Treg function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phase I/II acute GVHD prevention trial combining pacritinib with standard immune suppression after allo-HCT is actively being investigated (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02891603).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, such an approach has direct translational implications in GVHD and solid organ rejection prophylaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

C57BL/6 (B6; H-2b), B6.Ly5.1 (H-2b), BALB/b (H2b), BALB/c (H2d), and (B6 Ã— DBA2)F1 (H2b/d) mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with a conditional KO of JAK2 on the T cell lineage were generated by breeding JAK2fl/fl [provided by K. U. Wagner, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE (39)] with CD4-Cre (purchased from Taconic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSG mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of the NSG mice that were housed at the Moffitt Cancer Center, all other animals were housed at the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care-accredited Animal Resource Center at the Medical University of South Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were treated in adherence with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and their respective protocols approved by local institutional animal care and use committees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Murine_GVHD_and_Bioluminescent_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lethally irradiated BALB/c (MHC-mismatched) or BALB/b (MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched) mice received 5 Ã— 106 TCD-BM alone or plus 1 Ã— 106 (BALB/c) or 3 Ã— 106 (BALB/b) T cells from WT B6 or JAK2 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recipient body weight and survival were assessed twice weekly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GVHD pathology scores were assessed in a blinded fashion by an independent pathologist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where indicated, B6.Ly5.1+ TCD-BM and B6.Ly5.2+ WT and JAK2 KO T cells were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GVL experiments, BALB/c recipients received TCD-BM alone, TCD-BM with 2 Ã— 103 luciferase-transduced A20, or TCD-BM plus WT B6 or JAK2 KO T cells and luciferase-transduced A20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B6 Ã— DBA2)F1 mice received TCD-BM alone, TCD-BM with 5 Ã— 103 luciferase-transduced P815 tumor cells, or 3 Ã— 106 WT B6 T cells and luciferase-transduced P815 tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was performed as previously described (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated, pacritinib or its vehicle control were administered at 25100 mg/kg by oral gavage daily from day 0 for 3 wk after BMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where indicated, ruxolitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor control) was given at 30 mg/kg twice a day by oral gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Xenograft_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NSG mice (male or female, 624 wk old) received a 1-cm2 split thickness human skin graft under anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consent was obtained from eligible patients undergoing mastectomy, and their skin was collected in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol at the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC 17634).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bandage and sutures were removed after 710 d. Thirty days later, recipient mice then received 5 Ã— 106 fresh, human PBMCs (OneBlood) i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  using a random donor allogeneic to the skin graft (18, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each transplant experiment used a unique donor pair of skin and PBMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pacritinib 100 mg/kg or vehicle was given by oral gavage twice a day from day 0 until day +14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin grafts were followed closely for signs of rejection, such as ulceration, necrosis, or scabbing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin grafts that were  greater than 75% nonviable were considered rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathologic skin rejection grading was performed according to criteria set forth by Bejarano et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue samples were prepared, stained (Ventana Medical Systems), and imaged (Vista) as previously described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparisons of independent murine data, the two-tailed Students t test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparisons of dependent human data, the two-tailed paired t test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MannWhitney test was used for comparisons of nonparametric data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANOVA was used for group comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The log-rank test was used to analyze GVHD and skin graft survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
