title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate and topography control the size and flux of sediment produced on steep mountain slopes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rivers carve through landscapes using sediment produced on hillslopes by biological, chemical, and physical weathering of underlying bedrock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the size and supply rate of sediment influence the pace of river incision and landscape evolution, but the connections remain poorly understood, because the size distributions of sediment supplied from slopes have been difficult to quantify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study combined existing sediment-tracing techniques in a previously unidentified approach to quantify sediment production across an alpine catchment in the High Sierra, California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that colder, steeper, and less vegetated slopes produce coarser sediment that erodes faster into the channel network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the sediment-tracing approach can be used to quantify feedbacks between climate, topography, and erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Weathering on mountain slopes converts rock to sediment that erodes into channels and thus provides streams with tools for incision into bedrock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the size and flux of sediment from slopes can influence channel incision, making sediment production and erosion central to the interplay of climate and tectonics in landscape evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although erosion rates are commonly measured using cosmogenic nuclides, there has been no complementary way to quantify how sediment size varies across slopes where the sediment is produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how this limitation can be overcome using a combination of apatite helium ages and cosmogenic nuclides measured in multiple sizes of stream sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the approach to a catchment underlain by granodiorite bedrock on the eastern flanks of the High Sierra, in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that higher-elevation slopes, which are steeper, colder, and less vegetated, are producing coarser sediment that erodes faster into the channel network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that both the size and flux of sediment from slopes to channels are governed by altitudinal variations in climate, vegetation, and topography across the catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By quantifying spatial variations in the sizes of sediment produced by weathering, this analysis enables new understanding of sediment supply in feedbacks between climate, tectonics, and mountain landscape evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tracking_Multiple_Sediment_Sizes_in_a_Steep_Catchment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our approach exploits two widely used sediment tracing tools: detrital thermochronometry, which identifies the elevations of hillslopes where sediment was produced by weathering of underlying bedrock (2427), and cosmogenic nuclides in stream sediment, which reflect the erosion rate of the sediment averaged over the hillslopes where particles in the sample were produced (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas detrital thermochronometry can be used to quantify spatial variations in sediment production, cosmogenic nuclides in detrital minerals can be used to quantify spatially averaged erosion rates of sediment contributing areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detrital thermochronometry is well illustrated at Inyo Creek, which drains the eastern flanks of the High Sierra (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across catchment slopes, apatite helium ages in bedrock increase with elevation (24), from 20 My near the catchment mouth to 70 My at the summit of Lone Pine Peak (Fig 1, SI Appendix, and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sediment collected from the creek should have apatite helium ages that reveal the relative contributions of different elevations to the sediment flux at the sampling point (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the reference case of uniform sediment production and erosion, each point on the landscape is equally prone to producing a sediment particle and delivering it to the creek (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, the measured age distribution in creek bed sediment should be similar in shape to the age distribution in underlying bedrock (2427, 29, 30), calculated by combining the catchments elevation distribution with its ageelevation relationship (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any inconsistencies between the age distributions of sediment and bedrock delimit elevations that differ from the reference case of spatially uniform sediment production and delivery to the creek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cosmogenic nuclides serve as tracers of erosion because they accumulate in minerals in the uppermost few meters of rock and soil during exhumation to the landscape surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in eroded sediment reflects the erosion rate of the sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slower erosion yields higher nuclide concentrations, because minerals spend more time near the surface interacting with cosmic radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixtures of minerals from areas with different erosion rates should reflect the spatially averaged erosion rate of the combined area, because each point on the landscape sheds minerals and thus nuclides in proportion to its erosion rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, minerals in sediment delivered to a creek should have an average nuclide concentration that reflects the average erosion rate of the sediment contributing area (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it has not been previously recognized in the literature, erosion rate information from cosmogenic nuclides in multiple sediment sizes can be combined with sediment source information from detrital thermochronometry to quantify altitudinal variations in both the erosion rate and the size distribution of sediment particles across a catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of concept, we used data from two sediment sizes sampled from Inyo Creek at a point where the contributing area spans roughly 2 km of relief (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate and topography vary substantially with altitude across the catchment, allowing us to test mechanistic hypotheses about chemical, physical, and biological factors that influence sediment production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the lowest elevation at the catchment outlet to the highest at Lone Pine Peak, mean annual temperature decreases by nearly 12 Â°C, average precipitation increases by a factor of 3, the prevalence of steep slopes increases markedly, and desert scrub and conifers give way to barren alpine slopes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, higher elevations are colder, steeper, and less vegetated than lower elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the catchment has never been glaciated (24) and has three similar stocks of granodiorite bedrock (Dataset S2), thus minimizing the potentially confounding effects of glacial erosion and differences in lithology (31) in our study of climatic and topographic effects on sediment size and erosion rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The differences in climate, topography, and biota across the study catchment should drive altitudinal differences in chemical, biological, and physical weathering (1, 2, 4), which may, in turn, prompt spatial variations in both the size and flux of sediment eroded from slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that higher elevations are more strongly influenced by physical weathering and thus produce coarser sediment that erodes faster into the creek than lower elevations, where biological and chemical disaggregation of bedrock dominate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test our hypothesis, we collected very coarse gravel (3248 mm diameter) from Inyo Creek (Dataset S3) and measured apatite helium ages and cosmogenic 10Be in minerals separated from the sediment (SI Appendix and Datasets S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enables comparisons with previously measured apatite helium ages and cosmogenic 10Be (Datasets S5 and S6) from a sample of finer sediment (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial_Variations_in_Sediment_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By a variety of measures, the very coarse gravel has significantly older apatite helium ages than the finer sediment, indicating that it originated from higher in the catchment (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both a t test and a MannWhitney U test demonstrate that the gravels apatite is older than finer sediments apatite (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.00003, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant differences also emerge from KolmogorovSmirnov and Kuiper tests of the measured cumulative age distributions (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0023, respectively; SI Appendix and Dataset S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, HodgesLehmann estimators show that paired differences in ages between the gravel and finer sediment have a statistically significant median of 6.3 My and a 95% confidence interval for differences in inferred source elevations of 149404 m (median = 266 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are too large to be explained by any differences in the analytical procedures and sampling locations between this study and previous work (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explain the measured altitudinal differences in ages in terms of factors that might influence sediment production, we needed to first delimit the elevation ranges that exhibit exceedingly high and low production of gravel and finer sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our benchmark for comparison was the range of plausible measured age distributions in our creek bed samples under the reference condition that each point on the landscape is equally likely to contribute clasts to the creek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated plausible distributions for this reference case of uniform erosion using standard bootstrapping methodsi.e., by randomly sampling the bedrock elevation distribution 73 and 52 times, to simulate measured age distributions of gravel and finer sediment, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sampled elevation was assigned an age using the ageelevation relationship (Fig 1), and results were collapsed into an age distribution for each simulation of spatially uniform sediment production and erosion (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we repeated the simulations 30,000 times each and ranked the measured age distributions relative to the simulations at each elevation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptionally low or high percentile ranks, below 2.5 or above 97.5, imply that the measured difference from the median of simulations is unlikely to have arisen by chance when all points on the landscape are contributing equally to sediment in the creek (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we identified elevations over which we can be 95% confident that the contributions of the different sizes of sediment are high or low compared with a random sample reflecting uniform sediment production and erosion across the catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis indicates that the gravel is markedly underrepresented in the 2- to 2.35-km elevation band and overrepresented in the 2.6- to 2.75-km elevation band (Fig 3A) relative to the case of uniform erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference is especially pronounced in the lower band: Although it accounts for 15% of the catchment area, it produced just 1% of the gravel we sampled from the creek (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, finer sediment is markedly overrepresented in the 2.45- to 2.55-km elevation band and underrepresented in the 3.1- to 3.5-km elevation band relative to the median of the simulations (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the upper 30% of the catchment produced just 10% of the sampled finer sediment (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that production of the finer sediment is enhanced at lower elevations and inhibited at higher elevations (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, nearly half of the catchments elevation range exhibits positive or negative departures that lie outside the 95% confidence interval of the uniform erosion simulations for either the gravel or finer sediment (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, detrital thermochronometry reveals sharp contrasts in the erosional source elevations of the two sediment samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_Variations_in_Erosion_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements of cosmogenic nuclides reveal similarly sharp differences in the rates at which the different sizes of sediment have been shed from the slopes where they are produced to the sampling point in the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in quartz from the gravel and finer sediment are 1.01(Â±0.05) Ã 105 and 1.56(Â±0.01) Ã 105 atoms per gram, respectively (SI Appendix and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply two markedly different spatially averaged erosion rates for the catchment, according to conventional methods for interpreting detrital 10Be data (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy arises because the two sediment sizes represent erosion from different elevations of the catchment in different proportions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the 10Be results from Inyo Creek reveal a complication in interpreting cosmogenic nuclide data from sediment in steep landscapes: When eroded sediment size is spatially variable, any one size class of sediment considered in isolation can yield a distorted perspective on catchment-wide erosion rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancies between the age distributions of the gravel and finer sediment (Fig 2) show that similar errors can arise in studies of detrital thermochronometry (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We avoided some of the potential for misinterpretation of sediment tracing data by integrating the erosion rate information with the information on the sizes of sediment produced at different elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10Be data show that hillslopes are eroding faster at elevations where the coarser sediment is dominantly produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile the apatite helium ages clearly show that the coarser sediment was eroded from higher elevations, on average, than the finer sediment (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can interpret the 10Be and apatite helium data together to indicate that erosion rates increase with elevation across the catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this relationship more precisely, we used an optimization algorithm to search for the altitudinal gradient in erosion rates that best matches the measured 10Be concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach employs a forward model that expresses the catchment as a collection of points with elevations extracted from a 10-m digital elevation model (DEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apatite helium ages allow us to specify the elevation distribution of sediment production for gravel and finer sediment (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered four functions for the altitudinal increase in erosion rates: linear, exponential, power, and step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear, exponential, and power functions each have two adjustable parameters (a slope and an intercept), and the step function has three (a higher value, a lower value, and an elevation where it changes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each function, we adjusted the parameters incrementally, ran a forward model of sediment erosion for every parameter combination, and calculated a misfit for each model run as the sum of squared differences between predicted and observed 10Be concentrations in the sediment (see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter combination with the lowest misfit for each function was used to plot erosion rates versus elevation in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum misfits of the three functions are all similarly low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, without additional constraints from other sediment sizes, we cannot reliably identify which function agrees best with our observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the three best-fit functions in Fig 3C exhibit a common pattern: Erosion rates increase markedly with altitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the exponential function shows a fiftyfold increase from 0.03 mmy1 at the bottom of the catchment to 1.5 mmy1 at the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of detrital thermochronometry and cosmogenic nuclides reveals that both the size and flux of sediment vary markedly across Inyo Creek slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altitudinal increases in sediment size and erosion rates indicate that the catchment harbors considerable spatial variations in effectiveness of processes that break bedrock down and deliver it to channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variations likely arise due to altitudinal differences in topography and climate across the catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topography__Erosion_Rates__and_Sediment_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Average hillslope angle increases with altitude across most of the catchment (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the inferred altitudinal variations in erosion rates correlate strongly with topography for both the exponential and power-law functions (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends, together with the broad scatter in erosion rates at steep hillslope angles, match patterns observed in so-called threshold landscapes in previous studies of spatially averaged erosion rates from multiple catchments (17, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here they emerge from a single catchment, illustrating the power of using information from multiple sizes and multiple sediment tracing techniques to quantify spatial variations in the size and flux of sediment produced on slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Erosional processes are evidently wearing away slopes in catchment headwaters much faster than slopes near the outlet (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the trends quantified here reflect just a snapshot averaged over the 103- to 104-y timescales of the methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolated over the last several million years, the inferred spatial variations in erosion rates imply substantial headward erosion of the catchment into the low-relief surface of the High Sierra (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, the steepest slopes associated with the fastest erosion rates and coarsest sizes could have reached the modern catchment divide at Lone Pine Peak in just 24 My (SI Appendix), similar to the time elapsed since movement on the Sierra Nevada Frontal Fault accelerated base-level lowering of streams draining the range (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that the catchment itself (Fig 1) and the altitudinal trends in sediment size and flux (Fig 3) are all outcomes of a wave of differential erosion that has been propagating into the range since the Pliocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Connections between our results and the tectonics of the range are speculative, due to mismatches in timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the connections between topography and erosion rates are strong (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are also consistent with our hypothesis about altitudinal controls on weathering and erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they may help explain the altitudinal distribution of excesses and deficits in production of gravel and finer sediment across the catchment (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topography and erosion rates can regulate sediment size by influencing sediment residence times, with slower erosion on gentler slopes leading to longer exposure to weathering (3, 35) and thus finer sediment supplied to channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is consistent with the observed slower erosion and enhanced delivery of the finer sediment from lower, more gently sloped elevations at Inyo Creek (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bedrock_and_Sediment_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the mineralogy and geochemistry of the catchments three mapped bedrock units are similar enough to fall into the same granodiorite category, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the variations in sediment production are due to altitudinal differences in lithology (Fig 3E and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all three units have abundant biotite (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36 and SI Appendix), which is widely thought to drive granular disintegration in granitic bedrock (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the highest and lowest units, which dominate the catchment (Fig 3E), are similar in mineral size distribution (SI Appendix, Fig S3) even though the highest unit contains 10% K-feldspar megacrysts and the lowest unit contains none (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundant biotite and similarities in mineral size across the catchment may help explain why outcrops of the different bedrock units are similarly prone to rapid granular disintegration on slopes where climate is roughly the same (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can be reasonably certain that the deficit in fine sediment production at 3.13.5 km (Fig 3B) is not entirely due to an intrinsically lower weathering susceptibility in the highest bedrock unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the fact that the lowest bedrock unit breaks down into a wide range of sediment sizes, both on slopes and in the channel (SI Appendix, Fig S4), indicates that the deficit in gravel production at 22.35 km (Fig 3A) is not entirely due to an intrinsically higher weathering susceptibility in underlying bedrock at low elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we deduce that altitudinal differences in lithology are too small to fully explain the differences in erosion and weathering implied by the sediment tracing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may not be the case in other, more geologically diverse catchments; rock type can influence both ecosystems (31) and erosion rates (31, 38), and different lithologies can have differences in bedding, jointing, and tectonic deformation in the crust (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors could contribute to intrinsic differences in the sizes of sediment produced on slopes but do not appear to differ enough to drive the observed patterns in sediment production at Inyo Creek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Climate__Erosion_Rates__and_Sediment_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, differences in climate across the catchment are large and may play a significant role in the altitudinal distribution of excesses and deficits in the production of gravel and finer sediment (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the excess in gravel production from 2.6 km to 2.8 km (Fig 3A) corresponds to a decrease in biomass and an increase in the duration of frost cracking with elevation (Fig 3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slightly higher up, over the band of deficits in finer sediment from 3.1 km to 3.5 km (Fig 3B), slopes are steep (Fig 3D), erosion is fast (Fig 3C), biomass is negligible (Fig 3F), and the duration of frost cracking is long (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical weathering likely dominates over biological and chemical weathering across these elevations, enhancing production of coarse sediment and limiting production of fine sediment (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, both the deficit in gravel (Fig 3A) and excess in fine sediment (Fig 3B) span elevations with relatively gentle slopes (Fig 3D), slow erosion rates (Fig 3C), high biomass (Fig 3F), and negligible frost cracking (Fig 3G); chemical and biological weathering likely dominate over physical weathering processes, thus favoring production of fine sediment and inhibiting survival of coarse particles (Fig 5), consistent with the observed distributions of apatite helium ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chemical__Biological__and_Physical_Weathering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The connections shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35 are strong, but do not necessarily reflect causation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, they are consistent with the hypothesis that weathering shifts from dominantly biological and chemical near the catchment mouth to dominantly physical in the headwaters, due to altitudinal contrasts in climate and topography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low elevations, biological and chemical weathering are intense enough, or erosion is slow enough, and soil residence times are commensurately long enough, that coarse rock fragments readily break down to sand and fine gravel before they reach the channel (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, at higher elevations, where physical weathering processes such as frost cracking and rockfall dominate, bedrock shatters into coarser fragments that are delivered rapidly to channels across steep slopes without much additional breakdown (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of just two size classes yields a much richer understanding of sediment supply than one could obtain from either technique alone applied to a single sediment size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data should reveal whether sediment originates from events spanning only the elevations represented by the gravel and finer sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such spatially discrete sediment delivery (e.g., by landsliding) were responsible for the patterns in Fig 2, it would undermine our analysis of spatial variations in erosion rates (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3C and 4) but not our interpretations of altitudinal variations in sediment size (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3AB and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Apatite ages and cosmogenic nuclides from all size classes in the creek should provide a more comprehensive understanding of how size distributions and erosion rates of sediment vary with elevation across catchment slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should aid in deconvolving the effects of climate, vegetation, erosion, topography, and lithology on sediment production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimization algorithms similar to those used here will be vital to inferring altitudinal trends in sediment production that are internally consistent with all of the measured geochemical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With enough data, it should be possible to account for nonuniform distributions of bedrock apatite (27), deep landsliding (40, 41), wildfires (42), nonmonotonic relationships between age and elevation (25, 43), and other complications not present at Inyo Creek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it will be important to solve for size reduction during transport in catchments where sediment is weak or travel distances are long (6, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Inyo Creek, source bedrock is hard, travel distances are short, and we assume that size reduction during transport is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is conservative, relative to our conclusions about altitudinal increases in sediment size, because size reduction would be greater for the coarser particles that travel farther from higher elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our approach integrates over the timescales of sediment production and removal, which is less than 104 y due to fast erosion at Inyo Creek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a longer-term perspective, our approach could be applied to the archive of sediment in the debris fan at the catchment mouth (Fig 1) to quantify how climate change has influenced sediment production over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the effects to be significant, based on the strong climatic control on modern sediment production documented here (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study provides a framework for quantifying the climatic and geomorphic controls on the sizes of sediment produced on slopes and delivered to channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate and topography both appear to be important in the trends in sediment size across our study site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed altitudinal variations in sediment size and flux are robust, but it is difficult to differentiate climatic, topographic, and lithologic effects without data from more sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we cannot readily predict how sediment production varies with altitude in other catchments that harbor different relationships between altitude, slope, climate, and lithology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a more predictive understanding will be obtainable if the approach described here is applied across diverse climatic, lithologic, and tectonic settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, future applications of the approach will contribute to new process-based understanding of hillslope weathering and erosion in steep landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, will permit more mechanistic understanding of grain size variations in channel networks (9, 44) and thus reveal how geology, climate, and topography influence riverine habitats (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as shown here, our approach can improve understanding of the role of sediment supply in the feedbacks between climate, erosion, and tectonics that drive landscape evolution across sites where the origins of sediment can be traced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Inyo Creek, we found rare empirical support for the hypothesis that the sizes of eroded sediment are coupled to climate and topography through their effects on hillslope erosion, weathering, and sediment production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used standard techniques to isolate quartz and apatite from samples of sand and gravel collected from the active streambed in 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify (UTh)/He ages of apatite, we sent handpicked crystals to California Institute of Technology for analysis of 4He, U, Th, and Sm by noble gas mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify 10Be concentrations, we dissolved quartz, spiked it with 9Be, and extracted the Be for analysis of 10Be/9Be ratios by accelerator mass spectrometry at Purdue University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
