title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpected slowdown of US pollutant emission reduction in the past decade  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) have a large impact on air quality and climate change as precursors in the formation of ozone and secondary aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that NOx emissions have not been decreasing as expected in recent years (20112015) when comparing top-down estimates from satellites and surface NO2 measurements to the trends predicted from the US Environmental Protection Agencys emission inventory data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy can be explained by the growing relative contribution of industrial, area, and off-road mobile sources of emissions, decreasing relative contribution of on-road gasoline vehicles, and slower than expected decreases in on-road diesel NOx emissions, with implications for air-quality management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ground and satellite observations show that air pollution regulations in the United States (US) have resulted in substantial reductions in emissions and corresponding improvements in air quality over the last several decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large uncertainties remain in evaluating how recent regulations affect different emission sectors and pollutant trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a significant slowdown in decreasing US emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) for 20112015 using satellite and surface measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observed slowdown in emission reductions is significantly different from the trend expected using US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bottom-up inventories and impedes compliance with local and federal agency air-quality goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the difference between observations and EPAs NOx emission estimates could be explained by: (i) growing relative contributions of industrial, area, and off-road sources, (ii) decreasing relative contributions of on-road gasoline, and (iii) slower than expected decreases in on-road diesel emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison_of_Top-Down_and_Bottom-Up_Estimates_of_NOx_Emission_Changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a recent study, Miyazaki et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) estimated global NOx emissions in the period of 20052015 using multiple satellite measurements (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top-down NOx emissions were obtained using an ensemble Kalman filter, while improving the representation of the chemical system (e.g., NOx lifetime) affecting tropospheric NO2 by assimilating multiple chemical species including CO and O3 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A (green line) shows percent changes of the top-down anthropogenic NOx emissions (normalized at 2009), indicating a dramatic slowdown (76%) in US NOx emissions reduction from 7.0 ± 1.4%/y (20052009) to 1.7 ± 1.4%/y (20112015), as shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties represent 1  and include the error budget described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average top-down anthropogenic NOx emissions for the 11-y period are shown in Fig 2A, demonstrating the strongest emissions in the northeast United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 B and C shows the differences of top-down anthropogenic NOx emissions from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find pronounced changes in the reduction of anthropogenic NOx emissions for these two periods, throughout the continental contiguous United States (CONUS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparison, we evaluate EPAs bottom-up emission trends over the same time periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A (black solid line) shows percent changes of EPAs bottom-up emission estimates (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 1, trends of top-down anthropogenic NOx emission estimates (7.0 ± 1.4%/y) and EPAs emission estimates (6.4%/y) are consistent within the top-down uncertainty estimates in the period of 20052009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for 20112015, top-down (1.7 ± 1.4%/y) and bottom-up (5.3%/y) NOx emissions trends are inconsistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between the periods of 20052009 and 20112015, the slowdown predicted by the EPAs emissions is only 16%, from 6.4%/y to 5.3%/y, which is much smaller than the slowdown observed by the top-down estimates (76%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Changes_in_Tropospheric_Column_(Satellite)_and_Surface_NO2_Abundance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1B shows percent changes of the top-down anthropogenic NOx emissions and tropospheric OMI NO2 columns from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Dutch OMI NO2 (DOMINO), and Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) products (SI Appendix) over CONUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interannual variation of top-down NOx emissions generally follows the variation in OMI NO2 measurements as expected, since the OMI DOMINO product is included in the assimilated data (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since each point in Fig 1B represents an average over the CONUS for each year, the precision errors are relatively small; however, differences in the NASA, DOMINO, and BEHR products provide an estimate of the accuracy in tropospheric NO2 interannual variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 AF displays maps of the differences of mean tropospheric OMI NO2 columns from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015, respectively, for the different OMI data products, demonstrating a consistent slowdown of the reduction in tropospheric NO2 columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To corroborate the satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 columns, we perform a similar analysis using surface in situ AQS measurements (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 A and B shows the differences of mean surface NO2 concentrations, as measured by the AQS network, from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5A shows percent changes of the surface in situ AQS NO2 measurements and tropospheric OMI NO2 columns sampled at the times and locations of AQS measurements (based on monthly averages) over all CONUS AQS sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies (3, 13), the sampled OMI NO2 data demonstrate good agreement with AQS NO2 measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5 BD demonstrates agreement between AQS and OMI NO2 measurements within their uncertainties over three distinct US regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our analysis, the EPA Air Trend data (14) show a 42% slowdown of NO2 concentration reduction from 3.3%/y to 1.9%/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The similar slowdown of the reductions of observed NO2 abundances demonstrates the slowdown of estimated NOx emission reduction (6) is reasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the relation between changes in NOx emissions and NO2 abundances may be affected by the nonlinear chemistry (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent study, Jin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) indicated that some US megacities have changed from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to NOx limited in recent years, and thus, the same NOx emission reduction may result in slower reduction in NO2 abundance through an increase in NOx lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not expect a significant influence due to changes in urban NOx chemistry because the slowdown (Fig 3 AF) is observable throughout much of CONUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we tested the role of NOx emissions in controlling NO2 abundance with a sensitivity study where global surface NOx emissions were reduced by 20% compared with the standard simulation in the chemical atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) for study of atmospheric environment and radiative forcing (CHASER) for 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in a 1620% decrease in annual mean surface NO2 concentrations (SI Appendix, Fig S1), demonstrating that variations in NO2 abundances are dominated by changes in emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Changes_in_CO_Emissions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies (1, 18, 19) have demonstrated that a synthesis of NOx and CO measurements can provide an effective constraint on trends in anthropogenic emission inventories because both are coemitted byproducts of combustion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warneke et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) also showed that trends of VOCs found in gasoline are also highly correlated with trends in CO. Consequently, we also investigate the decadal variation of CO to evaluate the changes in anthropogenic NOx emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent study, Jiang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) constrained global CO emissions in the period of 20012015 using MOPITT CO measurements (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top-down CO emissions were obtained using a four-dimensional variational approach, and the role of long-range transport was accounted for by optimizing boundary conditions around the North American continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2D shows the 11-y averages of top-down anthropogenic CO emissions (7), excluding biomass burning and oxidation sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 E and F shows the differences of top-down anthropogenic CO emissions from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first period, 20052009, we observe a large decrease in both NOx and CO emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 G and H shows the differences of mean MOPITT surface layer CO mixing ratio, from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These show a similar slowdown of the decrease of CO mixing ratios in the most recent years, particularly over the northeast United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike OMI NO2 retrievals, MOPITT CO retrievals (even surface layer CO mixing ratio) are not an ideal proxy for local emissions, because of the longer CO lifetime (compared with NOx lifetime) and the coarse vertical resolution of MOPITT profile retrievals (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, SI Appendix, Fig S2C shows a significant reduction in top-down biomass burning CO emissions (7) in Mexico in the most recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These emissions influence CO concentrations in the southeast United States through regional transport, and explain the continued decrease of CO emissions in 20112015 for the southeast United States (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 C and D shows the differences of mean surface CO concentrations, as measured by the AQS network, from 20052006 to 20082009, and from 20112012 to 20142015, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 2, the trends in the MOPITT surface layer CO mixing ratio, AQS in situ CO measurements, and top-down US anthropogenic CO emission estimates from Jiang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) all exhibit similar slowdowns in reduction in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides NO2 and CO, AQS in situ O3 measurements over the eastern United States (Table 2) show a similar 75% slowdown of surface O3 concentration reduction from 1.6%/y to 0.4%/y, suggesting the importance of diminishing rates of decrease for anthropogenic CO, VOCs, and NOx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Revisions_to_Bottom-Up_Emission_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What are the potential explanations for this dramatic slowdown of reductions of US anthropogenic NOx and CO emissions in the recent years?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CO emissions, a slowdown in reductions is expected due to diminishing returns to improved three-way catalytic converters on gasoline engines (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past studies have shown that transportation emissions of CO are highly correlated with VOCs found in gasoline fuel and tailpipe exhaust (20, 22), implying that decreases in gasoline-related VOC emissions are also slowing down as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the slowdown in anthropogenic NOx emissions is surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the late 1990s, large decreases in NOx emissions were driven by efforts to regulate power plant emissions (23), fuel switching of electric power generation from coal to natural gas (24), and controls on transportation emissions (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 2005, stack monitors suggest that NOx emissions from power plants are still declining (SI Appendix, Table S1), tailpipe emission standards on light-duty gasoline vehicles have gotten stricter, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have begun to be installed on 2010 model year and later heavy-duty diesel trucks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, US NOx emissions are expected to decline at a similar rate in the 20112015 time period as during 20052009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows EPAs emissions trend report data across all anthropogenic sources (black solid line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To attain higher sectoral-level information, we substitute on-road emissions from the trends report with national-scale outputs from the EPA Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model, as well as utilize Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) data directly for electric power generation (black dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also propose three further modifications to help explain the observed NOx trend:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining these three modifications (green dashed line in Fig 1A) gives a slowdown with the reduction rate of NOx emissions from 6.7%/y for 20052009 to 2.9%/y for 20112015 (SI Appendix, Table S1), consistent with the observed slowdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above revisions to bottom-up emission estimates provide reasonable explanations for the observed slowdown of emission reduction at a national scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 5, we might expect regional variability in trends due to regional differences in air-quality management practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction rates of AQS surface in situ NO2 measurements are 4.1 ± 2.2%/y (20052009) and 3.9 ± 2.5%/y (20112015) for the southwest United States (particularly from California), suggesting relatively stable reductions in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the reduction rates of AQS surface in situ NO2 measurements are 7.8 ± 2.0%/y (20052009) and 2.6 ± 2.1%/y (20112015) for the northeast United States, and 6.7 ± 2.3%/y (20052009) and 0.1% ± 2.6%/y (20112015) for the southeast United States, indicating a dramatic slowdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to AQS measurements, the slowdown of emission reductions over the southwest US suggested by OMI tropospheric NO2 columns (e.g., NASA product sampled at AQS NO2 measurement locations and times in Fig 5) is also much weaker: the reduction rates are 8.6 ± 4.0%/y (20052009) and 5.6 ± 3.6%/y (20112015) over the southwest United States, compared with 10.2 ± 1.8%/y (20052009) and 3.2% ± 1.6%/y (20112015) over CONUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
California is expected to have more stringent emission regulations than other states of the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, California is accelerating the turnover of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet, such that by 2023, almost all truck and buses operating in the state will require a 2010 engine or later model year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other regions of the United States, there has been increasing scrutiny of glider-kit trucks, which are heavy-duty trucks with refurbished engines installed on a new chassis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, EPA suggests that NOx emissions from such glider-kit trucks significantly exceed the emission standards promulgated in 2010 (37), which could contribute to a slowdown in NOx emission reductions in regions where glider-kit trucks are operating in significant numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is also regional variability in trends of NOx emissions from energy generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stack monitors on power plants indicate that NOx emissions have consistently declined by 710% over the 20052009 and 20112015 time periods in the Northeast and Southeast regions, consistent with reporting under the Acid Rain Program and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the Southwest region, the decrease in power plant emissions of NOx has slowed from 20% in 20052009 to 8% in 20112015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some oil and natural gas basins, including in Texas and North Dakota, satellite NO2 columns have been shown to be increasing (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a synthesis of recently estimated top-down anthropogenic NOx and CO emissions from inverse analysis studies (6, 7), remotely sensed NO2 measurements from OMI, CO measurements from MOPITT, surface in situ NO2 and CO measurements from AQS, and emission estimation using fuel-based bottom-up methods, we evaluate trends in EPAs emission inventory data between 2005 and 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the larger European emission reduction as suggested by Grange et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10), we find an unexpected, significant slowdown in the reductions of US NOx and CO emissions in the most recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar slowdown of surface O3 concentration reduction suggests a potential important influence from variations in pollutant emissions on the formation of secondary pollutants, and consequent socioeconomic costs resulting from degraded air quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis suggests the slowdown in decreasing NOx emissions observed in 20112015 is mainly driven by the growing relative contribution of industrial, area, and off-road mobile sources of emissions, decreasing relative contribution of on-road gasoline vehicles, and slower than expected decreases in on-road diesel NOx emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the slowdown in decreasing CO emissions is likely due to diminishing returns from the large fraction of gasoline vehicles that have already significantly reduced CO emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this study demonstrates the large-scale effects of changing emission trends and identifies the likely causes of the observed slowdown in declining pollution trends, a more quantitative attribution of emission changes for NOx and CO and their subsequent effects on O3 and other air pollutants will require models and data with finer (e.g., urban and roadway environments) spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work highlights the importance of satellite and model inversion technologies to monitor changes in pollutant emissions and interpret the effects of regulations and economic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bottom-Up_NOx_Emission_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EPA inventory used in this study is from the Air Pollutant Emissions Trends Data downloaded at: https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/air-pollutant-emissions-trends-data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emissions are updated through the NEI 2014v1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better reconcile bottom-up emission inventories with top-down observations for NOx, we modify anthropogenic emissions only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we update electric power generation emissions with the latest CEMS data downloaded at: https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xing et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) outlined a fuel-based methodology to consistently estimate industrial, residential, and commercial fuel combustion emissions for long-term atmospheric modeling simulations (19902010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employ their approach here, and update energy use statistics through 2015 (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest decreases in industrial NOx emission factors occur before 2005 and are relatively constant thereafter (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We maintain this trend and hold NOx emission factors constant after 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other emissions associated with industrial processes are left unmodified from the EPA inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We revise mobile source emissions using a fuel-based approach for estimating both on-road (1, 25) and off-road engines (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, fuel-use statistics for on-road and off-road engines are available annually from the Federal Highway Administration and Energy Information Administration (4042).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission factors (in g/kg fuel) are based on a metaanalysis of roadway studies (1, 25), laboratory measurements of off-road gasoline engines (4345), and the EPA NONROAD model for off-road diesel engines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details about emission factors for on-road vehicles are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
