Socioecological transitions trigger fire regime shifts and modulate fireclimate interactions in the Sierra Nevada, USA, 16002015 CE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twenty-firstcentury climate change is projected to increase fire activity in California, but predictions are uncertain because humans can amplify or buffer fireclimate relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined a tree-ringbased fire history with 20th-century area burned data to show that large fire regime shifts during the past 415 y corresponded with socioecological change, and not climate variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate amplified large-scale fire activity after Native American depopulation reduced the buffering effect of Native American burns on fire spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from long-term temperature increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings highlight a need to enhance our understanding of humanfire interactions to improve the skill of future projections of fire driven by climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Large wildfires in California cause significant socioecological impacts, and half of the federal funds for fire suppression are spent each year in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future fire activity is projected to increase with climate change, but predictions are uncertain because humans can modulate or even override climatic effects on fire activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we test the hypothesis that changes in socioecological systems from the Native American to the current period drove shifts in fire activity and modulated fireclimate relationships in the Sierra Nevada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a 415-y record (16002015 CE) of fire activity by merging a tree-ringbased record of Sierra Nevada fire history with a 20th-century record based on annual area burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large shifts in the fire record corresponded with socioecological change, and not climate change, and socioecological conditions amplified and buffered fire response to climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire activity was highest and fireclimate relationships were strongest after Native American depopulationfollowing mission establishment (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1775 CE)reduced the self-limiting effect of Native American burns on fire spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the Gold Rush and Euro-American settlement (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1865 CE), fire activity declined, and the strong multidecadal relationship between temperature and fire decayed and then disappeared after implementation of fire suppression (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1904 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification and buffering of fireclimate relationships by humans underscores the need for parameterizing thresholds of human- vs. climate-driven fire activity to improve the skill and value of fireclimate models for addressing the increasing fire risk in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Summary information for fire history sites in lower montane forests in the Sierra Nevada, California  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fire index and climate in Sierra Nevada lower montane forests in the fire regime periods identified by the regime shift analysis and in socioecological periods identified in documentary records  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Variation in strength of firemoisture (60) relationships (i.e., PDSI) and population size of Native Americans (16) (triangle) and others (19) (circles) in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fire regime periods are indicated by shading as in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The r-values are 51-y running Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients of PDSI (inverted for presentation) and fire index is plotted on the 26th year of the window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance (P less_than 0.05, P less_than 0.01, P less_than 0.001) is shown by increasingly dark dashed lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regime-shift analysis of fire index time series that were based on a constant number of (pre-1908) fire-scar recording sites (9, 18, 24) over their entire length (16001907 CE, 16421907 CE, and 16861907 CE, respectively) and the 20th-century (19082015 CE) fire index record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change point for fire-regime shifts (P  0.1 for 16422015 CE and 16862015 CE; 0.15 for 16002015 CE) was identified by using a 30-y window following Rodionov (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color shading corresponds to the regime-shift periods detected by the analysis of the full 29-site record (Fig 2): 16001775 CE (green), 17761865 CE (orange), 18661903 CE (blue), and 19042015 CE (pink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regime-shift analysis of reconstructions of the Pacific North American Pattern (PNA) (61), El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (Niño3) (62), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A switch to a new regime is shown by the vertical line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change point (P less_than 0.05) was identified using a 30-y window following Rodionov (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regime-shift periods detected by the analysis of the fire record (Fig 2) are indicated by color shading: 16001775 CE (green), 17761865 CE (orange), 18661903 CE (blue), and 19042015 CE (pink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-correlation coefficients between reconstructions of fire index, summer moisture (i.e., PDSI) (60), and summer temperature (i.e., WNAT) (59) in lower montane forests in the Sierra Nevada for four fire-regime periods: 16001775 CE, 17761865 CE, 18661903 CE, and 19042015 CE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation coefficients were calculated for a 10-y period centered on the fire year (year 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The darker the dashed line, the greater the statistical significance (P less_than 0.05, P less_than 0.01, and P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEA of reconstructed summer moisture (i.e., PDSI) (60) and summer temperature (i.e., WNAT) (59) with high- and low-fire years in lower montane forests in the Sierra Nevada for three fire-regime periods: 16001775 CE, 17761865 CE, and 19042015 CE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fire-regime period 18661903 CE does not consist of sufficient years to warrant robust statistical results and was excluded from the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High- and low-fire years were defined as the 10th (circles) and 90th (triangles) percentile fire-index years in each fire-regime period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis window includes up to 6 y before and 4 y after each fire year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant (P less_than 0.05) values are shaded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interdecadal variation in mean 20-y nonoverlapping periods of summer temperature (i.e., WNAT) (59) and fire index, correlation between fire index and WNAT (gray fill), and predicted fire index from 20-y mean temperature (dashed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were smoothed with a 20-y cubic spline for presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fire-regime periods are indicated by shading as in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fire activity in Sierra Nevada lower montane forests during the past four centuries was estimated by using tree-ring records of fire (16001907 CE) and 20th-century area burned data (19082015 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wood samples with fire scars were collected from 29 sites on National Forest and National Park lands (Fig 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logging and wildfires eliminated the fire scar record in many areas, precluding a systematic sampling scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site elevation ranged from 1,136 to 2,437 m above sea level, and site collection areas ranged in size from 0.25 km2 to 26 km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each sample site, partial wood cross-sections with fire scars were removed from stumps, logs, or live trees with a chainsaw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An average of 67 (range, 10440) partial wood cross-sections was extracted per site from primarily (90%) ponderosa pine trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire dates in the wood samples were identified by cross-dating each samples tree-ring series by using standard techniques (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calendar year of each ring with a fire scar in it was then recorded as the fire year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An annual index of fire occurrence and extent (i.e., fire index) was calculated for each site by dividing the number of fire-scarred trees per year (with a minimum of two) by the number of trees potentially recording fire in that year (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The start and end dates of these site fire index time series were determined by a minimum of four samples capable of recording fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Sierra Nevada-wide fire index was then calculated as sum of the site indices per year divided by the number of sites recording fire in that year (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cutoff date of 1600 CE was chosen for the fire regime-shift analysis to ensure a minimum sample of recording sites (n = 9, 25%; Fig 2), a percentage sufficient to characterize fire regimes in frequent-fire forests (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Documentary records were used to develop the fire index for years after 1907.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Area burned data for fires 40 ha in Sierra Nevada lower montane forests were selected from the interagency California digital database for the years 19082015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data before 1908 were not used because they are less reliable (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Index values were then calculated by dividing the area burned per year by the total area burned in all years (19082015 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire index values for the pre-1908 (i.e., fire-scar based) and post-1908 (i.e., area-based) periods were then merged to develop a continuous record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in the fire index time series that signify a regime shift were identified by using the method developed by Rodionov (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regime-shift detection is based on sequential t tests, and a regime-shift change is identified when the cumulative sum of normalized deviations from the mean value of a new regime is different from the mean of the current regime (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cutoff length of 30 y and a change point level of P  0.05 were used to identify regime shifts, except for the individual analysis of the shorter 19002015 CE fire index time series, for which a cutoff length of 15 y and a change point level of P  0.1 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same procedures were used to identify regime shifts for proxies of (i) western North American summer temperature (WNAT) (59), (ii) summer moisture [Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for grid points 35 and 47) (60), (iii) winter Pacific-North American circulation pattern (61), (iv) winter Niño 3.4 index (62), and (v) annual Pacific Decadal Oscillation (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the regime shifts detected in the pre20th-century fire index time series (16001907 CE) were not influenced by changes over time in the number of sites recording fire, we also conducted regime-shift analyses on fire index time series with a constant number of recording sites over time (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we developed fire index time series (as described earlier) based on only the nine sites (18, 24) that were recording fire since 1600 CE (1642 and 1686, respectively) and the 20th-century area-based fire index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fire index time series were therefore based on a constant number of recording sites (9, 18, 24) during the pre-1908 section of their time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation analysis, ANOVA, and graphical analysis were used to characterize fireclimate relationships in periods with different fire regimes and SESs (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for differences in mean climate conditions among fire regimes and SESs by using ANOVA and a Tukeys post hoc test (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-correlation functions (CCF) and superposed epoch analyses (SEA) (65) were calculated to identify interannual fireclimate associations for the fire year and for lagged-years PDSI and WNAT (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before calculating correlation coefficients, we removed serial autocorrelation by using autocorrelation functions and autoregressive moving average models (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCF and SEA were calculated for periods of different lengths identified by the regime-shift analysis and for the entire fire record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate how interannual fireclimate relationships varied over time, we calculated 51-y running correlations between climate variables and fire index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to identify the influence of interdecadal climate variation on the fire index over time, we calculated the averages of the fire index and climate for 20-year nonoverlapping periods and calculated correlation coefficients (26, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relationship between 20-y averages of z-scores for the fire index and WNAT from 1600 to 1859 (n = 13) was assessed using a simple linear-regression model (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was then used to predict the fire index for 16002015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
