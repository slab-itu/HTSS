Polyclonal breast cancer metastases arise from collective dissemination of keratin 14-expressing tumor cell clusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conventional models of cancer progression propose that single cells leave the primary tumor, enter the circulation, and seed clonal metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, metastases can contain multiple clones, raising the question: How do polyclonal metastases form?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that cancer cells seed distant organs as cohesive clusters, composed of two molecularly distinct subpopulations, whose proportions vary systematically during metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We establish that collective dissemination is a frequent mechanism for metastasis and identify a molecular program in the most invasive, keratin 14+ (K14+) cancer cells, regulating cellcell adhesion, cellmatrix adhesion, and immune evasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that this metastatic phenotype is dependent upon K14 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the molecular basis of collective dissemination may therefore enable novel prognostics and therapies to improve patient outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent genomic studies challenge the conventional model that each metastasis must arise from a single tumor cell and instead reveal that metastases can be composed of multiple genetically distinct clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intriguing observations raise the question: How do polyclonal metastases emerge from the primary tumor?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used multicolor lineage tracing to demonstrate that polyclonal seeding by cell clusters is a frequent mechanism in a common mouse model of breast cancer, accounting for  greater than 90% of metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We directly observed multicolored tumor cell clusters across major stages of metastasis, including collective invasion, local dissemination, intravascular emboli, circulating tumor cell clusters, and micrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally aggregating tumor cells into clusters induced a  greater than 15-fold increase in colony formation ex vivo and a  greater than 100-fold increase in metastasis formation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, locally disseminated clusters, circulating tumor cell clusters, and lung micrometastases frequently expressed the epithelial cytoskeletal protein, keratin 14 (K14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq analysis revealed that K14+ cells were enriched for desmosome and hemidesmosome adhesion complex genes, and were depleted for MHC class II genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of K14 expression abrogated distant metastases and disrupted expression of multiple metastasis effectors, including Tenascin C (Tnc), Jagged1 (Jag1), and Epiregulin (Ereg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings reveal K14 as a key regulator of metastasis and establish the concept that K14+ epithelial tumor cell clusters disseminate collectively to colonize distant organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Multicolor_Fluorescent_Lineage_Tracing_Identifies_Frequent_Polyclonal_Metastasis_in_a_Mouse_Model_of_Breast_Cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define the clonal origin of metastasis in a model of collective invasion, we developed a multicolor lineage-tracing strategy in a commonly used mouse model of breast cancer, MMTV-PyMT, which has provided fundamental insights into diverse aspects of metastatic progression (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the MMTV promoter drives mammary epithelial expression of the polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT), a potent activator of PI3K signaling, a hallmark of human breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mammary tumors formed in this model show gene expression most similar to luminal B, an aggressive subtype of human breast cancer prone to metastasis (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We generated a convertible double-fluorescent mammary tumor model, ROSAmT/mG;MMTV-PyMT, in which tumor cells express membrane-localized tdTomato (mTomato) and, upon treatment with adenoviral Cre recombinase (adeno-Cre), switch heritably to expression of membrane-localized enhanced GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROSAmT/mG;MMTV-PyMT tumor organoids were treated with adeno-Cre to generate a mixture of red and green cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosaic organoids were then injected orthotopically into the cleared mammary fat pad of nonfluorescent host mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the host is nonfluorescent, this experimental system enabled us to unambiguously identify tumor metastases and their clonal origin (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principle of this strategy is that if there is an obligate single-cell intermediate during the metastatic process, we would expect to see a transition from a multicolored primary tumor (red and green) to singly red or green metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the lungs of these mice, we detected single disseminated tumor cells, micrometastases (250 cells), and macrometastases ( greater than 50 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single disseminated tumor cells were 47-fold more frequent than metastases (range 10- to 150-fold, n = 10 mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that if lung metastases arose exclusively from seeding of single disseminated tumor cells, then each lung metastasis should express only one color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, multicellular seeding should be able to produce metastases with both colors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed lung metastases composed of both red and green tumor cells across a range of sizes, from 2 cells to  greater than 1,000 cells per metastasis (Fig 1B) (n = 375 multicolored metastases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multicolored metastases demonstrated significant intermixing of red and green tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplanted mice showed wide variation in the percentage of multicolored metastases from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 61% (n = 158 multicolored out of 257 metastases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data show that multicolored metastases can occur frequently in the MMTV-PyMT model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand our variable frequency of detection of multicolored metastases, we analyzed the degree of mixing of red and green tumor cell clones at each step in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas red and green tumor cells were well mixed in the recombined tumor organoids used as input (Fig 1C), the tumors that resulted from transplanting these organoids showed surprisingly wide variation in the mixing of red and green tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed tumors composed almost entirely of a single color to tumors with significant intermixing of red and green zones (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze this variation further, we quantified the local mixing of red and green cells within each tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local mixing was assessed in 100 × 100-pixel (1.3 mm × 1.3 mm) regions tiled across the tumor by calculating the probability of selecting two colors when pixel values were chosen at random within each region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a strong linear correlation between the extent of local mixing and the percentage of detected multicolored metastases (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, local proximity between clones of different colors in the primary tumor determines our ability to detect multicolored metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our analysis of the relationship between local mixing and the detection of multicolored metastases (Fig 1E), we estimate that  greater than 97% of metastases were formed from multicellular seeds (95% confidence interval 74100%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also determined the frequency of multicolored metastases in two additional transplant models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MMTV-PyMT tumors expressing the Confetti lineage reporter (Fig S1A), tumor cells are induced by adeno-Cre to one of five distinct possible colors: cytoplasmic red fluorescent protein (RFP), cytoplasmic yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), nuclear GFP (nGFP), membrane cyan fluorescent protein (mCFP), or an unrecombined no-color (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed zonal patches of a single color in the primary tumor, with a clear preference for the unrecombined no-color (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with this limitation, we observed lung metastases composed of both no-color and RFP+ tumor cells (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MMTV-PyMT tumors expressing the Rainbow reporter (Fig S1D), adeno-Cre induces recombination to one of 21 different color values (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the increased color diversity, we similarly observed zonal patches of a single color in the primary tumor, with preference for a no-color tumor cell (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lungs of these mice, we observed multiple metastases composed of one to four different colors (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, data from three distinct lineage analyses reveal polyclonal metastases in this genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Polyclonal_Lung_Metastases_Arise_from_Multicellular_Seeds_and_Not_by_Serial_Seeding_of_Single_Tumor_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multicolored metastases that we observed could arise via the serial seeding of single tumor cells or via colonization by a multicellular cluster of tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to distinguish these mechanisms in two different ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model stochastic serial seeding events integrated over time, we first isolated organoids from different MMTV-PyMT tumors that constitutively expressed either mTomato or CFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then transplanted mTomato+ tumor organoids to the right flank and CFP+ tumor organoids to the left flank of a nonfluorescent host (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed a small degree of colonization of CFP+ primary tumors by mTomato+ cancer cells, accounting for 15% of the total tumor area, determined macroscopically in 5 of 11 mice (Fig S2B, Lower, and Fig S2 C and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the reported ability of metastases to reseed primary tumors, termed tumor self-seeding (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when we examined the clonal composition in the lungs, we only observed single-colored metastases (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data establish that polyclonal metastases do not efficiently arise from serial seeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To extend this finding, we modeled serial seeding by waves of disseminated tumor cells in the bloodstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this second experimental approach, we transplanted mTomato+ and CFP+ tumor cells serially via tail-vein injection (Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTomato+ tumor cells were isolated by FACS and then injected as a single-cell suspension into a nonfluorescent host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days later, CFP+ tumor cells were isolated by FACS and injected as a single-cell suspension into the same mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks later, lungs were collected and analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lung, we observed exclusively single-colored metastases (Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, serial delivery of cancer cells to the lungs was not an efficient mechanism for generation of polyclonal metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with a recent study revealing metastases from oligoclonal clusters in breast cancer cell lines (5), our data are most consistent with a model in which polyclonal metastases occur via colonization by multicellular seeds rather than serial arrival and aggregation of single tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_Observation_of_Polyclonal_Collective_Invasion__Polyclonal_Disseminated_Tumor_Emboli__and_Polyclonal_CTC_Clusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having shown that polyclonal metastases arise from multicellular seeding, we next asked how multicellular seeds emerge from the primary tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we identified tumor cell clusters across stages of metastasis, starting from collective invasion at the primary tumor stromal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our local mixing analysis (Fig 1 D and E), when we imaged at single-cell resolution, transplanted tumors were composed of zonal patches and collective invasion strands were typically composed of a single color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this technical barrier to detection of polyclonal groups, we observed multicolored collective invasion at interfaces between regions of red and green cancer cells (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these regions, we reasoned that there were two outcomes at the tumorstromal interface corresponding to two distinct models for the collective invasive-disseminative transition (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that tumor cells invade collectively but that dissemination occurs obligately through single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, because disseminated clusters should arise only from focal proliferation of single cells, disseminated clusters should be exclusively composed of singly red or green tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, cancer cells could both invade and disseminate collectively as multicellular units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we would expect to identify multicolored disseminated clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To distinguish these possibilities, we analyzed disseminated tumor cell clusters at three different stages of the metastatic sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we observed multicolored disseminated tumor cell clusters 200-m away from the tumorstromal interface, which we confirmed were fully disconnected from the primary tumor by 3D reconstruction (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined the adjacent vasculature at the tumorstromal interface (Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed both multicolored tumor microemboli and tumor macroemboli composed of  greater than 100 tumor cells within vessels (Fig 2D and Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their collective organization, we observed membrane-localized E-cadherin in collectively invading cancer cells, locally disseminated clusters, and tumor emboli (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of concept, we next isolated CTCs from the systemic circulation of a mouse bearing fluorescently labeled tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this tumor had quite limited local mixing of blue and red clones, we identified both a multicolored and multiple singly colored CTC clusters (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed CTC cluster size in three mice and found that they ranged from 2 to 66 cells per cluster, with a median of 6 cells (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking these data together, our lineage-tracing studies enabled us to observe multicolored tumor cell clusters at five different stages of metastasis: collective invasion, locally disseminated clusters in the adjacent stroma, intravasated tumor emboli, CTC clusters, and distant micro- and macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregating_Tumor_Cells_into_Clusters_Promotes_Colony_Formation_ex_Vivo_and_Lung_Metastatic_Colonization_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important question raised by these experiments is: Why are multicellular seeds advantageous for metastatic colonization?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This question is interesting because tumor cells typically maintain extensive cellcell contacts in vivo, and the organization of epithelial cells into cohesive clusters promotes tissue growth in a variety of normal and tumor contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, doublets of Paneth and Lgr5+ stem cells enhance the organoid-forming potential of single Lgr5+ stem cells (19), whereas the survival of colonic tumor organoids is dependent on retaining E-cadherin contacts (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model the colonization efficiency of multicellular seeding, we developed an experimental system to aggregate single tumor cells into cell clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we isolated FACs-sorted single mTomato+ MMTV-PyMT tumor cells and incubated them overnight in a nonadherent dish to form cell clusters (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overnight incubation increased the median number of cell clusters by  greater than 15-fold relative to the input single cells (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumor cell clusters that resulted had a median size of 2 cells, and ranged from 2 to 60 cells in size (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, coincubation of red and green tumor cells confirmed that clusters were generated by aggregation rather than by clonal expansion of single tumor cells (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the experimentally determined percentages of multicolored clusters as a function of cluster size matched the predicted percentages, assuming random assortment of red and green tumor cells into clusters (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation in a nonadherent dish therefore induces the efficient aggregation of single cancer cells into clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used this approach to compare the efficiency of colony formation by single cells or aggregated clusters, while holding the total cell number constant in each condition at 10,000 cells per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each cluster is formed from multiple cells, the total number of starting seeds is lower in the aggregated condition compared with the single cell condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this disadvantage, when cultured in 3D Matrigel, we observed that clusters were  greater than 15-fold more efficient at forming colonies compared with single tumor cells (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in an ex vivo setting, cluster organization strongly enhances colony formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess metastatic efficiency in vivo, we next injected into the tail veins of nonfluorescent host mice either a single-cell suspension of mTomato+ tumor cells or an equal number of mTomato+ tumor cells that had been aggregated into clusters in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed lung metastatic burden at 3 wk (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell suspensions generated zero to one metastases per mouse (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, aggregated clusters generated many large macroscopic mTomato+ metastases with  greater than 100-fold increase in metastatic efficiency relative to single cells (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that cluster organization is sufficient to significantly enhance tumor cell survival and promote metastasis formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Locally_Disseminated_Tumor_Cell_Clusters__CTC_Clusters__and_Micrometastases_Are_Enriched_for_K14+_Cells__Relative_to_Macrometastases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the frequency of polyclonal metastases and the efficiency of metastasis formation by multicellular seeding, we next sought to determine the molecular characteristics of the multicellular seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MMTV-PyMT tumors, K14+ cells account for 2% of the total tumor cell population (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These K14+ tumor cells lead  greater than 88% of collective invasion strands extending into the surrounding stroma (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the pioneer function of K14+ cells during metastasis, we observed K14+ cells in polyclonal collective invasion, disseminated tumor cell clusters, and intravascular emboli (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed significant differences in K14 expression between single cells and disseminated clusters, with 2% and 59% expressing K14, respectively (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed that 94% of CTC clusters contained K14+ cells (n = 15 of 16 CTC clusters) (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of cells within the cluster that were K14+ decreased as the size of the cluster increased (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data therefore show that K14+ cells are enriched in the dissemination stages of metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In lung metastases, the proportion of K14+ cells relative to the total cell number varied systematically with the size of the metastasis (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the primary tumor, micrometastases, and macrometastases, K14+ cells accounted for 0.9%,  greater than 50%, and 2.5% of cells, respectively (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, K14+ cells are highly enriched in locally disseminated clusters, CTC clusters, and micrometastases relative to their frequency in the primary tumor, and the proportion of K14+ cells reverts to baseline in macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model these transitions in 3D culture, we next isolated single K14 and K14+ cells by FACS from MMTV-PyMT tumors that genetically encode for a fluorescent biosensor for K14 expression (Fig 4D and Fig S5C) (11, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we observed that for individually purified K14 and K14+ populations, colony formation was  greater than 16-fold higher in aggregated clusters relative to single tumor cells (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, colony formation was not significantly different for K14 single cells versus K14+ single cells, or for K14 aggregated cells versus K14+ aggregated clusters (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data reveal that the difference in colony formation between K14 and K14+ cells is small relative to the difference between multicellular clusters and single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One interpretation of these data could be that the interaction of K14 and K14+ tumor cells may synergistically enhance the efficiency of colony formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivating this hypothesis, Wnt-driven murine mammary tumors contain two subclones that show interclonal cooperation during tumor progression (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the synergy hypothesis, we used our aggregation assay to test the effect of aggregating equal mixtures of K14 and K14+ cells (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mixing K14 and K14+ cells in aggregating clusters did not significantly enhance colony formation relative to either pure K14 or K14+ cell clusters (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternatively, phenotypic transitions between differentiation states could blunt our ability to detect differences in colony formation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined K14 expression in aggregated tumor cells at day 0, day 1 postaggregation (Fig S5D), and at day 8 (Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cell clusters at day 1 already contained mixtures of K14 and K14+ cells regardless of whether isolated K14 cells, K14+ cells, or mixtures of both cell types were used as input (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, at day 8,  greater than 80% of colonies were composed of mixtures of K14 and K14+ cells in each condition (Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically, small colonies were primarily composed of K14+ cells and larger colonies were composed of an inner core of K14 cells and an outer layer of K14+ cells (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordant with our observations of metastases in vivo, the proportion of K14+ cells varied with the size of clusters grown in 3D Matrigel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In small clusters, two to five cells in size, 100% of cells were K14+, and in larger clusters with 20 cells, all clusters contained multiple K14 cells (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, isolated K14 and K14+ cells converge toward cell colonies composed of both cell states, with K14+ cells predominant in small colonies in culture and in micrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, K14 cells are predominant in large colonies and in macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Transcriptional_Program_of_K14+_Tumor_Cells_Is_Enriched_for_Desmosome_and_Hemidesmosome_Adhesion_Complex_Genes__and_Depleted_for_Genes_Involved_in_MHC_Class_II_Immunosurveillance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the enrichment for K14+ cells in disseminated tumor cell clusters and micrometastases, we next asked how the transcriptional profiles of K14+ and K14 cells differed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we compared the transcriptomes of K14+ and K14 cells from primary MMTV-PyMT tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To focus our attention on changes in gene expression between cancer cell subpopulations, we first isolated epithelial organoids from the tumor and then used differential centrifugation to deplete immune and fibroblastic stromal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then processed these organoids to single cells and FACS-sorted them based on K14 status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the K14+ cell fraction exhibited  greater than 12-fold higher levels of K14 RNA expression (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our RNA-seq analysis revealed 239 genes differentially expressed between K14 and K14+ cells at a genome-wide significance level of P less_than 106 (mean-variance normalized heatmap in Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By DAVID gene ontology (GO) analysis (26), we identified significantly enriched GO categories in each cell subpopulation (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed significant enrichment for genes involved in extracellular matrix proteins, intermediate filament organization, and epithelial differentiation in K14+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, K14+ cells were enriched for transcripts encoding TNC, POSTN, and CTGF, proteins required in the metastatic niche (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, DAVID analysis revealed a number of genes involved in the regulation of the immune system that were significantly depleted in K14+ cells (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GO categories included immune response, MHC class II antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and genes involved in chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes involved in MHC class II presentation were among the most depleted in K14+ cells (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal that K14+ cells differ across multiple molecular programs that could be advantageous across distinct steps in metastasis, including immune evasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, two key features distinguishing K14+ cells from the bulk tumor cells are their increased expression of both cellcell and cellmatrix adhesion genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the extent to which the K14+ cell transcriptome correlated with stemness in three ways (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we looked at the expression of putative stem cell markers in K14 and K14+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that CD44 was differentially expressed between these cell populations, but CD49f, CD24a, CD133, and CD29 were not (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested for gene set enrichment in K14 and K14+ cells with published mouse mammary stem cell gene sets (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our gene set tests revealed that K14 cells were enriched for fetal mammary stem cell and luminal epithelial gene signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, K14+ cells were enriched for mammary stem cell, adult mammary stem cell, and myoepithelial gene signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third approach we took to test stemness was to assay the ability of isolated single K14 and K14+ cells to form mammospheres, as in Spike et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that both K14 and K14+ cells form mammospheres and that the mammosphere-forming efficiency was not significantly different between K14 and K14+ cells (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings are consistent with a model in which stemness features are observed in both K14 and K14+ cells, and that both cell types are capable of colony formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

K14_Expression_Is_Required_for_Distant_Metastasis_and_Regulates_Gene_Expression_of_Multiple_Metastasis_Effectors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our gene-expression study revealed that K14+ cells displayed coordinated up-regulation of most desmosome (10 of 11) and hemidesmosome (10 of 12) complex genes (Fig 5 C and C) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were intriguing to us because: (i) K14 is the major intermediate filament in hemidesmosomes; (ii) leader cells require expression of basal epithelial genes, including K14, for their collective invasive behavior (11); and (iii) a recent study has implicated desmosomal function in CTC clusters from human cancer patients (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that K14 expression is required for distant metastasis, we transplanted mTomato+ tumor organoids, either expressing control Luciferase or K14 shRNA, into host mice (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary tumors derived from Luciferase control knockdown organoids did not show statistically significant differences in size compared with primary tumors derived from K14 knockdown tumor organoids (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, K14 knockdown tumors had a sevenfold reduction in the mean number of metastases relative to control knockdown tumors (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having shown that K14 expression is required for distant metastasis, we next asked whether knockdown of K14 altered gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the transcriptomes of luciferase control knockdown and K14 knockdown tumor organoids by RNA-Seq and identified 1,584 genes differentially expressed between conditions (mean-variance normalized heatmap in Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To dissect this list further, we next ranked genes by their association with Krt14 transcript levels [487 genes at a false-discovery rate (FDR) less_than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top four genes most correlated with Krt14 transcript expression were enriched for multiple major metastasis effector genes that promote metastatic niche remodeling (Tnc, AdamTs1, Jag1) and metastasis survival (AdamTs1, Birc5) (Fig 6D) (27, 29, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, disruption of K14 expression abrogates the expression of multiple metastasis effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the core molecular program expressed in K14+ cells and regulated by K14 expression, we then integrated this transcriptome data with our RNA-seq enrichment data for K14+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 14 genes with twofold or greater significant enrichment in K14+ cells and whose gene expression was significantly associated with Krt14 transcript levels (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our observations in the K14 knockdown dataset, we observed that nine of these genes were previously reported in metastasis regulation, including in metastatic niche, vascular remodeling, and immunosurveillance, including Tnc, AdamTs1, Jag1, as well as Card10, Cav1, Ereg, Lgr5, Slpi, and Ptgs2 (29, 3538).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core genes showed evidence of multiple physical and genetic interactions and occurrence along common pathways (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the gene most highly enriched in K14+ cells and positively regulated by Krt14 transcript levels was Dsg3, which encodes for the major desmoglein in desmosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, K14 expression also regulates the expression of a major desmosome component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data establish that K14 expression is required for distant metastasis and that K14 is a regulator of multiple genes that function at distinct steps of the metastatic cascade (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major goal of our study was to determine how breast cancer cells seed distant metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our lineage analysis enabled us to identify polyclonal collective invasion strands, polyclonal disseminated tumor cell clusters in the stroma, polyclonal CTC clusters, and polyclonal micro- and macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings, in conjunction with recent reports in CTC clusters (5), and genomic sequencing of metastases (7, 8), provide strong evidence for polyclonal seeding as a major mechanism for metastatic spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next focused on the molecular features of the tumor cell clusters that give rise to polyclonal metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously established that the cells leading collective invasion near uniformly express K14 (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reveal profound and systematic changes in the relative proportions of K14+ and K14 cells from micrometastatic to macrometastatic stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detect K14+ cells in disseminated tumor cell clusters, in intravascular tumor emboli, CTC clusters, and in micro- and macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, both CTC clusters and micrometastases are  greater than 20-fold enriched for K14+ cells relative to primary tumors or macrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, K14+ cells are significantly enriched in breast cancer cells during the phases of metastasis most associated with systemic spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, K14 cells are significantly enriched in the phases of metastasis most associated with proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vivo data cannot distinguish between conversion of cells from a K14+ to a K14 state after arrival in the lung versus expansion of K14 cancer cells that arrived as a component of a mixed K14+/K14 cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our ex vivo assays provide clear evidence for interconversion between epithelial states in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanisms that drive transitions between K14+ and K14 states are an important area for further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study, we also revealed transcriptomic differences between K14 and K14+ tumor cells and identified genes coding for protein complexes distinct to each compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordant with a recent report on plakoglobin, our data implicate the desmosome in polyclonal seeding (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, K14+ cells are also enriched for hemidesmosome complex genes and genes encoding for proteinaceous extracellular matrix, and K14 expression is required for gene expression of multiple metastasis effectors involved in niche remodeling (29, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that polyclonal tumor cell clusters provide an efficient nidus for interactions with collagen I, fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, and other tumor microenvironmental components in the multicellular seeding process (3944).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data do not exclude the possibility of single-cell seeding events by either EMT or migratory stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our lineage analysis does put an upper limit on the relative contribution of these events to metastasis in the MMTV-PyMT model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our data, a recent study used lineage analysis in spontaneous mouse models of breast cancer to reveal that EMT does not significantly contribute to the formation of lung metastases in MMTV-PyMT mice, and that inhibition of EMT through miR-200 overexpression does not impair the ability of MMTV-PyMT tumor cells to form metastases (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains technically prohibitive to image the transit of a cancer cell continuously from escape out of the primary tumor through to establishment of a distant site, and so some inference remains necessary to construct models of the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, it is important to acknowledge contrary observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe K14 single cells in the mammary stroma and real-time intravital imaging was recently used to observe single MMTV-PyMT cancer cells intravasating at sites of macrophageendothelial cell connections (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are compatible with a model in which K14 is required for collective invasion and dissemination, but not single-cell dissemination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our data do not exclude the possibility of transitions between single cell and multicellular organization in the mammary stroma before intravasation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are needed to map the relative frequency of different single-cell and multicellular configurations and their molecular features across the entire mammary fat pad and in different cancer models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simplest interpretation of our data is that breast cancer metastases form via the local dissemination, entry into circulation, and distal seeding of a multicellular cluster containing K14+ cancer cells (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this framework, the survival advantage of multicellular organization provides a mechanism by which genetically distinct clones can jointly found a micrometastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eradicating polyclonal micrometastases in the adjuvant setting will be particularly challenging when these founders have intrinsic differences in treatment sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also support the concept that micrometastatic and macrometastatic disease may require distinct therapeutic strategies (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it will be important in future studies to determine how tumor cell clusters gain access to the lymphatic and venous circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Isolation_of_Primary_Mammary_Tumor_Organoids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary tumor organoids were isolated from mammary tumors by step-wise mechanical disruption, enzymatic digestion, and differential centrifugation according to our published protocols (11, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumors were harvested from 8- to 10-wk-old mice, minced with a scalpel, and digested for 1 h at 37 °C in collagenase solution: (DMEM (10565018; Gibco Life Technologies) with 2 mg/mL collagenase (C2139; Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mg/mL trypsin (27250018; Gibco Life Technologies), 5% (vol/vol) FBS (F0926; Sigma-Aldrich), 5 g/mL insulin (I9278; Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 g/mL gentamicin (15750; Gibco Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was centrifuged at 422 × g to remove cellular debris, and the pellet was treated with 2 U/L DNase (D4263; Sigma-Aldrich) to separate out organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor organoids were separated from single cells by differential centrifugation and counted under a microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mammary_Fat_Pad_Transplantation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumor organoids from MMTV-PyMT;ROSAmT/mG, MMTV-PyMT;Confetti, or MMTV-PyMT;Rainbow were incubated with 1:50 adeno-CMV-Cre (1045; Vector BioLabs)/DMEM overnight in a nonadherent 96-well plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cre expression was induced successfully in more than 75% of the organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To wash out adeno-Cre, the samples were collected in a BSA-coated microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 422 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For intermediate mosaicism, tumor organoids were mixed 1:1 with unrecombined tumor organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor organoids were resuspended in a 50% (vol/vol) DMEM/50% (vol/vol) Matrigel (354230; Corning) solution at a density of 2540 organoids per microliter and kept at 4 °C during transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted orthotopic transplantations into 3- to 4-wk-old NSG mice in a sterile hood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, immobilized and the surgical site was made sterile using ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1-cm midline incision was made, the skin was retracted, and the no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 mammary gland was exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fat pad proximal to the lymph node was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a syringe, 40 L of the tumor organoid suspension was injected into the mammary fat pad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin was then locally infiltrated with 510 L of 0.25% bupivacaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same procedure was repeated for the contralateral mammary gland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surgical wounds were closed using 9-mm autoclips and tissue glue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple antibiotic ointment was applied to the incision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were closely monitored, and autoclips were removed 10 d postsurgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 6 and 10 wk, tumors and lungs from these mice were harvested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differencial_Interference_Contrast_Imaging_and_Confocal_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential interference contrast imaging of tumor organoids was conducted using a Zeiss Cell Observer system with a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 and an AxioCam MRM camera (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal imaging was conducted with a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumors or lungs harvested from transplant mice were fixed in 4% or 1% paraformaldehyde, respectively, for 4 h. They were then incubated in a 25% sucrose solution overnight, embedded in Tissue Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, Sakura) and frozen at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCT blocks were sectioned at 50-m thickness using a Leica cryostat (Leica Biosystems) set to 27 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For antibody staining, the OCT was removed by rinsing with PBS for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were blocked for 2 h with 10% FBS/1% BSA/PBS (vol/vol) solution, incubated with the conjugated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 1% FBS/1% BSA/PBS solution, and rinsed two times in PBS for 1020 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were optically cleared, mounted, and sealed with coverslips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor Phalloidin (Life Technologies) anti-K14 (PRB-155P; Covance), antiE-Cad (24E10; Cell Signaling Technologies), and DAPI (D3571; Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To label functional vasculature, 10 g of anti-CD31 (102416; BioLegend) and anti-CD144 (138108; BioLegend) antibodies were injected into the mouse by tail vein (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 min, mice were killed and tumors and lungs were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_CTCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 500 L of blood was harvested from each mouse via the right atrium using a 20-G needle (305176; BD Biosciences) and 1-mL syringe (309659; BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before cardiac puncture, tumors were mechanically palpated to liberate CTCs into the systemic circulation, as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was transferred to 1 mL K2EDTA tubes (365974; BD Biosciences) and placed on an inverter to prevent clotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was mixed 1:2 with ACK Lysis Buffer (118-156-721; Quality Biological) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was washed with 500 L PBS without Mg+2/Ca+2 (10010-023; Life Technologies) and centrifuged at 500 × g for an additional 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was resuspended in 450 L total volume with PBS wthout Mg+2/Ca+2 and spread onto slides with a proprietary adhesion coating (0906000, Marienfeld).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were left to settle on the slide for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slide was then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slide supernatant was discarded and adherent cells were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were then washed with PBS without Mg+2/Ca+2 and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X at room temperature for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were again washed with PBS without Mg+2/Ca+2 and then blocked at 37 °C for 20 min with an Fc receptor-blocking antibody diluted 1:20 (101320, BioLegend) in 10% Normal Goat Serum (50062Z, Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were incubated with conjugated primary antibodies diluted in PBS without Mg+2/Ca+2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Antibodies used were pancytokeratin-AlexaFluor488 (1:50; 4523S, Cell Signaling), Keratin 14-AlexaFluor488 (1:250; PRB-155P, BioLegend), and CD45-AlexaFluor647(1:50; 103124, BioLegend).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed with PBS without Mg+2/Ca+2, mounted and coverslipped using ProLong Diamond Anti-Fade with DAPI (P36971, Life Technologies) and 24 × 60 coverglass (12-545-M, Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were left to dry overnight in a dark chamber and imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) using Metafer 5 software (v3.11.3) (MetaSystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution 3D images were collected on a Zeiss 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FACS_of_Single_K14_and_K14+_Tumor_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MMTV-PyMT; K14-actin-GFP were harvested for tumor organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organoids were subsequently dissociated to single cell suspensions in StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (A11105-01; Life Technologies) for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then resuspended in HBSS/1%BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through 40-m cell strainers and analyzed on a Beckman-Coulter MoFlo Cytometer by gating cellular distributions according to the eGFP reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single cells and clusters were gated by FSLin vs. Pulse Width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nozzle size chosen for sorting was 100+ m. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each condition, cells were sorted into 200 L Matrigel and cultured in 24-well plates with DMEM media supplemented with the growth factor basic human FGF (bFGF) (F0291; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the aggregation experiments, 10,000 single cells were sorted into DMEM plus bFGF media and allowed to aggregate overnight in nonadherent-well dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then resuspended into 200 L Matrigel and plated as mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were fixed at day 8 for counting of colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm aggregation, fractions of single-cell suspensions were incubated for 1 h with 10 µM Cell Tracker Green and Cell Tracker Red (C7025 and C34552, Life Technologies), respectively, before sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equal number of red and green cells where plated for a total of 10,000 single cells per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell aggregates were analyzed the following day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tail_Vein_Injections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NSG mice were injected with 200,000 single cells or an equivalent number of aggregated cells obtained from ROSAmT/mG;MMTV-PyMT or -actin-CFP;MMTV-PyMT tumor cells isolated by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lungs from these mice were harvested 3 wk later, and lung metastases were counted under the dissection scope or by counting metastases from 50-m lung sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lentiviral_Transduction_of_Tumor_Organoids_for_Tumor_Transplantation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lentiviral transduction of tumor organoids was conducted according to our published protocols (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 800 ROSAmT/mG;MMTV-PyMT organoids were resuspended in 100 L of DMEM/F12, and allowed to settle in a 96-well nonadherent dish for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The media was removed, and the organoids were infected with 50 L of lentivirus (Mission shRNA; Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 L of ViroMag beads (VM4100; OZ Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 96-well plate was incubated on top of a magnetic plate (MF10000; OZ Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1.5 h, then the magnetic plate was taken off and the 96-well plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 2, 75 L of media was removed and replaced with 200 L of fresh FGF2 organoid media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 3, 175 L of media was removed, and 175 L of FGF2 organoid media supplemented with 2.5 nM bFGF and 4 g/mL puromycin was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 3 d, the surviving organoids were collected for orthotopic transplantation into the no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 mammary fat pads of FVB host mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor dimensions were measured at regular intervals (one to two times a week) using digital vernier calipers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of disseminated tumor cell clusters, tumorstroma border of primary tumor sections were scanned for dissemination events and confirmed to be completely detached from the primary tumor by sequential z-stacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissemination events were scored as single cells or clusters (two cells or more).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_Local_Mixing_in_the_Primary_Tumor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We took low-power montages of primary tumors in transplanted mice on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fiji custom scripts were written to binarize these images and extract the percentage of pixels that were green in color (%Green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then divided images into 100 × 100-pixel grids (1.3 mm × 1.3 mm) and determined the probability of choosing two pixels of different colors in each grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined % local mixing as two times the average probability of choosing two pixels of different colors averaged over all grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using robust linear regression, we then estimated the percentage of multicolored metastases at maximal local mixing for data in Fig 1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Throughput_RNA_Sequencing_of_K14_and_K14+_Tumor_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each replicate, K14-actin-GFP;MMTV-PyMT tumor organoids were first dissociated into a single-cell suspension, and then single K14 and K14+ cells were isolated by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four independent experiments were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cell population, total RNA was extracted using TRizol (15596-026; Life Technologies) and RNeasy (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 10100 ng of RNA collected per sample, we generated barcoded NuGen RNA-seq v2 libraries and ran paired-end, 100-bp, 50-cycle sequencing on a HiSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2000 (The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Deep Sequencing and Microarray Core Facility).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired-end, nonstrand-specific RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (Genomic Reference Consortium build 38) using RNA-STAR v2.3.0 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieved 8085% read pair alignment to the reference genome and estimated the number of reads mapped to each gene using HTSeq v0.6.1p1 (51), with gene coordinates from the reference genome Generic Feature Format file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw counts were normalized and P values were calculated for paired sample differential expression using EdgeR (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes were excluded that did not have at least one read per million in four of eight samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure yielded 12,190 mapped genes, of which 11,968 had gene annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence data will be uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO category enrichment was determined by DAVID Gene Set Analysis, v6.7, using the functional annotation chart algorithm, mouse genome as background, and goterm_bp_fat, goterm_cc_fat, and goterm_mf_fat gene lists (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values for module enrichment were calculated using a Fisher exact test (1,561 of 11,968 genes with FDR less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Throughput_RNA_Sequencing_of_Luc-shRNA_and_K14-shRNA_Transduced_Tumor_Organoids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each replicate, MMTV-PyMT tumor organoids were transduced with luciferase control shRNA or K14 shRNA, and selected with puromycin as we have done previously (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduced organoids were embedded in 3D Matrigel and after 2 d in culture, harvested for RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four independent experiments were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each condition, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 10100 ng of RNA collected per sample, we generated cDNA using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for sequencing (Clontech), barcoded libraries with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), and ran paired end, 100-bp, 50-cycle sequencing on a HiSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2500 (GE Healthcare Seqwright).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired-end, nonstrand-specific RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (Genomic Reference Consortium build 38) using RNA-STAR (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieved 7386% read pair alignment to the reference genome and estimated the number of reads mapped to each gene using HTSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51), with gene coordinates from the reference genome Generic Feature Format file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw counts were normalized and P values were calculated for paired sample differential expression using the limma package (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes were excluded that did not have at least one read per million in four of the eight samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure yielded 13,332 mapped genes, of which 12,919 had gene annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence data will be uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each replicate (replicates one to four), the knockdown efficiency was determined by dividing the Krt14 transcript level in the K14-shRNA condition by the Krt14 transcript level in the Luc-shRNA condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear model was then fitted to the voomed expression data using a design matrix parameterizing batch effects and differences in knockdown efficiency between replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this fitted model, genes were then ranked by P value and FDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional association network (Fig S7) was determined using the GeneMANIA web interface (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mammosphere_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For suspension mammosphere culture, MMTV-PyMT; K14-actin-GFP tumors were first dissociated into a single-cell suspension, and then single K14+ and K14 cells were isolated by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were plated on ultralow-adherence plates (Thermo Scientific) at 500 cells/cm2 and 1,000 cells/cm2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were culture in Basal Epicult-B mouse media (Stem Cell Technologies) containing B-supplement, 10 ng/mL rhEGF, 10 ng/mL rhbFGF, 4 g/mL heparin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of spheres for each well was counted under the microscope on day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of spheres was compared across cell types and densities using the MannWhitney test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
