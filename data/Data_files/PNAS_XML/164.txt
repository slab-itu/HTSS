Characterization and small-molecule stabilization of the multisite tandem binding between 14-3-3 and the R domain of CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins increase trafficking of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the plasma membrane by binding to its regulatory (R) domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper contains a detailed characterization of the 14-3-3/CFTR interaction, showing that multiple phosphorylated binding sites in the CFTR R-domain are necessary for significant binding with 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that one of these binding sites serves as an anchor, while surrounding weaker sites enhance the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show the druggability of this interaction using natural-product fusicoccin-A, which stabilizes the 14-3-3/CFTR interaction by selectively modifying a weaker binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism of action can serve as a model for the development of new trafficking corrector molecules to treat cystic fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cystic fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease, most frequently caused by the retention of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of the 14-3-3 protein to the CFTR regulatory (R) domain has been found to enhance CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define the mechanism of action of this proteinprotein interaction, we have examined the interaction in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disordered multiphosphorylated R domain contains nine different 14-3-3 binding motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the 14-3-3 protein forms a dimer containing two amphipathic grooves that can potentially bind these phosphorylated motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a number of possible binding mechanisms between these two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using multiple biochemical assays and crystal structures, we show that the interaction between them is governed by two binding sites: The key binding site of CFTR (pS768) occupies one groove of the 14-3-3 dimer, and a weaker, secondary binding site occupies the other binding groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that fusicoccin-A, a natural-product tool compound used in studies of 14-3-3 biology, can stabilize the interaction between 14-3-3 and CFTR by selectively interacting with a secondary binding motif of CFTR (pS753).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilization of this interaction stimulates the trafficking of mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This definition of the druggability of the 14-3-3CFTR interface might offer an approach for cystic fibrosis therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Binding_Affinities_of_the_Interaction_Between_CFTR_R-Domain_Peptides_and_14-3-3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The separate binding motifs in the R domain were investigated to resolve the binding mechanism between the intrinsically disordered CFTR R domain and the 14-3-3 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides corresponding to the nine possible 14-3-3 binding motifs were synthesized (Fig 1B), with the phosphorylated serine in the center surrounded by six amino acids of the natural sequence on each side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After N-terminal labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay was performed to measure the binding of these labeled peptides to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, none of the nine peptides of 14-3-3 had sufficient affinity to allow determination of the association constants (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results from the assays showed the pS768 peptide to be the strongest binder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because a 14-3-3 dimer contains two binding grooves that are known to simultaneously bind two epitope sites on the same target protein partner, a series of diphosphorylated CFTR peptides were synthesized to study a potential dual-binding mechanism for CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peptides each consisted of two adjacent binding motifs, including the native interconnecting peptide sequences and an additional six amino acid residues at both the N and C termini (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptides were N-terminally labeled with FITC, and results from an FP assay showed that most of them bound to 14-3-3 with significantly stronger affinity than the singly phosphorylated peptides (Fig 2B and Fig S1A), with Kd values typically in the low micromolar range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest binder in this assay was CFTR_R7, which features the pS768 and pS795 epitopes, followed by CFTR_R6, featuring pS753 and pS768.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both of these peptides contain the pS768 binding motif, which by itself showed the strongest individual binding to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, peptides not containing the pS768 binding motif also showed a stronger affinity for 14-3-3 than the singly phosphorylated peptides, especially CFTR_R8, which features pS795 and pS813.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these experiments, one of the physically most relevant isoforms, 14-3-3, was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the other six isoforms were also tested to investigate the isoform dependence of the CFTR R-domain peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, FP assays of peptides CFTR_R1CFTR_R8 were performed on all seven isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that in all cases 14-3-3 binds the strongest, followed by , , , , , and , respectively (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from this experiment also showed that CFTR_R7 and CFTR_R6 exhibit the strongest binding to all seven 14-3-3 isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements on the three strongest-binding peptides showed the same trend in binding to 14-3-3 as observed in the FP assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding affinities of CFTR_R6, CFTR_R7, and CFTR_R8 for 14-3-3 were 75.8, 24.0, and 370 µM, respectively (Fig 2 CE and Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the ITC measurements show in all cases the stoichiometry of the CFTR peptide versus the 14-3-3 protomer to be close to 0.5 (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that one peptide containing two phosphorylated binding motifs is binding to one 14-3-3 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intrinsically disordered nature of the CFTR R domain could potentially also allow the R domain to bind with two nonadjacent binding motifs to one 14-3-3 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, peptide probes featuring two nonadjacent binding motifs, the pS768 motif and a more distant motif, were synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two motifs were connected by a glycine linker to reduce the peptide length and overcome synthesis problems while mimicking the flexibility of the R domain (CFTR_R9 and CFTR_R10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITC measurements of these two peptides showed binding to 14-3-3 comparable to CFTR_R6 and CFTR_R7 featuring adjacent binding motifs (Fig S3 AC and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that these potential phosphorylated sites are relevant for 14-3-3 binding, the wild-type R domain and the R domain containing a S700A, S753A, or S768A mutation were coexpressed with PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutations were constructed to prevent phosphorylation of the mutation site to study the influence of each site on the binding of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the coexpression with PKA resulted in only a partially phosphorylated R domain (a variation of three to nine phosphoryl groups was attached to the R domain; Dataset S1, W-AA), eliminating the serine at position 768 shows a significant decrease in binding affinity to 14-3-3 (56.5125.9 µM) whereas the other positions (700 and 753) resulted in a smaller decrease (59.9 and 92.6 µM, respectively) (Fig S3 DH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystal_Structure_of_CFTR_R6_and_CFTR_R7_with_14-3-3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The doubly phosphorylated peptide CFTR_R6 was cocrystallized with 14-3-3, and the protein complex structure was solved to a resolution of 2.1 Å [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 5D2D] (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretable density for 19 out of 28 amino acids of the CFTR_R6 peptide (R751G758 and R764T774) was found (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein structure shows that both phosphorylated binding motifs of the peptide are simultaneously bound to one 14-3-3 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pS768 site is located in the binding groove of 14-3-3 protomer A, and the pS753 site is located in 14-3-3 protomer B (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five residues of the flexible, connecting linker are not visible in the electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylated serines are located in the basic pocket of 14-3-3, composed of Arg56 and Arg127, consistent with earlier published structures of cocrystallized phosphorylated peptides with 14-3-3 (Fig 3 CE) (2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3E shows more details of the interaction between protomer A and the pS768 binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polar contacts are visualized by dashed lines and are more relevant for the binding of the N-terminal part of the peptide, whereas hydrophobic interactions, depicted as semitransparent spheres, are more relevant for accommodation of the C-terminal half of CFTR (pS768).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most prominent interaction is the basic pocket in 14-3-3 composed of Arg56 and Arg127 binding pS768, stabilized by polar contacts with Tyr128.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further on, polar contacts can be seen of Arg766 and Arg765 of CFTR_R6 with Glu180 and Glu131 of 14-3-3 (directly or via a water molecule).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions are generally responsible for the known mode I and mode II binding of 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Leu770 and Leu772 form important hydrophobic interactions with Val46 and Phe117 of 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between G758 and R764 (31.5 Å) is too large to be bridged by the five amino acids connecting these two amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this can be explained by the packing of the CFTR_R614-3-3 crystal (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the symmetry elements shows tetramer formation of the 14-3-3 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the C terminus of the pS753 binding site and the N terminus of the pS768 binding site is 15.3 Å, which is short enough to be bridged by five amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this tetramer formation is most probably due to packing in the crystal lattice, because additional experiments (size-exclusion chromatography, cross-linking, dynamic light scattering, and small-angle X-ray scattering) did not produce evidence for the presence of 14-3-3 tetramers in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The doubly phosphorylated peptide CFTR_R7 was cocrystallized with 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein complex structure was solved to a resolution of 2.75 Å (PDB ID code 5D3E) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, interpretable density was found for 11 of the 40 amino acid residues present in the CFTR_R7 peptide (R766L770 and K793P798) (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of 14-3-3CFTR_R7 shows that, as for the CFTR_R6 structure, both phosphorylated binding motifs are simultaneously bound to the 14-3-3 dimer: pS768 is located in the binding groove of 14-3-3 protomer A, and pS795 is located in protomer B (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stabilization_of_the_14-3-3CFTR_Interactions_with_Fusicoccin-A  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PPIs involving 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to be stabilized by small molecules (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the principal possibility of stabilizing the 14-3-3CFTR interaction, a number of these known 14-3-3 stabilizers were tested on this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of 100 µM FC-A (Fig 4E) in the FP assay stabilized the binding of CFTR_R6 to 14-3-3, increasing the apparent affinity by a factor of 4.0, from a Kd of 15.9 µM to a Kd of 3.98 µM (Fig 4A and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITC measurements confirmed this with an increased binding affinity of CFTR_R6 to 14-3-3 in the presence of 200 µM FC-A from a Kd of 57.8 µM to a Kd of 8.4 µM (9.0-fold) (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, addition of FC-A did not result in a significant increase in the binding affinity of the 14-3-3CFTR_R7 interaction (Fig 4 AC and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the structural basis for the observed stabilization of the 14-3-3CFTR_R6 complex by FC-A, the compound was soaked into the crystals described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was solved to a resolution of 2.74 Å (PDB ID code 5D3F) (Fig 4 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretable density was found for 18 of the 28 amino acids present in the CFTR_R6 peptide (R750L756 and K764P774) (Fig 4D), with FC-A present in one binding groove of the 14-3-3 dimer (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference density map directly calculated after molecular replacement with only 14-3-3 and the CFTR_R6 peptide as search model, but excluding FC-A, showed unambiguous, unbiased density for FC-A (Fig S4B) in 14-3-3 protomer B containing the pS753 binding motif but not in 14-3-3 protomer A containing the pS768 binding motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the structure of the binary complex, the pS753 peptide motif adapts its conformation slightly to enable the FC-A molecule to bind between the 14-3-3 protein and the CFTR peptide (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D and 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are some polar contacts between FC-A and 14-3-3 residues (Asn42, Lys122, and Asp215), no polar contacts are observed between FC-A in the pS753 binding motif of CFTR_R6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, 14-3-3 and the peptide jointly form a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the mostly hydrophobic FC-A molecule (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FP assays of CFTR_R6 with both physiologically relevant 14-3-3 isoforms  and , and 14-3-3 (which is used in the crystal-soaking experiment), show that FC-A increases the binding affinity of CFTR_R6 for all three 14-3-3 isoforms (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CF mutation database (www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/Home.html) contains mutations that lead to CF and could influence the binding of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples are S753R, V754M, and R766M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the influence of these mutations on the binding to 14-3-3, peptides similar to CFTR_R6 (pS753pS768) were synthesized that contain these mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After N-terminal labeling with FITC, their affinity for 14-3-3 was tested with an FP assay (Fig S3I) showing that these three peptides all bind less strongly to 14-3-3 than the CFTR_R6 wild-type peptide, further hinting at the relevance of the 14-3-3CFTR interaction for CF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influence_of_FC-A_on_the_Trafficking_of_F508del-CFTR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effects of FC-A on the trafficking of F508del-CFTR in the cell, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing 3HA-tagged F508del-CFTR were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of FC-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fixation of the cells, the combination of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC was used to detect F508del-CFTR that had trafficked to the plasma membrane, as described before by Carlile et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased fluorescence was detected with increasing concentrations of FC-A, up to 54% of a positive control, VX-809 [a known F508del-CFTR corrector (28)], at 100 µM (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent years, the amount of research done on 14-3-3 proteins has increased significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each year, new protein binding partners for 14-3-3 are found and, with them, the number of diseases and possible therapeutic approaches related to 14-3-3 increases (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brings forward a strong need to understand the different binding mechanisms of this regulatory hub protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a great number of 14-3-3 interactions have been thoroughly quantified, analyzed, and structurally elucidated (22, 23, 3032), the interaction between CFTR and 14-3-3 remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of the intrinsically disordered CFTR R domain to 14-3-3, relying on multiple-phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding motifs, employs a unique binding mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several 14-3-3 PPIs known where proteins with multiple-phosphorylated serines and threonines interact with 14-3-3, for example LRRK2, p53, and BAD (30, 3336).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the CFTR R-domain interaction with 14-3-3 is exceptional for the large number of interaction sites (nine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from increasing our understanding of the interactions and specificity of 14-3-3 proteins, we have shown that stabilization of this interaction might present a mechanism for tackling the trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR mutant protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FP binding assays of the nine singly phosphorylated CFTR peptides with 14-3-3 show that their binding to 14-3-3 is weak (high micromolar range) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These individual affinities are too low to explain the biological function of 14-3-3 in CFTR expression as described in a publication of Liang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13), and are significantly lower than the affinity of the whole phosphorylated R domain to 14-3-3 published by Bozoky et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Kd based on Trp fluorescence measurements: 5.4 ± 1.0 M) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The affinities of the doubly phosphorylated CFTR peptides to 14-3-3 are significantly stronger (lowmiddle micromolar range) (Fig 2B) and comparable to those of earlier published 14-3-3 interaction partners (18) as well as the full-length R domain (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the 14-3-3 dimer most probably binds simultaneously to two monophosphoepitope sites on the same CFTR R domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bozoky et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported a variety of different binding modes in their NMR-based model for CFTR R-domain binding to 14-3-3 (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structures of CFTR_R6 and CFTR_R7 with 14-3-3 clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylated binding sites do bind in the amphipathic binding grooves of 14-3-3, although the connecting linker in-between is not visible in the electron density and therefore shows no evidence for a functional interaction with 14-3-3 (Fig 3 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In binding assays, 14-3-3 was used because this isoform is physically relevant in CFTR expression (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for practical reasons, 14-3-3 and 14-3-3 have been used in crystallography experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these isoforms are physiologically less relevant, the binding grooves of 14-3-3 are highly conserved among the different isoforms (37), and should therefore provide a reliable impression of the binding between the R domain and 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the FP assay of all eight doubly phosphorylated peptides with the seven different isoforms showed that there are no specific preferences for the different binding sites within the isoforms (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the different isoforms show different total binding affinities, they display the same trend in binding to the different peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nine 14-3-3 binding sites in the R domain are all related to the mode I (RSXpSXP) and/or mode II (RX[Y/F]XpSXP) 14-3-3 binding motifs (32), but none of the motif sequences present in CFTR conform exactly to either of these two modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R-domain binding site corresponding best to these published consensus binding sites is pS768 (QARRRQpSVLNLMT) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, pS768 scored the maximum value in the overview of the estimated relative occupancy of the bound state of the nine different 14-3-3 binding sites in the CFTR R domain (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are coherent with our experimental findings that indeed pS768 is the strongest individual binding site of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we expected, based on the amino acid sequence and the estimated relative occupancy of the bound state of Liang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13), that pS795 would bind more strongly to 14-3-3 than pS753.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantification of the binding of CFTR_R6 (pS753pS768) and CFTR_R7 (pS768pS795) to 14-3-3 in both the ITC and FP assays confirms this prediction (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are further alternative bivalent modes of CFTR binding to 14-3-3 imaginable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test some of the possible combinations of two CFTR phosphosites binding to 14-3-3, we synthesized CFTR_R9 (pS712G5pS768) and CFTR_R10 (pS768G5pS813), which showed a comparable binding affinity for 14-3-3 as CFTR_R7 (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these peptides are not exactly similar to the natural sequence, because both the sequence and length of the glycine linker in the peptide are different from the natural sequence, these results provide valuable insight into the possibility that nonadjacent binding motifs can bind simultaneously to 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, ITC experiments performed on the full R domain showed that phosphorylation of S768 is more important for the binding to 14-3-3 than, for example, phosphorylation of S700 and S753 (Fig S3 DH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What is the role for the multiple-phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding sites in the CFTR R domain?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation could be that pS768 acts as a main anchor point for the binding between CFTR and 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the binding of one 14-3-3 protomer to this anchor point, the local concentration of weaker binding sites surrounding the other protomer increases significantly, making the binding of a second protomer more likely to happen (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is described by Yaffe as the gatekeeper model: One dominant site functions as an initiator that must be present and phosphorylated to promote a 14-3-3 interaction, which is then stabilized by a second interaction (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the case of CFTR is exceptional for the large number of binding sites, of which at least two must be phosphorylated and one has to be pS768.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, a mutation to one of the eight weaker binding sites will not significantly affect the functionality of CFTR, whereas having one single anchor point minimizes the chance of multiple 14-3-3 proteins binding to one R domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another explanation is more biological.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14-3-3 proteins are expected to increase CFTR function in three different ways: (i) supporting the folding of CFTR, (ii) masking the degradation recognition site, and (iii) assisting the trafficking to the plasma membrane (13, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of certain sites of the R domain to 14-3-3 could support the folding of the protein, whereas binding of other sites could, for example, mask or present the COPI recognition sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sites are located in the CFTR R domain at positions 683 (KKQS) and 696 (KRKNS) (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphorylation of the CFTR R domain significantly increases its binding to 14-3-3 (Kd based on Trp fluorescence measurements shifts from 34.3 ± 7.4 M to 5.4 ± 1.0 M) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we should keep in mind that the phosphorylation positions of the R domain and the presence of certain kinases exert an important influence on the binding of 14-3-3 to CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prediction of phosphorylation sites shows that different kinases are capable of phosphorylating different 14-3-3 binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PKA is able to phosphorylate all nine sites, PKC is predicted to phosphorylate only eight (all but Ser753), and AMPK is able to phosphorylate only five sites (Ser700, Ser737, Ser768, Ser795, and Ser813) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can cause different levels of phosphorylation at different sites, varying over time, location, and cell fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, the multiphosphorylatable R domain could work as an integrator of different signal-transduction pathways, with 14-3-3 acting as a reader element of the different phosphorylation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Johnson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  characterize this as an AND gate, where two phosphorylated sites must be engaged before the 14-3-3 dimer can bind, so two inputs (phosphorylation of the R domain by two different kinases) can lead to one output (binding of 14-3-3 to the CFTR R domain) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, multiphosphorylation of the R domain could lead to an ultrasensitive response of binding to the 14-3-3 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered with this study that at least two phosphorylated binding sites in the R domain, of which one should be pS768, are needed for the interaction with 14-3-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extra phosphorylation sites are perhaps not per se essential for binding to 14-3-3 but can increase the sensitivity of the system, resulting in a switch-like mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferrell and Ha describe this phenomenon in an excellent review (44) where the Fus3Ste5 interaction is used as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is important in yeast mating, where an ultrasensitive response is generated by multisite phosphorylation, two-stage binding with one docking site, and steric hindrance (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reported here provide the first indications, to our knowledge, toward a potential similar ultrasensitive mechanism for regulation of the 14-3-3CFTR interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the CF mutation database contains CF mutations that are present in the 14-3-3 binding sites of the CFTR R domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show with an FP assay of the CFTR_R6 peptide containing a selection of these mutations (S753R, V754M, and R766M) that they can decrease the binding affinity of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3 (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that interruption of this PPI could be the underlying mechanism in a certain mutation class of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the possibility of stabilizing the 14-3-3CFTR interaction, known stabilizers for 14-3-3 PPIs were tested in binding assays between 14-3-3 and the different doubly phosphorylated CFTR peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of 200 µM FC-A resulted in a ninefold increase of affinity between 14-3-3 and CFTR_R6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, until now, FC-A was reported to only stabilize mode III binding motifs ([pS/pT]X-COOH, where X is not Pro) (22), and yet the R domain does not contain any mode III binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of 14-3-3CFTR_R6 crystals soaked with FC-A shows that FC-A is only present in the binding groove containing the pS753 binding site (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possibly the reason why the FP assays and ITC measurements showed that FC-A is able to stabilize the 14-3-3CFTR_R6 (pS753pS768) interaction but not the 14-3-3CFTR_R7 (pS768pS795) interaction (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 AC and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important interactions between FC-A and CFTR_R6 are the hydrophobic contacts with Val754 and Ile755, which form a hydrophobic pocket together with 14-3-3 residues Leu218, Ile219, Ile168, and Val64 (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the pS768 and pS795 binding motifs also display hydrophobic residues at the +1 and +2 positions of the phosphorylated serine but are not stabilized by FC-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation why the pS768 motif is not stabilized by FC-A is that Leu772 contains hydrophobic contacts with both the Phe117 of 14-3-3 and Leu770 of the peptide itself (Fig 4E), which would be broken by addition of FC-A in this pocket, leading to a decreased binding affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a possibility is that leucine and alanine of the pS795 binding site, and valine and leucine of pS768, do not form the right surface topography to present to FC-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another explanation could be that the short linker between pS753 and pS768 (14 amino acids) is guided toward the direction of the second binding groove by FC-A, which is not essential for the longer linker between pS768 and pS795 (26 amino acid residues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would explain why the other doubly phosphorylated, but weaker-binding, peptides containing short linker lengths, CFTR_R1 (pS660pS670) and CFTR_R3 (pS700pS712), show stabilization upon addition of FC-A as well (Fig S6B), whereas peptides with longer linker lengths and the singly phosphorylated peptides do not show a significant increase of affinity through addition of FC-A (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FP assays of CFTR_R6 with both physiologically relevant 14-3-3 isoforms  and , and , showed that there is no isoform specificity in stabilization of the 14-3-3CFTR interaction (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, tool compound FC-A shows the ligandability of the 14-3-3CFTR interaction in an intermolecular specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the mode I/II binding of pS753 to 14-3-3 and the mode III binding of other known 14-3-3 PPIs that can be stabilized with FC-A could provide the stabilization specificity needed for further drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carlile et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  developed a sensitive F508del-CFTR cell-based assay to detect correctors of trafficking (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay showed that FC-A increases F508del-CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane, up to 54% of the positive control VX-809 (at a concentration of 100 µM; Fig 6A), thus confirming the biological relevance of the 14-3-3CFTR PPI and its small-molecule stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes FC-A an F508del-CFTR trafficking corrector with a structurally known mechanism of action, which is rare in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have presented a thorough and quantitative biophysical and structural characterization of the interaction between 14-3-3 and CFTR, and provided clear evidence for a tandem mode-of-action binding event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One anchor binding motif of CFTR (pS768) occupies one binding groove of the 14-3-3 dimer, and a weaker, secondary binding motif (e.g., pS712, pS753, pS795, or pS813) occupies the other binding groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we show that the 14-3-3CFTR interaction can be specifically stabilized by targeting the secondary binding-motif interaction with 14-3-3 with the small-molecule stabilizer FC-A, which thus might display a possible corrector activity in the trafficking of F508del-CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characterization of the 14-3-3CFTR interaction presented in this paper is an important step in understanding the purpose of multisite phosphorylation in disordered domains to initiate 14-3-3 PPIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it provides a promising approach for CF drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
