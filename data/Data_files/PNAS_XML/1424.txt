Warsaw breakage syndrome DDX11 helicase acts jointly with RAD17 in the repair of bulky lesions and replication through abasic sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Warsaw breakage syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by mutations in the conserved DDX11/ChlR1 DNA helicase, shows features of genome instability partly overlapping with those of Fanconi anemia (FA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using avian cellular models of DDX11 deficiency, we find that DDX11 functions as backup to the FA pathway and facilitates, jointly with the checkpoint clamp 9-1-1, a homologous recombination pathway of DNA bulky-lesion repair that does not affect replication fork speed and stalled fork stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDX11 also promotes diversification of the immunoglobulin-variable gene locus by facilitating hypermutation and gene conversion at programmed abasic sites that constitute endogenous replication blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest commonality between postreplicative gap filling and replication through abasic sites and pinpoint DDX11 as a critical player in both these processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Warsaw breakage syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by mutations in the DDX11/ChlR1 helicase, shows cellular features of genome instability similar to Fanconi anemia (FA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that DDX11-deficient avian DT40 cells exhibit interstrand crosslink (ICL)-induced chromatid breakage, with DDX11 functioning as backup for the FA pathway in regard to ICL repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we establish that DDX11 acts jointly with the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp and its loader, RAD17, primarily in a postreplicative fashion, to promote homologous recombination repair of bulky lesions, but is not required for intra-S checkpoint activation or efficient fork progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we find that DDX11 also promotes diversification of the chicken Ig-variable gene, a process triggered by programmed abasic sites, by facilitating both hypermutation and homeologous recombination-mediated gene conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results uncover that DDX11 orchestrates jointly with 9-1-1 and its loader, RAD17, DNA damage tolerance at sites of bulky lesions, and endogenous abasic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These functions may explain the essential roles of DDX11 and its similarity with 9-1-1 during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

DDX11_Helicase_Facilitates_Repair_and_Averts_Genomic_Instability_Induced_by_ICLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effect of DDX11 deficiency in vertebrate cells, we established DT40 knockout cell lines (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDX11/ cells (hereafter ddx11) proliferate normally (24), but are hypersensitive toward cisplatin (CDDP), which causes intra- and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), and methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), which causes bulky lesions (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of ddx11 mutants is complemented by expressing chicken and human DDX11 (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1A), but not by expressing a helicase-dead, K87A variant of chicken DDX11 (cDDX11), carrying inactivating mutations in a conserved lysine residue located in the Walker A motif (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S1B), despite similar levels of expression of these variants (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are observed in both colony formation (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1A) and cellular viability assays (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In similar trends with FA mutants, such as fancc and fancj, ddx11 cells are defective in recovery from a transient exposure to mitomycin C (MMC) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, after exposure to MMC, the frequency of chromosome abnormalities increased, especially in regard to chromatid breaks (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DDX11 is important in averting genome instability induced by ICLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDX11_Functions_as_Backup_to_the_FA_Pathway_in_ICL_Repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the phenotypic relationship between DDX11 and the FA pathway, we established double knockout mutants between DDX11 and FANCC, an FA core component required for FANCD2FANCI ubiquitylation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double mutant fancc ddx11 cells exhibited much greater sensitivity to cisplatin and MMC than either single mutant (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently from fancc mutants, ddx11 cells were proficient in inducing FANCD2 ubiquitylation in response to cisplatin and MMC (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DDX11 is important for ICL repair, acting in parallel with FA or downstream of FANCD2 ubiquitylation in the FA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FA pathway is required to act on metabolic formaldehyde (9), which can cause formation of DNA adducts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ddx11 cells showed mild sensitivity to formaldehyde, but strongly aggravated the sensitivity of fancc mutants (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also established double mutants between DDX11 and FANCJ, as FANCJ is the main helicase associated with the FA pathway, and both DDX11 and FANCJ are orthologs of budding yeast Chl1 (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ddx11 fancj cells showed slow proliferation (Fig 2C), with accumulation of cells in sub-G1 (SI Appendix, Fig S2B), and exhibited synergistic sensitivity to formaldehyde (Fig 2D), suggesting compensatory functions of DDX11 and FANCJ in proliferation and DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DDX11 is dispensable for FANCD2FANCI ubiquitylation and acts as backup to the FA pathway in ICL repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDX11_Facilitates_DNA_Repair_by_Homologous_Recombination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In line with previous reports (27), we found that DDX11 helicase is required to provide resistance against the PARP inhibitor, olaparib (SI Appendix, Fig S3A), which causes lesions that are repaired primarily by HR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate connections with HR, we established double mutants between DDX11 and BRCA2, which is critical for HR and implicated in FA (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ddx11 brca2 cells showed additive sensitivity in regard to both cisplatin and olaparib (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a role for DDX11 in a repair mechanism that responds to olaparib, but which presents distinct features from the BRCA2- and FA core-mediated pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, ddx11 cells are sensitive to the UV mimetic 4NQO (SI Appendix, Fig S3B), suggesting general roles of DDX11 in the repair of bulky lesions, rather than specificity toward ICLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many HR-related FA factors contribute to DSB repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ddx11 cells display sensitivity toward drugs that cause topological stress and ultimately induce DSBs, such as camptothecin, bleomycin, and etoposide (SI Appendix, Fig S3 CE), but are proficient in DSB-induced recombination, as measured with a GFP reporter assay (SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, the negative effects on HR caused by overexpression of the chicken BRC4 repeat of BRCA2 was used as control (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether DDX11 may contribute to HR repair by affecting RAD51 focus formation, we measured RAD51 foci after a short treatment of cells with MMC, followed by recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, RAD51 foci were decreased in ddx11 mutants compared with WT control cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further address a possible role for DDX11 in endogenous recombination-mediated processes, we examined its role in Ig gene conversion, measured as the gain of surface IgM (sIgM) expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DT40 cells carry a frameshift mutation in the Ig light-chain variable (IgV) segment, but gene conversion from pseudo-V segments removes the frameshift mutation, causing sIgM expression (Fig 3D, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT and ddx11 clones were expanded for 14 d, in the absence or presence of tricostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that increases the frequency of Ig gene conversion in DT40 cells (30), thus allowing detection of rare gene-conversion events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both spontaneous and TSA conditions, ddx11 mutants showed significant reduction in the frequency of Ig gene conversion events compared with WT cells (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, the results suggest that DDX11 facilitates HR repair of bulky lesions and gene conversion at the IgV region, but is dispensable for initiating HR at DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDX11_Acts_Jointly_with_9-1-1_to_Facilitate_Postreplicative_DNA_Repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address whether DDX11 repair functions are manifested at the fork, in which case their absence will delay fork speed, we used CldU/IdU double labeling, with each labeling for the same amount of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In unperturbed conditions, the ratio is close to 1, whereas in DNA damaging conditions, the ratio is smaller than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe significant differences between WT and ddx11 cells in either condition (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DDX11 is not essential for replication fork stability, as deduced from the lack of sensitivity of ddx11 cells to aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor (SI Appendix, Fig S4A and see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that DDX11 may manifest its DNA repair functions primarily postreplicatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because PrimPol has been implicated in reinitiating replication upon different types of replication lesions in eukaryotic cells (31), we also generated ddx11 primpol double mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutants showed additive sensitivity toward cisplatin and MMS (SI Appendix, Fig S4B), suggesting that DDX11 affects a step in DNA damage tolerance that is distinct from the replication restart step and TLS functions mediated by PrimPol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step is likely independent of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ubiquitylation, as we found this modification to be proficient in ddx11 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp promotes HR and facilitates repair of various types of replication lesions, including those triggered by ICLs, bulky adducts, and ssDNA gaps (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these features are overlapping to what we uncovered here for ddx11, we next analyzed the functional interaction between DDX11 and 9-1-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we found epistasis between DDX11 and the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp loader, RAD17, in regard to cisplatin and MMS sensitivity (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we analyzed whether DDX11 would act similarly with 9-1-1, or redundantly with it, to facilitate intra-S checkpoint activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently from RAD17, DDX11 was not required for efficient checkpoint activation upon DNA damage as measured by Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig 4C), and did not affect the ability of cells to slow down S phase progression in the presence of DNA damage (SI Appendix, Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, DDX11 was also largely dispensable for survival following hydroxyurea (HU)-induced dNTP pool depletion (Fig 4D), in contrast to the strong effects caused by the rad17 mutation (Fig 4D) or inhibition of Chk1 (SI Appendix, Fig S4E), which functions downstream of 9-1-1 and ATR in the checkpoint response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDX11 was proposed to function together with TimTipin to mediate fork restart upon HU treatment (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the checkpoint proficiency and the modest sensitivity of ddx11 cells to HU (Fig 4 C and D) do not exclude roles in fork protection and fork restart upon HU treatment, here we focused on the joint role of 9-1-1 and DDX11 in DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we tested whether the lesions remaining in ddx11 and rad17 cells are amenable to postreplicative HR repair, a pathway induced by improving sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) in G2/M, after the bulk of DNA replication is complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We improved postreplicative SCC by inhibiting a prophase pathway of cohesin release relying on Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit, SA2 (35) (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that expression of SA2-12A can partly rescue the sensitivity of ddx11 and rad17 cells to cisplatin and MMS (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that SA2 and SA2-12A were expressed at similar levels and strictly induced by doxycycline (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects were observed when the consequences of SA2-12A overexpression were compared with cells that do not induce its expression (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the lesions accumulating in ddx11 and rad17 cells can be repaired postreplicatively by alternate HR pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because HR repair of DNA damage leads to increased sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (36), we measured whether DDX11 and RAD17 were required for this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ddx11 and rad17 mutations did not affect the frequency of SCEs in unperturbed conditions, but impaired the ability of cells to efficiently induce SCEs following treatment with cisplatin, in an epistatic manner (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked whether DDX11 and 9-1-1 play similar or distinct roles in averting genome instability induced by MMC (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed similar and nonadditive effects in single and double mutants, with increased incidence in chromatid breaks upon DNA damage (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, defects in RAD51 focus formation and accumulation of H2AX foci following MMC treatment appeared similar in rad17, ddx11, and ddx11 rad17 double mutants (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, these results indicate that DDX11 and 9-1-1 act jointly to mediate efficient HR-mediated repair in response to replication lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDX11_Facilitates_Ig_Hypermutation_and_Gene_Conversion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better analyze the in vivo role played by DDX11 at endogenous abasic sites (Fig 3D), and its relationship with RAD17, we examined the diversification of the IgV region in WT, ddx11, rad17, and ddx11 rad17 mutants overexpressing AID, required for programmed induction of abasic sites at this locus (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced IgV gene libraries from expanded clones and analyzed the contributions of TLS-mediated hypermutation and gene conversion in this process (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar trend with rad17, and in line with the sIgM assay of gene conversion (Fig 3D), we found a reduction in gene conversion events in ddx11 cells compared with WT (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in gene conversion events was stronger in rad17 cells, and in line with previous reports (32, 39), and ddx11 rad17 showed similar trends with rad17 mutants (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rad17 mutants compensate for the reduction in gene conversion by increasing hypermutation (Fig 6A and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), similarly with mutations in RAD51 paralogues (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ddx11 mutants showed reduction in both hypermutation and gene conversion, and the strongly increased hypermutation events in rad17 cells depended in large part on DDX11 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that DDX11 promotes both gene conversion and TLS-mediated repair of abasic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The importance of the FA pathway in repairing complex lesions such as ICLs is now well established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of genetic disorders that have clinical and cellular overlaps with FA indicates the presence of pathways that can compensate in certain contexts for FA and/or act on other types of endogenous lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlighted that one such pathway is defined by the highly conserved DDX11/ChlR1 helicase mutated in the WABS genetic disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic and cell-based analysis provided in this study, with cellular models of WABS, FA subtypes (FANCC, FANCJ, and BRCA2), and combinations, suggests that DDX11 has roles in averting genome instability and in promoting DNA repair of ICLs, but this function is genetically distinct and secondary in importance to the one of canonical FA components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our study suggests that DDX11 also facilitates DNA damage tolerance of bulky lesions and replication through endogenous abasic sites, in a largely postreplicative manner and in collaboration with 9-1-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although previous studies reported accumulation of postreplicative gaps in human and mouse cells in response to UV damage (4043) or upon RAD51 depletion in Xenopus egg extracts (44), little is known about how postreplicative repair is carried out in vertebrate cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work indicates that DDX11 collaborates with the checkpoint clamp 9-1-1 and its loader, RAD17, in the postreplicative HR repair of bulky lesions, and in facilitating gene conversion induced by abasic sites, but without affecting checkpoint activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the current findings, we propose that 9-1-1, in addition to its role as lesion sensor and activator of ATR, participates together with DDX11 in the postreplicative bypass of replication lesions that are not preferential substrates for the canonical FA pathway or other fork stabilization mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that a noncanonical role for 9-1-1 in the postreplicative HR-mediated repair of replication lesions was observed in budding yeast (45), and that 9-1-1 repair defects can be overcome by overexpressing RAD51 (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model in which the action of 9-1-1 favors the formation of the RAD51 filament on postreplicative gaps, while DDX11 promotes the unwinding of the stalled 3 end (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermediate formed by the joint actions of 9-1-1 and DDX11 may be efficiently matured into an HR intermediate, while in the absence of 9-1-1, the 3 end exposed by the action of the DDX11 helicase may be more readily engaged by TLS polymerases (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A joint role for DDX11 and 9-1-1 in the HR repair of replication lesions and abasic sites may explain why their individual depletion/knockout leads to very similar developmental defects in mouse, with the somitic mesoderm being especially sensitive to the genomic instability produced by their individual mutations (22, 23) and resembling the ones caused by mutations in Brca2 and Palb2 (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These repair functions are likely critical in situations of fast proliferation, such as during early stages of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that DDX11 mitigates replication stress in FANCJ-defective cells and is critical for the repair of olaparib- and cisplatin-induced DNA damage in BRCA2 and FA-defective cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, another implication of our findings is that DDX11 is important for limiting replication stress in FA and BRCA mutated cells, and therefore it may be vital for the survival of these and other cancers, which often suffer from replication stress (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, we propose that the DNA repair pathway mediated by DDX11 has important functions related to replication of endogenous abasic sites and DNA damage tolerance of bulky lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway is critical for human disease and may offer new opportunities for cancer treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
