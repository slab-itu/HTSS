Visualizing in situ translational activity for identifying and sorting slow-growing archaealbacterial consortia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the biggest challenges in environmental microbiology is to determine the activity of uncultured cells directly in their habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report on the application of bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), a high-throughput approach to detecting protein synthesis in individual cells by fluorescence staining, on deep-sea methane seep sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining BONCAT with fluorescence in situ hybridization, we visualized active archaealbacterial consortia catalyzing the anaerobic oxidation of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further developed a novel approach that combines BONCAT with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to separate translationally active cells from complex samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BONCAT-FACS enabled us to directly link the identities of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea with their partner bacteria for individual active consortia, uncovering previously unknown interactions between these archaea and Verrucomicrobia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the biogeochemical roles of microorganisms in the environment, it is important to determine when and under which conditions they are metabolically active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) can reveal active cells by tracking the incorporation of synthetic amino acids into newly synthesized proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic identity of translationally active cells can be determined by combining BONCAT with rRNA-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (BONCAT-FISH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, BONCAT-labeled cells could be isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BONCAT-FACS) for subsequent genetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, in the first application, to our knowledge, of BONCAT-FISH and BONCAT-FACS within an environmental context, we probe the translational activity of microbial consortia catalyzing the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), a dominant sink of methane in the ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These consortia, which typically are composed of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria, have been difficult to study due to their slow in situ growth rates, and fundamental questions remain about their ecology and diversity of interactions occurring between ANME and associated partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our activity-correlated analyses of  greater than 16,400 microbial aggregates provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that AOM consortia affiliated with all five major ANME clades are concurrently active under controlled conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, sorting of individual BONCAT-labeled consortia followed by whole-genome amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed previously unrecognized interactions of ANME with members of the poorly understood phylum Verrucomicrobia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding, together with our observation that ANME-associated Verrucomicrobia are found in a variety of geographically distinct methane seep environments, suggests a broader range of symbiotic relationships within AOM consortia than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Concept for the visualization, identification, and sorting of translationally active cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The bioorthogonal amino acid HPG is added to an environmental sample, which is then incubated under in situ conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After HPG has entered the cell, the exact process of which is currently unknown, it competes with Met for incorporation into newly made peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPG-containing proteins are then fluorescently labeled via a Cu(I)-catalyzed azidealkyne click reaction, thus marking cells that have undergone protein synthesis during time of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Next, rRNA-targeted FISH is performed to taxonomically identify anabolically active cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this example, the yellow cell is detected via both BONCAT and FISH, whereas the other two were either not translationally active (red cell) or are taxonomically unidentified but active (green cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Individual labeled cells or consortia can be separated using FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are lysed and their genomes amplified using MDA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting amplified genomes are taxonomically screened via amplification and sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information may then guide the selection of cells or consortia for genomic sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Establishment_of_HPG_Incubation_Experiments_with_Methane_Seep_Sediment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were obtained from a methane seep from Hydrate Ridge, Oregon, (sample #3730), and a seep site in the Santa Monica Basin, California, (samples #7135, #7136-37, and #7142).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anoxic sediment microcosms were set up in the presence or absence of HPG (5 M or 50 M) and over-pressurized (2 bars) with either N2 or methane followed by incubation in the dark at 4 Â°C for 114 d (#3730), 171 d (#7135), 31 d (#7136-37), and 25 d (#7142).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These long incubation times were necessary due to the slow growth of ANMESRB consortia (37 mo; e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4143), which is attributed to the very low free energy yield of sulfate-coupled AOM (42, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsampling for molecular and geochemical analyses as well as exchange of gaseous headspace and seawater were conducted at regular intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on incubation setup and sampling is provided in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HPG_Amendment_Had_No_Detectable_Effect_on_Microbial_Community_Composition_or_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adding a compound to an environmental sample always bears the risk of altering the structure or function of the microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three independent lines of evidence suggest that, at the concentrations used in this study (50 M), the methionine analog HPG did not affect the geochemical activity or community structure of microbes within methane seep sediment for up to 171 d of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, HPG addition had no effect on sulfide production, a reliable proxy for sulfate-dependent AOM activity (45) in time course experiments (up to 6 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the removal of methane led to a notable and expected decrease (Fig S1A) in sulfide production as previously reported (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, seep sediment from Santa Monica Basin (sediment #7142) incubated with and without HPG over a period of 25 d showed equivalent rates of AOM, as measured by 13C dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production following 13CH4 amendment (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, Illumina tag sequencing (iTAG) of the 16S rRNA V4 region of archaea and bacteria revealed that HPG additions had no statistically significant effect on sediment #3730 and #7135 community compositions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, control incubations of #3730 are indistinguishable from samples containing 50 M HPG after 114 d of incubation (effect of HPG, P = 0.20), with an average Bray Curtis similarity of the communities of 94.4% between all samples (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences related to ANME-2c archaea make up a slightly higher proportion in HPG-containing samples compared with incubations without HPG; however, this observation was not statistically supported (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for #7135, no differences in the composition of the microbial community in general or ANME- and SRB-related lineages in particular between samples incubated in the presence (5 M or 50 M) or absence of HPG were observed (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2, S4, and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 41 d, communities in incubations with or without HPG were, on average, 92.1% similar (Bray Curtis; effect of HPG, P = 0.56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity decreased to 87.989.3% after an additional 130 d of incubation, but without a detectable effect from HPG (P = 0.25; Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of methane in the headspace, however, did result in a statistically significant change in the microbial community (P = 0.042; Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These independent activity and community composition analyses all indicate that the addition of the bioorthogonal amino acid HPG at concentrations up to 50 M did not result in any detectable changes in the seep microbial diversity or activity up to 171 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence_Detection_of_Translationally_Active_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To fluorescently label microbes undergoing active protein synthesis during the incubation, a recently established BONCAT protocol based on the Cu(I)-catalyzed conjugation of HPG with an azide dye (9, 14, 46) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In initial tests, no difference in fluorescence intensity or signal-to-noise ratio was observed between ethanol-fixed, paraformaldehyde-fixed, or nonfixed AOM consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All further experiments were thus performed on ethanol-fixed biomass, unless stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several factors prohibit the absolute quantification of new proteins from fluorescence data (discussed in SI Text), semiquantitative comparisons between different cells of the same taxonomic group may offer information on the functional (translational) activity of uncultured cells in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the text, we refer to DAPI-stained cell clusters that bound an ANME-specific (CARD) FISH probe as microbial (AOM) consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cells within a DAPI-stained cluster could not be unambiguously identified, we use the term microbial aggregate instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BONCAT_as_a_Novel_Approach_to_Study_Anabolic_Activity_of_AOM_Consortia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether BONCAT can be used as a proxy for methane-dependent translational activity of AOM consortia, we used sample #7136-37, representing the 9- to 15-cm depth horizon immediately underlying sediment horizon #7135 (69 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After preincubation of the sediment in the absence of methane for 124 d, microcosm experiments were established with 50 ÂµM HPG in the presence or absence of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 31 d of incubation, microbial aggregates were extracted and analyzed by microscopy (n = 1,554).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under methane-replete conditions, 24.9% of all microbial aggregates were BONCAT-stained, whereas only 2.3% exhibited detectable translational activity when methane was absent from the headspace (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This initial test demonstrated that BONCAT can be used to study the methane-dependent anabolic activity of AOM consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_of_BONCAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all incubations, the relative abundance of translationally active DAPI-stained microbial aggregates increased with time, with 65.8% and 48.5% of aggregates in #3730 and #7135 showing a positive BONCAT signal at the end of incubation (114 d and 171 d, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that, already after 7 d of incubation, 5.6% of the microbial aggregates in sediment #7135 were labeled by BONCAT (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the AOM consortia studied here have growth rates comparable to those previously reported [27 mo (41, 42, 43)], we estimate that BONCAT is able to detect the activities of cells within ANMESRB consortia after 3.37.7% of their doubling time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the differences in the physiology of the organisms as well as the lower fluorescence signal-to-noise ratios observed in environmental systems, this estimate is consistent with our finding of a BONCAT detection limit of less_than2% of generation time for slow-growing Escherichia coli (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At this time, it is unclear why up to half of the DAPI-stained consortia were not BONCAT-stained during the AOM incubation experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may have been the result of storing these deep-sea samples in the laboratory, variable amino acid uptake, or low levels of protein synthesis that are below detection with BONCAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined application of BONCAT and rRNA-targeted FISH demonstrated that all ANME lineages present in our samples are able to incorporate HPG into their biomass (discussed in Multiple Cooccurring ANME Subgroups Were Active Under Identical Incubation Conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that an inability to take up HPG into cells is likely not a problem in our AOM microcosms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is further supported by the observation that AHA and HPG are taken up and incorporated by a range of bacterial and archaeal cultures, including methanogens and sulfate reducers (9, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BONCAT-FISH_as_a_Tool_for_Microbial_in_Situ_Activity_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the quantitative isotopic analysis provided by SIMS and nanoSIMS is currently unparalleled by other single cell techniques, the specialized instrumentation and cost along with comparatively lower sample throughput have restricted its widespread application in the field (10100 consortia per study; e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7, 27, 35, and 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many fundamental questions in microbial ecology regarding the activity and metabolic potential of environmental microbes in situ, however, can be addressed with lower-precision methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the utility of BONCAT as a comparatively high-throughput method for tracking microbial biosynthetic activity, we used epifluorescence microscopy combined with FISH-BONCAT to investigate the translational activities of 14,884 individual microbial aggregates in the presence or absence of methane in microcosms mimicking in situ conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 12,652 aggregates from four #3730 microcosms incubated for 30 d and 114 d were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the activities of 2,232 aggregates from six incubations of sediment #7135 after 7 d, 41 d, and 171 d of incubation were determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the activity of individual consortia is influenced by the phylogenetic affiliation of their partners, we combined BONCAT with rRNA-targeted FISH (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following our recently established protocol (9, 46), we used 11 different 16S and 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes labeled with either a fluorescence dye or horseradish peroxidase (for catalyzed reporter deposition FISH, CARD-FISH) to target the different ANME populations and their associated bacteria present in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were applied in 11 different combinations (see SI Text and Datasets S2 and S3 for details) to study the activity of AOM consortia in the presence or absence of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we visualized the translational activities of 1,346 taxonomically identified AOM consortia (representative images in Fig 3; results in Fig 2, Table 1, and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BONCAT-FISH_Reveals_the_Cooccurrence_of_Diverse_and_Active_AOM_Consortia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Domain-specific FISH probes (Arch915 and EUB338mix) hybridized 37.6% (114 d) and 51.8% (41 d) of microbial aggregates in methane-containing incubations of sediments #3730 and #7135, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the combined application of five fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for the main ANME subpopulations present in our samples (ANME-1, -2a, -2b, and -2c) yielded positive results for only 5.4% (#3730, 114 d) and 5.8% (#7135, 41 d) of microbial aggregates in methane-containing samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other groups of ANME archaea, nitrate-dependent ANME-2d (47) as well as ANME-3, were absent from our methane seep 16S rRNA iTAG datasets and thus were not probed by FISH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with FISH, CARD-FISH yielded slightly lower detection rates for probe Arch915, specific for domain Archaea (55.7% in FISH vs. 53.2% for CARD-FISH for #3730, 114 d of incubation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for the combined application of ANME-specific probes, which, together, hybridized 4.2% of microbial aggregates (5.4% with FISH; Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable hybridization efficiencies were found for samples that had been incubated in the absence of HPG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent CARD-FISH experiments (Table 1 and SI Text) corroborated these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stark discrepancy between domain- and subpopulation-specific probes might be explained by a combination of factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, several available probes specific for different ANME clades are predicted to have low accessibilities to their rRNA target sites (48) and thus may exhibit low fluorescence signal-to-noise ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although most published ANME probes are predicted to comprehensively and specifically detect the diversity of sequences in rRNA databases, we do not know how well these probes cover the full diversity of ANME in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For one subpopulation, ANME-2b, which was represented by 1820% of all ANME-related tag sequences in our sediments (Fig S5), we tried to overcome this problem by designing a new probe, ANME-2b-729.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested in silico, this probe binds to 93% of all ANME-2b 16S rRNA sequences and has at least two mismatches to all non-ANME-2b-related rRNA sequences in public and in-house databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We successfully applied this new probe to our sediment samples (Fig 3 D and E), and the results are described in Table 1 and Dataset S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is possible that a fraction of DAPI-stained aggregates contained archaea unaffiliated to ANME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to most other marine sediments (38), seep sediment #7135 from Santa Monica Basin hosts a variety of archaea unrelated to ANME (917% of all iTAG sequences in our dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The archaeal population in Hydrate Ridge sediment #3730, in contrast, is dominated by ANME (93.297.7% of all archaeal sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is unlikely that archaea unrelated to ANME constituted a substantial number of microbial consortia in #3730.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to our knowledge, no other sediment-dwelling archaea have previously been reported to occur in multicellular associations with bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional discussions on FISH using ANME-specific probes can be found in the SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of all consortia detectable with an ANME-specific FISH probe, 91.4% (sample #3730) and 81.8% (sample #7135) were also BONCAT-positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only 81.4% (#3730) and 58.3% (#7135) of all positively hybridized microbial aggregates (using either domain- or ANME-specific FISH probes) could be detected via BONCAT (Fig 2 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result lends support to the view that rRNA-targeted FISH is not always a reliable proxy for cellular activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there was no statistically supported relationship between BONCAT and FISH signal intensities of individual cells within AOM consortia (n = 5 consortia, each composed of 50200 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Cooccurring_ANME_Subgroups_Were_Active_Under_Identical_Incubation_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methane seeps commonly harbor a wide range of taxonomically distinct ANME clades (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26, 38, 49, and 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity patterns and niche differentiation of these apparently functionally redundant groups are, however, not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, temperature (32), methane partial pressure (32), concentration of sulfate (33, 34) and sulfide (34), and nitrogen availability (35, 36) have directly or indirectly been shown to drive the abundance and activity of different ANME lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using BONCAT, we were able to demonstrate that representatives of all major ANME subpopulations (ANME-1 and ANME-2a, -2b, and -2c) cooccurring in a sediment incubation were biosynthetically active under controlled AOM incubation conditions in the laboratory (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result raises questions about the ecology underlying this apparent functional redundancy and factors influencing niche specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A promising approach for future studies of the functional capacities and niche adaptations of different ANME lineages will be to use isotopically labeled substrates in combination with BONCAT-based activity screening in targeted physiological experiments (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activity_of_ANMESRB_Consortia_in_the_Absence_of_methane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, members of ANME archaea have only been shown to conserve energy through methane oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies, however, have suggested that select ANME populations might be capable of methanogenesis (34, 5155).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anabolic activity of individual ANMESRB consortia in the absence of methane has not, however, been directly demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our BONCAT-FISH studies, we found that, after 30 d of incubation without the addition of methane, 7.9% of DAPI-stained microbial aggregates from sediment #3730 were BONCAT-stained, and, after 114 d, this proportion nearly doubled to 14.6% [5095% of doubling time (4143)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend was observed for sample #7135 (14.5%, 30.4%, and 24.2% BONCAT-positive aggregates after 7 d, 41 d, and 171 d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was in stark contrast to our #7136-37 incubations in the absence of methane, in which only a very small percentage (2.3%) of microbial aggregates were fluorescently labeled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although #3730 and #7135 consortia were clearly BONCAT-stained, their fluorescence intensity was roughly 10-fold lower (n = 20) than consortia incubated in the presence of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with samples incubated in the presence of methane, the relative proportion of BONCAT-stained aggregates that could be attributed to a specific ANME population via (CARD) FISH was also very low in the absence of methane (0.39.8%; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An explanation for activity of AOM consortia in the absence of methane headspace could be that some consortia may have the potential to consume previously accumulated energy storage compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by the observation that some representatives of ANME-2b but not ANME-2c cells feature polyphosphate granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, some ANME-associated SRB might harbor carbon storage compounds (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that more AOM consortia than previously thought are able to build up substantial amounts of energy storage during times of substrate repletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is surprising, given the very low energy yield of the AOM reaction (G0 = 16 kJmol1 at standard conditions) (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding, however, is consistent with the observation that some AOM consortia are able to invest substantial amounts of metabolic energy in N2 fixation (35, 58), one of the most energy-intensive reactions known (16 ATP per N2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation of an increase in active consortia in sediment #3730 over long periods of time (from 7.9% after 30 d to 14.7% after 114 d; Fig 2) is, however, inconsistent with the predicted progressive depletion of storage compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible explanation for results from #3730 could be attributed to an internal methane cycle, in which methanogens produced methane, which was then reoxidized by AOM consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, members of ANMESRB consortia might themselves engage in the production of methane rather than in sulfate-coupled AOM, as previously suggested (5155).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent experiments on the methanogenic potential of ANME-1 and ANME-2 enrichment cultures, however, have not supported this idea (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minor amount of methane was detected in our N2-containing #3730 and #7136-37 microcosms; however, these levels were similar to concentrations measured as a trace contaminant in the N2 tank (110 ppm methane).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported methane partial pressure capable of supporting AOM by methane seep consortia is 1 bar (i.e., 1.4 mM in solution) (32, 45), five orders of magnitude higher than concentrations in our incubations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another intriguing possibility to explain the activity of BONCAT-stained ANMESRB consortia in the absence of methane is that we might not yet recognize the full extent of physiological capabilities of ANMESRB consortia and that they might be involved in energy conservation pathways unrelated to the oxidation or generation of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first step toward formulating hypotheses about potential energy-yielding substrates is to identify specific archaealbacterial partnerships that might differ in their substrate range for targeted genomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Microbial_Partners_Within_Activity-Sorted_Consortia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With a few notable exceptions (10, 11, 39, 6062), single-cell genome sequencing efforts so far have been target-blind; they did not select for a specific taxon of interest or focus on metabolically active cells that could be considered key species for ecosystem functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power of these techniques to investigate microbial partnerships involved in AOM was recently demonstrated by the separation of FISH-identified ANME consortia from methane seep sediments via immunomagnetic capture [magneto-FISH (39, 63)] and fluorescent-activated cell sorting [FISH-FACS (61, 64)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using sorting approaches, associations between ANME and bacteria not known to be capable of sulfate reduction, including members of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria as well as Planctomyces, have been revealed (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the potential of targeted sorting approaches for uncovering rare populations has been demonstrated by the successful enrichment of an ANME-2d population from 2% to 94% (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the potential of BONCAT to separate the functionally active fraction of a microbial community from complex samples, we sorted individual, translationally active consortia from sediments #3730 and #7142 by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this activity-based cell-sorting approach as BONCAT-FACS (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the specificity of the chosen gates, 200 events per gate were sorted into individual tubes and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the BONCAT++ gate, which was used for all downstream analyses, 204 DAPI-stained microbial aggregates were identified, all of which were BONCAT-stained (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slightly higher number of consortia (204 vs. the expected 200) may be due to cosorting of physically attached aggregates or the partial disaggregation of some aggregates after sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consortia sorted into individual wells of microtiter plates were lysed and their genomes amplified via multiple displacement amplification (MDA) following established protocols (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ethanol-fixed biomass from sediment #3730, 76 out of 168 sorted events resulted in an MDA product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This efficiency (45%) is comparable with that of a recent study that reported a success rate of 50% when DNA from cells stored in 70% ethanol was used as PCR template (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By avoiding any cell fixation before sorting of individual consortia (Fig 4), the efficiency of MDA reactions improved to 93% (78 out of 84 sorted events) for the same sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that BONCAT and click chemistry-mediated dye labeling have no detrimental effect on DNA quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixation of biomass was avoided for sediment #7142.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diluted DNA from MDA reactions was used as the template in PCR amplifications targeting the V4 region of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes (67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplicons from PCR reactions that yielded a single band during gel electrophoresis examination were barcoded, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed (Fig 5 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of reactions contained both ANME- and SRB-related sequences in high numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several reactions, however, only sequences from either the ANME or the SRB partner were obtained (sequences from the other cell type were less_than0.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the observed specificity for active microbial aggregates of our sorting approach (Fig 4B), preferential amplification of a single sequence type for this subset may be indicative of bias during cell lysis and/or the MDA reaction, a problem well discussed in the literature (66, 69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions that only recovered SRB sequences (n = 5) were not considered further in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the remaining 45 consortia, a single ANME operational taxonomic unit (OTU; defined here as a unique sequence) represented 93100% of all ANME-associated sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in each individual consortium from sediment #3730, a single OTU always contributed 94100% of all SRB-related sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the relatively low number of consortia analyzed (n = 34), representatives of all ANME clades found in #3730 samples (according to 16S rRNA iTAG data) were retrieved from a single incubation, corroborating the findings of phylogenetic diversity from our BONCAT-FISH studies (findings are summarized in Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports (26, 36, 39, 49, 71), ANME-1 and ANME-2 were predominantly associated with putative sulfate reducers within the delta-proteobacterial lineages Desulfobacterium, Desulfobulbus, Desulfococcus, and Desulfosarcina (Fig 5 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of single consortia further revealed that individual ANME subpopulations (single OTU) are often associated with different bacterial partners, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the seven observed #3730 ANME-2b consortia (identical in their V4 region) have partners within three different bacterial families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, three consortia (A03Uf, C08Uf, and H01Uf) from sediment #7142 each harbored two SRB OTUs (94.998.8% identical in sequence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to sequences from SRB, five consortia from sediment #3730 also yielded low proportions of sequences from bacteria related to Pseudomonas or other gamma-proteobacteria (Fig 5 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sequences were taxonomically different from commonly observed laboratory contaminants and were distinct from sequences detected in overamplified negative controls or control mock communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result, together with (i) the finding of highly similar gamma-proteobacterial sequences in a magneto-FISH study of AOM consortia (39), (ii) our demonstration that translationally active gamma-proteobacteria and archaea form consortia in sediment #3730 (Dataset S2), and (iii) the observation that individual ANME OTUs in different consortia were associated with diverse bacterial groups, lend strong support to the idea that AOM partnerships are dynamic, both in terms of partner affiliation and possibly their ecophysiology (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discovery_of_a_New_Interdomain_Partnership  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rRNA gene sequences obtained from an ANME-1a consortium (#E06) from #3730 did not contain sequences related to known sulfate reducers, but instead recovered sequences associated with Verrucomicrobia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences retrieved from a second consortium (#D05) also contained the same ANME-1a OTU, in addition to both Desulfobulbaceae sequences and another Verrucomicrobia-affiliated OTU (sequence 80% identical to the E06 OTU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Verrucomicrobia-affiliated sequences had 81% identity to rRNA genes from previously described species (Fig 5 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement our sequence-based observations, we used FISH to screen 27 samples from nine methane seep sediment cores obtained from a variety of geographic locations as well as two carbonates retrieved from a methane vent site for the association of Verrucomicrobia with AOM consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two 16S rRNA-targeted probes specific for the phylum Verrucomicrobia (EUB338-III and Ver47) (7274), in combination with the general archaeal probe Arch915, to screen archaeal aggregates from these samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In four sediments (#3730 incubated for 30 d and 114 d in the presence of HPG and methane; sediments #5119, #5202, and #7142) as well as both carbonate samples (#2450 and #3439), verrucomicrobial cells were associated with 1020% of AOM consortia (Dataset S3 and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the vast majority (98%) of these aggregates contained only low numbers of Verrucomicrobia (less_than20 per aggregate), a small number (n = 14) of aggregates exhibited very high ratios of verrucomicrobial to archaeal cells (Fig 5, Fig S7, and Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the near-ubiquitous distribution of Verrucomicrobia in marine sediments (75), including all 23 methane seeps recently surveyed via 16S iTAG sequencing (38), archaealverrucomicrobial associations have not been described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the loss of structural information during DNA extraction and the typically low abundance of consortia consisting of ANME and nontraditional partner bacteria (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39 and 40 and this study), metagenomic sequencing has so far failed to provide metabolic predictions on the whole diversity of these microbial associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reinforce the imperative to combine genomic sequencing with spatially resolved approaches, such as microscopy and cell sorting (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, 69, and 76), to gain access to the genetic potential of these important associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At this time, we can only speculate about the biological necessities driving the physical association of Verrucomicrobia with ANME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia associated with AOM consortia, however, suggests that these cells might be heterotrophs, consuming organic exudates or exopolymers of the archaeal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar cross-feeding relationship has previously been hypothesized for anammox bacteria cooccurring with ANME-2d archaea (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic sequencing of individual ANMEVerrucomicrobia aggregates sorted via BONCAT-FACS combined with additional microcosm experiments may assist with expanding our understanding of the nature of these ANMEverrucomicrobial interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion_and_Outlook  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The possibility of detecting anabolic activity of taxonomically identified cells using fluorescence staining offers a valuable complement to existing fluorescence microscopy methods for microbial ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BONCAT-FISH allows the activity screening of thousands of cells within a few hours, rather than a few dozen per day as achieved by isotope labeling techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both bioorthogonal (this study) and nondestructive isotope labeling (10, 60) approaches further allow the sorting of individual cells and aggregates from complex samples, although sorting throughput for BONCAT-FACS is much higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted cells can be subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA) and sequencing, thus allowing direct access to the genetic potential of cells functionally important under defined conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to isotope labeling approaches, which test whether cells are able to assimilate a specific substrate of interest (1, 5, 6, 77), BONCAT is an untargeted marker of translational activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, BONCAT cannot directly provide information about specific substrate metabolism, as is possible with isotope probing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the possibility of combining BONCAT-incubations with the addition of any other compound allows for in situ metabolic screening and comparative analysis of organisms stimulated by the compound (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we anticipate that BONCAT-FISH will be particularly attractive if nonassimilatory pathways or substrates that are not (or only very expensively) available as stable isotope-labeled derivatives are to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth-promoting substrates could, in the following, be used for the targeted cultivation of translationally responsive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to isotope labeling approaches, which require specialized instrumentation, BONCAT-FISH and BONCAT-FACS use standard configuration microscopes and flow cytometers that are more readily available to molecular biological laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we established that HPG at concentrations up to 50 M can be applied to marine methane seep sediments without detectable effects on the structure and function of the microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the subsequent detection of HPG-containing de novo synthesized proteins via click chemistry is a powerful approach to visualizing and identifying translationally active microbes in situ, separating them from complex samples via activity-based cell sorting, and studying microbial interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that representatives of all major subgroups of ANME are functionally active in Hydrate Ridge seep sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that, in two geographically distinct sediments, some consortia are active in the absence of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be tested whether these findings are entirely the result of the use of cellular storage materials or a physiological flexibility of these archaea that is yet unaccounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for the existence of previously unrecognized interactions of archaea and Verrucomicrobia in marine sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that genomic characterizations of these as well as other diverse ANMESRB consortia will soon provide hypotheses about potential growth-supporting substrates, and that BONCAT-FISH and BONCAT-FACS will play important roles in experimentally testing the ecophysiological properties of these globally relevant microbial partnerships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incubation_of_Methane_Seep_Sediment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were obtained from three sediment cores taken off the coasts of California (Santa Monica Basin) and Oregon (Hydrate Ridge) and incubated in the presence of absence of HPG and methane for up to 6 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for geochemical characterization, whole-community composition, and microscopic analyses were taken in regular intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on these experimental procedures are described in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BONCAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BONCAT was performed following our recently established protocol without modifications (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Succinctly, fixed biomass (whole sediment or extracted consortia) was immobilized on Teflon-coated glass slides and dried at 46 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increasing ethanol series [50%, 80%, and 96% ethanol in double-distilled water (ddH2O)] was performed, and the slides were air-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutions were prepared as recently described (46), and the click cocktail was always freshly mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solution contained 5 mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM amino-guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 M Tris[(1-hydroxypropyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (THPTA; Click Chemistry Tools), 100 M CuSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 M of azide-modified dye carboxyrhodamine 110 (CR-110; Click Chemistry Tools) or azide-modified 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA; Click Chemistry Tools) (used only in combination with CARD-FISH) in 0.2-m-filtered 1Ã PBS, pH 7.4; 20 L of this solution was applied on top of biomass, and the glass slides were incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) in a humid chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, slides were washed repeatedly in 1Ã PBS and an increasing ethanol series (50%, 80%, and 96%), before being air-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details on this protocol, see Hatzenpichler and Orphan (46) and Hatzenpichler et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonfixed samples were processed following the same protocol with the difference that all ethanol washing steps were omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FISH_and_CARD_FISH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following BONCAT, ethanol-washed samples were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FISH experiments, double-labeled (78) or monolabeled probes with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescence dyes were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FISH hybridizations were performed overnight (1418 h) according to standard protocols (9, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of all probe solutions (except ANME-2-932) was checked using other seep samples before they were applied to #3730 and #7135-37 sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tested probe solutions yielded a large number of positive hybridizations to AOM consortia in these control samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each probe or probe set was hybridized in a technical duplicate or triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences in fluorescence intensity or relative proportion of (CARD) FISH-positive consortia could be observed between replicate hybridizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CARD-FISH was performed as recently described (80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three different cell wall digestion protocols were tested, but only one, a modified version of a recently published protocol (36), was found to be successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Permeabilization was performed at RT as follows: incubation in 0.01 M HCl for 15 min; two washing steps in ddH2O, 1 min each; incubation in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 5 min; three washing steps in ddH2O, 1 min each; incubation in 50% (vol/vol) ethanol in ddH2O for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After air-drying, samples were hybridized for 1418 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated oligonucleotides (purchased from Biomers) before signal amplification using self-synthesized fluorescein-labeled tyramide was carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microscopy_and_Image_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were mounted with 1 mgmL1 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) in Citifluor AF-1 antifading solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and analyzed using either an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope or a Zeiss LSM-510-Meta confocal laser-scanning microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 12,652, 2,232, and 1,554 consortia were analyzed for sediments #3730, #7135, and #7136-37, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower number of consortia analyzed for the latter samples is explained by the much lower concentration of AOM consortia in that sediment core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each DAPI-stained microbial aggregate was manually inspected for BONCAT and FISH signals, and representative images were taken for each probe set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consortia were always identified via DAPI, before switching to the other fluorescent channels to not preferentially select for BONCAT-positive or FISH-positive consortia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed list of BONCAT-FISH counts can be found in Datasets S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In every BONCAT-positive aggregate, either (i) (nearly) all cells within an aggregate were stained or, in rare cases, (ii) (nearly) all cells of one (but not the other) cell type (archaea or bacteria) were stained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the complex 3D structure of the aggregates, which sometimes grow many thousands of cells large (Fig 3A), we cannot exclude that, in rare cases, individual cells (less_than5%) of a specific cell type were not stained (hence the term nearly all).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After shipping and storage at 4 Â°C for 3 d, activity-sorted consortia were resuspended in 1 mL 1Ã PBS before being harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 16,100 Ã g; RT), resuspended in 1:1 1Ã PBS:ethanol, and immobilized on a glass slide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slide was washed for 1 min in 50% ethanol (in ddH2O), air-dried, DAPI-embedded, and microscopically analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consortia were counted following the same procedure as outlined above, and representative images were taken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activity-Based_Cell_Sorting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial tests were performed using pure cultures and mixtures of E. coli K-12, Methyloprofundus sedimenti WF-1 (81), and Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 that had been incubated in the absence or presence (250 M) of HPG for approximately one generation and stained using an azide-modified version of dye CR110 as recently described (9, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After successful tests, BONCAT-treated sediment-extracted consortia from samples #3730 and #7142 were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BD Influx cell sorter was sterilized, and sheath fluid was prepared using 1Ã PBS, as recently described (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After passing through a 70-m nylon mesh filter, samples were sorted using a 200-m nozzle at 0.21 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sort mode was 1.0 drop single; 2Ã 84 single events were deposited into wells E4L15 of two 384-well plates, with rows D and L serving as negative control wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BONCAT dye CR110 was excited using a 488-nm laser, and fluorescence was captured with a 531-nm/30-nm filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gates were defined using a forward scatter (FSC) vs. 531-nm emission plot, and events with a BONCAT signal brighter than  greater than 90% of aggregates in the negative control were captured (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For quantification of sorted consortia, 200 events identified within each gate were sorted into 1.5-mL tubes that contained 10 L 1Ã PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubes were stored at 4 Â°C until further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequence_Access  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequences have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database under accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KT945170KT945234 and KU564217KU564240 (16S rRNA iTAG sequences from activity-sorted consortia in #3730 and #7142, respectively) and Sequence Read Archive under accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRP066109 (whole-community 16S rRNA iTAG sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SI_Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Factors_Limiting_the_Absolute_Quantification_of_Newly_Synthesized_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BONCAT has the theoretical potential to detect all de novo synthesized proteins that contain at least one Met, i.e., ~99% of proteins in an average archaeal and bacterial proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in practice, several factors reduce this sensitivity and prohibit the absolute quantification of the amount of new protein, and, in consequence, of cell doubling times, from fluorescence data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The process(es) by which HPG enters the cell is currently unknown and might depend on the physiological state of the cell or differ between different taxonomic groups; (ii) the rate at which HPG substitutes Met during protein synthesis has, so far, only been studied for E. coli (17) and might deviate in other organisms; (iii) due to varying contents of Met and contrasting copy numbers of proteins, distinct peptides contribute differently to overall fluorescence; and (iv) the extent by which protein recycling and posttranslational modification affect the stability of HPG (in particular its alkyne group) is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CARD-FISH_vs_FISH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our CARD-FISH experiments revealed marked discrepancies in the efficiencies to permeabilize and fluorescently detect different ANME subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, although ANME-1 constituted only 0.6% of all taxonomically identified consortia in our FISH experiments on sample #3730 (114 d sample; n = 167 consortia), the same subgroup represented 81.3% of detected ANME consortia in our CARD-FISH dataset (n = 48) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is mainly explained by the inability of the used CARD-FISH protocol to detect ANME-2a and -2c consortia in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in contrast to two recent studies that used near-identical permeabilization protocols for the successful visualization of these ANME groups in other methane seep sediments (36, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparing_ANME_Community_Structure_in_Sediment_#3730_to_Previous_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The very low proportion of aggregated ANME-1 in our Hydrate Ridge sediment (#3730) is consistent with a previous study on this methane seep, which found that ANME-1 occurred mostly as planktonic cells rather than in multicellular associations (26, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of our focus on syntrophic consortia in this study, we initially separated microbial aggregates of  greater than 3 Âµm from sediment particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Planktonic ANME-1 cells thus might have partly evaded FISH detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should, however, be noted that our filtered samples contained large numbers of individual cells and that in no #3730 sample were individual cells found to bind the ANME-1-specific probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ANME-2a and -2c probes used in this study have been successfully used in previous mono-FISH studies of geographically distinct Hydrate Ridge sediment samples with hybridization rates of 2080% of all DAPI-stained AOM consortia (37, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the high spatial variance in ANME community structure (37, 38), it is, however, possible that our specific sediment samples hosted a unique combination of ANME clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, ANME community structure might have diverged from its original composition during the nearly 4 y of incubation in the laboratory before the experiments described herein were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Considerations_on_the_Environmental_Application_of_BONCAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to the well-established stable isotope probing approach, the universal applicability of BONCAT is currently untested, and several questions demand rigorous investigation in future studies: (i) The mechanism(s) by which bioorthogonal amino acids are taken up by cells is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If active transporters are required for their uptake, their absence would prohibit the application of BONCAT to that particular cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that effect, the recent report of up to 100% BONCAT labeling efficiency of planktonic microbes in surface seawater is encouraging (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) HPG and AHA, the bioorthogonal amino acids that have been used in environmental studies so far (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 14 and this study), have to compete with intracellular Met for incorporation into newly being made proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preference of the translational machinery for Met over its synthetic surrogates (17) might therefore restrict the use of BONCAT in habitats featuring high concentrations of free Met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Lastly, substituting proteins with synthetic amino acids bears a high risk of interfering with the cellular machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently demonstrated that the addition of up to 1 mM of HPG or AHA had no detectable effect on the growth of several different, physiologically distinct archaeal and bacterial pure cultures for at least one cell generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At longer incubation times, however, inhibition of growth could be observed at these high concentrations (9, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For environmental applications, we thus recommend that low concentrations of bioorthogonal amino acid should be used, incubation times be kept to a minimum, and complementary experiments testing for potential community shifts be performed (for details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Environmental_Sampling_and_Storage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment sample #3730 was obtained from Hydrate Ridge South methane seep field (R/V Atlantis cruise AT-15-68, Alvin Dive 4635; push-core 16; 44Â°34.09 N, 125Â°9.14 W; 775 m water depth; sediment horizon 06 cm; 4 Â°C in situ temperature) on 7 August 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment was stored under argon headspace in a Mylar bag for 5 wk before being transferred to a 1-L glass bottle with a 1.38 bar 100% methane headspace, which was stored at 4 Â°C for ~4 y. Seawater and headspace were exchanged at regular intervals to prevent the accumulation of inhibitory compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment samples #7135 and #7136-37/37 were collected from Santa Monica Basin on 9 May 2013 (R/V Western Flyer MBARI Cruise 2013; dive 463; push-core 43; 33Â°47.34 N, 118Â°40.10 W; 860 m water depth; horizons 69 cm (#7135) and 915/1522 cm (#7136-37/37, pooled) below a pink and white microbial mat; 4 Â°C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment slurry was stored in a glass bottle for 1 y under argon at 4 Â°C before BONCAT experiments were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment sample #7142 was collected from Santa Monica Basin on 7 May 2013 (R/V Western Flyer MBARI Cruise 2013; dive 459; push-core 74; 33Â°47.34 N, 118Â°40.09 W; 863 m depth; sediment horizon 46 cm; 4 Â°C in situ temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediment was sealed under argon and stored at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 40 d of storage, the sediment was suspended in anaerobic natural bottom seawater from the site in an anaerobic chamber (3% H2 in N2) and aliquots were overpressured with 1.5 bar methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediment was kept for 12 mo under 1.5 bar 100% methane in natural bottom seawater that was exchanged every 3 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment sample #5119 was collected from the Hydrate Ridge methane field during R/V Atlantis Cruise AT-18-10 on 1 September 2011 (44Â°40.02 N, 125Â°6.00 W; dive J2-593 E4A; push-core 36 through a yellow microbial mat; water depth 600 m; sediment horizon 912 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment #5202 was collected during the same cruise on 3 September 2011, dive J2-593 E6B (44Â°40.02 N, 125Â°7.51 W; push-core 18 through a pink and white microbial mat; water depth 601 m; horizon 36 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbonate #3439 was collected from atop an active seep at the Hydrate Ridge methane field during cruise AT-15-68 on 1 August 2010 (44Â°34.09 N, 125Â°9.14 W; dive AD4629; water depth 775 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonate sample #2450 was retrieved from sediment sample #2450 collected at Eel River Basin on 27 July 2005 (40Â°48.68 N,  124Â°36.73 W; dive T-864; push-core 49; horizon 02 cm; water depth 516 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information on the geochemical characteristics of the sampling sites may be requested from the corresponding authors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Setup_of_Incubations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All samples were kept in an ice bath at all times during handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artificial seawater (ASW) consisted of 10.9 g of MgCl26H2O, 0.2 g of NaHCO3, 0.76 g of KCl, 25.9 g of NaCl, 1.47 g of CaCl22H2O, 3.98 g of Na2SO4, and 26.73 mg of NH4Cl per liter of ddH2O at pH 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One milliliter of vitamin solution (see medium 141, https://www.dsmz.de) and 1 mL of trace element solution SL-10 (see https://www.dsmz.de) were also added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before use, ASW was filtered through a 0.2-Âµm filter and N2-bubbled for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASW was kept on ice during handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 50 mL of wet sediment #3730 was resuspended in ASW, yielding a total volume of 130 mL; 20-mL aliquots of homogenized slurry were transferred into 160-mL serum bottles, and 30 mL of ASW was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers, and headspaces were flushed with either 100% methane or 100% N2 for 5 min before being pressurized with 2 bar 100% methane or 100% N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment was allowed to equilibrate overnight (18 h) at 4 Â°C in the dark; 0.2 m-filtered HPG (Click Chemistry Tools) in ddH2O was added to reach a final concentration of 50 M. Control incubations without HPG were supplemented with sterile ddH2O to reach equal volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All bottles were then flushed for 5 min, pressurized with 2 bar methane or N2, and incubated in the dark at 4Â° C. In total, six incubations were performed: two times without HPG plus methane, two times with 50 M HPG plus methane, and two times with 50 M HPG plus N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 100 mL of wet sediment #7135 was resuspended in ASW, yielding a total volume of 300 mL, and incubated for 15 d under 2 bar 100% methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this preincubation, 100 mL of ASW was added, and the slurry was homogenized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under constant N2 flushing, 35-mL aliquots were transferred into 160-mL serum bottles, bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers, and headspaces were flushed for 5 min with either 100% methane or 100% N2, depending on incubation setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPG was added to reach a final concentration of either 5 M or 50 M. In addition, controls without HPG were supplemented with sterile ddH2O to reach equal incubation volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, all bottles were flushed for 5 min, overpressurized with 2 bar methane or N2, and incubated in the dark at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 12 incubations were performed: four times without HPG plus methane, four times with 50 M HPG plus methane, two times with 50 M HPG plus N2, and two times with 5 M HPG plus methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twenty milliliters of wet sediment #7136-37 was resuspended in ASW, yielding a total volume of 50 mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slurry was bubbled with N2 for 10 min (this was repeated after 5 d) before the bottle was incubated for 124 d under 2 bar N2 (detectable but nonquantifiable amount of methane, 110 ppm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this prestarving, 10-mL aliquots were transferred into 75-mL bottles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPG was added to reach a final concentration of 50 ÂµM, and 2 bar 100% methane or 100% N2 (2 bar) was added to the headspace of two aliquots each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a control mesocosm was incubated without HPG under 100% methane (2 bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All bottles were incubated at 4 Â°C in the dark for 31 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One-milliliter aliquots of wet sediment #7142 in 5 mL ASW containing 25 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mM sulfide, and 5 mM DIC were resuspended in serum vials, which were then sealed with rubber stoppers (12.9 mL final volume).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The headspace was flushed with 12CH4 before 1.0 mL 13CH4 (99% 13C, containing 0.05 vol% 13CO2 as impurity; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 d of preincubation, HPG was added to two of the four bottles to reach a concentration of 50 M. In addition, one incubation was performed at 250 ÂµM HPG for 25 d and later used for activity-based cell sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling_for_Molecular_and_Geochemical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sampling of sediment microcosms was undertaken at incubation start as well as after 30 d, 73 d, and 114 d and 7 d, 14 d, 41 d, 56 d, and 171 d for sediment #3730 and #7135, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for molecular, cellular, and geochemical analyses were removed using sterile syringes while the incubation bottles were kept in an ice bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At each sampling point, 0.25 mL of sediment slurry was transferred into a sterile 1.5-mL tube and centrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 s at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant (SN) was removed, mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 0.5 M Zn-acetate solution, and stored for later sulfide analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was flash-frozen using liquid N2 and stored at 20 Â°C for DNA extraction; 0.25 mL of sediment slurry was removed, centrifuged as described above, the SN was wasted, and the pellet was resuspended in a 1:1 mix of 1Ã PBS and absolute ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 0.25 mL was processed in the same way but resuspended in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 1Ã PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT for chemical fixation of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, biomass was harvested by centrifugation, the SN was wasted, and the pellet was washed with 1.5 mL of 1Ã PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, sediment was centrifuged, the SN was wasted, and the biomass was resuspended in a 1:1 mix of 1Ã PBS and ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ethanol- or PFA-fixed samples were kept at 20 Â°C until further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sampling (30 d, 73 d, and 114 d and 7 d, 14 d, 41 d, 56 d, and 171 d for #3730 and #7135, respectively), the headspace of bottles was flushed for 3 min with either methane or N2 before the sediment was again incubated at 4 Â°C with 2 bar of either 100% methane or 100% N2, depending on incubation setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, after 73 d (#3730) and 41 d and 130 d (#7135), 90% of artificial seawater overlying sediment was exchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slurry volume and sediment-to-water ratio of all incubations was identical at all times for each sediment type (#3730 or #7135, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When appropriate, newly added seawater was then supplemented with 5 M or 50 M (final) HPG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geochemical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sulfide (H2S plus HS) concentrations were determined via the cline assay (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analyzed for statistically relevant differences via Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences were considered to be significant at P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methane oxidation rates for sediment #7142 were determined as described by Scheller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29) by measuring the formation of DIC from 13CH4 over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Succinctly, 0.25 mL of ASW overlying settled sediment was removed and centrifuged (16,000 Ã g for 5 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SN was transferred into 0.6-mL tubes, flash frozen in N2, and stored at 20 Â°C until further processing; 150 L of thawed SN was then added to He-flushed vials containing 100 L H3PO4 (85%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting CO2 was analyzed for isotopic enrichment on a GC-IR-MS GasBench II (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_Microbial_Aggregates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To separate microbial aggregations and individual cells from sediment particles, 50 L of sediment slurry was resuspended in 450 L of 1Ã PBS in a 2-mL tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solution was chilled in an ice bath for 15 min before being sonicated three times for 10 s at 36 W output using a Branson Sonifier 150 (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between pulsing intervals, the sample was allowed to cool for 1030 s. After sonication, the sample was applied on top of 500 L Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 16,100 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove Percoll particles and the majority of individual planktonic cells, the entire SN was resuspended in 15 mL 1Ã PBS and filtered through a 3-m TSTP white polycarbonate filter (EMD Millipore) using a filter tower at 0.3 bar under pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each filter was washed with a total volume of 50 mL 1Ã PBS without letting the filter run dry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, particles and biomass that had been retained by the filter were transferred into a 2-mL tube using 1Ã PBS by repeatedly and vigorously pipetting up and down using a 1-mL pipette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAPI staining confirmed that this protocol leads to the near-complete transfer of microbial aggregates from the filter into solution (99100% of DAPI-stained consortia), without selecting for or against a particular type of consortium morphology or size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfer into 1Ã PBS, biomass was harvested via centrifugation (16,100 Ã g, RT), resuspended in either 1Ã PBS (for nonfixed BONCAT analyses) or a 1:1 ratio of 1Ã PBS and ethanol (fixed biomass), and stored at either 4 Â°C (nonfixed) or 20 Â°C (fixed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

List_of_Oligonucleotide_Probes_for_FISH_and_CARD-FISH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In FISH experiments, monolabeled and dual-labeled (indicated with ** in the list below) probes were used in different combinations (Dataset S2): Arch915, specific for most members of the domain Archaea (83), used at 35% formamide (FA); EUB338, -II, and -III (also known as EUB338mix), which together cover most of the known bacterial diversity (72, 84), used at 35% FA; EUB338-III, specific for most members of the Verrucomicrobia (72), used at 35% FA, in combination with EUB338-I and -II as competitor probes; Delta495a** together with its competitor probe, specific for most delta-proteobacteria (85), used at 35% FA; Gam42a, together with its competitor, specific for most gamma-proteobacteria (86), used at 35% FA; Ver47**, specific for Verrucomicrobia (73) together with its helper probe H64 (74) at 15% FA; and ANME-1-350 (26) (40% FA), ANME-2-932 (also known as EelMS-932; 26) (40% FA), ANME-2a-647 (50% FA) (37), and ANME-2c-760** (60% FA) (37), specific for different subpopulations of ANME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a new probe, ANME-2b-729, was designed, which detects  greater than 93% of all ANME-2b-affiliated 16S rRNA sequences in online and laboratory internal databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new probe has at least two mismatches to all other archaeal or bacterial 16S rRNA sequences [tested using probeCheck (87)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After careful evaluation, ANME-2b-729 was used at 20% formamide concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this probe has a one-nucleotide overlap with probe ANME-2-712 (37) and should thus not be used in conjunction with this probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybridizations without probe addition or probe NONEUB388 (88) were used as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the exception of probe ANME-2a-647, which was used at 40% FA (rather than 50%), all probes used in CARD-FISH were used at the same FA concentrations as in FISH experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CARD-FISH, hybridizations with probe NONEUB388 were used as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Displacement_Amplification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual sorted consortia were lysed and subjected to WGA as previously described (65) with the following modifications: WGA was performed with a REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen) with a scaled-down reaction volume of 2 L and DNA dye SYTO-13 added at 1Ã for real-time tracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell lysis procedure followed a recently described protocol (65), which was modified by lysozyme treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step included a 15-min RT incubation with 300 nL of 50 U/ÂµL ReadyLyse lysozyme (Epicentre R1810M), which was followed by the addition of 50 nL concentrated DLB buffer (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysis and stop reagents were UV-treated as described (65), and the Master Mix was used as obtained from the manufacturer (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification reaction was incubated for 6 h at 30 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_16S_rRNA_Gene_Tag_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment DNA was extracted using the Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturers protocol (MoBio), and diluted DNA from genome-amplified sorted consortia was used directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from each extract using archaeal and bacterial primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) (67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment samples were amplified in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonbarcoded primers were used with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2Ã Master Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturers directions, using annealing conditions of 54 Â°C for 30 cycles and 58 Â°C for 32 cycles for sediments and MDAs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplicates of sediment sample amplifications were then pooled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barcoded 806R primer (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT XXXXXXXXXXXX AGTCAGTCAG CC GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) was paired with 515F in a reconditioning reaction (same conditions as above except for five cycles of PCR) to barcode the PCR products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were mixed together in equimolar amounts and purified in bulk through a Qiagen PCR purification kit before submission to Laragen for analysis on an Illumnia MiSeq platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting paired-end sequence data, 2Ã 250 bp, was demultiplexed, and sequences with  greater than 1 bp mismatch on the 12-bp barcode were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting sequences were passed through Illuminas MiSeq Recorder software to assign quality scores to each base call and remove adapter, barcode, and primer sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_16S_rRNA_Gene_Tag_Sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence data were processed in QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) version 1.8.0 (89) following a recently published protocol (90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw sequence pairs were joined and quality-trimmed using the default parameters in QIIME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were clustered into de novo OTUs with 99% similarity using UCLUST open reference clustering protocol (91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the most abundant sequence was chosen as representative for each de novo OTU (92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxonomic identification for each representative sequence was assigned using the SILVA-115 database (93, 94) clustered at 99% similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This SILVA database had been appended with 1,197 in-house high-quality, methane-seep derived bacterial and archaeal clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any sequences with pintail values  greater than 75 were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified SILVA database is available upon request from the corresponding authors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OTUs were then filtered to remove singletons from the combined MDA dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A threshold filter was used to remove any OTU that occurred below 0.01% of the entire combined sediment samples dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Known contaminants in PCR reagents as determined by the analysis of negative and positive controls run with each MiSeq set were also removed (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sediment samples, the sequence data were rarified by random subsampling to equal the sample with the least amount of sequence data, resulting in 12,115 and 3,707 sequences per sample for sediments #3730 and #7135, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tables of both absolute and relative abundances were generated at the family level for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical and similarity percentage analyses [Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM), and Similarity Percentage], family-level abundance tables were square-root-transformed before generation of Bray Curtis similarity matrices and analyzed using Primer-E software (www.primer-e.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences were considered to be significant at P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 16S rRNA gene tag sequences from each consortium as well as closely related sequences from online databases (identified via the BLAST algorithm of National Center for Biotechnology Information) were imported into and analyzed via the ARB software package (96).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were automatically aligned to reference sequences of all ANME subpopulations as well as relevant bacterial clades contained within the SILVA-115 database that had been amended with 1,197 in-house seep derived clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences from cultured representatives of archaeal phyla Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were used as outgroup for reconstruction of the archaeal tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the Planctomycetes where chosen as outgroup for the bacterial tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both alignments were manually curated, and termini filters were created.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the phylogenetic reconstruction of archaeal (all  greater than 1,100 nt in length) and bacterial (all  greater than 1,000 nt in length) sequences, 958 and 1,255 positions were considered, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenies were modeled using a Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RaxML) algorithm, and short tag sequences were individually added to the resulting tree using the parsimony interactive tool in ARB without changing the overall topology of the tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, maximum parsimony (100Ã replications) and Neighbor Joining (1,000Ã replications) trees were calculated, and bootstrap values were projected onto the RaxML tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
