Spop promotes skeletal development and homeostasis by positively regulating Ihh signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skeletal diseases place a huge burden on patients and society, and yet their genetic basis remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we identify Speckle-type POZ protein (Spop) as a regulator of skeletal development, loss of which leads to shorter digit bones and lower bone density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that, in striking contrast to the current dogma positing Spop as a negative regulator of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, Spop regulates skeletal development by promoting Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our work represents an important conceptual advance in the understanding of Ihh signaling and skeletal development and provides a potential new target for the diagnosis and intervention of bone diseases such as osteoporosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) regulates chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation through the Glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous in vitro studies suggested that Speckle-type POZ protein (Spop), part of the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex, targets Gli2 and Gli3 for degradation and negatively regulates Hedgehog (Hh) signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we found defects in chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation in Spop-null mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, both the full-length and repressor forms of Gli3, but not Gli2, were up-regulated in Spop mutants, and Ihh target genes Patched 1 (Ptch1) and parathyroid hormone-like peptide (Pthlh) were down-regulated, indicating compromised Hh signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this finding, reducing Gli3 dosage greatly rescued the Spop mutant skeletal defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that Spop directly targets the Gli3 repressor for ubiquitination and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate in a conditional mutant that loss of Spop results in brachydactyly and osteopenia, which can be rescued by reducing the dosage of Gli3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, Spop is an important positive regulator of Ihh signaling and skeletal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spop__but_Not_Spopl__Is_Required_for_Normal_Skeletal_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the requirement for Spop in development, we characterized two Spop mutant mouse strains (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first strain, Spoptm1a(KOMP)Mbp, or SpoplacZKI, contained a bacterial -galactosidase (lacZ) reporter in the third intron of Spop, which was predicted to terminate Spop transcription after the third exon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removal of the fourth and fifth exons of Spop in the second strain, SpopEx, similarly truncated the Spop protein after exon 3 due to a frameshift (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both alleles were likely null because the predicted protein products lacked the entire POZ (Cul3-binding) and MATH (substrate-binding) domains (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the absence of Spop protein in the homozygotes of both mutant alleles by immunoblot analyses using an Spop-specific antibody (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous mutant pups of both strains died shortly after birth, similar to a previous report, consistent with the prediction that they are both likely null (25) (Fig S1 C and D and Tables S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we refer to both mutant alleles as Spop for brevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lacZ reporter in the SpoplacZKI allele allowed us to detect the expression pattern of Spop with great sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, starting from embryonic day (E) 12.5, Spop-lacZ was expressed at high levels in the developing endochondral skeleton, including the long bones, costal cartilage, ribs, and vertebrae (Fig 1A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer look revealed lacZ expression in the chondrocytes and perichondrium, as well as surrounding mesenchymal cells that are possibly muscle precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust expression of Spop was also present in the primordium of dermal bones (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strong Spop expression in the developing cartilage prompted us to examine endochondral ossification in Spop mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found delayed calcification in the ribs, vertebrae, and long bones in Spop mutants at multiple stages (Fig S3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the calcification of the metacarpals and metatarsals was severely compromised in Spop mutants, with the defects more severe in the hindlimbs (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enlarged fontanelles and fenestrated dermal bones in Spop mutants suggested that intramembranous ossification was also affected in the absence of Spop (Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spopl shares 85% sequence identity with Spop and exhibits similar, but weaker, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity than Spop (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether Spop and Spopl play redundant roles in mouse development, we characterized Spopl mutants and Spop;Spopl double mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spopl homozygous mutants were viable and fertile with no apparent morphological and skeletal defects, and Spop;Spopl double mutants exhibited similar skeletal defects to Spop mutants (Fig S4), indicating that Spopl did not compensate for the loss of Spop in mouse development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spop_Regulates_Hypertrophic_Differentiation_of_Chondrocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether the ossification defects in Spop mutants resulted from disrupted chondrocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we expected, the primary ossification center flanked by hypertrophic chondrocytes was much narrower in the E15.5 Spop mutant humerus compared with that of WT (Fig 2 A and A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar, but more severe, defects were observed in E18.5 metatarsals (Fig 2 B and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better evaluate the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in Spop mutants, we examined the expression of genes specific to chondrocytes at various stages of differentiation in the E13.5 humerus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation, chondrocytes switched from Col2a1 expression to Col10a1 expression (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the Col2a1/Col10a1+ domain was greatly reduced in Spop mutants, suggesting that hypertrophic differentiation was defective (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the two narrow domains of Pth1r and Ihh expression in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes separated by the hypertrophic zones were much closer to each other in Spop mutants, confirming the hypertrophic differentiation defects (Fig 2 EF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spop_Promotes_Bone_Formation_and_Osteoblast_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expression of Spop in the perichondrium, where osteoblasts are derived (Fig 1A), suggests that Spop may be important for bone formation and osteoblast differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the bone collar present in E18.5 WT metatarsal 3 was absent in Spop mutants (Fig 2 B and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A von Kossa assay confirmed that the bone collar was similarly absent from the region next to the prehypertrophic chondrocytes of the Spop mutant humerus at E15.5 (Fig 3 A and A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the inner layer of the perichondrium in Spop mutants failed to properly differentiate into cuboidal osteoblasts and that the perichondrium was thicker than that in control littermates (Fig 3 B and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Runx2 and Bmp2, markers for the precursors and mature osteoblasts, respectively, were both down-regulated in the Spop mutant metacarpals (Fig 3 CD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, chondrocytes in the metacarpals did not undergo hypertrophic differentiation until E15.5, suggesting that the lack of Runx2 expression was not secondary to the defects in chondrocyte hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the expression of Bglap, also known as Osteocalcin, a marker of terminally differentiated osteoblasts, was reduced in Spop mutants (Fig 3 E and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we used quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the expression levels of Col1a1, a major extracellular matrix protein produced by osteoblast, and Sp7/osterix, a transcription factor required for osteoblast maturation, and found that both genes were significantly down-regulated at E13.5 in the Spop mutant forelimbs (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Spop promotes bone formation, likely by cell-autonomously promoting osteoblast differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Decreased_Ihh_Signaling_and_Gli3R_Accumulation_in_Spop_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous in vitro studies found that Spop inhibited Hh signaling by targeting Gli2 and Gli3FL for degradation (1821, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether Ihh signaling was affected by the loss of Spop, we examined the expression of Patched 1 (Ptch1), a direct transcriptional target of Ihh, in E13.5 forelimbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found a significant reduction in Ptch1 expression in E13.5 Spop mutant forelimbs through qRT-PCR, indicating an unexpected positive role of Spop in Ihh signaling (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both RNA in situ hybridization with a Ptch1 probe (Fig 4B) and a Ptch1-lacZ reporter (Fig S5 AB) showed a reduction of Ptch1 expression in the chondrocytes and perichondrium of Spop mutants, suggesting that Spop regulates bone formation by promoting Ihh signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Ptch1-lacZ expression in the posterior part of E12.5 Spop mutant limb buds was indistinguishable from that of the littermates (Fig S5 C and C), suggesting that loss of Spop has no obvious effect on Sonic Hedgehog signaling from the zone of polarizing activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with decreased Ihh signaling, qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of Pthlh, another target gene of Ihh signaling, was also significantly reduced (Fig 4A), although this moderate reduction was not obvious through RNA in situ hybridization (Fig 2 G and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Spop promotes endochondral ossification by positively regulating Ihh signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the molecular basis of this positive role of Spop in Ihh signaling, we examined the levels of Gli2 and Gli3 in E13.5 forelimbs by immunoblot analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite previous in vitro data suggesting an important role of Spop in Gli2 degradation (1821, 23), the level of Gli2 was not significantly changed in Spop mutants (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the levels of both Gli3FL and Gli3R in the Spop mutant forelimbs were more than twice those in WT (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Gli3R was known to antagonize Ihh signaling in endochondral ossification (10), we conclude that Spop promotes Ihh signaling in skeletal development by down-regulating Gli3R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the levels of both Gli3FL and Gli3R were higher in Spop mutants, it was possible that Spop targeted exclusively Gli3FL, which, in turn, generated Gli3R through proteolytic processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, because previous studies showed interaction between Spop and the N terminus of Gli3 (19, 20), Spop may interact and directly target Gli3R for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the latter possibility, we first examined the physical interaction between Spop and Gli31-700, a truncated form mimicking Gli3R, by coexpressing FLAG-Spop with GFP-tagged Gli3, Gli31-700, and Gli2, respectively, and immunoprecipitating FLAG-Spop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, similar to Gli3 and Gli2, Gli31-700 coprecipitated with Spop (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a negative control, Gli25m, a Gli2 variant with mutated Spop-binding motifs, did not coprecipitate with Spop (19) (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse immunoprecipitation confirmed that GFP-Spop coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Gli3 and Gli31-700 (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we tested the ability of Spop to reduce the level of Gli3R in cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that coexpressing Spop in HEK 293T cells reduced the levels of both Gli3 and Gli31-700 (Fig 4D and Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found that overexpressed Spop promoted the ubiquitination of both Gli3 and Gli31-700 in HEK 293T cells (Fig 4E and Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that Gli3R was a direct target of Spop and that the increase in Gli3R in Spop mutants resulted at least partially from lack of Spop-mediated degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Increase_in_Gli3R_Underlies_the_Ossification_Defects_in_Spop_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that the increase in the level of Gli3R and decreased Ihh signaling underlie the skeletal defects in Spop-null mutants, we generated Spop/;Gli3+/ double mutants in which Gli3FL and Gli3R were restored to near WT level (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, both the endochondral ossification and chondrocyte hypertrophy were restored in metacarpals and metatarsals in Spop/;Gli3+/ double mutants (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with our observation that the levels of Gli3, but not Gli2, were altered in Spop mutant limbs, Spop;Gli2 double homozygous mutants exhibited ossification defects (Fig S7A), failure in bone matrix deposition (Fig S7B), and hypertrophic differentiation (Fig S7C) in digit bones at E17.5, similar to Spop single mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, loss of Spop had no effect on either digit formation or the ossification of the metacarpals and metatarsals in the absence of Gli3 (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calcification (Fig S7E) and hypertrophic differentiation (Fig S7F) were also comparable in Spop;Gli3 double homozygous mutants and Gli3 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Spop regulates endochondral bone development mainly through Gli3, but not Gli2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Defective_Chondrocyte_Hypertrophy_Results_in_Brachydactyly_in_Spop_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the neonatal lethality of Spop-null mutants prevented us from assessing skeletal defects in adults, we generated a limb-specific Spop mutant allele (SpopcKO) by removing Spop in Prx1-expressing limb mesenchymal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges, but not long bones in more proximal parts of the limbs, were significantly shorter in adult SpopcKO mutants than in their littermates (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, SpopcKO can serve as a model for brachydactyly, a common but poorly understood congenital anomaly (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to determine whether changes in cell proliferation and/or apoptosis contribute to the short digits in Spop mutants at E17.5, when the Spop mutant metatarsals were obviously shorter than WT (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the cell number in Spop mutant metatarsals was similar to that in WT littermates (Fig S8B), suggesting that the shorter metatarsals did not result from a reduction in cell number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this observation, the numbers of proliferating (Ki67+) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3+) cells were also comparable between Spop mutant and WT metatarsals (Fig S8 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, although large hypertrophic chondrocytes were present in the center of the WT metatarsals, cells were more densely packed throughout the Spop mutant metatarsals (Fig S8 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that compromised hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes underlies the brachydactyly in Spop mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Osteoblast_Differentiation_Defect_Results_in_Osteopenia_in_Spop_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the stylopod and zeugopod bones were not shorter in SpopcKO mutants, these bones nevertheless exhibit structural defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our histological analyses of the femurs showed an obvious reduction in the density of bone matrix in both the primary and secondary ossification centers, as well as thinner bone spicules, in adult SpopcKO mutants (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the structural defects of the bones of SpopcKO mutants, we evaluated the femurs with X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D reconstruction of distal metaphysis showed an obvious reduction in trabecular bone density in SpopcKO mutants (Fig 6D), which was confirmed by quantitative analyses of the CT data that indicated a significant reduction in bone volume fraction, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and connectivity density, as well as a significant increase in the specific bone surface and trabecular separation in SpopcKO mutants (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In development and adulthood, bones undergo constant remodeling with osteoblasts producing bone matrix and osteoclasts resorbing it (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the mechanism underlying the loss of bone mass in SpopcKO mutants, we analyzed the expression of osteoblast and osteoclast markers by qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to earlier stages, the expression of both Col1a1 and Sp7 was compromised in E17.5 Spop mutant femurs, suggesting continued defects in osteoblast differentiation (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the expression of Acp5 and Ctsk, both encoding enzymes secreted by osteoclasts to remodel the bone matrix, was not significantly changed in E17.5 and postnatal day 10 (P10) Spop mutants (Fig 3 G and H), suggesting that the loss of bone mass was not the result of too much osteoclast activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, osteopenia in SpopcKO mutants was likely the result of impaired osteoblast function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gli3R_Dosage_Reduction_Rescues_Brachydactyly_and_Osteopenia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the increase in Gli3R underlies the defects in chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation in Spop-null mutants, we hypothesized that it also accounted for the osteopenia and brachydactyly in SpopcKO mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we reduced the dosage of Gli3R by generating SpopcKO;Gli3+/ double mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the length of metacarpals, phalanges and metatarsals in 2-wk-old SpopcKO;Gli3+/ pups was comparable with that in Spopflox/flox littermates, and significantly longer than that in SpopcKO mutant littermates (Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, both the bone density and thickness of bone spicules increased in SpopcKO;Gli3+/ than in SpopcKO mutant femur (Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that dysregulation of Gli3R underlies both brachydactyly and osteopenia in SpopcKO mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we characterized two null alleles and a limb-specific conditional mutant allele of Spop and discovered critical roles for Spop in skeletal development and remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation is defective in the absence of Spop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gli3R, but not Gli2, is increased in Spop mutants, and Ihh signaling is compromised as a result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that limb-specific loss of Spop leads to brachydactyly and osteopenia, which can be rescued by reducing the dosage of Gli3R, suggesting that Spop could be a new target of intervention for these human disease conditions (Fig S10 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding that Spop plays a positive role in Ihh signaling is in striking contrast to previous studies suggesting a negative role of Spop in Hh signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, loss of hib/rdx results in the accumulation of Ci and excess activation of Hh signaling (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, expression of hib/rdx was found only in cells with high levels of Hh pathway activation, in which proteolytic processing of Ci was inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the excess activation of Hh signaling in hib/rdx mutants likely resulted from the accumulation of full-length activated Ci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our data and a previous study suggest that the expression of mammalian Spop is not limited to cells with active Hh signaling (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the accumulation of Gli3R in cells with moderate levels of Hh signaling likely accounts for the unique reduction of Hh pathway activation in Spop mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of hib/rdx in areas of Drosophila wing disk with moderate Hh pathway activation resulted in the decrease in both full-length and processed Ci (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies using cultured mammalian cells or mRNA injection in Xenopus eggs also suggested a negative role of Spop in Hh signaling (1821, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that a key difference between these studies and our in vivo data lies in the roles of Spop in the regulation of Gli2, the primary activator of the mammalian Hh pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these gain-of-function studies, overexpressed Spop interacts with Gli2 and targets it for degradation, an observation we confirmed in our own in vitro analysis (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we find no significant change in Gli2 protein level in Spop-null mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both Gli3FL and Gli3R accumulate in Spop mutants, the increase in Gli3R clearly has more impact on the Ihh signaling output, consistent with a previous study indicating an important role of Gli3R in Ihh signaling and endochondral ossification (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not clear why the level of Gli2 is not altered by the loss of Spop in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation is that Spop specifically targets the activated, labile form of Gli2 that exists in only a small number of cells with the highest level of Hh pathway activation as suggested by previous in vitro studies (18, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that Spop does not target Gli2 for degradation under physiological condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that Spop interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of Gli3, but only with the C-terminal region of Gli2, suggests that Gli3 may be a better Spop substrate than Gli2 (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies found that Sufu interferes with Spop/Gli-interaction and Spop-mediated Gli degradation (18, 20, 21), suggesting that Spop may specifically target activated Gli proteins that are not associated with Sufu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because Sufu is essential for the proteolytic processing of the Gli3 protein (20), the increase in both Gli3FL and Gli3R in Spop-null mutants seems to indicate that Spop can target nonactivated, Sufu-bound Gli3 for degradation as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result could also explain the difference between our results and a recent study suggesting that reducing Spop did not affect Gli3R level in cultured cells treated with Shh (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, figure 4G of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 appeared to show a small and insignificant increase in the levels of both Gli3FL and Gli3R with the reduction of Spop in the absence of Shh, consistent with our finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings that Spop interacts with Gli3R and regulates its ubiquitination and degradation is consistent with previous reports of direct interaction between the N terminus of Gli3 and Spop (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study further revealed multiple ubiquitination sites on the N terminus of Gli3 that are sufficient for Spop-catalyzed ubiquitination (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data seem to be at odds with a recent study showing no effect of Spop overexpression on the stability of Gli31-700 in C3H10T1/2 cells (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference could result from the use of different antibodies for immunoblots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20, a Gli3 antibody was used to detect both the endogenous Gli3R and overexpressed Gli31-700.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because endogenous Gli3R is hardly affected by Spop overexpression due to the low transfection efficiency, a moderate decrease in Gli31-700, which comigrates with endogenous Gli3R, may be difficult to detect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the expression levels of Spop in C3H10T1/2 and HEK 293T cells underlie the different effects on Gli31-700 degradation because we have failed to express Spop at sufficient levels in C3H10T1/2 cells in an attempt to repeat the experiment described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to Gli proteins, Spop mediates the ubiquitination of at least 20 more proteins through serine/threonine-rich degrons (19, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is theoretically possible that changes in the activities of other Spop substrates may also contribute to the skeletal defects observed in Spop mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the near-complete rescue of bone and cartilage development in Spop/;Gli3+/ and SpopcKO;Gli3+/ double mutants suggests that Spop-mediated ubiquitination of other substrates plays minimal roles in this process at best.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we failed to recover Spop/;Gli3+/ double mutants at weaning, suggesting that the increase in the level of Gli3 does not account for the lethality of Spop-null mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we provide here solid evidence for essential roles of Spop-mediated ubiquitination in chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation during skeletal development, and normal bone size and density in adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we reveal a surprisingly positive function of Spop in Ihh signaling through specific down-regulation of Gli3, particularly its repressor form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, this knowledge allows us to better understand the pathology and potential intervention of skeletal disorders such as brachydactyly and osteoporosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Then, 100 slices at distal metaphysis were selected 750 m from the proximal end of the distal growth plate for trabecular analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Company-provided software and custom scripts were used to view images, create 3D models of the bones and determine bone volume and other parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
