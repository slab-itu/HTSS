title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiscale approach reveals that Cloudina aggregates are detritus and not in situ reef constructions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Little is known about how the Ediacaran index fossil Cloudina lived and what impact it had on its surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This uncertainty is due to the fact that Cloudina often is preserved with the same mineralogy as the rocks in which it is found; the lack of density contrast means that traditional imaging techniques cannot be used to reconstruct and measure in situ Cloudina populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, researchers have suggested that Cloudina was a framework reef builder that actively adapted to changing environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we use a serial grinding and imaging technique to produce 3D models of Cloudina aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with detailed field observations, we demonstrate that Cloudina populations are detritus and not in situ growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The earliest metazoans capable of biomineralization appeared during the late Ediacaran Period (635541 Ma) in strata associated with shallow water microbial reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that some Ediacaran microbial reefs were dominated (and possibly built) by an abundant and globally distributed tubular organism known as Cloudina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If true, this interpretation implies that metazoan framework reef buildinga complex behavior that is responsible for some of the largest bioconstructions and most diverse environments in modern oceansemerged much earlier than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present 3D reconstructions of Cloudina populations, produced using an automated serial grinding and imaging system coupled with a recently developed neural network image classifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reconstructions show that Cloudina aggregates are composed of transported remains while detailed field observations demonstrate that the studied reef outcrops contain only detrital Cloudina buildups, suggesting that Cloudina played a minor role in Ediacaran reef systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques have wide applicability to problems that require 3D reconstructions where physical separation is impossible and a lack of density contrast precludes tomographic imaging techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthetic tube experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) One hundred tubes of equal diameter and length are randomly distributed within XY space with their centers at Z = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A, all of the tubes exhibit a plunge of 15° and a trend of 180±15, while in B, tubes are evenly subdivided into two populations, both with the same plunge but with one having a trend of 180±15 and the other having a trend of 0±15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C demonstrates that the cross-section at Z = 0 is the same for both populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Variations in cross-sectional eccentricity and curvature of a synthetic tube lead to measurement error (here, error is the percentage of difference between the median measured area and the known cross-sectional area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errors result from treating measured semiminor axis size as the true diameter based on the assumption that tubes have a circular cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Sixty-four randomly selected sections through a straight open tube with a circular cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shapes are similar to those observed on bedding planes, including what are interpreted as closed apical ends (circled).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In Namibia, the Driedoornvlakte and Zebra River Farm reefs represent Neoproterozoic age Nama Group sediments that were deposited on a carbonate ramp in the northern Zaris subbasin following the Damara and Gariep orogenies (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kuibis subgroup, which comprises the lowest Nama and contains Cloudina-bearing sediments, has a maximum age of 620590 Ma (13) and a minimum age, on the basis of a uraniumlead zircon date in the overlying Schwarzrand subgroup, of 545.1 ±1 Ma (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional geochronological constraint is provided by an ash bed 270 m above the base of the Kuibis at Zebra River Farm, located in an interbedded microbialite succession above Cloudina-bearing thrombolites (Fig S2D), which has a reported age of 548.8 ± 1 Ma revised to 547.32 ± 0.31 Ma (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reef at Driedoornvlakte Farm is a 500-m-thick, 10-km-long outcropping that dips 25°40° to the south and that, on the basis of changes in reef geometry, has been divided into three distinct units (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thirdand youngestunit, which was deposited in an environment of increasing accommodation before drowning by the Urikos shales (17), has been the focus of multiple studies (1719), including several that proposed evidence for in situ Cloudina growth (4, 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third unit contains pinnacle reefs made up of coalescing decimeter-to-meterscale microbial mounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mounds are composed of both columnar or encrusting stromatolites and columnar or massive thrombolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fill between the stromatolites and thrombolites, when present, often contains the skeletal remains of Cloudina and the goblet-shaped biomineralizer Namacalathus (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remains of both organisms, along with the modular metazoan Namapoikia (21), also can be found within neptunian dikes distributed throughout the reef.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the fore slope of the reef are meter-scale dolomitized clinoformal grainstones consisting solely of the skeletal remains of Namacalathus and Cloudina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina thicket, a dense aggregate of individuals without evidence of internal microbial fabrics that has been suggested to represent framework reef building (4, 6), is present in several mounds within the reef.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed survey of the reef reveals that Cloudina thicket is sparsely distributed within the outcrop area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 52% of all surveyed points exhibit some form of microbial texture, only 14% have any sort of skeletal remains present, and fewer than 3% have been identified as Cloudina thicket (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two samples of thicket from Driedoornvlakte (named thicket A and thicket B) consist of Cloudina tubes surrounded by a fine-grained, dark micrite matrix that lacks any apparent microbial fabrics (Fig 3 D and E and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual specimens have smooth or slightly corrugated exterior surfaces and smooth-walled, hollow interiors that are filled with either micrite or blocky calcite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina regularly bend, have elliptical cross-sections, and have a consistent semimajor axis size along the length of the tube (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thicket A, both the Cloudina remains and surrounding matrix are partially dolomitized, while only the matrix is partially dolomitized in thicket B. Cloudina tubes in thicket A plunge 21.5° ± 10.4° relative to the bedding plane (Table 1) and, while usually trending between 25° and 240°, the specimens do not exhibit a dominant trend (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of trend and plunge measurements can be described as variable lineations on a single best-fit plane with a strike of 055.2° and a dip of 22.3° relative to the bedding plane (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thicket B, Cloudina individuals plunge 35.8° ± 18.9° relative to the bedding plane (Table 1) and do not exhibit a dominant trend (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The outcrop at Zebra River Farm, located up-ramp of Driedoornvlakte, is composed of near-horizontal (1°2° dip to the northwest) strata that are exposed in a system of river canyons (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stratigraphic succession overlies the Kaines quartzite at the bottom of the canyons and consists of alternating fine- to coarse-grained grainstones that are twice interrupted by meter-scale, often dolomitized, microbial reef buildups, which in turn are overlain by a sequence of interbedded microbialites and shales (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower reef occurrence appears as isolated mounding biostromes with poor fabric retention while the upper reef is sheetlike and forms a resistant bedding plane that exposes mounds of thrombolites and associated stromatolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mounds exhibit directional elongation and contain skeletal material within the fill between individual microbial buildups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No Cloudina thickets were identified within the Zebra River stratigraphy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fill between two thrombolite mounds located in the upper reef unit at Zebra River Farm (Fig S2D) includes both Cloudina and Namacalathus preserved as dark, recrystallized molds in a light, extremely fine-grained micrite matrix (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina can be divided into smaller (outer semimajor axis size less_than1.25 mm) and larger (outer semimajor axis size 3 mm) size fractions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3H and 4G and Movie S2), exhibit elliptical cross-sections, and have no appreciable change in semimajor axis size (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internal cavities, especially in smaller Cloudina specimens, are not always distinguishable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When present, interiors are hollow, smooth walled, and filled with micrite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger Cloudina have smooth external surfaces while smaller tubes can be either ribbed or smooth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina plunge 31.6±17.5 relative to the bedding plane (Table 1), and individuals have no predominant trend (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Canada, the isolated biohermal reefs on Salient Mountain belong to the Salient Platform of the Byng Formation (Upper Miette Group, Windermere Supergroup) (23) and were deposited in a passive margin setting following the breakup of Rodinia (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of Re-Os dating of a post-Marinonan shale in the Windermere Supergroup, the reef has a maximum age of 607.8 ± 4.7 Ma (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlying McNaughton formation contains trace fossils (Skolithos and Cruziana) in strata immediately below trilobite-bearing beds (28) and provides a minimum age of Early Cambrian for the reef.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reefs on Salient Mountain outcrop as glacially polished exposures that dip approximately 18° to the southwest on a series of southeast-to-northwesttrending normal fault blocks (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block exhibits variable exposure of the same stratigraphic succession.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of alternating sandstones and shales transition into an oncolite and stromatolite horizon with no visible skeletal material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the horizon is a unit of interbedded shale and massive sandstone that is capped by meter-scale, elongated pink Platella stromatolite bioherms with skeletal material (including Cloudina) in fill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Platella bioherms are overlain by an upper sandstone succession, which contains two thin dolomitized horizons, both with evidence of poorly preserved stromatolites (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Platella bioherms are laterally well exposed, no evidence of Cloudina thicket was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sample from the Platella bioherms contains Cloudina and Namacalathus remains that are found within pockets of fill between microbial buildups (Fig 3G and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skeletal remains are fragmented, incomplete, and, in certain cases, appear to be truncated by overlying microbial layers (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internal tube cavities are smooth walled, hollow, and filled with a combination of detrital skeletal material, pink micrite, and submillimeter quartz grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina individuals appear to be composed of cemented, connected funnels with flared rims (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubes have elliptical cross-sections and exhibit a consistent semimajor axis size along the length of the tube (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several (n = 3) 1-mm diameter spheres, with zero to two apertures, also were identified during reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloudina plunge 45.4° ± 19.0° relative to paleohorizontal (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trend and plunge measurements are widely distributed, and Cloudina individuals can be described as broadly plunging to the northeast (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transported_Remains_of_an_Easily_Deformed_Organism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the rock record, true reef builders compose a large portion of lithified reef remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the Lower Cambrian Poleta Formation at Stewarts Mill, CA, the dominant reef-building archaeocyaths make up 38% of the volume of rock present (in other Lower Cambrian reefs, that number is as high as 50%) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, primary framework constructors are the most likely to be preserved in situ or in growth position within lithified blocks while other, secondary, reef dwellers are prone to mechanical destruction, fragmentation, and transportation (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field observations reveal that Cloudina thickets compose only 3% of the reef at Driedoornvlakte Farm and are completely absent at the laterally extensive outcroppings in Zebra River Farm and on Salient Mountain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in all three study areas, Cloudina are found as transported individuals, rather than dense colonies, within fill between microbial growths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Cloudina was neither a dominant metazoan component of the reefs nor a primary framework reef builder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is likely that, until the Cambrian, microbes and their buildupsnot Cloudinaprovided the structure for reef systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even if Cloudina did not build Ediacaran reefs, the possibility that the studied assemblages represent in situ bioconstructions must be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ Cloudina would be expected to exhibit closed basal ends (5) with an attachment to some substrate (7); a consistent relationship between length and diameter (as older, more developed organisms would be both longer and wider, with evidence of branching) (9, 32); and finally, an appreciable increase in semimajor axis length resulting from ontogenesis, as demonstrated by previous workers (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 3D reconstructions reveal that Cloudina from all four samples lack basal apical ends, are not attached to any substrate, have no relationship between length and semimajor axis size (Fig 4D), and have consistent, unchanging outer semimajor axis size measurements (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of apical endswhich, as previously noted, can be easily misidentified in 2D cross-section (Fig 1E)and lack of attachment to microbial surfaces suggest that the Cloudina are not growing where they are found, while the semimajor axis size measurements imply that individual tubes represent incomplete segments of whole Cloudina organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the samples are likely detrital assemblages, the same as previously described Cloudina aggregates in Spain, China, Paraguay, Nevada, and Brazil (5, 10, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It could be argued that Cloudina aggregates represent the broken remains of an in situ reef inhabitant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the possibility that Cloudina may have been a reef inhabitant cannot be ruled out, the absence of Cloudina thicket in all three study areas suggests that it was, at most, a minor metazoan component of Ediacaran reef systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, distributions of 3D individual tube orientation (Fig 4 EG) suggest that the studied assemblages probably were transported before deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Cloudina took advantage of nutrient flux (whether controlled by current or a steady rain of organic matter from above), as suggested by previous researchers (6), individual tubes of an in situ framework would all be oriented in a single, predominant direction (4) with similar plunge angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the trends and plunges of Cloudina in all four reconstructions can be explained by hydraulic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thicket A, individual tubes have similar inclinations relative to the bedding plane but are not pointing in one direction, which can be explained by reorientation by a unidirectional current following deposition at the edge of a microbial buildup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Cloudina individuals from thicket B, along with those from Zebra River, exhibit a lack of coherence in both plunge and trend, suggesting rapid settling following transport (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, at Salient Mountain, specimens do broadly point in one direction but have a range of plunges, suggesting reworking by a turbulent unidirectional or tidal current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is rare to transport shell assemblages over large distances, habitat-adjacent movement of death assemblages in modern environments is a common occurrence (35), suggesting that Cloudina aggregates, when found in Ediacaran reef systems, may be proximally sourced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition following transportation likely produced detrital assemblages with high porosity, which would explain the presence of marine cements as described by previous workers (4, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reconstructed Cloudina individuals do not have circular cross-sections (Fig 4D) as previously assumed by researchers when making 2D diameter measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the wide range of Cloudina aspect ratios were the result of compaction, the semiminor axis of individual tubes would be oriented subvertically to vertically (i.e., semiminor plunge angles would be distributed about or near 90°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all four samples have normally distributed semiminor axis plunge angles, with means ranging from 24.0° to 42.7° (1 ranging from 15.3° to 22.7°; Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, it is likely that Cloudina individuals were deformed before burial compaction, during either transportation or deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that individual tubes could be so easily deformed suggests that Cloudina was weakly biomineralized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrasample measurements reveal that Cloudina shells and the surrounding matrix have similar mean 13C values (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C of shells is controlled by a combination of shell type, primary mineralogy (i.e., whether aragonite or calcite is precipitated), and/or diagenesis (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although inconclusive, the similarity of shell and matrix 13C values may suggest that Cloudina shells were recrystallized and thickened during diagenesis by a rock-buffered fluid interacting with an organic template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If all Cloudina aggregates are, in fact, proximally sourced detrital assemblages, it is likely that Cloudina lived in ecological niches in or near Ediacaran microbial reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous researchers have suggested that Cloudina was not an annelidlargely based on comparisons of shell ultrastructure and the presence of rapidly expanding daughter tubes, neither of which were examined in this study (32)serpulid communities still may provide an appropriate analog for the sort of ecological niche that Cloudina may have occupied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, serpulid reefs consist of tubular, gregarious annelid filter feeders that attach to hard substrates and exist in environments within and proximal to framework reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In low- to moderate-energy lagoonal environments, serpulid bioconstructions have been shown both to be spatially extensive and to produce fragmented shelly remains and sediments (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous habit for Cloudinain which Cloudina produced dense aggregations of weakly biomineralized tubes that could be easily broken upcould account for observations of large amounts of detrital skeletal material as well as explain why in situ Cloudina are rare in Ediacaran reef systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed differences in size (Fig 4 EH) and morphology (Table 1) between samples must be evaluated with respect to the fact that the aggregates are essentially detritus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that distinctions between Cloudina populations are entirely due to taphonomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential size sorting during transportation or burial could explain the variety of diameters between aggregates (35), while diagenetic processes, especially acting on a weakly biomineralized shell or organic structure, could reduce or entirely erase external morphological features such as flared rims or longitudinal crests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is equally likely that the apparent differences between populations are due to taxonomic differences or environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous researchers divided soft-bodied Ediacara into three spatially and chronologically distinct assemblages representing unique stages of evolution (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative 3D observations of tubular Ediacaran biomineralizers may reveal that morphological differences between organisms also represent evolution and that tubes can similarly be subdivided into assemblages by time and space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, both the lack of absolute time constraints and the absence of correlatable features in the 13C chemostratigraphy (Fig S2C) at Salient Mountain make it impossible to constrain the chronological relationship between Cloudina from Namibia and Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further reconstructions of tubular organisms from throughout the Late Ediacaran to the Early Cambrian, combined with detailed geochronology, may provide an appropriate framework for understanding the evolution of the earliest biomineralizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations in Cloudina size and shape also may reflect the response of the organism to environmental parameters such as nutrient flux, presence of specific microbial textures, and/or different energy regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As individual Cloudina aggregates are most likely to be detrital, no one sample or location can provide enough direct evidence to support a link between environment and Cloudina morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, additional studies, consisting of detailed field observations from multiple localities, in conjunction with 3D reconstructions, could provide enough indirect and/or contextual information to determine whether there is a relationship between environmental conditions and the morphology of both Cloudina and other, early, tubular organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even with extensive field observations and detailed 3D reconstructions, there is a possibility that true in situ Cloudina bioconstructions are preserved in the rock record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, any interpretation of Cloudina as a framework reef builder must contend with the paucity of framework textures in reef outcroppings as well as the easily deformed, likely weakly biomineralized, nature of Cloudina tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, any claim of in situ construction must be evaluated in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution 3D reconstructions enable the extraction of accurate in situ measurements that cannot be collected from 2D cross-sections alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, 3D in situ measurements allowed for a crucial reinterpretation of the role Cloudina played within Ediacaran reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the low density contrast between Cloudina and matrix, this work would not have been possible without the GIRI serial sectioning and image-processing pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To produce high-resolution orthographic imagery and digital surface models (DSMs) of all three study areas, the Ebee Sensefly, a 0.69-kg, hand-launched, programmable aerial drone equipped with a specially modified 12 megapixel Cannon S110 camera, was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple flights at each location collected hundreds of overlapping raw red, green, and blue aerial photographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These images were then geotagged and converted to 12-bit .TIFFs in eMotion, a proprietary flight-planning and processing software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processed .TIFFs were loaded into Pix4D, a photogrammetry software package, after which a sparse point cloud was produced by detecting and matching features present in overlapping images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute georeferencing of the dataset was accomplished by matching differentially corrected Trimble measurements of control points to features in the sparse point cloud.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following georeferencing, the point cloud was densified and an orthographic image and DSM were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Driedoornvlakte Farm, Zebra River Farm, and Salient Mountain orthomosaics and DSMs had resolutions of 5.45 cm/pixel, 12.0 cm/pixel, and 21.4 cm/pixel, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A handheld Trimble GeoXH6000 rover without an external antenna was used to collect 1,254 GPS points, arrayed over a survey grid with 10 × 20-m spacing; discrete keywords associated with field observations, including information about texture, lithology, sedimentary structures, and the presence (or absence) of skeletal remains, were recorded in conjunction with each point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Trimble GPS data were differentially corrected using the GPS Pathfinder Office software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from the TrigNet Springbok base station, 654 km from Driedoornvlakte, were used for differential correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal accuracy of the corrected data had a mean of 0.596 m and a SD of 0.126 m, while vertical accuracy had a mean of 0.706 m and a SD of 0.256 m. The corrected data, along with field observations, were then loaded into MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each feature of interest (outcrop, microbial facies, skeletal material, and thicket), points were assigned either a 1 if any associated field observations were present or a 0 if no supporting field observations were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, experimental variograms were produced using mGstat, a geostatistical toolbox for MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, theoretical variograms were fitted to the experimental data and the best-fit parameters were recorded (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the entire dataset was processed in mGstat using indicator kriging (39) to produce an interpolated map illustrating the probability of finding the feature of interest within the reef complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In selected stratigraphic sections, centimeter-scale carbonate samples from approximately every 1.0 m were analyzed for 13C and 18O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was slabbed, polished, and then selectively drilled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 5 mg of the resulting powder was placed into a borosilicate vial, heated to 110 °C to remove water, and then reacted with five drops of H3PO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting CO2 was analyzed using a Sercon IRMS coupled with a GasBench II at Princeton University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured precision is ±0.1 for carbon and ±0.2 for oxygen; all values are reported in delta notation and are relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPBD) standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decimeter-scale in situ hand samples of Cloudina and associated organisms were collected for thin sectioning and serial sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was assigned a unique GPS point using a Garmin GPSmap 64, a Garmin GPSmap 60cx, or a Trimble GeoXH6000 handheld GPS unit and was contextualized with respect to the environment in which it was deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whenever possible, orientation (either bedding plane up or the strike and dip) was marked directly on multiple faces of the extracted sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples designated for serial sectioning and reconstruction were slabbed (5.4 × 4.0 × 5.0 cm) and mounted using two-part epoxy onto steel plates in preparation for grinding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GIRI at Princeton University is a fully automated system that requires minimal operator intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GIRI is a computer numerical control (CNC) Mistui MSG-818PC-NC surface grinder which has been retrofitted with a misting apparatus, retractable rollers, and an imaging stage that consists of two LED lamps and an 80-megapixel Phase One digital back coupled to a 120-mm Schneider Kreuznach macrolens via an electronic shutter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CNC grinder is capable of moving in 1-m increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The camera sensor measures 40.4 × 53.7 mm and contains pixels that are each 5.2 × 5.2 m in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the camera is set up for 1:1 macroimaging, the system is capable of resolving objects as small as 10.4 m over a 40.4 × 53.7-mm field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the CNC grinder has a high degree of repeatability, samples can be mosaicked to achieve a higher field of view and/or higher resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CNC grinder processes a list of machine instructions written in G code, a numerical control code language (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optimized grinding and imagining routine has been written for GIRI and parameters related to individual samples (i.e., sample name, sample width, step-down size, and number of slices) can be edited and the result saved as a valid G-code file for any given sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a collection of interactive MATLAB scripts and Applescript functions, the control computer is able to send and receive signals from the grinder, trigger the shutter, and verify image capture, all while GIRI is in operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A typical grind cycle begins with the removal of some surface material (as specified by the step size) by a 6-inch diameter diamond or silicon carbide wheel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the grind cycle, the sample passes under a roller to clear off any excess fluid and ensure an even sheen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample is then positioned under the imaging stage for photographing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, the grinder sends a signal to the control computer requesting an image capture; an Applescript command triggers the shutter and the image is downloaded into Capture One, a software package designed to work with the Phase One digital back.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the image has been downloaded and verified, the control computer initiates the next grind cycle by sending a signal to the grinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process is repeated until the sample has been fully ground and imaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical 1,500-slice sample (at 30 m per slice) takes 1 wk to grind and image; during this time, the operator needs to replace machine fluids and clean the wipers only once every 24 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Capture One downloads and stores images as .IIQs, a proprietary raw image file format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the .IIQ format preserves unedited sensor datathereby enabling postcapture adjustments of settings such as white balance, exposure, and sharpeningit cannot be opened or processed in programs other than Capture One.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, once a sample has been ground and imaged, the .IIQ file for each slice is adjusted and exported as a 16-bit .TIFF for further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion from .IIQ to .TIFF has the downside of dramatically increasing file size by an order of magnitude: A single .IIQ ranges from 50 MB to 80 MB in size while its corresponding .TIFF is approximately 600 MB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, .TIFFs for a typical 1,500-count image stack can consume up to 900 GB of disk space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to storage space limitations, and because .IIQ files retain adjustment information, only the .IIQ files are archived after a project is completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A user-supervised MATLAB routine was developed to efficiently extract features of interest from .TIFF image stacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, superpixels (i.e., regions that consist of pixels that have been clustered together on the basis of color and position, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41) are calculated for each image using the MATLAB superpixels routine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effectively preserves feature edges while oversegmenting the image (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each superpixel, a column vector, consisting of pixel color and texture value statistics, as well as the corresponding statistics of superpixels located directly above and directly below the one of interest, is produced and stored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this preprocessing, a user defines the classes of interest (e.g., fossil and matrix) and selects representative superpixels for each class within a subset of images from the stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting collection of classified superpixels is divided into training, verification, and testing datasets, which are then used to train and verify a two-layer feed-forward neural network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trained network outputs the probability that a superpixel belongs to a given class (Fig 3B) and predicts the correct class with greater than 90% accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, superpixels are thresholded to produce a binary image for use in visualization and measurement (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stack of processed binary images is loaded into Avizo, a scientific visualization software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each slice is given a thickness that corresponds to the amount of material removed during a grind cycle (i.e., the step size), thereby turning each pixel into a volumetric pixel, or voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To isolate and measure individual specimens, a custom graphical user interface (GUI), written in MATLAB, is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a down-sampled stack of the original true color images is loaded into the GUI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, a user scrolls through the stack, selects an object of interest, draws a bounding box around the feature, and inputs the first and last slice in which the feature can be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the case of cylindrical objects such as Cloudina, the user marks the center of the object in multiple slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bounding box coordinates, along with information about the first and last slice, are used to extract a subvolume of the larger dataset in Avizo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If center points are provided, a 3D spline is fitted to the points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the spline is treated as the length of the object.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates and tangent values are evaluated at fixed intervals along the spline (for this study, the intervals were at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the total length of the spline) and the information is used both to produce oriented sections (with the tangent serving as the normal of the plane that defines the sections) in Avizo and to calculate the plunge and trend of the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Semimajor and semiminor axes measurements are made directly on these 2D sections using the built-in ruler tool in Avizo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-sectional eccentricity is calculated by dividing the semiminor axis size value by the semimajor axis size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of semimajor axis size change is defined as(|dn+1dn|)/(dn),where d is the semimajor axis (in millimeters) and n refers to the sectional slice number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All means are reported with 1 SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
