POWERDRESS and HDA9 interact and promote histone H3 deacetylation at specific genomic sites in Arabidopsis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) belong to a large protein family in plants, and little is known about how target specificity of each HDAC is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a paired SANT (SWI3/DAD2/N-CoR/TFIII-B) domain-containing protein, POWERDRESS, specifically acts with HDA9 to confer the deacetylation of histone H3 lysine residues at a set of genomic targets to regulate various biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study elucidates the functional correlation between SANT domain-containing proteins and HDACs in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic control mechanism that is tightly linked to the promotion of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone acetylation levels are balanced through the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arabidopsis HDAC genes (AtHDACs) compose a large gene family, and distinct phenotypes among AtHDAC mutants reflect the functional specificity of individual AtHDACs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms underlying this functional diversity are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that POWERDRESS (PWR), a SANT (SWI3/DAD2/N-CoR/TFIII-B) domain protein, interacts with HDA9 and promotes histone H3 deacetylation, possibly by facilitating HDA9 function at target regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developmental phenotypes of pwr and hda9 mutants were highly similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three lysine residues (K9, K14, and K27) of H3 retained hyperacetylation status in both pwr and hda9 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation profiling revealed elevated acetylation at largely overlapping sets of target genes in the two mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly similar gene-expression profiles in the two mutants correlated with the histone H3 acetylation status in the pwr and hda9 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PWR and HDA9 modulated flowering time by repressing AGAMOUS-LIKE 19 expression through histone H3 deacetylation in the same genetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, PWR was shown to physically interact with HDA9, and its SANT2 domain, which is homologous to that of subunits in animal HDAC complexes, showed specific binding affinity to acetylated histone H3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that PWR acts as a subunit in a complex with HDA9 to result in lysine deacetylation of histone H3 at specific genomic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_PWR_SANT2_Domain_Preferentially_Binds_Modified_Histone_H3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reported previously that PWR regulates floral stem cell fate through promotion of miR172 and CRC expression (34), but its molecular function was unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paired SANT domains (SANT1 and SANT2), a distinct feature of PWR, were found to have high sequence similarity with the animal HDAC subunits SMRT and N-CoR (52% and 63% similarity, respectively) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SANT1 and SANT2 domains of SMRT are necessary for HDAC activity and binding to unmodified histone tails, respectively (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the PWR SANT domains have similar functions to those of the SMRT SANT domains, a histone peptide array was probed with purified recombinant His-PWR SANT1, His-PWR SANT2, and His-PWR SANT1+SANT2 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the PWR SANT1 domain did not bind any histone peptides (Fig S2B), the SANT2 domain strongly bound to a subset of modified histone H3 but did not show any affinity for histone H4 or H2A/B; this binding preference was perfectly repeated in duplicated arrays in the same chip (Fig 1A and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PWR SANT1+SANT2 also bound the same peptides (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SANT1 did not bind histone peptides, the SANT1+SANT2 data independently verified the SANT2 binding specificities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among monomodified H3, PWR SANT2 selectively bound to K9me1, K9me2, K9ac, S10P, T11P, and K14ac compared with unmodified H3 or H3K4ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also interacted with 32 kinds of multimodified histone H3, 29 of which contained at least one of the above modifications bound by His-PWR SANT2 (Fig 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifications at the H3K9 residue were the most preferred by the PWR SANT2 domain among the histone H3 monomodifications (70%) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the PWR SANT2 domain recognizes modified histone H3 and raises the possibility that PWR is functionally relevant in histone modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PWR_Specifically_Promotes_Histone_H3_Deacetylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of the sequence similarity of the PWR SANT2 domain to that of HDAC subunits and its affinity for H3K9ac and H3K14ac, the effect of PWR on histone H3 acetylation status was analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were examined by Western blotting using pan-acetylated H3 and H4 antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the histone peptide array results, hyperacetylation of histone H3 was observed in pwr-2, whereas no difference was observed for histone H4 acetylation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of histone H3 acetylation at K9, K14, and K27 were all increased in pwr-2 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that PWR may contribute to the regulation of histone H3 acetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the functional correlation between PWR and HDACs, we screened several hda mutants for similarities with pwr mutants in morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From both the screen and published reports, the phenotype of hda9 mutants was similar to that of pwr mutants, including early flowering and slightly bulged silique tips (Fig 2B and Fig S3) (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early flowering phenotype was much milder under continuous light compared with short-day conditions (35, 36), such that pwr-2 and hda9-1 mutants bolted about 1.5 d earlier than wild type, with a similar number of rosette leaves to that in wild type at bolting (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the acetylation levels of histone pan-H3, but not pan-H4, were increased in the hda9 mutant (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation levels were also increased in hda9 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperacetylation of H3K27 in the hda9 mutant was reported in a previous study (35) and was also observed here (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar morphological and histone acetylation phenotypes of the two mutants led us to hypothesize that PWR and HDA9 act closely to deacetylate histone H3 at specific target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PWR_and_HDA9_Enhance_Histone_H3_Deacetylation_at_Largely_Overlapping_Sets_of_Targets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether PWR promotes deacetylation at specific genomic targets and, if so, whether PWR and HDA9 affect the same targets, a global analysis of the acetylation status of histone H3K9 and H3K14 was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed in wild type, pwr-2, and hda9-1 using antibodies against H3K9ac and H3K14ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For H3K9ac ChIP-seq, two biological replicates were performed; Pearsons correlation analysis showed that the replicates were reasonably reproducible (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3K14ac ChIP-seq was carried out with one replicate, but randomly selected observations were later validated by ChIP-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild type, a total of 12,650 H3K9ac peaks were found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed before (37, 38), the peaks were mostly in genes or intergenic regions (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the H3K14ac ChIP-seq, a total of 11,141 H3K14ac peaks were found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic distribution of H3K14ac was similar to that of H3K9ac, but a stronger enrichment for genic regions than H3K9ac was found (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within genes, H3K9ac and H3K14ac marks were strongly enriched in 5UTRs, which constitute 4% of all genes (Fig S6E) but more than 25% of H3K9ac- or H3K14ac-containing genic regions (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation was centered at 300 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) and markedly dropped off at the transcription termination site (TTS) (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we identified differentially acetylated regions between each mutant and wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the differentially acetylated regions identified, the majority were hyperacetylated in pwr-2 (H3K9ac: 3,921 of 5,026; H3K14ac: 3,128 of 3,351) and hda9-1 (H3K9ac: 4,222 of 5,307; H3K14ac: 3,847 of 4,131) compared with wild type (Col) (Fig 3A), which is consistent with the observed increase in H3K9ac and H3K14ac levels in the two mutants (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hyperacetylated regions accounted for 3040% of all ChIP-derived peaks for H3K9 (pwr-2: 3,921 of 12,890; hda9-1: 4,222 of 12,745) and H3K14 (pwr-2: 3,128 of 12,791; hda9-1: 3,847 of 13,122) in the pwr and hda9 mutants, which reflects that PWR and HDA9 contribute to more than one-third of H3K9 and H3K14 deacetylation at a genome-wide level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative analysis of the hyperacetylated regions in pwr-2 and hda9-1 revealed significant overlap: about 70% overlap for H3K9ac (P = 0; hypergeometric test) and 5060% overlap for H3K14ac (P = 0; hypergeometric test) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the overlapping regions of hyperacetylated H3K9 and H3K14 between pwr-2 and hda9-1 revealed that more than 50% corresponded to genes and a minor fraction corresponded to transposable elements (TEs) (Fig 3C), which is consistent with the nature of H3K9ac and H3K14ac as euchromatic marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in the overlapping, hyperacetylated regions, H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation was peaking at 300 bp downstream of the TSS, as observed in wild type (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEME-ChIP analysis (39) was performed to identify overrepresented motifs among the genomic targets of PWR and HDA9 in terms of histone H3K9 and H3K14 deacetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, motifs GAAG(A/C)AG(A/C) and G(A/G)(A/C)GA(A/C)G(A/C/G) were identified as the most significant motifs for H3K9ac and H3K14ac marks, respectively, from overlapping hyperacetylation regions between pwr-2 and hda9-1 (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that PWR and HDA9 regulate histone H3 deacetylation mainly at actively transcribed regions and that the functions of these two genes are tightly correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PWR_and_HDA9_Share_a_Significant_Number_of_Target_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The studies above revealed hyperacetylation at common genomic sites in the pwr and hda9 mutants, raising the possibility that the two genes regulate similar sets of target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the histone acetylation status and gene-expression levels of the targets of PWR and HDA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pwr-2 and hda9-1, 2,159 and 2,073 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, respectively (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the DEGs, 774 and 1,385 genes were increased and reduced in pwr-2, respectively, and 772 and 1,301 genes were increased and reduced in hda9-1, respectively (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant overlap between the DEGs identified in pwr-2 and hda9-1 [542 increased DEGs and 817 reduced DEGs, P = 0 (hypergeometric test)] (Fig 4A), indicating that PWR and HDA9 act in the same regulatory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the up-regulated genes in pwr-2 and hda9-1 were mainly involved in stress responses (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis was performed to assess the correlation between overlapping up-regulated DEGs and ChIP-derived hyperacetylated regions in the corresponding gene body and promoter regions (up to 2-kb upstream of the TSSs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 542 genes identified as up-regulated DEGs in both mutants (i.e., coup-regulated DEGs), 179 and 144 genes were hyperacetylated at H3K9 and H3K14, respectively, in the gene body or promoter regions in pwr-2 or hda9-1 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 50% of the hyperacetylated DEGs for H3K9 and H3K14 overlapped between pwr-2 and hda9-1 (H3K9: 89 of 137 in pwr-2 and 89 of 131 in hda9-1; H3K14: 47 of 86 in pwr-2 and 47 of 105 in hda9-1) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 274 of the 542 coup-regulated DEGs retained hyperacetylation status for either H3K9 or H3K14 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 30% (49 of 179 for H3K9 and 49 of 144 for H3K14) had both H3K9 and H3K14 hyperacetylation (Fig 4C), suggesting some degree of functional specificity between H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation of target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings indicate that histone deacetylation at either H3K9 or H3K14 through PWR and HDA9 is significantly correlated with gene expression at the target loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PWR_and_HDA9_Act_in_the_Same_Genetic_Pathway_Through_AGL19_to_Ensure_Proper_Flowering_Time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the obvious phenotypes of pwr and hda9 mutants is early flowering (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have shown that early flowering in hda9 is because of increased AGL19 levels, which results from increased levels of histone acetylation and Pol II occupancy at the locus (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether PWR acts in the AGL19-mediated flowering-time pathway through HDA9 function, we first examined AGL19 transcript levels in pwr-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AGL19 expression was higher in pwr-2 as in hda9-1 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the acetylation level of histone H3 was tested in pwr-2 and hda9-1 by ChIP-qPCR, and the analysis revealed increased histone H3 acetylation in pwr-2 and hda9-1 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, no synergetic effect was observed in the pwr-2 hda9-1 double-mutant compared with either single-mutant in terms of AGL19 transcript levels and flowering time (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 5A and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings indicate that PWR and HDA9 act in the same genetic pathway in the regulation of flowering time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PWR_Physically_Interacts_with_HDA9  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that the functions of PWR and HDA9 are tightly correlated: they share histone deacetylation targets and regulate some of the same biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because N-CoR/SMRT acts together with HDAC3 as a subunit of the complex (32), we investigated whether PWR is associated with HDA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HA epitope-fused PWR (PWR-3xHA) and FLAG epitope-tagged HDA9 (HDA9-3xFLAG) were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HA antibodies to pull down PWR-3xHA followed by Western blotting to detect HDA9-3xFLAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, HDA9-FLAG was enriched in the PWR-3xHA immunoprecipitate (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the interaction between PWR and HDA9, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and PWR was found to interact with HDA9 (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that PWR interacts with HDA9 and may function in the same complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of a pair of SANT domains in PWR and their high sequence similarity to those of animal HDAC subunits were a major clue in the investigation of the molecular function of PWR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the PWR SANT2 domain recognizes histones, as does the SANT2 motif of the HDAC-associated subunit SMRT/N-CoR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding prompted further studies on PWR and HDACs and led to the conclusion that PWR acts together with HDA9 to deacetylate H3K9 and H3K14 at numerous genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the specific binding of the SMRT SANT2 domain to an unacetylated histone H4 tail (32), the PWR SANT2 domain preferentially binds to acetylated histone H3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) proposed that the SMRT SANT2 domain binds to unacetylated histone H4, possibly to recruit other cofactors or to prohibit further modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the binding of the PWR SANT2 domain to targets probably promotes histone H3 deacetylation in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PWR SANT2 domain exhibited specificity for modified histone H3 but not H4 or H2A/B (Fig 1A), which is consistent with the hyperacetylation status in pwr-2 and hda9-1 being specific for histone H3 and not H4 (35 and present study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the interaction between PWR and HDA9 and the significant overlap in their deacetylation targets in the genome, we propose that the PWR SANT2 domain confers substrate binding preferences to HDA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HDA9 regulates several biological processes, such as flowering time, seed dormancy, and stress responses (14, 35, 36, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies have shown that development and stress-response genes are up-regulated and this is accompanied by hyperacetylation in the hda9 mutant, there have been no reports about HDA9-interacting proteins required for its histone deacetylation function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical interaction between HDA9 and PWR and the similar morphological and molecular defects in the pwr and hda9 mutants support the hypothesis that PWR and HDA9 act in the same complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not clear whether HDA9 is the only interacting partner of PWR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histone peptide array showed that in addition to acetylated histone H3, the PWR SANT2 domain also bound to other modified histone H3, such as H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (Fig 1A), and the levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 were reduced in pwr-2 and hda9-1 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding raises two possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the PWRHDA9 complex coordinates histone acetylation and methylation for transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PWR may act as a histone code reader of which the SANT2 domain recognizes H3K9me1/me2 and interprets its repressive mode through histone deacetylation by recruiting HDA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because H3K9me1/me2 is mainly found at heterochromatin, this may be a mechanism to prevent histone acetylation at such genomic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, PWR acts in a distinct complex from the one containing HDA9 to regulate other histone modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several histone demethylases are known to interact with N-CoR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, JMJD2A, which demethylases di- or trimethylated histone H3K9, was isolated from affinity purification of the N-CoR complex (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous study revealed that PWR regulates floral stem cells as a positive regulator of a subset of MIR172 genes and CRC (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our finding that PWR acts in histone H3 deacetylation, the reduced transcript levels of MIR172 and CRC in pwr may be an indirect effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, there were a large number of down-regulated DEGs observed in pwr-2 and hda9-1 along with significant overlap between them (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, the level of miR164 was increased in pwr-2 (34) and, consistently, ChIP-seq revealed H3K9 hyperacetylation at MIR164b in both pwr-2 and hda9-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, MIR164b could be a direct target of the PWRHDA9 complex and increased miR164 levels are expected to result in reduced expression of miR164 target genes in pwr and hda9 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not yet clear how the PWRHDA9 complex specifies its targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motif analysis uncovered significant enrichment of sequences from the H3K9ac and H3K14ac ChIP-seq peaks (Fig 3E), which are very similar to the GAAGAA motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No transcription factors targeting this motif are known, but several studies have proposed that this motif is significantly enriched in splicing junction proximal exons, possibly as an exonic splicing enhancer (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the GAAGAA motif present in some genes may be recognized by PWRHDA9 to regulate their transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the GAAGAA motif may simply be associated with histone acetylation in spliced genes, leading to an overrepresentation of this motif in the dataset rather than being directly targeted by the PWRHDA9 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Arabidopsis plants were grown at 23 °C under continuous light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pwr-2 was described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, and hda9-1 was described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mutants were in the Columbia background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeds were surface-sterilized and sown on MS-agar plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 d of cold treatment, the plated seeds were transferred to 23 °C under long-day (16-h light, 8-h dark) or short-day (8-h light, 16-h dark) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmid_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For expression of the PWR SANT2 domain in Escherichia coli, the PWR SANT2 domain was amplified from cDNA using the SANT2-F and SANT2-R primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR fragment was cloned into pET32a at the BamHI and XhoI sites (pET32a-SANT2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the PWR entry clone for in planta PWR expression, the PWR coding region was amplified using PWR-CDS-F and PWR-CDS-R and cloned into pDONR221 by the standard Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PWR coding region was subsequently introduced into the gCsVMV-3xHA-N-1300 destination vector through Gateway cloning to generate gCsVMV-PWR-3xHA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HDA9 coding region was amplified using HDA9-F and HDA9-R primers and cloned into pCAMBIA1390, which also contained 3xFLAG, using the PstI and BamHI sites to generate pCAMBIA-HDA9-3xFLAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gCsVMV-PWR-3xHA and pCAMBIA-HDA9-3xFLAG were used for the tobacco transient assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used for plasmid construction are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ten-day-old seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and the powder was boiled for 5 min in 1× protein sample buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, the proteins were resolved on a 15% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membranes were blocked in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween-20) with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat milk for 1 h and probed with antipan-acetylated H3 (Abcam, ab47915), anti-H3K9ac (Abcam, ab10812), H3K14ac (Abcam, ab46984), H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729), H3K9me1 (Abcam, ab9045), and H3K9me2 (Abcam, ab1220) in TBST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three washes with TBST, the signals were detected with Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from 10- to 14-d-old seedlings using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed in triplicate on a Bio-Rad CFX 384 Real-Time System using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 17088802AP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used for real-time RT-PCR are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ChIP was performed as previously described (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in M1 buffer [10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 M hexylene glycol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)] for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-linking reaction was quenched by adding glycine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was filtered through four layers of Miracloth, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pelleted chromatin was washed three times with M2 buffer (M1 buffer plus 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100) and one time with M3 buffer [10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromatin was resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer and sonicated to generate DNA fragments 500 bp in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysate was precleared by incubation with 50-µL protein-A agarose beads/salmon sperm DNA (Millipore) for 1 h then incubated with anti-H3K9ac (Abcam, ab10812) and anti-H3K14ac antibodies (Abcam, ab52946) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beads were washed two times with each of the following solutions: low salt, high salt, LiCl, and TE (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bound DNA fragments were recovered and purified using columns from the Qiagen Plasmid Extraction Kit according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on bound and input DNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mRNA-Seq_Library_Construction_and_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA purity was determined by assaying 1 µL of total RNA extract on a NanoDrop8000 spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA integrity number value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturers instructions (Illumina Truseq stranded mRNA library prep kit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA was purified and fragmented from total RNA (1 µg) using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads and two rounds of purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleaved RNA fragments were reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase, random primers, and dUTP in place of dTTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The incorporation of dUTP quenches the second strand during amplification because the polymerase does not incorporate past this nucleotide.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single adenine base was added to these cDNA fragments, followed by adapter ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The products were purified and amplified with PCR to create the final strand-specific cDNA library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the amplified libraries was verified by capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer, Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After qPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), the index-tagged libraries were combined in equimolar amounts within a single pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  500 system following the provided protocols for 1 × 75 sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were mapped to the TAIR10 Arabidopsis genome using HISAT2 (46) with default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads that mapped to multiple regions were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-expression levels were determined using a Perl script, and the calculations for differential gene expression were performed using edgeR (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with counts per million less_than1 were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with at least a 1.5 fold-change in expression (FDR  0.05) were considered to be differentially expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP-Seq_Library_Construction_and_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ChIP DNA was quantified using a fluorescence-based quantification method (Qubit, Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-seq libraries were prepared according to the manufacturers instructions (Illumina TruSeq ChIP sample prep kit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Input ChIP DNA was blunt-ended and phosphorylated, and a single adenine base was added to the 3 ends of the fragments in preparation for ligation to an adapter with a single thymine base overhang.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The products of this ligation reaction were purified and size-selected (300- to 400-bp fragments) by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size-selected DNA was purified and PCR-amplified to enrich for fragments with adapters on both ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the amplified libraries was verified by capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer, Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After qPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), the index-tagged libraries were combined in equimolar amounts within a single pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  500 system following the provided protocols for 1 × 75 sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ChIP-seq analysis was performed as previously described (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, GAPipeline, the Illumina sequence data analysis pipeline, was used to analyze the raw sequence data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads were mapped to the TAIR10 Arabidopsis genome using Bowtie (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perfectly and uniquely mapped reads were processed for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wiggle (WIG) files of the alignments were generated using bam2wig (https://github.com/MikeAxtell/bam2wig) and visualized using IGV (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the SICER program (51), ChIP-enriched peaks were identified, and qualitative comparisons of binding levels in wild-type and mutant plants were determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each peak was positioned to genomic location (TE, genes, or intergenic region), and peaks within genes were further classified as exon, intron, 5UTR or 3UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The promoter-representing peaks were defined by their position within 2-kb upstream of a TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the reads number is provided in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearson correlation was determined by R statistical software on normalized signal intensity for ChIP peaks in the two biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation (R) was 0.984, 0.988, and 0.998 for H3K9ac ChIP of Col, pwr-2 and hda9-1, respectively (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
