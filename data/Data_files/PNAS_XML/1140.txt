Nitrate is an important nitrogen source for Arctic tundra plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How terrestrial plants use N and respond to soil N loading is central to evaluating and predicting changing ecosystem structure and function with climate warming and N pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, evidence from NO3 in plant tissues has uncovered the uptake and assimilation of soil NO3 by Arctic tundra plants, which has long been assumed negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil NO3 contributed about one-third of the bulk N used by tundra plants of northern Alaska.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the importance of soil NO3 for tundra plants should be considered in future studies on N and C cycling in Arctic ecosystems where C sequestration is strongly determined by N availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant nitrogen (N) use is a key component of the N cycle in terrestrial ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supply of N to plants affects community species composition and ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis and carbon (C) accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the availabilities and relative importance of different N forms to plants are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While nitrate (NO3) is a major N form used by plants worldwide, it is discounted as a N source for Arctic tundra plants because of extremely low NO3 concentrations in Arctic tundra soils, undetectable soil nitrification, and plant-tissue NO3 that is typically below detection limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reexamine NO3 use by tundra plants using a sensitive denitrifier method to analyze plant-tissue NO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil-derived NO3 was detected in tundra plant tissues, and tundra plants took up soil NO3 at comparable rates to plants from relatively NO3-rich ecosystems in other biomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrate assimilation determined by 15N enrichments of leaf NO3 relative to soil NO3 accounted for 4 to 52% (as estimated by a Bayesian isotope-mixing model) of species-specific total leaf N of Alaskan tundra plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that in situ soil NO3 availability for tundra plants is high has important implications for Arctic ecosystems, not only in determining species compositions, but also in determining the loss of N from soils via leaching and denitrification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant N uptake and soil N losses can strongly influence C uptake and accumulation in tundra soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, this evidence of NO3 availability in tundra soils is crucial for predicting C storage in tundra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the highly sensitive denitrifier method (detailed in Materials and Methods), we analyzed concentrations and stable isotope compositions of NO3 in tissues of dominant plant species in Alaskan tundra ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared our results with those for plants from relatively high-N or high-NO3 ecosystems in lower-latitude regions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such comparisons of Arctic sites to non-Arctic sites, using both traditional and new methods, are important for understanding soil N cycling (particularly soil NO3 availability) and for placing the N uptake abilities of tundra plants into a broader context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Uptake_of_NO3_in_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existence of NO3 in plant tissues is evidence for NO3 uptake from the soil or atmosphere because NO3 production in non-N2 fixing plants is negligible under normal conditions (3640).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NO3 can be produced from the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) both enzymatically and nonenzymatically in non-N2 fixing plants (3740), the rates are very low in natural environments (4144), especially compared with the pool sizes of NO3 detected in plants of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, while NO3 production by nonsymbiotic hemoglobin is possible in anoxic conditions (38, 39) and with high ambient NO concentrations (40), neither anoxic conditions nor high ambient NO applies to the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We detected unexpectedly high NO3 concentrations in leaves and roots of the tundra plant species studied (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, of the 153 tundra plant samples analyzed, 143 had measurable NO3 concentrations (detailed in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some species (e.g., Polygonum bistorta) had higher foliar NO3 than low-latitude forest species, including those in high-NO3 environments (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, ratios of leaf NO3 to soil NO3 and of root NO3 to soil NO3 were similar between tundra and lower-latitude ecosystems or even higher in tundra than in some lower-latitude ecosystems (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide evidence of high NO3 uptake of tundra plants despite much lower concentrations of NO3 in tundra soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that tundra plants can take up NO3 as efficiently as plants from relatively NO3-rich ecosystems in other biomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, NO3 additions to soils enhanced leaf NO3 concentrations in most tundra plants (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is evidence that plant NO3 uptake is responsive to soil NO3 variations in Arctic tundra ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such responses and patterns of NO3 uptake among studied species are useful for interpreting changes in functional traits and the structure of tundra plant communities in response to projected increases of soil NO3 with climate warming and elevated N deposition (1, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Sources_of_NO3_in_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the 17O signatures of leaf NO3 (17Oleaf) to verify the mixing of atmospheric-derived NO3 [17Oatm  greater than  0 per mille () due to an enrichment in 17O during photochemical oxidization of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by O3] with soil-derived NO3 (17Osoil = 0 because of no 17O excess in atmospheric O2 and soil H2O molecules) (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaf NO3 of P. bistorta showed no 17O isotope anomaly (17O values = 0.0; SI Appendix, Fig S7), indicating that the NO3 detected in this species was purely soil derived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, soil NO3 is available to, and taken up by, tundra plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, positive 17Oleaf values in low-latitude forests (SI Appendix, Fig S7) indicate the direct leaf absorption of atmospheric-derived NO3 (17O  greater than  0) or possibly the root uptake of NO3 at the surface soil with positive 17O values (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used mean 17O values of precipitation NO3 measured in the Tama-Kyuryo Field Museum forest in temperate Japan (TML) (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for descriptions of the forest sites used in this study) (49); in Guiyang in subtropical China (this study); and in Jianfengling forests in Hainan, tropical China (49) as 17Oatm values in the studied temperate, subtropical, and tropical forests, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then estimated mixing ratios of atmospheric-derived NO3 (17Oleaf:17Oatm) for plants in lower-latitude ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that atmospheric-derived NO3 accounted for, on average, 35% (6 to 86%) of total leaf NO3 in measured samples from lower-latitude forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO3_Assimilation_in_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Higher 15N and 18O values in plant-tissue NO3 relative to source NO3 could provide new evidence for in situ plant NO3 assimilation because NO3 reduction via NO3 reductase would cause 15N and 18O enrichments in the unassimilated NO3 (2, 5052).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we calculated differences ( values) between isotopic values of tissue NO3 (15N and 18O) in each plant sample and mean values of soil NO3 in corresponding ecosystems (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In northern Alaska, 15N values of soil NO3 were 1.0 at Toolik Field Station (TFS) (see SI Appendix, Table S1) (21, 53) and 0.5 ± 4.7 at Barrow (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric-derived NO3 in snowmelt had lower 15N values of 4.8 ± 1.0 at Barrow (54) and much lower values of 8.6 ± 0.7 at a high Arctic site at Midtre Lovénbreen, Svalbard (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with 15N values of soil- or atmospheric-derived NO3 (SI Appendix, Fig S8A), the higher 15N values of leaf NO3 in tundra of northern Alaska (positive 15N values; Fig 2A) are evidence for in situ NO3 assimilation in tundra plants (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18O values of NO3 produced in high-centered soil polygons averaged 4.4 ± 2.7 at Barrow (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, distinctly higher 18O values of leaf NO3 than those of soil NO3 (positive 18O values; Fig 2B) also provide evidence for in situ NO3 assimilation in tundra plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In non-Arctic sites, higher 18O values of leaf NO3 than those of a soil- and atmospheric-derived NO3 mixture (distributed on the mixing line; Fig 3) indicated assimilation of the mixed NO3 pool in the studied plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, higher 18O enrichments (SI Appendix, Fig S8) might be due, in part, to contributions from high 18O values of atmospheric-derived NO3 (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major uncertainties existed in fractional contributions of atmospheric-derived NO3 in leaf NO3 because of limited 17O data of leaf NO3 and lack of explicit 17O values of atmospheric NO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation NO3 might not fully represent all atmospheric NO3 contributions to plant leaves; in addition, it is even more difficult to determine reasonable 15N and 18O end-member values of atmospheric-derived NO3 in plant leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these problems, NO3 isotopes in plant tissues did provide information on plant NO3 sources and uptake in disturbed ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contributions_of_Soil_NO3_to_Total_N_in_Tundra_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with plants in relatively N-rich ecosystems, tundra plants showed a similar distribution of leaf total N concentrations but a much wider distribution of leaf total (bulk) 15N values (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wider distribution of leaf total 15N values arises because of the strong niche differentiation of N-use regimes among tundra plants (13, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 15N values of total N in tundra plants (11.2 to 5.8 in Alaska) are generally lower than those of soil NH4+ [around 12.3 ± 3.6 (this study); 4.4 ± 0.9 (53); and 1.4 ± 0.5 (21)], although some DON components are 15N depleted [around 5.7 for hydrolyzable amino acids (HAA) at Imnavait Creek (IMT) in northern Alaska; see SI Appendix, Table S1] (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disparity between the 15N signatures of plant total N vs. soil N sources exists even when isotopic fractionations for NH4+ and HAA assimilation by mycorrhizal plants are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given plant NO3 uptake and assimilation as indicated by NO3 in plant tissues, soil NO3 should be considered when using 15N methods to evaluate in situ contributions of soil N sources to total N of tundra plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proportional contributions (f, expressed as a percentage) of soil NO3 to total N in tundra plants were estimated using 15N values of soil N (NO3, NH4+, and HAA) and 15N values of leaf total N in a Bayesian isotope-mixing model [Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/siar/index.html) (59)] (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIAR model uses a Bayesian framework to establish a logical prior distribution (60) for estimating f values, and then determines the probability distribution for the f values of each source (soil NO3, NH4+, and HAA, in this study) to the mixture (total N of plant leaves, in this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We contend that this approach provides reliable estimations of fractional contributions of different N sources to plant total N because the mixing model considers isotope effects during plant N uptake (15 values hereafter) and variability in both source 15N values and plant 15N values (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, the 15N values (mean ± SD) of soil NO3 at Barrow [0.5 ± 4.7 (54)], soil NH4+ at IMT and TFS (11.5 ± 8.4, this study and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21), and soil HAA at IMT [5.7 ± 2.2; (53)] were used as source 15N values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants, leaf 15N values were mainly controlled by the 15N values and f values of source N (NO3, NH4+, and HAA), assuming negligible isotope effects during the acquisition processes of source N from soil into NM plants (i.e., 15 = 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mycorrhizal plants, the 15 values during the acquisition processes of soil N sources were calculated as the net differences of leaf 15N values between mycorrhizal and NM plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same 15 value was assumed for plant species associated with the same type of mycorrhiza and for N forms absorbed through the same type of mycorrhiza.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Alaskan tundra, the 15 values for plant species associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), ectomycorrhizae (ECM), and ericoid mycorrhizae (ERM) were estimated as net 15N differences from NM plantsthat is, 5.0, 6.9, and 7.7, respectively (21, 62), which differed from the 15 values normalized for worldwide plants [2.0, 3.2, and 5.9, respectively (63)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our 15 values (0 for NM plants, 5.0 for AM plants, 6.9 for ECM plants, and 7.7 for ERM plants) were considered under four scenarios (scenario 1: for NO3, NH4+, and HAA; scenario 2: for NH4+ and HAA only; scenario 3: for HAA only; and scenario 4: for none of NO3, NH4+, and HAA) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates from natural 15N evidence were that NO3 assimilation accounted for 4 to 52% of species-specific leaf total N (around one-third, on average) of Alaskan tundra plants (Fig 5), thereby demonstrating the importance of soil NO3 relative to soil NH4+ and HAA for N use by many tundra plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings also enhance understanding of N competition among plant species and between plants and microbes in Arctic tundra ecosystems, and how that may affect changes in species community composition and productivity with climate change and N pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Sites_and_Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate in situ NO3 uptake and assimilation in terrestrial plants in relation to NO3 availability, we selected 18 sites (see descriptions in SI Appendix, Table S1) across a distinct gradient of soil NO3 (SI Appendix, Fig S2), including one tropical and four subtropical sites in southwestern China; nine temperate sites in central, southern, and western Japan; and four Arctic tundra sites in northern Alaska.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, Tsukuba Forest Experimental Watershed (TKB) and Tama-Kyuryo Field Museum upper slope (TMU) and lower slope (TML) (SI Appendix, Table S1) are characterized by high soil NO3 or N saturation (49, 64, 65), while the Arctic sites TFS, Sagavanirktok River Valley (SAG), and IMT (SI Appendix, Table S1) are characterized by unmeasurable nitrification rates and negligible soil NO3 and, thus, are assumed to be typically low-NO3 ecosystems (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 28 plant species in the above study sites were sampled for fine roots (roughly less_than5 mm in diameter and less_than20 cm in spatial distribution of soil depth) or mature sunlit leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studied plants in each ecosystem include dominant indigenous species (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design of this study allows us to evaluate plant NO3 use at the species and ecosystem levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soil_N_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil N concentrations and net N transformation rates (mineralization and nitrification) were measured as indices of potentially available NO3 for both plants and soil microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information on soil types and samplings, N variables, and corresponding methods used for each ecosystem are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations of NO3 and NH4+ in soil solutions, extracts of fresh soils, and extracts of incubated soils (for net N mineralization and net nitrification rates) were determined colorimetrically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEN was digested to NO3 using alkaline persulfate digestion and its concentration measured as NO3 on the autoanalyzer (specified in SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In-house standards (alanine, glycine, and histidine) dissolved in corresponding extracts were used for calibrating the concentrations of TEN and estimating the effect of the N blank from reagents (the same as that described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil extractable organic N was calculated as the difference between soil TEN and extractable inorganic N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
15N and 18O ratios of soil NO3 were determined using the denitrifier (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) method (described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65 and 66) that converts NO3 to nitrous oxide (N2O) (67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration curve between measured isotope ratios of N2O and those of NO3 was prepared using US Geological Survey (USGS)-32, USGS-34, USGS-35, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) NO3 standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil NH4+ in 100-mL extracts of IMT soil was separated onto glass filter papers (GF/D; Whatman) using the diffusion method (69), and then the NH4+ diffused on the filter papers was measured for 15N values on an elemental analyzer coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) (70) at The Ecosystems Center, Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAEA-N2 was run with the samples to check the accuracy of 15N-NH4+ data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analytical precision was better than 0.2 for 15N-NO3, 0.5 for 18O-NO3, and 0.5 for 15N-NH4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective natural abundances of 15N and 18O were reported as 15N and 18O values expressed in per mille units, as 15N or 18O = [(Rsample/Rstandard)  1] × 1,000, where R = 15N/14N or 18O/16O and standards are atmospheric N2 and standard mean ocean water for N and O, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_N_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leaf total N concentrations and total 15N values of plant samples were analyzed using an EA-IRMS (detailed in SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analytical precision for 15N was better than 0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaf NRA assay, which has been used to evaluate the NO3-reduction potential of tundra plants [expressed per either fresh or dry weight (58, 71)], was conducted for plants at pristine and control sites of IMT, SAG, TFS-MAT (moist acidic tundra), TFS-MNT (moist non-acidic tundra), and at fertilized plots of TFS-MAT (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method of leaf NRA determination was the same as that described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58, 72, and 73.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NRA data (only those uniformly reported in dry weight) of natural terrestrial plants in low-latitude ecosystems were compiled (SI Appendix, Fig S3C) for comparing NRA levels between tundra and low-latitude ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concentrations and 15N and 18O of NO3 in plants were measured using the sensitive denitrifier method (67, 68) at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT; method details are described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74 and 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, 1 of 7 root samples of Eriophorum vaginatum and 7 of 94 leaf samples of tundra plants showed measurable NO3 concentration as zero, including 5 of 15 Sphagnum samples, 1 of 8 Cassiope tetragona leaf samples, and 1 of 1 Juniperus communis leaf sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 17O values of NO3 in plant leaves were determined by combining bacterial reduction [i.e., denitrifier method (67, 68)] and the thermal decomposition method (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, NO3 in plant extracts was converted to N2O using the denitrifier method (67, 68) at TUAT (method details are described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74 and 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the gold-tube conversion of bacteria-produced N2O into N2 and O2 was conducted, and 17O values (defined as 17O = [(1 + 17O)/(1 + 18O)]  1, where the constant  is 0.5247; see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  76 and 77) were measured on a Finnigan Delta Plus Advantage IRMS (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at the University of Washington (method details are described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A laboratory standard courtesy of Greg Michalski, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN [NaNO3 with 17O = 19.9 (79)] and several standards that mimic the 5% and 10% of atmospheric NO3 (i.e., 17O = 1 and 2, respectively) were used to check the precision of low 17O samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average SDs for replicate analyses of an individual sample were ±0.2 for 17O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
