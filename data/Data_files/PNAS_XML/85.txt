title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Army ants dynamically adjust living bridges in response to a costbenefit trade-off  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complex systems, from ant colonies to stock markets, share a common property: sophisticated group-level structure emerges from simple individual-level behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using simple interaction rules, Eciton army ants construct complex bridges from their own bodies to span forest-floor gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These living bridges are uniquely complex in both their dynamic properties and the number of animals involved and so are of considerable interest for understanding emergent structures in complex systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In field experiments, we show that construction interacts with traffic rate and environmental geometry, causing bridges to lengthen, widen, and migrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bridges provide a shortcut for foraging ants, at the cost of sequestering workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that bridge location represents a costbenefit trade-off, with potential implications for human engineered self-assembling systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of individual animals to create functional structures by joining together is rare and confined to the social insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Army ants (Eciton) form collective assemblages out of their own bodies to perform a variety of functions that benefit the entire colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examine bridges of linked individuals that are constructed to span gaps in the colonys foraging trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How these living structures adjust themselves to varied and changing conditions remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our field experiments show that the ants continuously modify their bridges, such that these structures lengthen, widen, and change position in response to traffic levels and environmental geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ants initiate bridges where their path deviates from their incoming direction and move the bridges over time to create shortcuts over large gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final position of the structure depended on the intensity of the traffic and the extent of path deviation and was influenced by a costbenefit trade-off at the colony level, where the benefit of increased foraging trail efficiency was balanced by the cost of removing workers from the foraging pool to form the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this trade-off, we quantified the geometric relationship between costs and benefits revealed by our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then constructed a model to determine the bridge location that maximized foraging rate, which qualitatively matched the observed movement of bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight how animal self-assemblages can be dynamically modified in response to a group-level costbenefit trade-off, without any individual units having information on global benefits or costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that army ants dynamically adjusted the location and size of their bridges at the local level to meet a costbenefit trade-off at the colony level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bridges formed were not static structuresthey were initiated at the apex of the diversion formed by our apparatus and, by a dynamic process of construction and deconstruction, moved toward the main trail axis, lengthening and widening as they did so (shown in Fig 1A; also see Movie S1), and thus shortening the overall path of travel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The grouped results for bridge movement as a function of experimental time (Fig 2A) clearly show an initial period of rapid bridge migration, which plateaus toward the end of the experiment [generalized linear model (GLM), t630 6.812679, P less_than 0.00001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bridges built at smaller angles  moved further than those at larger angles (GLM, t630 = 2.719549, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all angles, bridge movement did not continue to its full possible extent where the bridge would have intercepted the main trail axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, bridge movement plateaued after some distance, with lower angles  showing a greater movement distance (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traffic intensity also had a strong effect on the distance moved by the bridge, with higher traffic leading to greater movement (Fig 2C; GLM, interaction between time and traffic, t630 = 9.010750, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bridges moved closer to the main trail axis, they grew longer to maintain the connection between the two platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bridges lengthened, there was a correlated increase in width, as shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the linear regression of length and width decreased with increasing angle  (12° = 1.25, 20° = 0.96, 40° = 0.59, and 60° = 0.52), indicating that bridge width increased at a faster rate for smaller angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geometric_Model_of_the_CostBenefit_Relationship  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fact that bridge movement stops before creating the maximum shortcut possible suggests the existence of a trade-off between the benefit provided by a shorter path length and the cost of sequestering workers in the living structure, rendering them unable to participate in the capture and retrieval of prey items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We adopted a geometric approach to quantify the relationship between the aforementioned cost and benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefit was computed as the amount of travel distance saved B as a function of the distance d moved by the bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined as the difference between the path length in the absence of a bridge and the path length in the presence of a bridge and is given byB=2dcos(/2)(1sin(/2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]The cost C of sequestering workers can be approximated by the surface area of the bridge, as a proxy of the number of sequestered workers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an angle , the distance d moved by the bridge, and the width of the bridge, the cost isC=4d2wtan2(/2)(1wtan(/2)),[2]where w is the ratio between the width and the length of a bridge, as a function of the angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of w corresponds to the slope of the linear regression in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The theoretical costs (in geometric terms) increase nonlinearly (as d2) with bridge movement (Fig S2A), increasing much more rapidly for higher angles .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical benefits, in terms of travel distance saved by installing a bridge as a shortcut, increase linearly (as d) for all angles as bridges move further toward the main trail axis (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits increase at a faster rate for smaller angles because the longer bridges required at larger angles offset some of the benefits in total path length reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify our theoretical costbenefit relationship, we compared the theoretical curves to the costbenefit relationship of actual bridges (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our geometric quantification of the costbenefit relationship in army ant bridges shows that the cost of sequestering workers increases faster than the benefit gained from reducing travel distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that this costbenefit relationship is responsible for bridge movement ceasing before travel distance along the trail is minimized, we extended the geometric model to the following costbenefit optimization model of bridge construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model assumes that the colony tends to maximize traffic density on their trails as a means to improve traffic output (e.g., increased prey retrieval, shorter migration time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is compatible with previous studies showing that several army ant behaviors are directly involved in improving traffic conditions on the trails (16, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CostBenefit_Optimization_Model_of_Bridge_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We model N ants, which are situated on a section of foraging trail of length LT in addition to the experimental apparatus, which has an inner edge length LA and is set at an angle  (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the design of the apparatus, LA is a function of the angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If L0 is the length of the arm between the two hinge points and wA is the width of the apparatus arm (Fig 1A), then the length L1 of the apparatus arm that overlaps with the other arm is given by L1 = wA/(2tan(/2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the inner edge of one arm is therefore LE = L0  L1, and the overall inner length of the apparatus is twice this length, so that LA = 2L0  wA/tan(/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of a bridge, the total (one-way) travel distance for each ant is LT + LA, and the density of ants on the foraging trail is N/(LT + LA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If a bridge is built across the apparatus at some distance d from the apparatus junction, then the length of the bridge will be b = 2dtan(/2) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, this will decrease the total foraging trail length to f = LT + b + (1  d/Dmax)LA, where Dmax is the maximum distance that the bridge can travel given the constraints of the apparatus and is given by Dmax = LAcos(/2)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bridge incurs a cost to the colony by decreasing the number of available foraging ants by an amount nb = wb2(1  wtan(/2))/(lnwn), where w is the ratio between the width and the length of the bridge, and ln and wn are the length and width, respectively, of an average ant when occupying a position within the bridge structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of ants on the foraging trail in the presence of a bridge becomes=(Nnb)/f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If we assume that the speed of an ant foraging on the trail is approximately constant within the range of ant densities observed, then maximizing the traffic rate of the colony is equivalent to maximizing the density of ants on the foraging trail (within this range of densities).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By differentiating Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 with respect to bridge distance d, setting the result to 0, and solving for d, we can compute the bridge distance that maximizes colony foraging rate, subject to a maximum value of Dmax:d=cos(/2)2(1sin(/2))[(LT+LA)(LT+LA)2Nlnwn[1sin(/2)]2w[1wtan(/2)]sin(/2)2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we add a free parameter A to adjust the space occupied by an ant on the trail (or equivalently, the length or width of the ants in the bridge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This parameter can be interpreted as differences (i.e., morphological or functional) between the ants that typically contribute to bridge building and those that tend to participate in foraging, which are difficult to measure quantitatively in this experiment (Discussion).d=cos(/2)2(1sin(/2))[(LT+LA)(LT+LA)2ANlnwn[1sin(/2)]2w[1wtan(/2)]sin(/2)2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By fitting the resulting Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 to the data, we find a very good fit to the data for A = 17.02 (95% confidence interval [15.22,18.82]) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal bridge migration distance decreases as the apparatus angle increases and increases as the overall density of ants on the foraging trail increases (Fig 4A), which agrees with the behavior of the ants in our experiment (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study demonstrates the capacity of army ants to dynamically adjust the properties of their living structures to changing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although each ant possesses only local information, and does not know the global position or dimensions of the bridge, the structures move, lengthen, and widen in response to traffic levels and environmental geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the movement of bridges did not continue to the furthest possible extent over our apparatus, which would have created the shortest path by directly connecting both segments of the main trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For larger angles, bridge migration ceased sooner, because ants traded off the diminishing returns of shortening the trail to avoid the cost of locking up an increasing number of workers in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than minimizing the length of their trail network with no regard for the cost incurred by larger bridges, army ant colonies modify their bridges according to a costbenefit trade-off for the given environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our density-based model of bridge dynamics demonstrates that such a trade-off is likely to result from attempts to maximize the foraging rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model shows that, given the properties of the traffic along the trail, there exists a bridge position where the cost of sequestering workers in the bridge structure outweighs the benefit gained from reduced travel distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data do not allow us to claim that the positions at which bridges stopped in our experiments are indeed the optimal positions predicted by this idealized model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because our model assumes that ants attempt to maximize traffic density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, traffic theory indicates that they should increase traffic only up to a critical density that maximizes traffic flow, and beyond which interactions between individuals would cause slowdowns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring this critical density would be very difficult in field conditions, where it is nearly impossible to controland in particular to increasethe traffic flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the ants have a number of regulatory mechanisms that naturally keep traffic below the critical density (16, 2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, assuming that ant traffic never exceeds this critical density, our model makes two clear predictions: the distance moved by the bridge should decrease with the increasing angle of the apparatus, and for all angles, bridges should move further as traffic increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental results match these two predictions very well, supporting the hypothesis that the position and size of army ant bridges result from a costbenefit trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There may be several factors contributing to the value of the free parameter A in our costbenefit model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the model treated each individual equally (by simply counting the number of ants on the trail and the number of ants in the bridge), there are substantial differences between bridge-building ants and non-bridge-building ants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The submajor caste of E. hamatum rarely participates in bridge building but contributes highly disproportionally to foraging, in terms of the likelihood of carrying a prey item, the size of the prey item carried, and running speed (9, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our preliminary observations suggest the ants contributing to bridge building tend to be younger individuals that are visibly more timid in the raid traffic and lack foraging experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these factors reduce the cost of ants joining the bridge and account for at least some of the value of the free parameter A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most likely mechanism by which army ant bridges adjust to their environment is through individuals modifying their likelihood to join or leave a structure based on interaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ants in the structure are responsive to changes in traffic, increasing their likelihood to leave when traffic levels drop below a critical threshold (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a bridge forms at an angle between two surfaces, as in our experimental apparatus, traffic conditions vary along the bridges cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ants seeking the shortest path tend to create a higher traffic flow along the inner side of the bridge (closer to the main trail axis), and lower traffic flows along the outer side, where the path is longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Passing workers thus experience higher interaction rates on the inner side and are more likely to attach to the structure here (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ants on the outer edge are contacted less, and are more likely to leave the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localized processes of construction and deconstruction in response to a cross-sectional traffic gradient are likely to result in a dynamic structure that steadily moves toward the main trail axis, shortening the overall path of travel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study was necessarily focused on the local dynamics of single bridges occurring on sections of the greater foraging network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the overall colony-level costs and benefits, it would be necessary to quantify both the number of ants per bridge and the number of bridges in an entire foraging network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powell and Franks (18), using the closely related Eciton burchellii, calculated that the costbenefit trade-off of building plugs vs. contributing to prey retrieval should yield a net gain for the colony under a range of realistic scenarios (pothole plugs can be thought of as ant bridges with one to a few individuals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, under their worst-case estimate, with the loss of one prey item for every plug ant and a total of 20% of total foragers dedicated to plugs, daily intake of prey could drop by as much as 79%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, accurate measures of the proportion of available foragers locked up in bridge structures will be critical for a global, colony-level representation of the cost of bridges to foraging colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it is clear that the presence of bridges should yield energetic gains at the colony level from increased prey delivery rates, both through minimizing the path length from raid site to bivouac and from the cumulative increase in speed gained by smoothing rough sections of terrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for global, colony-level calculations of the costbenefit trade-offs of bridge building, it would be necessary to accurately measure the path length of the trail established by the ants, the number and size of bridges along the trail, and the total path shortening that the bridges provide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is beyond the scope of the present study (although see Supporting Information for an estimate of colony-wide bridge investment) but will be critical for extending our results here on the localized net gain of bridges to the collective benefit at the whole-colony level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future work should also examine how E. burchellii responds to the costbenefit trade-off induced by bridge-building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foraging behavior of E. burchellii differs from that of E. hamatum in that the former species most often uses a single branching trail that is focused in one direction only, and connected to the bivouac by a common, trunk trail (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colony size is also typically much larger in E. burchellii than in E. hamatum, further contributing to higher traffic flow and prey delivery rates in E. burchellii at the level of individual trails (11, 12, 19, 24), but not necessarily greater colony-level biomass intake when E. hamatums multiple trail foraging system is considered (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all workers are using the same trunk trail [as opposed to the two or three separate radiating trails of E. hamatum (11)], then colony-level bridging costs may be lower as less terrain may need to be bridged, and benefits may be higher because the entire prey-laden workforce will benefit from all bridges on the common trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, E. burchellii bridges may also need to be wider given the higher average traffic flow, and more obstacles may need to be bridged to accommodate the generally wider trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If E. burchellii has also evolved to make a costbenefit trade-off in bridge building, we might therefore expect informative differences between species in the distance and rate of bridge migration, further improving our understanding of the costbenefit trade-offs inherent to collectively solve these problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important area for future work is the role of structural forces in regulating the growth, movement, and stability of bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments demonstrate that a consistent length/width ratio is maintained as bridges increase in size, which suggests that the probability to join or leave a bridge may be influenced by structural forces as well as traffic dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ants already in a bridge, the decision to remain or leave may be influenced by increasing or decreasing tension forces on the legs, whereas for ants crossing a bridge, the decision to join may be influenced by the relative stability of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previous study, the bridge structure was shown to emerge in a decentralized manner, from simple interactions influenced by local information on the traffic intensity and the presence of gaps along the trail (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study provides quantitative insights into the functional importance of the self-assembly process for the foraging efficiency of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that self-assembling bridges can adjust to features of the landscape that are unpredictable from the organisms perspective, and appear to balance construction costs with foraging benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these structures demonstrate the adaptive value of biological self-assembly even in complex, multicellular organisms (6, 25, 26) and may inform the design of artificial self-assemblages, at the interface of materials science, robotics and architecture (2734).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The focal species was E. hamatum (Fabricius), and all data were collected from Barro Colorado Island, Panama.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were conducted during daylight hours between February and August 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. hamatum workers spend the day foraging, establishing a primary trail and several secondary trails by late morning, with bidirectional traffic connecting the bivouac to the raid site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted our experiments along the primary raiding trail, finding a suitable location to set up our apparatus and filming equipment before inserting our experimental apparatus into the existing trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, we located sticks and small branches along the trail on which ants had been running, which were thus coated in trail pheromone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing these, we inserted our apparatus into the interrupted trail, using the pheromone-coated sticks to construct makeshift ramps on either side of our apparatus, which was mounted on tripods 40 cm above the forest floor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To encourage the rerouting of traffic, we placed additional leaves from the trail, along with ants, onto the side platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a period of 1030 min, the trail had fully reestablished over our apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The apparatus consisted of four 3D-printed platforms attached by adjustable hinges into a V shape (Fig 1), attached to two larger platforms mounted on tripods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before each experiment, we set the angle of separation between the platforms () to a randomly designated treatment angle of either 12° (n = 5), 20° (n = 8), 40° (n = 7), or 60° (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In every trial, ants initiated bridges at the intersection point between the platforms, and over time these bridges moved out over the gap in the apparatus toward the main trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the hinge mechanism, the absolute distance from the main trail to the junction of the platforms (Dmax) increased with increasing  (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because bridges were only initiated at this junction, we compared different angles of  by measuring the absolute distance from the junction to the inner edge (with respect to the main trail) of the bridge (d in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data_Collection_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Video data were collected at 60 frames per second using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3 digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The camera was installed on a tripod to film from 30 cm above the deviating platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment was filmed for around 45 min, beginning when a strong trail was visible on the apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analysis was performed on 30 min of this data, starting when ants first initiated a bridge between the two deviating platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured how the collective action of the ants modified various bridge properties over time, performing our analyses for each minute of the experiments by selecting the final frame from each minute of the video data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A shows graphically the properties of the bridge we measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the ImageJ software (v1.46r, imagej.nih.gov/ij/), we measured where the inner and outer edges of the bridge intersected a line drawn through the center of the space between the hinged platforms (Dmax in Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the absolute distance that the inner edge of the bridge moved from the junction of the two platforms (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bridge width (w) was determined by calculating the distance between the inner and outer edges of the bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing the angle , and the length of d, we used basic trigonometry to determine the length of the inner edge of the bridge (b in Fig 1A) and the trapezoidal surface area of the bridge for each minute of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to changes over time, we were interested in how the ants modified the structure of their bridges under different traffic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured traffic along the trail by counting how many ants passed a point one-quarter of the way along one of the platforms of the apparatus, in both directions, over each minute of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The change in position of the bridge over time was analyzed using a GLM with three main effects: time, angle , and traffic intensity as measured above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time variable was transformed using a hyperbolic function to account for the slowing down of the bridge movements with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters of the hyperbolic function (i.e., the growth speed and the asymptote) were estimated by fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data of each experiment separately and taking the median value for each parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within-group correlation was modeled as an autoregressive process of order 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Akaike information criterion, a comparison of the different combinations of the three main effects and their interactions showed that the best model included time, angle  and traffic intensity, and the interactions between time and angle , and between time and traffic intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model diagnostics were performed using graphical procedures (Q-Q plot and standardized residuals vs. fitted values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Parameter_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The center of each hinge point is 0.98 cm from the end of each platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the apparatus arm between the two hinges is thus L0 = 24  2*0.98 cm = 22.04 cm, and the width of the apparatus arm is wA = 3.3 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, LA = 13.95, 25.36, 35.01, and 35.36 cm, for apparatus angles  = 12°, 20°, 40°, or 60°, respectively, and Dmax = 6.93, 12.49, 16.45, and 16.61 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From video observations, we estimate the dimensions of an ant to be ln = 0.691 cm and wn = 0.107 cm and the density of ants moving across the apparatus to average 0.42 ants per centimeter, which is compatible with the literature (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate the ratio between bridge width and length to be  = 4.799-0.5014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set LT, the length of the foraging trail not part of the experimental apparatus, to 100 cm (see bridge spacing estimates in Supporting Information), with the total number of ants N determined by (LT + LA) and the overall density of ants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Estimate_of_Colony-Wide_Bridge_Investment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We make some estimates by combining our field observations with those in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical E. hamatum trail network can extend 200 m from the bivouac (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along these trails, bridges are patchily distributed, clustering in areas of particularly rough terrain (18, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our observations, we estimate that naturally occurring bridges contain on average 10 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of bridges along a trail can vary widely, depending on terrain and traffic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the low end, we estimate one bridge per meter of trail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our preliminary observations, it is not uncommon to see lengths of trail with upwards of 10 bridges per meter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these figures, as a cursory approximation, we can thus estimate a range for the total number of ants sequestered in bridges at somewhere between 2,000 and 20,000 ants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a typical colony of 100,000 ants (23), bridges then occupy somewhere between 220% of the total population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we further consider that a large proportion of the colony (perhaps up to half) remain at the bivouac throughout the day and take no part in foraging, these structures certainly segregate a substantial portion of the available foragers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
