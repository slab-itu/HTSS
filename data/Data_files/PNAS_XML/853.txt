title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis SH3P2 is an ubiquitin-binding protein that functions together with ESCRT-I and the deubiquitylating enzyme AMSH3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The endosomal sorting of integral proteins is essential for controlling signaling pathways at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posttranslational modification by ubiquitin is key to proper degradation of plasma membrane proteins as the ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins are recognized by multiple ubiquitin adaptor proteins and trafficked to the vacuole for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although plants lack orthologs of the yeast and metazoan endosomal sorting complex required for transport-0 heterodimer that functions as an ubiquitin adaptor, plants appear to have evolved other strategies to recognize and concentrate ubiquitylated proteins that have been endocytosed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the SH3P2 protein as a yet-unknown ubiquitin adaptor protein in Arabidopsis and its molecular function in regulating the endocytic transport and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins is an essential regulatory process that controls plasma membrane protein abundance and is therefore important for many signaling pathways, such as hormone signaling and biotic and abiotic stress responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On endosomal sorting, plasma membrane proteins maybe recycled or targeted for vacuolar degradation, which is dependent on ubiquitin modification of the cargos and is driven by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of the ESCRT machinery are highly conserved among eukaryotes, but homologs of ESCRT-0 that are responsible for recognition and concentration of ubiquitylated proteins are absent in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently several ubiquitin-binding proteins have been identified that serve in place of ESCRT-0; however, their function in ubiquitin recognition and endosomal trafficking is not well understood yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identified Src homology-3 (SH3) domain-containing protein 2 (SH3P2) as a ubiquitin- and ESCRT-Ibinding protein that functions in intracellular trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 colocalized with clathrin light chain-labeled punctate structures and interacted with clathrin heavy chain in planta, indicating a role for SH3P2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, SH3P2 cofractionates with clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), suggesting that it associates with CCVs in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants of SH3P2 and VPS23 genetically interact, suggesting that they could function in the same pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we suggest a role of SH3P2 as an ubiquitin-binding protein that binds and transfers ubiquitylated proteins to the ESCRT machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SH3P2_Binds_K63-Linked_Ubiquitin_Chains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether there are other ubiquitin adaptors in the plant endocytosis pathway, we investigated proteins that were reported to localize on the plasma membrane or CCVs for putative ubiquitin-binding motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the SH3Ps since SH3 domains were previously reported to bind ubiquitin (3638).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three homologs of SH3Ps (SH3P1, SH3P2, and SH3P3) that seem to be distributed early in evolution of dicots (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these three homologs, SH3P1 and SH3P2 were reported to localize on clathrin-positive vesicles (32, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined whether the SH3 domain of SH3P2 has the ability to bind ubiquitin and ubiquitin conjugates, and examined full-length SH3P2 and fragments of SH3P2 with and without the SH3 domain (Fig 1A) in an ubiquitin-binding assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length SH3P2 binds to K63-linked ubiquitin chains but does not bind linear or K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments show that an SH3P2 fragment containing the SH3 domain binds K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin, whereas a fragment deleted of the SH3 domain did not show binding (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST-SH3P2(SH3) also bound to ubiquitin conjugates from plant total extracts, whereas GST alone did not (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the SH3 domain of SH3P2 can bind ubiquitin and has a preference toward the K63-linkage type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SH3P2_Interacts_with_ESCRT-I  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The function of ubiquitin adaptors in endocytosis is to concentrate ubiquitinated cargos and to transfer them to the ESCRT machinery, especially ESCRT-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated whether SH3P2 interacts with ESCRT-I components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESCRT-I consists of three core subunits, VPS37, VPS28, and VPS23, and Arabidopsis has two homologs for each subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested one of each of the homologs and examined the interaction of GAD-SH3P2 against GBD-fused VPS23.1, VPS28.1, and VPS37.1 in a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VPS23.1 has an N-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain that is a conserved ubiquitin-binding domain and a C-terminal core motif (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 showed YTH interaction with only VPS23.1 (Fig 2B and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A targeted YTH analysis and an in vitro-binding assay have shown that the UEV domain is dispensable for this interaction (Fig 2 B and C and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunoelectron microscopic analysis has previously shown that SH3P1, a homolog of SH3P2, localizes on the plasma membrane, the TGN, and the CCVs associated with them (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that SH3P2 localizes on clathrin light chain (CLC)-labeled punctate structures and on late-endosomeassociated aggregates that appear upon blockage of ESCRT-III disassembly (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ESCRT-I subunit VPS28 was previously demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopic analysis to localize on the TGN (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, colocalization of ESCRT-I subunits with clathrin markers has not been established in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore generated plants expressing VPS23.1-TagRFP under the endogenous promoter and analyzed the localization with endosomal markers, including YFP-CLC (clathrin), GFP-SYP43 (TGN/EE) (40), and YFP-ARA7 (PVC/MVBs) (41) (Fig 3A), as well as with SH3P2-superfolder GFP (sGFP) (32) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VPS23.1-TagRFP localized on punctate structures and colocalized with another ESCRT-I subunit, GFP-VPS28.1, when both were expressed under their native promoters (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization efficiency analysis showed that VPS23.1-TagRFP punctate structures showed the highest level of colocalization (52.3%, n = 241) with YFP-CLC (Fig 3 A and C), whereas only 4.6% (n = 304) and 4.4% (n = 248) of the VPS23.1-TagRFP vesicles showed colocalization with the GFP-SYP43 and ARA7-labeled early and late endosomes, respectively (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not detect localization of VPS23.1-TagRFP on the plasma membrane or on cell plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When crossed with an SH3P2-sGFP line, 41.3% (n = 736) of the VPS23.1-TagRFP foci colocalized with SH3P2-sGFPpositive foci (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated whether SH3P2 and ESCRT-I can interact in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total extracts were prepared from wild-type and SH3P2pro:SH3P2-sGFP seedlings and mixed with GFP-trap beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblots using anti-GFP and anti-clathrin heavy chain (CHC) antibodies showed that the endogenous CHC was coimmunoprecipitated with SH3P2-sGFP (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, VPS23.1-HA was also specifically coimmunoprecipitated with SH3P2-sGFP (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data show that both VPS23.1 and SH3P2 colocalize with CLC, suggesting that they can function together on intracellular clathrin-positive organelles in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that SH3P2-sGFP interacts with both CHC and VPS23.1-HA in vivo suggests that these proteins can function together in the intracellular trafficking pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SH3P2_Is_Associated_with_CCVs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further establish whether SH3P2 is localized on CCVs, we purified CCVs from 7-d-old seedlings expressing SH3P2-GFP under the native promoter using a tandem fractionation scheme based on differential and density centrifugation (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2-GFP cofractionated with CHC, and was retained in the purified CCV fraction, whereas other organelle or compartment markers did not (Fig 4A), indicating that SH3P2 is associated with CCVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SH3P2 was previously reported to bind phospholipids, and it was shown that the BAR domain alone was sufficient for this binding (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we observed that the truncated protein without the complete BAR domain SH3P2(NBAR: amino acids 179369)-sGFP did not localize on the plasma membrane or on intracellular punctate structures, whereas the localization of SH3P2(BAR: amino acids 1257)-sGFP was indistinguishable from that of the full-length fusion protein (FL) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2(NBAR)-sGFP also lost its interaction with CHC (Fig 4C), indicating that the N-terminal region containing the BAR domain is indispensable for the interaction with membrane structures containing clathrin and for the localization of SH3P2 on the plasma membrane and on clathrin-positive foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SH3P2_Interacts_with_the_DUB_AMSH3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the DUB AMSH was initially identified as a protein that interacts with the SH3 domain of STAM, an ESCRT-0 subunit in mammals (43), we investigated whether the Arabidopsis AMSH3 and SH3P2 can directly interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5A, MBP-SH3P2 bound to GST-AMSH3 but not to GST-VPS2.1, an ESCRT-III subunit that served as a negative control, showing that AMSH3 interacts with SH3P2 in vitro (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the addition of SH3P2 in a DUB assay using AMSH3 did not show altered activity of AMSH3 (Fig S4), indicating that SH3P2 does not influence the in vitro DUB activity of AMSH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish whether AMSH3 has a function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we explored the interaction of AMSH3 with other proteins reported to function in the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like SH3P2, AMSH3 was found to interact with the ESCRT-I subunit VPS23.1 in an YTH assay (Fig 5B and Fig S5) and in an in vitro-binding assay (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, VPS23.1-HA and AMSH3 were coimmunoprecipitated from total protein extracts of Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig 5D), suggesting that these proteins function together in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMSH3 was previously shown to localize on ARA6- and ARA7-labeled late endosomes (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze whether AMSH3 can also localize together with VPS23.1 on clathrin-labeled foci, we analyzed the colocalization between AMSH3-YFP and CLC-monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-nine percent of AMSH3-YFP foci colocalized with CLC-mKO (n = 398; Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether AMSH3-YFP foci showed distinct localization with CLC- and ARA7-labeled endosomes, seedlings expressing AMSH3-YFP, CLC-mKO, and ECFP-ARA7 were examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 40.4% of AMSH3-YFP signals colocalized with endosomes labeled with ECFP-ARA7, 28.3% of AMSH3-YFP signals colocalized with CLC-mKO, and 14.5% of the AMSH3-YFP signals colocalized with both markers (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that CLC-mKO and ARA7-YFP predominantly reside on separate compartments and that AMSH3-YFP is associated with both CLC- and ARA7-labeled endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the independence of the CLC-mKO and ECFP-ARA7 in this line, we treated seedlings with the PI3K/PI4K inhibitor Wortmannin (WM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ECFP-ARA7 localized to the typical swollen late endosomal compartments induced by WM, whereas CLC-mKO did not (Fig 5F), indicating the two markers maintain largely distinct localization patterns even upon coexpression of AMSH3-YFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data show that VPS23.1, AMSH3, and SH3P2 all localize on CLC-positive punctate structures and likely function together in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SH3P2_Shows_Genetic_Interactions_with_the_ESCRT-I_Subunit_VPS231  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the physiological role of SH3P2 in Arabidopsis, we examined transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertion lines of SH3P1, SH3P2, and SH3P3 and identified null mutant alleles designated sh3p1 and sh3p3 (Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SH3P2, we could not identify any T-DNA insertion lines that affected the level of SH3P2 transcript, and therefore generated an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) line designated amish3p2, which has a 90% reduction in the level of SH3P2 mRNA relative to wild type and the sh3p1sh3p3 double mutant (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neither the sh3p1sh3p3 double mutant nor amish3p2 showed apparent developmental phenotypes (Fig S6D) even in the presence of the ARF-GEF inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, uptake of the endocytosis tracer FM4-64 in amish3p2 was comparable to wild-type seedlings (Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As SH3P2 was reported to be involved in autophagy, we next tested the amish3p2 for dark-induced autophagy phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutants remained indistinguishable from the wild type even after prolonged dark treatment, whereas atg7, a bona fide autophagy defective mutant, displayed pale green leaves and significantly reduced chlorophyll content (Fig S6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated attempts to generate a sh3p1sh3p3amish3p2 triple mutant failed, as the amiRNA construct did not express in the sh3p1sh3p3 double-mutant background, and thus we cannot rule out the existence of redundancy between the three SH3Ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether mutants of vps23 and sh3p2 show genetic interactions, we first established mutants of vps23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arabidopsis has two VPS23 homologs, VPS23.1/VPS23A/ELCH and VPS23.2/VPS23B/ELCH-LIKE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated T-DNA insertion mutants of VPS23.1 and VPS23.2 that we named vps23.1-3 and vps23.2-1, both of which were null mutants (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then crossed them with each other to generate double mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not recover double-homozygous mutants among the progeny of a double-heterozygous plant, suggesting that the double-homozygous mutants are not viable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inviable phenotype of the double homozygotes was rescued by the expression of VPS23.1:VPS23.1-TagRFP (Fig S7C), indicating that the VPS23 function is essential in Arabidopsis and that the VPS23.1-TagRFP construct used for the localization studies was functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observed that 9.6% of the total progenies of vps23 double-heterozygous plants were smaller than their siblings and had small cotyledons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR-based genotyping identified them as vps23.1-3/vps23.2-1+/ (Fig 6A, Table 1, and Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypes could be further divided according to the color of the cotyledons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 8.6% of progenies had small but green cotyledons (Table 1 and Fig S7D), while 1% of progenies remained white even when grown in light, suggesting that these mutants have defects in greening in addition to developmental defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In progenies from a wild-type plant, none of the seedlings showed this phenotype (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the progeny of a vps23.1-3+/vps23.2-1+/ line harboring the amish3p2 construct, the number of seedlings with small white cotyledons significantly increased to 4.7% (Fig 6A and Table 1), while the number of seedlings with small green cotyledons decreased to 5.8%, indicating that the presence of amish3p2 increased the number of vps23.1-3/vps23.2-1+/ seedlings with greening defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that this shift is caused by amish3p2, we generated an amiRNA-resistant variant of SH3P2-sGFP named SH3P2(amiRNAres)-EGFP, and introduced it into the vps23.1-3+/vps23.2-1+/amish3p2 background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2(amiRNAres)-EGFP restored the segregation of seedling phenotypes (Table 1), confirming the effect of amish3p2 on the vps23 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of SH3P2(amiRNAres)-EGFP was verified under confocal microscopy (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, it has been reported that VPS23.1 is involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the abscisic acid (ABA)-receptor PYR1-like 4 (PYL4) in Arabidopsis (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon treatment with ABA, a null mutant of vps23.1 (vps23a) accumulated ubiquitylated proteins, while the level of ubiquitin conjugates was indistinguishable from the wild type when untreated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the vps23.1-3/vps23.2-1+/ mutant shows defects in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, we examined the ubiquitin profile of mutant seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven-day-old seedlings with mutant phenotypes accumulated ubiquitinated proteins at a high level (Fig 6B), indicating that VPS23 is required for the removal of ubiquitin conjugates also in ABA-independent processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, previous data (34, 35) and the data presented in this study suggest that Arabidopsis ESCRT-I VPS23.1, AMSH3, and SH3P2 localize and function together on clathrin-labeled endomembrane structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 can bind K63-linked ubiquitin chains of membrane proteins in close proximity to the plasma membrane or on/in CCVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model (Fig 6C) in which SH3P2 binds ubiquitylated cargos at the plasma membrane and during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, SH3P2 could be also recruited separately to the plasma membrane and to CCVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 could enrich ubiquitylated cargos at the endosomal membrane and, by interacting with VPS23, could pass them to the ESCRT machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On CCVs, SH3P2 could function together with the ESCRT-I subunit VPS23 and the DUB AMSH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SH3P2 localizes to the plasma membrane, whereas VPS23 and AMSH3 do not, SH3P2 could also have an ESCRT-I and DUB-independent function at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deubiquitylation of cargos by DUBs at this stage might rescue the cargo from being sorted into the ESCRT-dependent degradation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SH3 domains can be found in all eukaryotes, and whereas more than 100 SH3 domain-containing proteins regulate diverse signaling pathways in mammals (46, 47), Arabidopsis has only five SH3 domain proteins, suggesting a different regulatory mechanism by SH3 domain proteins in animals and plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we have demonstrated that the plant-specific SH3 domain-containing protein SH3P2 from Arabidopsis binds preferentially K63-linked ubiquitin chains and interacts in vitro and in vivo with the ESCRT-I subunit VPS23.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 interacts also with the DUB AMSH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2, VPS23.1, and AMSH3 all localize on clathrin-positive intracellular structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we propose a role for SH3P2 in the recognition of ubiquitinated cargos that are to be sorted into the ESCRT pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among proteins involved in membrane trafficking of plants, FYVE1/FREE1, ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX), TOLs, VPS23.1, and the ESCRT-II subunit VPS36 were shown to have affinity toward ubiquitin and/or ubiquitin chains in Arabidopsis (26, 30, 44, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of any obvious phenotypes in the sh3p mutants, despite the well-established importance of the ESCRT-mediated degradation pathway, could be due to the genetic redundancy between members of the SH3P family as well as other plant ubiquitin adaptor proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 was recently reported to interact with the ubiquitin-binding FYVE1/FREE1 protein (30, 32), suggesting that ubiquitin-binding proteins may interact and function together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may increase their affinity to ubiquitin chains and could enhance the efficiency of sorting the cargos into the ESCRT-dependent endocytic degradation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polyubiquitylation of membrane proteins by ubiquitylating enzymes is key for the determination of protein stability (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By hydrolyzing the ubiquitin chains, DUBs could rescue the target proteins from degradation and recycle part of the cargos back to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recycling of membrane proteins can fine-tune the regulation of protein abundance at the plasma membrane and could also enable a faster reaction upon environmental changes without the cost for de novo protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some DUBs require interacting proteins for their enzymatic activation (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMSH proteins, however, display DUB activity in vitro as monomers, although human AMSH proteins were reported to show higher activity in the presence of the interactor of AMSH, STAM (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STAM is an SH3 domain-containing protein and ESCRT-0 subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between AMSH and SH3 domain-containing proteins seems to be conserved in plants, albeit the absence of ESCRT-0 and the structural differences between SH3P2 and STAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitin-binding proteins could facilitate the access of DUBs to the ubiquitin chain by simultaneously binding both the ubiquitin chain and the DUBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a quantitative in vitro DUB assay, however, preincubation of AMSH3 with SH3P2 did not accelerate the DUB activity of AMSH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acceleration of DUB activity may require different substrates or additional factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMSH3 lacks recognizable membrane-binding motifs, and thus is probably dependent on binding partners, such as ALIX, for its recruitment to endosomes (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH3P2 binds phospholipids (34, 35) and could also play a role in stabilizing the association of AMSH3 with endosomal membranes and the ESCRT machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, only single mutants of ESCRT-I components have been analyzed in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyzed mutants of VPS23.1/VPS23A/ELCH, VPS28.1, and VPS37.1 were all viable, but were defective in cytokinesis, endosomal sorting, and degradation of membrane-localized proteins and showed an altered phytohormone or pathogen response (45, 48, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the double-null mutant vps23.1-3/vps23.2-1/ displayed embryo lethality, shows that ESCRT-I, like ESCRT-III, is essential for plant growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to previously reported ESCRT-III mutants or ESCRT-IIIrelated mutants, including fyve1 and amsh3 (30, 32, 44, 54), part of vps23.1-3vps23.2-1 seedlings are small and have white cotyledons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact molecular mechanisms are unknown, a previous report has shown that mutants defective in membrane trafficking or plants treated with inhibitors of membrane trafficking have defects in plastid development (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant phenotypes observed in this study suggest that defects in ESCRT-I function may also have a similar effect on plastid development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Localization studies have revealed similar but distinct localization patterns of ubiquitin-binding proteins in Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOLs are predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, with a fraction on punctate structures in the cytosol (26), whereas FYVE1 and ALIX were not found at the plasma membrane, but were shown to localize on punctate structures that were colabeled with late endosomal markers (30, 32, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, together with a previous report (34), demonstrate that the SH3Ps are associated with CCVs and localize on the plasma membrane, cell plate, and clathrin-positive foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localization studies suggest that ubiquitin adaptors, including SH3P2, can be involved in vesicle trafficking at diverse membrane compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clathrin has been shown to form non-triskelia flat plaques on endosomal membranes, where it is assumed to be involved in the recruitment of ubiquitylated cargos together with ubiquitin-binding proteins (5658).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether SH3P2 could also interact and function together with clathrin on similar structures on the endosomes has yet to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While this paper was in preparation, Ahn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) reported that SH3P2 localizes to the tubulovesicular network at the cell plate and could function together with DYNAMIN RELATED PROTEIN (DRP) 1A during cell plate formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also shown that SH3P2 binds phosphoinositides through its N-terminal BAR domain and that the BAR domain of SH3P2 can cause tubulation of liposomes (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should reveal whether SH3P2 is also involved in membrane bending and/or scission events at the plasma membrane together with the DRPs and how the dynamics of SH3P2, ESCRT-I, and other ubiquitin-binding proteins are regulated during endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Biological_Material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments were performed with Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0) background, except for the ELCH-HA line, which is in Wassilewskija-2 (Ws2) background (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-DNA insertion mutants sh3p1 (Salk_127258), sh3p3 (Salk_065790), vps23.1-3 (Sail_1233E07_2-4) and vps23.2-1 (Sail_237G05_3-4) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant transformations were performed using the floral dip method (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown in continuous light or under long-day (16-h light/8-h dark) conditions with 100120 molm2s1 light on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS; Duchefa Biochemie) supplemented with 1% sucrose germination media (GM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For root length measurements, seedlings were grown 6 d on GM supplemented with 3 M BFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For artificial starvation, 7-d-old seedlings grown on half-strength MS were transferred to the dark for 6 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Purification__in_Vitro-Binding_Assays__and_Ubiquitin-Binding_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GST- or MBP-fused proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3), Rosetta-gami 2, or Rosetta-gami B strains (all from Merck Millipore) and purified using Pierce Glutathione Magnetic Beads (Thermo Scientific), ProtinoGlutathione Agarose 4B (MachereyNagel), or Amylose Resin (New England Biolabs), depending on the fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vitro-binding assays, Pierce Glutathione Magnetic Beads saturated with 25, 50, or 65 pmol of GST-fusion proteins were incubated with an equimolar amount of another protein or tetra-ubiquitin chains (Enzo Life Science) in 400 L of cold buffer (50 mM TrisHCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween-20) under rotation at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beads were then washed four times with cold buffer, proteins were eluted with 40 mM glutathione, and bead-bound materials were subjected to SDS/PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the ubiquitin-binding assay with plant total extracts, 6 g of Arabidopsis seedlings was ground and homogenized in 10 mL of lysis buffer A (50 mM TrisHCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol), supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g.

Molecular_Phylogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coding sequences used for phylogenetic analysis of SH3P1, SH3P2, and SH3P3 homologs in angiosperms (Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Amborella trichopoda, Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays, Vitis vinifera, Medicago truncatula, Populus trichocarpa, and Brassica rapa) were obtained using a BLAST search in Phytozome v11.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment was performed with MAFFT v.7, and, subsequently, unreliably aligned regions were trimmed with Gblocks 0.91b, allowing half-gap positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic trees were constructed with Bayesian analysis using MrBayes 3.1.2, and with maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses using PAUP* 4.0b10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bases that were not identified were treated as unknown, and gaps were treated as missing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Bayesian analysis, the nucleotide model, a general time-reversible model with gamma distributed rate variation among sites and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + I + G), was selected by Akaikes information criterion (AIC) with MrModeltest 2.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayesian searches were conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo with two independent sets of four chains, each run with 10 million generations and sampling every 1,000 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracer was used to check that the runs had reached stationarity, and the effective sample size of all of the parameters was high (n  greater than  200).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 2.5 million generations were discarded as burn-in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MP analysis, all characters were equally weighed and heuristic searches were conducted with 1,000 random addition replicates involving tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap values were calculated with 1,000 pseudoreplicates with 100 random additions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ML method, jModelTest 2.1.10 was used to determine the nucleotide substitution model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GTR + I + G model were specified by AIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ML analysis was implemented using PAUP 4.0b10 as heuristic searches involving nearest-neighbor interchange (NII) branch swapping with 100 random addition sequence replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap values were calculated with 100 pseudoreplicates with 10 random additions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coding DNA sequences (cDNAs) of P. patens were used as outgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
