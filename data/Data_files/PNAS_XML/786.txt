Entanglement and thermodynamics after a quantum quench in integrable systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding how statistical ensembles arise from the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of isolated pure systems has been a fascinating question since the early days of quantum mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it has been proposed that the thermodynamic entropy of the long-time statistical ensemble is the stationary entanglement of a large subsystem in an infinite system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine this concept with the quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution and integrability-based knowledge of the steady state to obtain exact analytical predictions for the time evolution of the entanglement in arbitrary 1D integrable models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results explicitly show the transformation between the entanglement and thermodynamic entropy during the time evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, entanglement is the natural witness for the generalized microcanonical principle underlying relaxation in integrable models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Entanglement and entropy are key concepts standing at the foundations of quantum and statistical mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the spacetime scaling limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Entanglement dynamics after a quantum quench: theoretical scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Quasiparticle picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full lines denote quasiparticles with maximum velocity emitted in the initial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shaded cones show the halo of slower quasiparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Main steps to calculate the entanglement dynamics using Bethe ansatz and the quasiparticle picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a generic interacting integrable model, there are different species of stable quasiparticles corresponding to bound states of an arbitrary number of elementary excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrability implies that different types of quasiparticles must be treated independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is then natural to conjecture thatS(t)=n[2t2|vn|tless_thandvn()sn()+2|vn|tdsn()],[2]where the sum is over the types of particles n, vn() is their velocity, and sn() is their entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To give predictive power to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, in the following, we show how to determine vn() and sn() in the Bethe ansatz framework for integrable models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is straighforwardly generalized to the mutual information between two intervals (see SI Materials and Methods and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The eigenstates of Bethe ansatz solvable models are in correspondence with a set of pseudomomenta (rapidities) .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the thermodynamic limit, these rapidities form a continuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One then introduces the particle densities n,p(), the hole (i.e., unoccupied rapidities) densities n,h(), and the total densities n,t()=n,p()+n,h().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every set of densities identifies a thermodynamic macrostate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This macrostate corresponds to an exponentially large number of microscopic eigenstates, any of which can be used as a representative for the macrostate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of representative microstates is eSYY, with SYY as the thermodynamic YangYang entropy of the macrostateSYY=sYYL=Ln=1d[n,t()lnn,t()n,p()lnn,p()n,h()lnn,h()]Ln=1dsYY(n)[n,p,n,h]().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]Physically, SYY corresponds to the total number of ways of assigning the quasimomentum label to the particles, similar to free fermion models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Bethe ansatz treatment of quantum quenches (7274), local properties of the postquench stationary state are described by a set of densities n,p() and n,h().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculating these densities is a challenging task that has been performed only in a few cases (7587).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the densities, the thermodynamic entropy of the stationary ensemble Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 is sYY[n,p,n,h]().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physically, eLsYY is the number of microscopic eigenstates entering in a generalized microcanonical ensemble for quenches, in which all of the microstates corresponding to the macrostate have the same probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now present our predictions for the entanglement dynamics (Fig 1B gives a survey of our theoretical scheme).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the stationary state, the density of thermodynamic entropy coincides with that of the entanglement entropy in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, as it has been shown analytically for free models (52, 88, 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This identification implies that sn()=sYY[n,p,n,h]().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is natural to identify the entangling quasiparticles in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 with the low-lying excitations around the stationary state .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their group velocities vn depend on the stationary state, because the interactions induce a state-dependent dressing of the excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These velocities vn can be calculated by Bethe ansatz techniques (90) (SI Materials and Methods and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To substantiate our idea, we focus on the spin-1/2 anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) chain, considering quenches from several low-entangled initial states, namely the tilted Néel state, the MajumdarGhosh (dimer) state, and the tilted ferromagnetic state (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these initial states, the densities n(h),p are known analytically (7779).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 summarizes the expected entanglement dynamics in the spacetime scaling limit, plotting S/ vs. vMt/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, S/ is always smaller than ln2 (i.e., the entropy of the maximally entangled state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Néel quench, because the Néel state becomes the ground state of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 in the limit , S/ln()/2 vanishes, whereas it saturates for all of the other quenches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the MajumdarGhosh state, one obtains S/=1/2+ln2 at .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the tilted ferromagnet with 0 (Fig 2E), S/ is small at any , reflecting that the ferromagnet is an eigenstate of the XXZ chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the linear growth seems to extend for vMt/1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dS/dt (Fig 2F) is flat only for vMt/1, which signals true linear regime only for vMt/1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peculiar behavior is caused by the large entanglement contribution of the slow quasiparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, we report the bound-state resolved contributions to the entanglement dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 A and C focuses on the steady-state entropy (second term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), whereas Fig 3 B and D shows the bound-state contributions to the slope of the linear growth (first term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of the bound states, although never dominant, is crucial to ensure accurate predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4A shows tDMRG results for S(t) for the quench from the symmetrized Néel state (|+|)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are for the open XXZ chain and subsystems starting from the chain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative agreement with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B reports the steady-state entanglement entropy as a function  (data at t8 in Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume law S is visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dasheddotted lines in Fig 4B are fits to SsYY, supporting the equivalence between entanglement and thermodynamic entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4C focuses on the full-time dependence, plotting S/ vs. vMt/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dasheddotted line in Fig 4C is Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 with tt/2 because of the open boundary conditions (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviations from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 because of the finite  are visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diamonds in Fig 4C are numerical extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is perfect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we provide a more stringent check of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, focusing on the linear entanglement growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5 shows infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) results in the thermodynamic limit for S(vMt), with S(x)dS(x)/dx taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  91.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the quenches, the agreement with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 (horizontal lines in Fig 5) is spectacular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In this supplementary material, we provide some details on  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bethe_Ansatz_Solution_of_the_XXZ_Chain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Bethe ansatz (94) solution of the XXZ chain, the eigenstates of the XXZ chain in the sector with M down spins (particles) are in correspondence with a set of rapidities j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rapidities are obtained by solving the Bethe equations (94)[sin(j+i2)sin(ji2)]L=k=1Msin(jk+i)sin(jki),[S1]where arccosh().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the thermodynamic limit, the solutions of the Bethe equations (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1) form string patterns in the complex plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapidities forming an n string are parametrized asn,j=n,+i2(n+12j)+n,j,[S2]where j=1,,n labels the different string components, n, is the string center, and n,j are the so-called string deviations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically (i.e., for the majority of the eigenstates of the XXZ chain), one has n,j=O(eL), implying that the string deviations can be neglected (94) (string hypothesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physically, n strings correspond to bound states of n down spins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The string centers n, are solutions of the BetheGaudinTakahashi (BGT) equations (94):Ln(n,)=2In,+(n,)(m,)n,m(n,m,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]For 1, one has n,[/2,/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we define n()2arctan[tan()/tanh(n/2)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering phases n,m() are defined asn,m()(1n,m)|nm|()+2|nm|+2()++n+m2()+n+m().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]Each different choice of the so-called BGT quantum numbers In,12 identifies a different set of solutions of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and in turn, a different eigenstate of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding eigenstate energy E and total momentum P are obtained by summing over all of the BGT rapidities (94) as E=n,n(n,) and P=n,zn(n,) withn()sinh()sinh(n)cosh(n)cos(2),zn(n,)=2In,L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]Note that P depends only on the In,.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Steady_State__Bethe_Ansatz_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we provide some details on how to derive the steady-state densities n,p,n,h in Bethe ansatz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The root densities n,p are defined as (95)n,p()limL1L(n,+1n,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]Instead of working with the hole densities n,h, it is convenient to define n=n,h/n,p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the initial states considered in this work, the corresponding steady-state densities n,h,n obey the recursive relations (74, 80)n()=n1(+i2)n1(i2)1+n2()1,[S7]n,h()=n,t(+i2)+n,t()n1,h(),[S8]with 0=0 and 0,h=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8, the initial conditions 1,h and 1 encode the information about the prequench initial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the quenches considered in this work, these initial conditions are known analytically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, for the quench from the Néel state, one has (80)1=2[2cosh()+2cosh(3)3cos(2)sin2()][cosh()cos(2)][cosh(4)cos(4)]1,h=1()2(14cosh2()[1()sin(2)]2+4cosh2()),[S9]where 1()d1()/d [with 1() as defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the dimer state, 1,p and 1 have been calculated in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  81, whereas for the tilted Néel and the tilted ferromagnet, they have been derived recently (79, 87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2A shows n,p for n=1,2,3 for the quench from the Néel state in the XXZ chain with =2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group_Velocities_of_the_Entangling_Quasiparticles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we detail the calculation of the group velocities of the entangling quasiparticles, which explain the linear entanglement growth after the quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-lying excitations around the postquench steady state can be constructed as particle hole excitations over the corresponding macrostate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice that it has been verified in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  96 that the low-lying excitations around the stationary state can be used to reconstruct back in time the postquench out-of-equilibrium dynamics of local observables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, one can imagine choosing among the eigenstates of the XXZ chain a representative of the macrostate, identified by some BGT quantum numbers In,.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a particle hole excitation, in each n-string sector, is obtained as In,hIn,p, where In,p(In,h) is the BGT number of the added particle (hole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the XXZ chain is interacting, this local change in quantum numbers affects all of the new rapidities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excess energy of the particle hole excitation isEn=en(n,p)en(n,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]Remarkably, apart from the dressing of the single-particle energy e() (see below for its calculation), Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 is the same as for free models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the total momentum is obtained from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 asP=zn(n,p)zn(n,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S11]Finally, the group velocity of the particle hole excitations is by definitionvn()enzn=en()2n,t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we used that (94) dzn()/d=2n,t, with n,tn,p(1+n), and we defined en() as the derivative of e().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, en() is determined by an infinite system of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind asen()+12m=1dem()m,n()1+m()=n(),[S13]where n,m()dn,m()/d and n()dn()/d (compare Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solutions of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 can be obtained numerically very effectively after truncating the system considering nnmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We should mention that the method outlined above has been used to study transport properties in the XXZ chain starting from inhomogeneous initial conditions (70, 71) and the spreading of correlations after quantum quenches (20, 90, 97105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, in the limit , the solution of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 and the group velocities (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12) can be obtained analytically as a power series in ze1/(2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, for the quench from the Néel state, one obtainsv1()=2sin(2)+z2[sin(2)+4cos(4)sin(2)]+z3[2cos(2)sin(2)]z4[2cos(4)sin(2)sin(2)4cos(8)sin(2)]+O(z5)v2()=6zsin(2)+O(z3)v3()=12z2sin(2)+O(z3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S14]A similar result can be obtained for the MajumdarGhosh state asv1()=2sin(2)+4z2cos(4)sin(2)+z3[8cos(2)sin(2)+4sin(2)]+z4[6sin(2)4cos(2)sin(2)+8cos(4)sin(2)+4cos(8)sin(2)]+O(z5)v2()=4zsin(2)+z2[4sin(2)+4cos(2)sin(2)]+z3[4cos(4)sin(2)6sin(2)]+z4[4cos(6)sin(2)28sin(2)32cos(2)sin(2)]+O(z5)v3()=12z2sin(2)+O(z3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S15]As an example of calculation of group velocities, we plot in Fig S2B vn() for n=1,2,3 for the quench from the Néel state in the XXZ chain with =2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S1B, vn are plotted vs. the rapidity .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The star symbols in Fig S2B are the perturbative results (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S14) in the large  limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in Fig S3, we plot the maximum group velocity in each string sector as a function of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dasheddotted lines in Fig S3 are the analytical results (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S14) in the limit .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in the limit , one has v12, whereas the group velocities are vanishing in the other string sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At =1, v1 is different from the low-energy spin-wave velocity vsw=/2 (shown as the horizontal dotted line in Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two_Disjoint_Intervals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this section, we investigate the entanglement of two disjoint spin blocks after a quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is motivated by some recent holographic results, which also apply to irrational 1+1 CFT (64, 67, 69, 106, 107), that are in contrast with the quasiparticle picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on the behavior of the von Neumann mutual information IA1:A2 after a global quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider the tripartition of the chain as A1A2B, where A1 and A2 are two disjoint intervals of equal length  and at distance d, whereas B is the remainder of the chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutual information IA1:A2 is defined asIA1:A2SA1+SA2SA1A2,[S16]with SA1(2) and SA1A2 being the entanglement entropies of A1(2) and A1A2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For an infinite system and two intervals of length  at a distance d, it is straightforward to derive the contribution to the mutual information of each quasiparticle with velocity v, namely (50)IA1:A22max((d+)2,vt)+max(d2,vt)+max((d+2)2,vt),[S17]which predicts IA1:A2=0 for vtd/2, a linear increase for d/2less_thanvt(d+)/2 followed by a linear decrease up to vt=(d+2)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stark contrast, it has been suggested that the quasiparticle picture for the entanglement propagation does not hold in holographic contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scenario of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  69 predicts IA1:A2=0 at any time: the idea is that quasiparticles originated at the same point in space and traveling with one in A1 and the other in A2, do not remain maximally entangled when they are far apart from each other (a phenomenon known as scrambling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clarify whether the quasiparticle picture applies to interacting integrable models, here we discuss the behavior of IA1:A2 after the quench from the Néel state | in the XXZ chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We restrict ourselves to the open XXZ spin chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We always consider the situation with the two intervals A1 and A2 at the opposite edges of the chain, because it is convenient for the numerical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This geometry implies L=2+d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this case, the contribution of each quasiparticle is given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S17 with the replacement 2, but the formula is valid only before the revival time trev=L/v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, the final quasiparticle prediction for the mutual information is obtained by summing (and integrating) the contribution of all quasiparticles: that is,IA1:A2=ndsn()[2max((d+2)2,vn()t)+max(d2,vn()t)+max((d+4)2,vn()t)],[S18]which again, it is valid before the revival time (i.e., for t, such that vMtless_thanL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we compare Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18 with tDMRG results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well-known that extracting the entanglement entropy of multiple disjoint intervals in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations is a formidable task in contrast with the single-interval entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, given the matrix product state (MPS) representation of the state, the computational cost scales as 6 for the multiinterval, whereas it is only 3 for the single interval, with  being the bond dimension of the MPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue is even more dramatic out of equilibrium, where  grows exponentially with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we can provide reliable data for IA1:A2 only for very small intervals and up to short times after the quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results are presented in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbols are the tDMRG data for IA1:A2 plotted as a function of the time after the quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the data for =3,4,5, which are the only sizes that we can simulate reliably, and only t7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simulations, for all values of , the two intervals are at fixed distance d=10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lines in Fig S1 are the analytic results obtained using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the system sizes and timescales accessible in our tDMRG simulations do not allow us to reach a quantitative conclusion on the validity of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18 for the mutual information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observe that the DMRG data are in a good overall qualitative agreement with the quasiparticle predictions in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the mutual information is zero for tless_thand/(2vM); then, it starts growing (seemingly) linearly with time, up to a maximum value that is clearly visible for =5 (but not for smaller ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The few results available in the literature for the mutual information of two disjoint intervals for free systems (55, 108) show very similar effects when the lengths of the subsystems are very small, such as in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, these DMRG results provide a strong support for the validity of the quasiparticle picture for IA1:A2, signaling the absence of scrambling that takes place for CFTs with large central charge (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main result of this work is the analytical prediction in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 for the time-dependent entanglement entropy after a generic quantum quench in an integrable model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested our conjecture for several quantum quenches in the XXZ spin chain, although we expect Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 to be more general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional checks of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 (e.g., for the LiebLiniger gas) are desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be also interesting to generalize Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 to quenches from inhomogeneous initial states, exploiting the recent analytical results (70, 71, 92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we are not able yet to provide an ab initio derivation of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, we find it remarkable that it is possible to characterize analytically the dynamics of the entanglement entropy, whereas its equilibrium behavior is still an open challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we believe that Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 represents a deep conceptual breakthrough, because it shows in a single compact formula the relation between entanglement and thermodynamic entropy for integrable models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous description for nonintegrable systems, where quasiparticles have finite lifetime or do not exist at all, could lead to a deeper understanding of thermalization (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is defined by the HamiltonianH=i=1L[12(Si+Si+1+Si+Si+1)+(SizSi+1z14)],[4]where Si are spin-1/2 operators, and  is the anisotropy parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we considered as prequench initial states the tilted Néel state |,eijSjy|, the MajumdarGhosh (dimer) state |MG((||)/2)L/2, and the tilted ferromagnetic state |,eijSjy|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Heisenberg spin chain is the prototype of all integrable models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for all of the initial states considered in this work, the postquench steady state can be characterized analytically via the macrostate densities p(h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a set of recursive relations for these densities can be obtained (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group velocities of the low-lying excitations around the steady state (i.e., the entangling quasiparticles) are obtained by solving numerically an infinite set of second-type Fredholm integral equations (details are in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The numerical data for the postquench dynamics of the entanglement entropy presented in Fig 4 were obtained using the standard tDMRG (4649) in the framework of matrix product states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the implementation, we used the ITENSOR library (itensor.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented in Fig 5 are obtained using the iTEBD method (93) and they are a courtesy of Mario Collura.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
