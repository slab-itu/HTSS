Autocatalytic surface reduction and its role in controlling seed-mediated growth of colloidal metal nanocrystals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Controlling the shape of colloidal metal nanocrystals is central to the realization of their diverse applications in catalysis, photonics, electronics, and medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that autocatalytic surface reduction can be employed to enable the formation of metal nanocrystals with well-controlled and predictable shapes through seed-mediated growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantitative analysis suggests that the kinetics of autocatalytic surface reduction is highly sensitive to the atomic structures on the surface of the seed, leading to different growth rates for different sites on the seed and eventually resulting in the evolution of nanocrystals into different shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic insights into autocatalytic surface reduction obtained in this work can be extended to other systems involving nanocrystals with different compositions, facets, and structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The growth of colloidal metal nanocrystals typically involves an autocatalytic process, in which the salt precursor adsorbs onto the surface of a growing nanocrystal, followed by chemical reduction to atoms for their incorporation into the nanocrystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its universal role in the synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals, it is still poorly understood and controlled in terms of kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the use of well-defined nanocrystals as seeds, including those with different types of facets, sizes, and internal twin structure, here we quantitatively analyze the kinetics of autocatalytic surface reduction in an effort to control the evolution of nanocrystals into predictable shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our kinetic measurements demonstrate that the activation energy barrier to autocatalytic surface reduction is highly dependent on both the type of facet and the presence of twin boundary, corresponding to distinctive growth patterns and products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the autocatalytic process is effective not only in eliminating homogeneous nucleation but also in activating and sustaining the growth of octahedral nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work represents a major step forward toward achieving a quantitative understanding and control of the autocatalytic process involved in the synthesis of colloidal metal nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Autocatalytic_Surface_Reduction_and_Its_Dependence_on_the_Type_of_Facet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our recent quantitative analysis suggests that the reduction pathway undertaken by a salt precursor is largely determined by the kinetics involved (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precursor is reduced on the surface of a seed through an autocatalytic process under slow kinetics, whereas it is reduced in the solution phase when the kinetics is fast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this finding, here we chose to focus on PdBr42, a complex known for its relatively slow reduction kinetics, to systematically investigate how the Pd(II) precursor would be reduced in the presence of Pd seeds enclosed by different types of facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical experiment involves the one-shot injection of aqueous PdBr42 solution into an aqueous mixture containing Pd nanocrystals (seeds), ascorbic acid (AA, reducing agent), and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, colloidal stabilizer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the seeds with cubic and octahedral shapes, their surfaces are enclosed by six {100} and eight {111} facets, respectively, allowing us to examine the explicit dependence of surface autocatalytic reduction on the type of facet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It should be pointed out that the PdBr42 complex is supposed to immediately hydrolyze upon its dissolution in water at a relatively low concentration of 0.34 mM (used in all of the syntheses reported here), leading to the formation of a series of hydrated species, PdBrn(H2O)4n2n (n less_than 4), with a specific distribution at equilibrium (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S1A shows the UV-vis spectrum taken from an aqueous solution of freshly prepared PdBr42, which has a concentration identical to the reaction mixture used for the standard seed-mediated growth except for the absence of AA, PVP, and seeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pd(II) species in the solution showed a broad peak at 269 nm, which is different from the absorption peak at 332 nm expected for PdBr42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the result from computational calculation, the broad peak at 269 nm can be assigned to the absorption of PdBr2(H2O)2 and PdBr3(H2O) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result implies that the hydrolysis of PdBr42 has to be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when PVP was introduced, the peak intensified and shifted to a longer wavelength, suggesting that PVP could also coordinate with the Pd(II) ions (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, under the conditions used in the present work, the actual Pd(II) precursor likely comprised H2O molecules, Br ions, and PVP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid misunderstanding and confusion, we use the precursor based on PdBr42 or simply the Pd(II) precursor throughout this paper, with an intention to reflect the initial Pd(II) complex added into the reaction system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1 A and B shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Pd cubic and octahedral seeds, respectively, as well as their 3D atomic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They had a purity approaching 100%, together with sizes (see SI Appendix, Fig S2 for the definition of size) of 18.0 ± 2.1 nm and 25.0 ± 2.9 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1 CF, the products of seed-mediated growth contained no particles smaller than the original seeds, implying the absence of homogeneous nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Pd cubic seed, the truncation at corners, that is, the appearance of eight small {111} facets, became more significant with the increase in reaction time, while the distance between the opposite {100} facets gradually increased from 19.4 ± 2.3 nm at t = 2 h (Fig 1C) to 20.7 ± 2.4 nm at t = 4 h (Fig 1E), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data clearly indicate that the growth rate along the less_than100 direction was greater than that along the less_than111 direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When seed-mediated growth was applied to the Pd octahedral seed, octahedra with a slight truncation at the {100} facets were observed at t = 2 h, as shown in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the reaction was prolonged to t = 4 h, truncation became more visible at the corner sites (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result confirms that the growth mainly occurred on the {111} facets, which is opposite to what was observed in the case of Pd cubic seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be pointed out that the introduction of PdBr42 as a precursor could release Br ions into the reaction solution, and some of the Br ions might chemisorb onto the {100} facets of the seed and thereby retard the growth at these sites (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cubic seed, the Br ions released from the precursor could chemisorb onto the {100} faces, but the coverage density at equilibrium should be relatively low due to the large surface area of {100} facets on the cubic seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the octahedral seed, however, the number of Br ions released from the precursor was adequate for a higher coverage due to the relatively small surface area of the {100} facets on the octahedral seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (24), the ratios between the numbers of Br ions and surface Pd{100} atoms were 0.27 and 0.77, respectively, for the Pd cubic and octahedral seeds (see SI Appendix for detailed analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the seed-mediated growth of Ag and Pd nanocrystals, recent experimental observations indicated that, once a complete octahedron had been formed, the growth of the close-packed {111} facets would be automatically shut down and the atoms subsequently formed in the solution would undergo homogeneous nucleation instead of being deposited onto the surface of the octahedral nanocrystals via heterogeneous nucleation (19, 2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon, known as self-termination of growth, can be attributed to the closest packing of atoms in the {111} facets of a face-centered cubic (fcc) metal and thus a greater energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation relative to homogeneous nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the self-termination phenomenon when we carried out a control experiment with the use of aqueous PdCl42 as a precursor (SI Appendix, Fig S3), while all other experimental conditions were kept the same as the standard protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when PdBr42 was added as a precursor, the limitation imposed by self-terminated growth was lifted for the Pd octahedral seed, resulting in continuous evolution in terms of size and shape (Fig 1 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, it can be concluded that the use of distinct precursors (e.g., PdBr42 vs. PdCl42) can lead to different products depending on the reduction kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same argument can also be applied to other types of seeds with different facets and internal twin structures (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the precursor, both the type of reducing agent and reaction temperature could also affect the reduction kinetics and thus significantly alter the outcome of a synthesis (9) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantitatively understand how the reduction kinetics of the precursor correlates with the type of seed involved, we measured the concentrations of Pd(II) ions remaining in the reaction solution at different time points using UV-vis spectroscopy (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental procedures for kinetic analysis can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2A shows the concentrations of Pd(II) remaining in the reaction solution in the presence of Pd cubic and octahedral seeds, respectively, as a function of reaction time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, it can be seen that the reduction of the Pd(II) precursor by AA had a strong dependence on the type of seed involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in the presence of cubic seed was much faster than the case of octahedral seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also focused on the elementary reactions involved in the synthesis and estimated their corresponding kinetic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our recent work (9), we found that the reduction kinetics of Pd(II) in the absence of preformed seeds could be fitted to the FinkeWatzky two-step growth mechanism (4), by which Pd(II) was reduced to generate atoms [solution reduction: Pd(II)+2ek1Pd0], which then aggregated into nuclei (defined as Pdn0) via homogeneous nucleation, followed by autocatalytic surface reduction enabled by the just-formed nuclei [surface reduction: Pdn0+Pd(II)+2ek2Pdn+10].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate constants (k1 and k2) for the reduction of Pd(II) in the absence of seeds could thus be extracted from curve fitting based on the FinkeWatzky mechanism (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we further extended this quantitative analysis to seed-mediated growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the introduction of preformed seed, denoted Pdn0(seed), the seed would provide additional nucleation sites for the autocatalytic surface reduction of Pd(II) precursor [surface reduction: Pdn0(seed)+Pd(II)+2ek2Pdn+10(seed)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, the reduction of the precursor was greatly accelerated in the presence of Pd cubic or octahedral seed (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S9), suggesting that the added seed not only participated in but also dominated the reduction of the Pd(II) precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the absence of homogeneous nucleation (as confirmed by the TEM image in Fig 1), we expected that autocatalytic surface reduction should occur on the added seed only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by setting k1 to the value obtained from a control experiment, in which the same synthesis was carried out in the absence of preformed seed and thus k2 = 0 (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S9 and Table S1), the rate constants (k2) for the autocatalytic surface reduction of Pd(II) by AA on the Pd cubic and octahedral seeds were derived as 2.61 × 101 and 1.35 × 101 min1mM1, respectively, through curve fitting (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed mathematical models for analyzing the reduction kinetics can be found in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods (SI Appendix, Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the kinetic parameters in SI Appendix, Table S2, we further calculated the percentages of solution reduction and surface reduction for the precursor in the presence of preformed seed as a function of reaction time by integrating reduction rates over time (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the percentage of surface reduction approached 86% and 77% in the cases of cubic and octahedral seeds, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetic analyses, along with the TEM images shown in Fig 1, suggest that the reduction of the precursor based on PdBr42 followed the autocatalytic surface growth pathway (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10), in which the reduction of precursor mainly occurred on the surface of preformed seed rather than in the solution phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also imply that only a limited number of Pd atoms were formed in the solution phase through solution reduction (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8) and their concentration could be kept below supersaturation (the lowest concentration of atoms needed for initiating homogeneous nucleation) (18) throughout the synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These atoms could only undergo heterogeneous nucleation and growth (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9) via atom deposition onto the surface of the preformed seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the rate constants (k2) at different reaction temperatures (T), we obtained the activation energy (Ea) for autocatalytic surface reduction involving the precursor based on PdBr42, AA, and preformed seeds using the Arrhenius plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2B for the plot of ln k2 as a function of 1/T, activation energies of 37.6 and 65.1 kJ/mol, respectively, were derived for the autocatalytic surface reduction on the Pd cubic and octahedral seeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy barrier to the autocatalytic surface reduction on the cubic seed was 1.7× lower than that on the octahedral seed, suggesting that the {100} facets require a lower energy to initiate autocatalytic surface growth relative to the {111} facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation explains why the {100} facets grew at a relatively faster rate than the {111} facets, which is consistent with the TEM observations in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our quantitative analysis clearly indicates that the kinetics of autocatalytic surface reduction is highly dependent on the type of facet expressed on the surface of the seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were also observed for the cases of Pd cuboctahedral and truncated octahedral seeds with different proportions of {100} and {111} facets (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact surface exposed on the seed undergoes constant remodeling as growth proceeds, this approach still allows for a good estimate of the kinetic parameters, including both rate constant and activation energy, involved in the autocatalytic growth process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dependence_of_Autocatalytic_Surface_Reduction_on_the_Size_of_the_Seed  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the type of facet, we also examined how the size of the seed affects autocatalytic surface reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When varying the size of a seed, the ratio between different types (e.g., vertex, edge, and plane) of surface atoms that differ in coordination number will also change accordingly (3033).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the size effect, we conducted a set of experiments with the use of Pd cubic seeds with four different edge lengths (7, 12, 18, and 23 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the statistics of surface atoms for fcc metals (SI Appendix, Fig S13), about 70% of the surface atoms of a 7-nm cube are located on the side faces (i.e., plane atoms), while the percentage of plane-based atoms increases beyond 90% for a 23-nm cube (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S14 shows TEM images of the truncated cubes grown from these seeds when PdBr42 was added as the precursor, suggesting that the growth still occurred preferentially on the {100} facets regardless of the difference in edge length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we did not observe homogeneously nucleated particles in the final products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were consistent with the growth mechanism based on surface autocatalytic reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The corresponding kinetic parameters were then obtained from the data acquired using the spectroscopic method (SI Appendix, Fig S15 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the rate constant k2 for the autocatalytic surface reduction on Pd cubic seeds exhibited a negligible dependence on the size of the seed, as shown in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further estimated the activation energies for autocatalytic surface reduction on the differently sized seeds by measuring the rate constant over a range of temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autocatalytic reduction of PdBr42 on the Pd cubic seeds with different sizes had an almost identical activation energy (Fig 3B) although the seeds are characterized by different ratios between different types of surface atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetic data (Fig 3), along with the TEM images shown in SI Appendix, Fig S14, suggest that the precursor based on PdBr42 tended to undergo surface reduction on the {100} facets with a lower activation energy than other types of facets (e.g., corners) for the single-crystal Pd cubic seed, resulting in the formation of nanocubes with significant truncation at the corners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extension_from_Single-Crystal_to_Multiply_Twinned_Seeds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also extended the mechanistic analysis of autocatalytic surface reduction to multiply twinned seeds, including those with decahedral and icosahedral structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 A and B shows TEM images and the corresponding 3D atomic models of the 19.2 ± 2.4-nm Pd decahedral and 12.3 ± 2.1-nm Pd icosahedral seeds, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decahedral nanocrystal is made of 5 single-crystal tetrahedral units connected by 5 twin boundaries and enclosed by 10 {111} facets, while an icosahedron consists of 20 tetrahedral units and 30 twin boundaries, and enclosed by 20 triangular {111} facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon seed-mediated growth with the introduction of PdBr42, the resultant Pd decahedral (Fig 4 C and E) and icosahedral (Fig 4 D and F) nanocrystals clearly showed concave structures on their surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the early stage of growth, the deposition of Pd atoms preferentially took place on the low-coordination vertex sites intersected by multiple-twin boundaries on each Pd decahedral (Fig 4C) or icosahedral seed (Fig 4D) relative to the {111} faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increase in reaction time, the Pd atoms were continuously deposited on the vertices of the seeds at a rate greater than the surface diffusion of adatoms (26), generating a tip at the point of deposition, finally resulting in the formation of Pd concave decahedral (Fig 4E) and icosahedral (Fig 4F) nanocrystals with a high density of low-coordination sites (e.g., steps, edges, and kinks) and high-index facets on the surface (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Again, we obtained the corresponding activation energies from the Arrhenius plots (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S16 and S17 and Table S4), as summarized in Fig 5 and Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the energy barriers associated with the autocatalytic surface reduction on multiply twinned seeds (Ea = 25.8 and 21.1 kJ/mol for decahedral and icosahedral seeds, respectively) are significantly lower than those on the single-crystal, octahedral seeds enclosed by {111} facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with our TEM observations in that the growth of decahedral and icosahedral seeds preferentially occurred on the low-coordination vertex sites instead of (111) planes (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the precursor based on PdBr42 tended to be reduced to Pd atoms on the vertex sites with smaller activation energy barriers through autocatalytic surface reduction, transforming the decahedral and icosahedral seeds into concaved structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the low coordination of vertex sites, the significant surface strain associated with twin boundaries is also believed to be instrumental to adsorption and surface reduction of the precursor because they alter the electronic structures of surface atoms by shifting their d-band center (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is particularly pronounced for a decahedral or icosahedral nanocrystal owing to the high density of twin boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the strain-induced electronic effect may be another factor responsible for the formation of decahedral and icosahedral nanocrystals with concaved surface structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study along this line will greatly advance our understanding of surface strain on autocatalytic surface reduction involved in seed-mediated growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is worth emphasizing the importance of knowing the activation energies of autocatalytic surface reduction on different types of facets or twin boundaries presented on the surface of well-defined seeds used in the present study (Fig 5 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such quantitative information can be used to predict the growth pattern of a more complicated seed with a unique energy landscape and the shape or morphology taken by the final metal nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, such a quantitative understanding and control will push the synthesis of colloidal metal nanocrystals away from the conventional trial-and-error approach, and toward a predictable, deterministic setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using Pd as a typical example, we have demonstrated that autocatalytic surface reduction can be employed to enable the formation of metal nanocrystals with predictable and well-controlled shapes through seed-mediated growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the elimination of homogeneous nucleation, autocatalytic surface reduction allows one to lift the limitation imposed by self-terminated growth on the {111} facets of octahedral seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the quantitative analysis, it can be concluded that the kinetics of autocatalytic surface reduction is sensitive to the atomic structures on the surface of the seed, leading to different growth rates for different sites on the seed and eventually resulting in the formation of nanocrystals with the diverse but well-controlled shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is anticipated that the mechanistic understanding of autocatalytic surface reduction obtained in this work can be extended to other systems involving nanocrystals with different compositions, facets, and structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In a standard protocol, 2.0 mL of PdBr42 (1.71 mg of K2PdBr4) precursor was injected in one shot into 8 mL of an aqueous suspension containing 0.36 mg of the capping-free Pd seeds (cubic, cuboctahedral, truncated octahedral, octahedral, decahedral, or icosahedral seeds), 60 mg of AA, and 100 mg of PVP that was hosted in a 20-mL glass vial at a certain temperature under magnetic stirring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was then capped, and maintained at a certain temperature for various reaction times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the reactions, the final product was collected by centrifugation at 17,500 rpm (Beckman Coulter Optima MAX-XP ultracentrifuge; TLA-55 rotor) for 30 min and washed three times with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ICP-MS analysis, the particles were dissolved in aqua regia and further diluted with 1% (vol/vol) aqueous HNO3 solution to a level of 100 ppb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
