Contrasting climate change impact on river flows from high-altitude catchments in the Himalayan and Andes Mountains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in the hydrology of high-altitude catchments may have major consequences for downstream water supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on model projections with a higher spatiotemporal resolution and degree of process complexity than any previous intercontinental comparative study, we show that the impacts of climate change cannot be generalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These impacts range from a high climatic sensitivity, decreasing runoff, and significant seasonal changes in the Central Andes of Chile to increasing future runoff, limited seasonal shifts, but increases in peak flows in the Nepalese Himalaya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study constrains uncertainty about response times and mechanisms controlling glacier and runoff response to climate and sets a benchmark for process-based modeling of the climate change impact on the hydrology of high-altitude catchments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mountain ranges are the worlds natural water towers and provide water resources for millions of people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their hydrological balance and possible future changes in river flow remain poorly understood because of high meteorological variability, physical inaccessibility, and the complex interplay between climate, cryosphere, and hydrological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a state-of-the art glacio-hydrological model informed by data from high-altitude observations and the latest climate change scenarios to quantify the climate change impact on water resources of two contrasting catchments vulnerable to changes in the cryosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two study catchments are located in the Central Andes of Chile and in the Nepalese Himalaya in close vicinity of densely populated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both sites reveal a strong decrease in glacier area, they show a remarkably different hydrological response to projected climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Juncal catchment in Chile, runoff is likely to sharply decrease in the future and the runoff seasonality is sensitive to projected climatic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Langtang catchment in Nepal, future water availability is on the rise for decades to come with limited shifts between seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the high spatiotemporal resolution of the simulations and process complexity included in the modeling, the response times and the mechanisms underlying the variations in glacier area and river flow can be well constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projections indicate that climate change adaptation in Central Chile should focus on dealing with a reduction in water availability, whereas in Nepal preparedness for flood extremes should be the policy priority.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temperature projections reveal similar warming trends for the Langtang and Juncal region (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 2010 and 2100, mean temperatures are projected to increase between 1.1 and 3.4 °C for RCP45 and between 3.4 and 7.2 °C for RCP85 for the two regions, depending on the GCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation projections show a negative trend for the Central Andes of Chile and a contrasting positive trend for the Nepalese Himalaya, and in both cases those trends are pronounced for the RCP85 scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the uncertainty in precipitation projections is generally large, in particular for Central Chile, where projected end-of-century precipitation changes vary between 50% and +15% in comparison with the beginning of the century (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
River_Flow_Projections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Upper Langtang catchment exhibits increasing runoff in the first half of the 21st century for all climate scenarios (between +15% and +70% in comparison with 20012010; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under RCP45 conditions, the simulations indicate a possible runoff decrease after the peaking in 20512060.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under RCP85 conditions, Langtang River runoff remains relatively stable during the second half of the 21st century, but with an increasing GCM uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the projections for the Nepalese Himalaya, decreasing water availability is a plausible scenario for the Central Andes of Chile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multimodel median projections for the Juncal catchment indicate stable runoff volumes until 20212030 and then a steadily decreasing trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multimodel median runoff under RCP45 conditions declines by 40% between 20012010 and 20912100, and by 62% under RCP85 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the described trends are consistent across GCMs for the Upper Langtang catchment, the runoff trends projected for the Juncal catchment differ between climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the projections by 5 out of 12 climate models lead to a stable runoff response until the end of the century rather than a steady decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fate_of_Glaciers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both catchments respond with a clear decreasing trend in glacier area to the changes in climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multimodel median results indicate 53% (RCP45) or 70% (RCP85) glacier area loss in the Juncal region between 20012010 and 20912100 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same period, the simulations indicate a decrease in glacierized area by 35% (RCP45) or 55% (RCP85) for the Langtang region (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Debris-covered glacier area (representing 27% of the total glacier area in Langtang) is less sensitive to the changes in climate and decreases only by 25% (RCP45) or 33% (RCP85) until the end of the century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is typical of heavily debris-covered glaciers with stagnant low-gradient termini that fronts are more stable (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High air temperatures prevailing on the low-reaching tongues and enhanced melting on exposed ice cliffs and beneath supraglacial lakes can substantially mitigate the shielding effect of supraglacial debris (2629).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the Langtang region, melt rates of debris-covered ice are much lower than of nondebris-covered ice (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the long run, this leads to glacier tongues that are disconnected from the accumulation areas (Fig 1 iii and iv and SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glacier_Contributions_to_River_Flow  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ice melt from glaciers represents roughly one-third of total simulated streamflow during the reference period (20012010) in Langtang, and one-fifth in Juncal (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that total ice melt is on a rising limb in Langtang at least until 20412050 and starts to decrease again after 20512060 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm the findings by a previous modeling study (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Juncal, however, total ice melt was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century according to our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasting response to climate warming can be explained by differences in the elevation distribution of the glaciers in the two regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Juncal, many glaciers are melting up to the highest elevations already during the reference period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing melt rates due to higher air temperatures cannot compensate the continuous loss of glacier area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Langtang catchment, large sections of the glaciers at high elevations are currently not exposed to melt, but will be in the future, and thus compensate for the loss of glacier area at lower elevations (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total glacier area contributing to melt in Langtang peaks in 20512060 (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Juncal, glacier area contributing to melt decreases steadily (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The decline in total ice melt in Langtang after 20512060 is compensated by a very pronounced increase in total rainfall (SI Appendix, Fig S10C), which is due to the projected increase in precipitation by most climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the second half of the century, the contribution of ice melt to total water inputs decreases by 10%, whereas the contribution of rainfall increases by 10% according to median projections (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have argued that, in a monsoon-dominated climate, the glacier contribution to water availability is minor (2, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm that the effect of runoff decrease due to glacier decline is dampened by high relative (increasing) contributions of rain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the contributions of glaciers in the Langtang catchment remained constant and were not decreasing after midcentury (Fig 3), runoff would further increase rather than decrease or remain constant (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Juncal catchment, the decline in total ice melt until the end of the century (Fig 3D) explains 3040% of annual runoff declines (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Future_Runoff_Seasonality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The changes in the hydrology of the Juncal catchment are such that peak runoff during the austral summer disappears gradually (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the end of the century, the differences between winter, spring, and summer runoff become very small (under RCP85 conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The climate projections by five GCMs (RCP85) lead to an earlier peak runoff shifted by 23 mo, whereas the simulations associated to a majority of climate models (both RCP45 and RCP85) indicate an anticipation of the seasonal runoff peak by 1 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shifts in the seasonality can be explained by earlier snowmelt onset and a change of phase from liquid to solid precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total rainfall amounts will likely increase (SI Appendix, Fig S10G)despite mostly decreasing precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Upper Langtang catchment, on the other hand, the changes in climate lead to almost no changes in runoff seasonality (Fig 4), because the timing of the monsoon period and of the main melting season essentially remains unaffected by climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the hydrological regime changes to a more rainfall-dominated regime, which results in a faster transition of precipitation to runoff and a higher susceptibility to peak flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Future_Runoff_Extremes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our simulations indicate a substantial increase in the magnitude of peak runoff events for the Upper Langtang catchment, particularly under RCP85 conditions (Fig 5A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model runs indicate increasing annual maximum daily flows with increasing peak flows especially during the postmonsoon season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual maximum daily flows with recurrence intervals of 10 y are projected to increase by 100% until the end of the century (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher peak flows can be related to precipitation state changes from solid to liquid during extreme precipitation events related to cyclonic disturbances (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is therefore not affected by the common limitations of climate models and bias correction techniques in predicting new precipitation extremes outside empirical ranges (34), or by the large uncertainties in precipitation projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Juncal, simulated future annual peak flows remain approximately constant in magnitude (Fig 5B), due to shifts in seasonal flows (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S9) despite total annual runoff decreases (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For future dry years (cumulative probability of annual runoff less than 50%), the model projects no reduction in water availability in comparison with the present in Langtang, but 1030% stronger decreases than for average years in Juncal (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings point to the necessity of identifying coping strategies to a reduction in water availability in the Central Andes of Chile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations for the Juncal region indicate a significant decrease in summer runoff until the end of the century, and more than 90% of the runs a decrease in total annual runoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the Central Andes of Chile, there are no signs of decreasing water availability in the Nepalese Himalaya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, future research will have to focus on changes in the return periods of water-related natural hazards and assess the downstream impact of strong increases in postmonsoon peak flows from high elevation catchments as projected by our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global glacier change models (2, 8, 9) project strong glacier area and volume decreases until the end of the century for the Southern Himalaya (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8, RCP45, 70% glacier area by the year 2100), which also leads to projections of continuously decreasing glacier runoff (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such projections are representative of very large regions, and therefore the comparability with the outputs of the present study is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both Juncal and Langtang are located near urban centers and therefore have a high interest for stakeholders of water resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, large-scale studies are not suitable to inform policy making regarding climate change adaptation, given also the large differences between our projections and the regionally averaged outputs of global models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from different glacier ensembles considered, the much stronger glacier retreat projections by global models for the Southern Himalaya in comparison with our study could be explained by the nonconsideration of the insulating effect of supraglacial debris and/or the application of simple temperature index models, which tend to be oversensitive to temperature fluctuations (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are also important differences in the outputs of previous detailed climate change impact modeling studies focusing on the Upper Langtang catchment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water released by glaciers plays a more important role for future runoff from the Upper Langtang catchment than suggested by two previous studies (30, 36), and as a consequence future runoff is not entirely governed by the future precipitation trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study projects stagnating (RCP85) or slightly decreasing (RCP45) runoff after midcentury, whereas refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 and 36 indicate a consistent increase throughout the 21st century (both RCPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, differences in model structure and between calibration strategies explain the differences in model projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consideration of a separate term for shortwave radiation in the melt algorithms used by this study assures that the relationships between air temperature and melt are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modeling (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher spatiotemporal resolution and degree of process complexity allows representing the heterogeneous snowmelt and ice melt patterns controlled by solar radiation or supraglacial debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glacio-hydrological models in high-altitude regions are also particularly sensitive to assumptions about temperature gradients (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1215; SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in this study temperature gradients are based on measured detailed information about air temperature distribution, previous catchment scale models in the region use substantially different approaches to determine temperature lapse rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameterizations were obtained through model calibration (30, 36), which may lead to equifinality and error compensation (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies use reanalysis products (17, 38) or remotely sensed data (39), which are, however, more uncertain data sources and available only at relatively coarse resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A distributed model characterized by a high degree of complexity such as TOPKAPI-ETH requires a good knowledge of internal states to correctly represent the basin-internal dynamics (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore highlight the utility of in situ data to inform glacio-hydrological models for climate change impact assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that more such data collection efforts are required for climate change impact assessment across climates and regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A smart integration of field-based studies with the catchment scale at key basins in the world has great potential and can reveal the full magnitude of the impacts of climate change on mountain water resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Main_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a fully distributed, high-resolution (100 m, hourly time step) glacio-hydrological model, TOPKAPI-ETH (1215), in two glacierized catchments of the Himalaya and the Andes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model simulates all major hydrological and glaciological processes at the watershed scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As input variables, the model requires distributed fields of air temperature, precipitation, and cloud transmittance factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Snowmelt_and_Ice_Melt  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Snow and ice ablation is modeled with an enhanced temperature index (ETI) approach, where melt in each grid cell is the sum of a temperature-dependent term and a shortwave radiation-dependent term (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach considers therefore the fully distributed shortwave radiation balance, which is calculated from the position of the sun relative to the considered grid cell, topographic shading, cloudiness, and surface albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snow albedo decreases over time if air temperatures are above the melting point (42), and constant ice albedo is used by the ETI to calculate ice melt once snow is depleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supraglacial_Debris  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subdebris ice melt is calculated using a debrisETI approach, where ablation rates decrease in function of debris thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Debris thickness is reconstructed by an inverse Ostrem approach (12), relating observed surface elevation change rates to debris thicknesses according to an Ostrem curve established using a debrisenergy balance model (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stagnant glacier area is chosen for this purpose to limit the error due to ice thickening in response to compressive flow regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface elevation changes are obtained from differencing two high-resolution digital elevation models from unmanned aerial vehicle surveys (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Debris thicknesses of areas without information about surface elevation changes are parameterized based on the position relative to the snout and the presence of supraglacial lakes identified from Landsat ETM+ multispectral data (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial density of supraglacial lakes is used as a proxy for spatial variations in debris thickness because these features (in combination with supraglacial cliffs whose presence correlates with the presence of lakes) have been shown to greatly influence downwasting rates of debris-covered glacier ice (27, 28, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Avalanching  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gravitational snow redistribution is taken into account with a mass conservation algorithm based on slope-dependent maximum snow holding depths (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the threshold depth is exceeded, snow is moved to the next model grid cell downward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glacier_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assume a linear increase of glacier thinning rates below a given threshold elevation and a constant ice thickness above, which guarantees that ice accumulated above the ELA is redistributed to lower elevations and that declines in glacier area are delayed by flow dynamics (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is mass conserving, which implies that thinning rates depend on annually accumulated ice volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snow-to-ice conversion takes place where snow remains on a glacier for longer than a year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice depths remain constant if the ice mass balance of a given glacier for a given year is zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial ice thicknesses are estimated using the model GlabTop2 (48), which is essentially a slope-dependent ice thickness estimation approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glacier dynamics algorithm is executed once a year at the end of each hydrological year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Routing__Groundwater__and_Evapotranspiration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reference evapotranspiration (RET) depends on incoming shortwave radiation, albedo, and air temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetation coefficients determine the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and RET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actual evapotranspiration depends on available soil moisture content within a superficial soil layer calculated internally by TOPKAPI-ETH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second soil layer accounts for runoff originating from percolation to deeper soil and into fractured bedrock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water routing in is based on the kinematic wave concept, whereby subsurface flow, overland flow due to infiltration or saturation excess, and channel flow are represented by nonlinear reservoir differential equations (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GCM_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A subset of 12 GCMs (SI Appendix, Table S2) is selected for the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios from the latest climate model ensemble generated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report provided through CMIP5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order for the subset to be representative of the uncertainty range of the original CMIP5 ensemble, the selected GCMs are sampled randomly from clusters of multivariate characteristics regarding the changes in temperature and precipitation projected for both the Andes and the Himalaya (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use daily precipitation and monthly temperature climate model outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GCM_Downscaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a stochastic approach to downscale the climate models (15, 18) to generate hourly input time series until 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature and precipitation data are downscaled to the location of the closest permanent meteorological station in each region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each station provides at least 9 y of data to determine the observed climate statistics for the reference period (20012010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistics that are reproduced in the stochastic precipitation time series are the mean, variance, no-rain probability, skewness, and autocorrelation at daily scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disaggregation of daily to hourly precipitation is performed on the basis of empirical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Air temperature is subdivided into a stochastic and a deterministic component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature statistics of the deterministic part provided by the climate models are the monthly mean and the monthly standard deviation (SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An autoregressive integrated moving average model is used for the stochastic generation of hourly air temperatures (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The daily cycle is provided by historical data and is added to the stationary stochastic time series before destandardization with the monthly mean and SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between station observations and climate model outputs are first corrected through a nonlinear parametric bias correction method (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All climate statistics are evaluated separately for each month of the year and each decade from 2001 to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature lapse rates and precipitation gradients are used to distribute the downscaled climate data to every catchment grid cell and are estimated on the basis of historical station data, taking into account their spatial and temporal variability (13, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily cloud factors are sampled randomly from the available historical station data, differentiating between days with strong/medium/weak or no daily precipitation, and between springsummer records and autumnwinter records to preserve the coupling of daily cloudiness with precipitation intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We force the model with 20 members of the stochastic input data ensemble generated for each GCM-RCP combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Calibration_and_Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TOPKAPI-ETH setups used in this study have been established and thoroughly evaluated in three companion papers (1214).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model parameters were calibrated with a multistep, multiobjective approach (12, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carefully planned field data collection during two ablation seasons at both study sites constituted the basis for the setup and validation of the model (12, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of preventing error compensation, each parameter was estimated on the basis of data that directly represent the corresponding physical process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete list of datasets and related model components and parameters is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed catchment runoff was used for model validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both regions, measured daily runoff from validation periods of 13 y could be reproduced by the model with a NashSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) higher than 0.85 (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the relatively short calibration and validation periods used in the companion papers (1214), we use 9 y of available runoff data at either site to validate the seasonal runoff cycle as simulated by the stochastic runs for the reference period (SI Appendix, Fig S4; NSE Juncal: 0.97; NSE Upper Langtang: 0.90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extreme_Values_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess possible changes in hydrological extremes, we look at the changes in different quantiles of annual runoff (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9) and at the changes in the magnitude of annual peak daily runoff with different recurrence intervals (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty stochastic realizations of each GCM-RCP combination lead to 200 annual values per decade that are used for this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Units of all water balance components in this study are expressed in millimeter water equivalents (volumes of water divided by catchment area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on the methodology and datasets can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
