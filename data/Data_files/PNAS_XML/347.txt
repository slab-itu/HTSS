Leveraging abscisic acid receptors for efficient water use in Arabidopsis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water is the major limiting factor for plant productivity in the field, and current water use in agriculture is not sustainable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under water limitations, plants can ameliorate the carbon for water exchange leading to higher water use efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plant hormone abscisic acid is activated in response to drought and regulates the water status and acclimation responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show in the model species Arabidopsis that abscisic acid receptors can be explored to constitutively increase the water use efficiency without impinging on growth potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding may support future efforts to generate more crop per drop required for a more sustainable water use in agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant growth requires the influx of atmospheric CO2 through stomatal pores, and this carbon uptake for photosynthesis is inherently associated with a large efflux of water vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under water deficit, plants reduce transpiration and are able to improve carbon for water exchange leading to higher water use efficiency (WUE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether increased WUE can be achieved without trade-offs in plant growth is debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signals mediating the WUE response under water deficit are not fully elucidated but involve the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA is perceived by a family of related receptors known to mediate acclimation responses and to reduce transpiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show that enhanced stimulation of ABA signaling via distinct ABA receptors can result in plants constitutively growing at high WUE in the model species Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WUE was assessed by three independent approaches involving gravimetric analyses, 13C discrimination studies of shoots and derived cellulose fractions, and by gas exchange measurements of whole plants and individual leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants expressing the ABA receptors RCAR6/PYL12 combined up to 40% increased WUE with high growth rates, i.e., are water productive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water productivity was associated with maintenance of net carbon assimilation by compensatory increases of leaf CO2 gradients, thereby sustaining biomass acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaf surface temperatures and growth potentials of plants growing under well-watered conditions were found to be reliable indicators for water productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study shows that ABA receptors can be explored to generate more plant biomass per water transpired, which is a prime goal for a more sustainable water use in agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increased_WUE_of_Arabidopsis_Accessions_Under_Water_Deficit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WUE varies in different accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under water deficit, an approximately doubling of WUE has been reported in the accessions Columbia (Col-0) and Landsberg (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed additional Arabidopsis accessions from different continents and climatic environments for this change in WUE by conducting gas exchange measurements on whole plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants growing under well-watered conditions were compared with plants exposed to water deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All accessions analyzed responded by an approximately twofold increase in insWUE imposed by 30% residual water content of the soil (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis confirms the general WUE response of plants if water becomes limiting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposing Col-0 plants to progressively drying soil revealed a continuous rise of insWUE negatively correlated with water availability (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question we attempted to address was whether enhanced ABA signaling by ABA receptors can establish constitutively enhanced WUE without affecting growth performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overexpression_of_ABA_Receptors_Affects_Growth_and_Leaf_Temperatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis plants with enhanced expression of single RCAR receptors were generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three to five independent homozygous lines for each RCAR member were prescreened for their capacity to grow comparably to the parental line while showing elevated leaf surface temperatures as a first indication for reduced transpiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each line, four plants were scored under well-watered conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case that ectopic expression of individual RCARs generated a single plant line that fulfilled the criteria, three independent lines were selected; if not, only one prototype line was chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected plants lines were again analyzed for confirmation of the phenotypes by thermal imaging of leaves and determination of the rosette size (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the level of RCAR expression and the ABA sensitivity during seed germination was assessed in these RCAR lines (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic assessment revealed increased leaf surface temperatures for the RCAR8 and RCAR9 line associated with severely reduced development of the leaf rosette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others, such as the RCAR11RCAR14 lines, showed no significant or marginal elevation of leaf temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Arabidopsis lines RCAR1-1, RCAR6-3, and RCAR10-3 combined increased leaf temperatures with no or minor growth trade-offs (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum leaf expansion rates of most lines examined were in the range of 9.2% growth per day, however, lines overexpressing RCAR4, RCAR8, and RCAR9 showed reduced growth rates (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RCAR_Lines_with_Higher_Water_Use_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of three independent RCAR6 lines for water consumption over time indicated a reduced transpiration at similar leaf rosette growth (Fig 3A) and elevated leaf temperatures of the ABA receptor lines compared with Col-0 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was conducted by withholding watering and minimizing evaporation at an early developmental stage of the plantlets, 18 d after germination with a total leaf area smaller than 0.5 cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil volume and soil water content per planting pot were identical for each single plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment started under well-watered conditions with a soil water content of 75% (vol/vol) and was terminated 8 wk after onset when the plant-available water in the soil was consumed and the residual water content in the soil was below 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this drought regime, the biomass of wild-type plants increased from 0.001 to 0.32 g and most of the biomass build-up occurred under mild to severe water deficit as a simulation of mounting water deficit in the field (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symptoms of mild water deficit were observed at water potentials  less_than 0.03 bar, indicated by changes of stomatal aperture evidenced by increases in leaf surface temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe water deficit ( less_than 0.5 bar) resulted in wilting and shrinkage of leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All selected RCAR lines were subjected to this drought regime and analyzed for the maximum accumulation of dry matter and the calorimetric yields (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same amount of water was available to every plant; hence, higher biomass values of RCAR lines compared with the wild type reflect higher WUE, i.e., more carbon gain per water unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, lines overexpressing RCAR1, RCAR6, RCAR8, RCAR9, and RCAR10 (Fig 3D) had increased biomass production; some showed increases up to 40% in both dry matter and calorimetric values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those ABA receptors belong to subclass I and II (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plant lines of subclass III receptors, RCAR11RCAR14, showed no significant gains in biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stomatal limitation of CO2 assimilation affects 13C discrimination (13C), which is an indicator of iWUE (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, 13C provides an assessment of WUE independent of the WUE analysis by gravimetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for gravimetrically determined WUE and 13C of total aboveground biomass (Fig 3E) showed a clear association (R ± 0.92, P less_than 0.001) for all plant lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C-deduced iWUE (Fig S2A) confirmed an approximate 40% increase of iWUE from 69 mol carbon per mole water in wild type to a maximum value of 93 and 99 molmol1 in two RCAR lines, RCAR6-3 and RCAR10-4, respectively, and correlated with biomass-based WUE (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C/12C composition of cell wall material integrates water relations during growth, which prevails during periods of less severe water deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C of the cellulose fraction indicated an iWUE up to 36% (±1%, P less_than 0.001) higher in RCAR plants than wild type (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaf surface temperatures of RCAR-overexpressing plants under well-watered conditions correlated positively with biomass gain under water-limiting conditions, with the exception of RCAR4 (Fig 3F, R = 0.91, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RCAR4 line had markedly impaired growth and not all plant-accessible water was consumed at harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the data support an increased WUE conferred by ectopic expression of distinct ABA receptors leading to greater net carbon assimilation per unit of water transpired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Water_Productivity_Associated_with_Enhanced_CO2_Gradients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RCAR6-3 and RCAR10-3 lines combined enhanced water efficiency with no growth penalty (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3A), whereas RCAR6-4 and RCAR10-4 lines showed somewhat reduced growth under well-watered conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RCAR10-4 line performed better than RCAR10-3 under drought, which might be attributed to the higher receptor expression in RCAR10-4 (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four lines showed high ectopic RCAR expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of the physiological basis of water productivity, we chose RCAR6-3 and RCAR10-4, the latter as a candidate for higher WUE combined with some penalties in growth potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these selected Arabidopsis lines consistently performed better in reiterated and independently conducted experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with the wild type, biomass gains of 3946% and 3269% for the RCAR6 and RCAR10 line, respectively, were found under drought (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant growth difference detectable between plants of the RCAR6 line and wild type grown under well-watered conditions (Fig S3 B and C) and final biomass yield differed by 1% (±7%, n = 28, P = 0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under well-watered conditions, gas exchange measurements of whole plants revealed lowered transpiration rates at similar net CO2 assimilation rates compared with the wild type, leading to higher transpiration efficiencies of both RCAR lines (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arabidopsis erecta mutant has increased transpiration rates (11), whereas the farnesyltransferase-deficient era1-2 mutant is considered drought resistant (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The erecta and era1 mutants were found to have higher and slightly lower transpiration compared with the wild type, respectively, and inverse transpiration efficiencies (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of CO2 influx and water vapor efflux of plants is determined by the partial pressure differences of both gases at the stomatal pore (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, increased transpiration efficiencies at comparable net CO2 assimilation rates require a steeper CO2 gradient at a given water pressure difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both RCAR lines had intercellular CO2 levels lowered by about 38 molmol1 leading to 59% enhanced CO2 gradients at the stomata (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the transpiration efficiency was higher in the RCAR6 and RCAR10 lines by 49% and 55% (P less_than 0.001), respectively (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher transpiration efficiencies of RCAR lines were found irrespective of the soil water content (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of net CO2 assimilation to stomatal conductance gs, which reflects the partial CO2 pressure gradient at the stomatal pore, increased with reduced soil water content in wild type but remained high and fairly constant in the RCAR6-3 line (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, gs in wild-type plants was lowered to one-half by a reduction of soil water content from 70% to 50%, whereas gs in the RCAR6-3 line was largely unaffected but consistently lower than wild type, possibly reflecting an enhanced ABA response (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gas exchange analyses were conducted on entire plants at ambient CO2 level and photon density of 150 molm2s1; both parameters are limiting photosynthesis (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At saturating light and modulating different CO2 concentrations of the air, the net CO2 assimilation rates of leaves from RCAR6, RCAR10, and wild-type plants were quite similar (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At ambient CO2 levels (400 molmol1) there was no significant difference (P  greater than  0.3), which supports a comparable CO2 flux from air to chloroplasts under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 diffusion path from air to the site of photosynthesis, the chloroplast stroma, is controlled by the stomatal conductance gs and mesophyll conductance gm that control CO2 entry from the atmosphere into the intercellular space and the passage from there into chloroplasts, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in mesophyll conductance for CO2 affect the CO2 flux and a higher mesophyll conductance may sustain photosynthesis under CO2 limiting conditions (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net CO2 assimilation was similar among the plant lines in response to variation of the intercellular CO2 level (Fig S5) even under CO2 starvation conditions, as generated by artificially low CO2 concentrations in the air (less_than150 molmol1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the mesophyll conductance revealed variable values among leaves of a single line (Fig 4F) but did not detectably differ among the lines (P  greater than  0.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mesophyll conductance was somewhat lower than the stomatal conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated CO2 concentration in chloroplasts of the RCAR lines was indistinguishable (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plastidic CO2 level in leaves of the RCAR6 line was 177 ± 8 molmol1, whereas the levels were higher by 30 molmol1 in the wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the CO2 gradient between ambient air and chloroplasts differed by 16% (P = 0.01) between leaves in RCAR6 and wild type: 217 molmol1 versus 189 molmol1 in Col-0 leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was sufficient to counterbalance the 24% reduction in stomatal conductance and thereby sustaining net CO2 influx (Fig 4E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shoot_Versus_Root_Contribution_to_Water_Use_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water deficit triggers a plethora of physiological changes, in which ABA plays a key role by mediating osmoregulation at the whole plant level, photosynthetic adjustments, and root-specific responses such as the stimulation of root growth for exploring soil moisture (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocal grafts of above- and below-ground organs between the RCAR10 line and wild type were performed to decipher which organ part contributes to WUE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of leaf temperatures indicated a shoot-prone reduction in transpirational cooling of the ABA receptor-expressing plants consistent with enhanced ABA signaling in guard cells (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C discrimination analysis of above-ground biomass from the various grafted plants grown for 10 wk also supported a major effect by RCAR10 shoots for increasing iWUE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon isotopic signatures also tentatively supported a contribution of the root system to enhance WUE (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the findings emphasize the dominant role of the shoot in ameliorating carbon for water exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well established that terrestrial plants can improve WUE under water-restricted conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this response is necessarily linked to reduced biomass production and which signals increase WUE under these conditions has not been fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we analyzed the ABA receptor family of Arabidopsis for its potential to provide a water-productive trait by mediating a constitutively increased WUE with no or marginal impacts on growth potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings support the conclusion that activation of ABA signaling is able to increase WUE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ABA is induced under drought, ABA and concomitantly triggered ABA responses are likely sufficient to mediate a more efficient carbon capture under water deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, we were able to separate increased WUE from trade-offs in growth potentials and showed that ABA receptors can be used to generate water-productive plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Arabidopsis line overexpressing the ABA receptor RCAR6, and analyzed in detail, showed a constitutively elevated WUE without significant reduction in growth under well-watered conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water productivity was associated with reduced transpiration and maintenance of carbon assimilation as well as growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomatal size and densities were not different in the RCAR6 line from the wild type, indicating that the observed changes in transpiration reflect ABA signaling-mediated changes in apertures of stomata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is in line with other studies in which ectopic ABA receptor expression caused ABA-hypersensitive stomatal responses (18, 2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduced stomatal conductance found in the RCAR6 and RCAR10 lines was compensated by increased CO2 gradients across the stomatal pore that allowed for maintenance of the CO2 influx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, whole plant transpiration efficiencies were increased in the high WUE lines under well-watered conditions to levels induced in Arabidopsis accessions under water deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mesophyll conductance did not differ among the RCAR6-3 and RCAR10-4 lines and wild type under light saturating conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light saturation ensures maximal photosynthetic CO2 demand and may uncover differences in net CO2 assimilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such differences were not observed as reported for gas-exchangerestricted plants (30) despite the lower chloroplastidic CO2 levels in the water-productive plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at lowered environmental CO2 concentrations that exacerbate CO2 deficiencies for the carboxylation reaction, leaves of the RCAR lines showed comparable net CO2 assimilation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the water-productive RCAR lines were able to sustain net CO2 assimilation by a slightly (10%) increased CO2 gradient between ambient air and the chloroplast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological adjustments of water-productive plants might also involve specific long-term adjustments of shoot and root organs (29, 31) for optimizing water use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of higher WUE conferred by the root system overexpressing RCAR10 tentatively supports such a role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Constitutively increased transpiration efficiencies mediated by reduced transpiration of RCAR overexpressing lines requires ABA receptors capable of modulating stomatal apertures in response even to low ABA levels in the nanomolar range, as present under well-watered conditions (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ABA receptors that are exceedingly sensitive to ABA and too efficient in mediating stomatal closure would curb net CO2 assimilation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics in water status within a plants life and concomitant changes in endogenous ABA concentrations by a factor of 40 and more (32) may add to the selectivity of ABA receptors capable of mediating water productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the delicate balance of net CO2 assimilation versus transpiration at varying ABA levels, and water status of plants likely imposes major constraints on the suitability of ABA receptors to confer water productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion site and posttranscriptional silencing induced by the high ectopic RCAR expression levels could influence RCAR abundance, the regulation of its abundance under water deficit, and thus affect stomatal aperture and trade-offs in photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our analysis provides a proof of concept that certain RCARs are suitable to improve water productivity of plants but the study is not exhaustive enough to clearly exclude other RCAR members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subclade I receptors showed a variable result; the RCAR1 overexpressing plants were more water productive in one of three lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability in growth might be attributed to RCAR1/PYL9-mediated induction of leaf senescence found in a recent study by Zhao et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a phenotype was not observed in an earlier characterization of RCAR1 overexpressing plants (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zhao et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) had been using overexpression of the Arabidopsis ABA receptors and identified RCAR1 to mediate drought resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas that study focused on severe drought scenarios and senescence-related processes, our analysis has addressed the contribution of RCAR members to water productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, expression of the high ABA affinity receptor RCAR4, also a subclade I member, resulted in stunted growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a trait might be beneficial to provide drought resilience but the water productivity of the RCAR4 line was found to be low in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most ABA subclade II receptors, comprising RCAR5RCAR10, contributed to water productivity under drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, subclade III receptors, which are considered to be dimeric and less affine receptors (33) that include the prototype PYR1/RCAR11 (19), did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water shortage is an environmental challenge encountered by most perennial plants even in the tropics (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several plant species have developed specialized water-storing organs, as exemplified by succulents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others, such as resurrection plants, are truly drought tolerant (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most plants do not conserve water and initiate adaptive responses only when water becomes scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This physiological response is possibly due to selection forces in nature, where a species would not benefit from water productivity but face trade-offs associated with reduced transpiration, including higher leaf temperatures and possible constraints on nutrient and CO2 uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation would change, however, for crop plants where water-saving strategies in monocultures increase water productivity and sustain biomass production under water-limiting conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both the general response of terrestrial plants to increase WUE under water deficit and the conservation of ABA receptor components in dicots and monocots (37, 38) imply that water-productive plants can be generated with crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such crops would combine elevated WUE and high yields similar to plants cultivated under deficit irrigation (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plants engineered for water productivity, however, would offer the advantage that no technical equipment is necessary for establishing enhanced WUE and saving soil-borne water to better withstand periods of drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of ABA receptors for providing water productivity will aid in breeding programs and biotechnical efforts to reduce unsustainable water withdrawal (40) and to generate more crop per drop (35, 39, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_Material_and_Chemicals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (www.sigmaaldrich.com), J. T. Baker (www.avantormaterials.com), and (S)-ABA from CHEMOS (www.chemos.de).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arabidopsis accession Mr-0, Mt-0, Pog-0, Sorbo, Tu-0, and Col-0 and the mutants er2, and era1-2 in the Col genetic background were provided by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCAR114 overexpressors were established by transferring an expression cassette for RCARs under control of the viral 35S promoter into Arabidopsis and selecting for homozygous lines as carried out for RCAR1 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous RCAR-overexpressing lines of the T3 generation were prescreened for reduced transpiration rates combined with minor growth trade-offs compared with wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ectopic expression of individual RCARs generating plants that possibly fulfilled these criteria, three independent lines were selected for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If not, only one prototype line was chosen and further characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RCAR transcript abundance was determined by RT-PCR analysis (Bio-Rad, CFX96) using ubiquitin 10 as reference and target-specific primers (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA extraction and subsequent cDNA biosynthesis from 12-d-old seedlings was performed as described (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown in soil (Classic Profi Substrate Einheitserde Werkverband) at 22 °C under short-day conditions with 8 h of light (photosynthetic photon flux density: 150 µmolm2s1) and 50% humidity during light period, unless otherwise stated, in plant growth cabinets (E15, Conviron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Drought_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis wild-type and T3 and T4 transgenic plants were subjected to drought stress by withholding watering for 46 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single seedlings were grown in 200-mL pots containing calibrated amounts of soil (33.4 g dry weight ± 0.5 g) for 18 d under well-watered condition by maintaining soil moisture near field capacity (7075% soil volumetric water content,  0.02 bar water potential) before covering the soil surface to prevent evaporation as described (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment contained at least four replicates of Columbia and single RCAR lines at randomized positions in the cabinet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitions of the experiment were conducted independently over the course of 16 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative soil water content (vol/vol) and the soil water potential were determined gravimetrically and by using a pF meter (Umwelt Geräte Technik), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projected leaf area of the Arabidopsis rosettes was analyzed by using Photoshop Elements software (Adobe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under well-watered conditions (soil water potential   greater than  0.03 bar), the logarithmic growth phase was used to derive the maximal linear leaf expansion rate as the square root function of the daily growth rate of the projected leaf area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above-ground material was harvested for determination of biomass and calorimetric yields after drying the material for 3 d at 60 °C to achieve constant weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physiological_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Germination assays were performed in the presence of various ABA levels, as reported (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grafting experiments were conducted as described (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gas exchange measurements were carried out for analysis of carbon assimilation rates, intercellular CO2 levels (ci), and stomatal conductance (gs) in the whole plant configuration and at single leaf level using the GFS-3000 gas exchange system equipped with custom-built cuvettes and the provided software (Heinz Walz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesophyll conductance (gm) and CO2 concentration in plastids of leaves of comparable developmental stage and age (leaf number 16 ± 3, 2 wk after leaf emergence) were determined by using a 2-cm2 cuvette and applying the constant J method at saturating light condition (photosynthetic photon flux density: 1,500 µmolm2s1) as described (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy content was determined for each Arabidopsis line by combusting aliquots of dried plant material (four biological replicates, two technical repetitions) under high oxygen atmosphere using a Calorimeter C2000 (IKA) calibrated with benzoic acid provided by the supplier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal imaging (InfraTec) was carried out on whole plant trays containing 24 pots at randomized positions and within the environmentally controlled plant growth cabinets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

13C_Analysis_and_Intrinsic_Water_Use_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbon isotope composition (13C) of whole-shoot biomass and extracted cellulose (46) was analyzed using an elemental analyzer (NA 1110; Carlo Erba Instruments) interfaced (ConFlo II, Finnigan MAT) with a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta Plus; Finnigan MAT), EA-CF-IRMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was measured against standard CO2 calibrated with an isotope standard (International Atomic Energy Agency CH6, accuracy of calibration ± 0.06 SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precision of sample repeats was 0.08 (SD) for bulk biomass samples and 0.13 for cellulose and included deviations by subsampling, cellulose extraction, and EA-CF-IRMS measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C discrimination (13C, in ) was calculated as 13C = (13Cair  13Cplant)/(1 + 13Cplant/1,000) (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrinsic WUE has been defined as: iWUE = A/gs = 0.625 Ca (1  Ci/Ca), where A is the net CO2 assimilation rate and gs the stomatal conductance (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The factor 0.625 gives the ratio of the diffusivities of CO2 and H2O in air, and Ca and Ci designate the CO2 concentrations in ambient air and intercellular space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the growth cabinet, Ca was 422 ± 12 molmol1 with an approximated 13Cair value of 9.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplified Farquhar model based on nonlimiting mesophyll conductance was applied to estimate Ci/Ca: 13C = a + (b  a) Ci/Ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term a (4.4) denotes the fractionation of 13CO2 relative to 12CO2 during diffusion through the stomatal pores, and b (27.6), the net fractionation during carboxylation reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA and linear regression analysis with the SPSS version 16.0 software for Windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise stated, we chose the sample size n = 4 of plant individuals per genotype and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of large sample size experiments revealed that normal distribution occurred with a SD, , of 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample size was computed with the G*Power 3.1.9.2 software program under the assumption that a difference of 30% (3 × ) between RCAR-overexpressing lines and the wild type would occur, with presumed values for  and  of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cohort size of four individuals is recommended based on these parameters for an unpaired, two-sided t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
