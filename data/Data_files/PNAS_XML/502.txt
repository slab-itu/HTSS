Imaging the He2 quantum halo state using a free electron laser  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In bound matter on all length scales, from nuclei to molecules to macroscopic solid objects, most of the density of the bound particles is within the range of the interaction potential which holds the system together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum halos on the contrary are a type of matter where the particle density is mostly outside the range of the interaction potential in the tunneling region of the potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few examples of these fascinating systems are known in nuclear and molecular physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conceptually simplest halo system is made of only two particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally image the wavefunction of the He2 quantum halo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows the predicted exponential shape of a tunneling wavefunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantum tunneling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and crucial for many technological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It allows quantum particles to reach regions in space which are energetically not accessible according to classical mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this tunneling region, the particle density is known to decay exponentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is universal across all energy scales from nuclear physics to chemistry and solid state systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although typically only a small fraction of a particle wavefunction extends into the tunneling region, we present here an extreme quantum system: a gigantic molecule consisting of two helium atoms, with an 80% probability that its two nuclei will be found in this classical forbidden region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This circumstance allows us to directly image the exponentially decaying density of a tunneling particle, which we achieved for over two orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging a tunneling particle shows one of the few features of our world that is truly universal: the probability to find one of the constituents of bound matter far away is never zero but decreases exponentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were obtained by Coulomb explosion imaging using a free electron laser and furthermore yielded He2s binding energy of 151.9±13.3 neV, which is in agreement with most recent calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A) Shallow short-range potential holding a ground and an excited state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the potential depth decreases (B), the excited state becomes unbound, leaving only the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further decrease (C) leads to the particle probability density distribution leaking more into the classically forbidden region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the extreme case of the helium dimer (note the logarithmic R scale) (D), this effect allows the wavefunction to extend to sizes of fullerenes, the diameter of DNA, and even small viruses (He2 potential and wavefunction taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), whereas the classical turning point is located at 13.6 Å, and the overall wavefunction extends to more than 200 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the corresponding experiment presented here, helium clusters were produced by expanding cooled helium gas through a 5m nozzle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By matter wave diffraction, a pure helium-dimer beam was separated from the lighter monomers and heavier clusters (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two experimental campaigns, both atoms of the dimer were then singly ionized using either single-photon ionization using photons provided by a FEL [less_than100 fs, 18.5 nm; FreieElektronen Laser in Hamburg (FLASH)] or tunnel ionization using a strong ultrashort laser field (Ti:Sa laser; 780 nm; Dragon KMLabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the ionization of the two atoms occurs fast compared with the nuclear motion, thus triggering an instantaneous Coulomb explosion of the repelling ionized particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Coulomb explosion converts the potential energy of the two ions located at an internuclear distance R into a released kinetic energy (KER) according toR=1KER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By recording a large number of Coulomb explosion events, via cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) (1214), a distribution of measured distances R (as shown in Fig 2A) is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distribution represents a direct measurement of the square of the helium-dimer wavefunction ||2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classically allowed part of ||2 provides a cross-check for our measurement because it falls off steeply at the inner turning point of the helium-dimer potential and theoretical calculations agree well on the location of the turning point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of our measured probability density distribution close to the inner turning point and some theoretical predictions are shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, two exemplary theoretical curves (5, 15) are depicted along with a measurement conducted at our Ti:Sa laser because it provides very high resolution and statistics for small internuclear distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The classically forbidden part of ||2 is shown in Fig 2C on a logarithmic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For internuclear distances larger than 30 Å, the helium-dimer potential is two orders of magnitude smaller than the predicted ground-state binding energy and thus can safely be approximated to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the wavefunction is approximated in this region by the solution of the Schrödinger equation below a step-like barrier, which is given by(R)e2m2EbindR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the mass m and Plancks constant  are fixed, the only variable defining the slope of the exponential decay is the binding energy Ebind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the binding energy can be extracted from the measurement by an exponential fit to the pair-distance distribution, as depicted in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the fit, we obtain a helium-dimer binding energy of 151.9±13.3 neV (see Materials and Methods for a discussion of errors and corrections to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value can be used for a fully experimental determination of the binding energy of the helium-trimer Efimov state, which was discovered recently using the same experimental setup (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The theoretical value for the binding energy was under dispute for many years (1720).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictions range from 44.8 neV (18) to 161.7 neV (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently calculations became available that include quantum electrodynamical effect and relativistic effects and go beyond the Born Oppenheimer approximation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These supposedly most precise calculations predict a binding energy of 139.2±2.9 neV (5), which is in disagreement with the most recent experimental value of 94.8 + 25.9/-17.2 neV obtained in pioneering experiments by evaluating matter wave diffraction patterns and relying on a detailed theoretical modeling of the interaction of the dimer with the grating surface (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present value of 151.9±13.3 neV is in good agreement with the prediction of Przybytek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) (139.2±2.9 neV) and in clear disagreement with the predictions from some HeHe interaction potentials, including the popular TangToenniesYiu potential (TTY) (19) and the mimic of the LiuMcLean potential (LM2M2) (22) yielding 114 and 113 neV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The helium dimer is a remarkable example of a system existing predominantly in the quantum mechanical tunneling regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to reveal the full shape of the wavefunction experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured data confirm the universal exponential behavior of wavefunctions under a potential barrier on unprecedented scales and yield a revised experimental value for the binding energy of the helium dimer, which has been under dispute for more than 20 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dimer_Preparation_and_Detection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A mixture of helium clusters was produced by expanding gaseous helium through a 5m nozzle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nozzle was cooled down to 8 K, and a driving pressure of 450 hPa absolute pressure was applied to maximize the dimer content in the molecular beam (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a pure helium-dimer target beam, we made use of matter wave diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All clusters have the same velocity but can be sorted by mass because their diffraction angle behind a transmission grating (100-nm period) depends on their de Broglie wavelengths (= h/mv, with Plancks constant h, mass m, and velocity v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That way, only dimers reach the laser focus, whereas the dominant fraction of atomic helium, as well as the share of helium trimers, present at the chosen gas expansion conditions get deflected away from the ionization region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows a schematic of the setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two atoms constituting the dimer get singly ionized in the focus either via photoeffect (FEL; 18.5 nm; FLASH) or via tunnel ionization (Ti:Sa laser; 780 nm; Dragon KMLabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two positively charged ions repel each other, resulting in a Coulomb explosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ionic momenta acquired in this explosion were measured by COLTRIMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A homogeneous electric field of 4.41 V/cm (at FEL) and 3.09 V/cm (at Ti:Sa laser) guides the ions to the detector, which measures time-of-flight and position of impact using microchannel plates (MCPs) and delay line anodes (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With known electric fields, ion masses, ion charges, and a distance from focus to detector of 39 mm, the initial momentum vector of the ions, and thus the KER, can be reconstructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detector_Calibration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The binding energy of the helium dimer is derived from the measured KER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a precise energy calibration is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crucial parameters for this calibration are the absolute value of the electric field in the spectrometer and the position calibration of the detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electric field was obtained by measuring the kinetic energy release spectrum of the N2 breakup, which provides very narrow peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitions from D3g and D1u+ into continuum could be identified and met reference measurements (23), with a mean relative deviation of 0.054%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement yielded the calibration of the momentum component along the time-of-flight direction of the spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The position calibration was done by comparing the momentum component in the time-of-flight direction with the ones perpendicular to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we performed two calibration measurements with isotropic dissociation channels (N2O/Ne2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most relevant, due to energetic proximity to the helium-dimer breakup, is the N2O channel at 0.16 eV KER, with a mean relative deviation of 6.2%, whereas additional channels yield a smaller deviation, with 0.62% (N2O at 0.36 eV) and 0.15% (Ne2 at 4.4 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the experiment at FLASH, despite excellent vacuum conditions (81012 hPa), an average of about 50 ions were collected for every FEL pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of ions were charged hydrogen atoms or molecules with short times-of-flight, which could be gated out by software during data acquisition before writing to the hard drive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the MCPs endured constant stress, which led to a drop in detection efficiency in the center of the detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection efficiency was corrected to its normal level using a residual gas calibration measurement with a Gaussian-shaped correction function containing a 5.5% uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This uncertainty leads to an error of ±1 neV on the binding energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, random coincidences from ionizations of two independent helium ions from the residual gas were subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error resulting from this background subtraction is small in comparison with errors discussed above (±0.4 neV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Binding-Energy_Derivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The solution to the Schrödinger equation in the region below a potential barrier is an exponential decay function (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The helium-dimer binding energy has been extracted from the experimental data by applying an exponential fit to the reconstructed pair-distance distribution (50 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to 300 a.u.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded breakups recorded in the detector plane (with a tolerance of ±33.5) because indistinguishable background and potentially deadtime effects compromised the data here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To image the exact shape of the probability density distribution by Coulomb explosion, imaging the ionization probability has to be independent of the internuclear distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two consecutive tunnel ionization steps can be influenced by enhanced ionization (24), an effect that depends on the internuclear distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steep rise of the probability density at the inner turning point is not very sensitive to this effect and could consequently be imaged by our experiment with an 800-nm laser pulse, which has superior statistics compared with the FEL experiment (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the exponential region of the probability density, we aim for a high-precision determination of the slope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used photons from the FEL FLASH to ionize both atoms of the dimer by single-photon absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with an 800-nm laser pulse, this ionization process has the additional advantage that the electron energy, and thus the recoil of the electrons onto the nuclei, is much better controlled and has an upper threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron-Recoil_Correction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial ion energy during the Coulomb breakup has to be either zero or well-defined, because Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 assumes that the KER only results from the potential energy between the two point charges and that there is no additional energy from other sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two most important sources of such additional energy are the zero-point kinetic energy from the bound state before ionization and the energy transferred during the ionization process by recoil of the escaping electron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first source is negligible for He2, because the depth of the potential well is only 1 meV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also confirmed this finding by calculating the Coulomb explosion quantum mechanically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no difference in the KER between the classical calculation using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and the quantum calculation, which automatically includes the initial state zero-point motion (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The energy transferred to the two nuclei during the ionization process by the FEL is given by the recoil of the two electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum momentum distribution of two electrons with a kinetic energy of E - IP = 42.4 eV each was calculated and is reflected in the measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For two independent ionization events, the distributions of the sum momenta and the momentum difference of the electrons are equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the sum momentum cancels out in the KER calculation, the relative momentum adds to it and increases the measured KER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correcting this effect reduces the slope of the exponential decaying function by 12.1 neV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking this reduction into account, we obtain a binding-energy value of 151.9 neV ±1.7(stat) ±10.2(calib) ±1.4(corr) neV from our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical error is the error of the fit caused by the statistics of the data points, the calibration error is the uncertainty of the calibration of our COLTRIMS reaction microscope, as discussed above, and the error labeled (corr) is the estimated error on the correction procedure compensating the detector efficiency and subtraction of random coincidences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The exact value of the helium-dimer binding energy was the subject of dispute for decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 displays the evolution of theoretical predictions as small effects such as deviation from the BornOppenheimer Approximation, retardation and quantum, electrodynamical effects were included in calculations and more computational power became accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurement is in good agreement with the most recent calculations from Przybytek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) but cannot distinguish between that and several older calculations (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our obtained results on the He2 wavefunction and binding energy provide an experimental benchmark for theoretical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
