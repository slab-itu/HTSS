Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like nanostructures reducing the light reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide an extensive analysis of corneae across insect groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using atomic force microscopy, we discover a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patternsshapes resulting from the reactiondiffusion modeling underlying many examples of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work, verging on the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also describes, to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies, and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and their antireflective properties have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, corneal nanostructures of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanocoatings are categorized into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them, many, to our knowledge, never described before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, this unexpectedly diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by Alan Turing in his famous reactiondiffusion system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their molecular origin and evolutionary diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They may also be the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Characteristics of corneal nanostructures of representatives of different insect families studied in our work are provided, along with a few selected citations of previous studies when they describe nanopatterns different from those typically found in the respective families by us  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distribution of basic and intermediate nanopatterns among insect orders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each pattern type is represented by a circle of a certain color on the diagram; double-colored circles correspond to transitional nanopatterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orders of which no representatives were analyzed in the present study are marked as N/A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data on insect phylogenetic relationship are based upon ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The insect corneal nanostructural diversity replicates Turing patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically modeled Turing patterns (in black and white) and their insect counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and A) Irregular nipples of various sizes, characteristic e.g., for Hemipteran corneal nanocoatings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B and B) Highly ordered nippled nanoarrays (Lepidoptera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and C) Strands merging into a maze (Diptera, Tabanidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D and D) Parallel strands (Diptera, Tipulidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E and E) Nipples merging into a maze (Plecoptera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (F and F) Typical maze-like structures (Coleoptera, Gyrinidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (G and G) Angular maze-like structures (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (H and H) A typical dimpled pattern (Dermaptera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A is a fragment of Fig S1F; B is an image from a Pterophoridae butterfly; C is a fragment of Fig 1F; D is a fragment of Fig 1G; E is a fragment of Fig 1E; F is an image from a Gyrinus beetle [overwater eye (13)]; G is a fragment of Fig S2B; and H is a fragment of Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling parameters are given in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (I) Simulations of Turing patterns formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step-wise changes in the av and bu parameters within the boundary conditions produce different Turing patterns: dimples (yellow zone), mazes (blue zone), and nipples (green zone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig S4A for more detailed representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations of Turing pattern formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Step-wise changes in the av and bu parameters produce Turing patterns within the boundary conditions; av and bu parameters outside of the boundary conditions do not result in patterns (evenly colored boxes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern space is divided into the areas with dimples (colored orange and yellow), mazes (colored blue), and nipples (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Schematic representation of the Turing model used here and its parameters used throughout the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Step-wise changes in the diffusion parameters Du and Dv produce nipple-type Turing patterns, with increasingly hexagonal packing upon increasing Du within the boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Step-wise changes in the diffusion parameters Du and Dv produce maze-type Turing patterns, with increasingly ordered parallel orientation of ridges obtained upon increasing Du within the boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Parameter conditions normally producing maze-type patterning produce parallel ridges if growth starts in a nonhomogeneous environment, with nipple-type structures preoccupying part of the space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four time points of simulations are shown; the right-most picture is a fragment of Fig 1F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling parameters for A and CE are given in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of the parameter space of Turing modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters Du and Dv (A), fu and gv (B), and fv and gu (C) are varied in the ranges indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colored space indicates the range of parameters where Turing patterns can be formed; the white space is where no stable patterns can appear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colors reflect the wavelength of the patterns, from small (blue) to large (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Points on the colored space indicate the parameters chosen to produce Turing patterns as shown on Fig 3 AH, as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures are made with the matplotlib program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parameters used to model the Turing patterns shown on Fig 3 and Fig S4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transformations of corneal nanopatterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphogramme depicts the likely interconversions among the nanostructural patterns found in the insect class rather than phylogenetic relationships of the patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primordial dimpled nanopatterns (1, here from a Forficula earwig) can transform into various maze-type nanostructures (24; 2 from a Pyrrhocoris firebug, 3 from a Tabanidae fly, and 4 from the butterfly Protographium asius).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can further transform into disordered nipples (6, here from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster), which can further become orderly packed (7, here from a Pterophoridae moth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, parallel ridges (5, here from a Tipulidae fly) can evolve either from mazes or nipples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The figure is made of reconstructed 3D AFM images fused, for the sake of visualization not in exact scale, using MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insect_Specimens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dried insect samples were obtained from a collection of the Department of Entomology, Moscow State University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fresh specimens were collected in the woods around the town of Pushchino, Moscow region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic tree of the insect class was taken from Su and coworkers (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To prepare corneal samples, the head of an insect was cut out of the body, followed by removal of the mouth apparatus with a scalpel, splitting of the head into the two hemispheres, and careful extraction of the brain tissue with forceps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the cornea was cleared from the head capsule tissue as well as the underlying brain material with a scalpel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was attached to a glass slide for AFM by means of two-sided scotch tape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AFM scanning of the corneal surfaces was performed with the Integra-Vita microscope (NT-MDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the semicontact procedure, the nitride silicon cantilever NSG 03 (NT-MDT) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters of the cantilever were: length, 100 µm; resonant frequency, 62123 kHz; radius, 10 nm; and force constant, 0.42.7 N/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the contact procedure, the cantilever CSG 10 (NT-MDT) was used, with the following parameters: length, 250 µm; resonant frequency, 1428 kHz; radius, 10 nm; and force constant, 0.030.2 N/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice between the semicontact and the contact measuring procedures was dictated by the size and curvature of the studied surface of the sample but provided essentially identical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each AFM experiment, several scans were made to check the reproducibility of images and the absence of possible surface damages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of height and width of the corneal nanostructures were performed by the Nova software (NT-MDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Turing_Modeling_of_Corneal_Nanopatterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Turing reactiondiffusion system of differential equations was used,ut=F(u,v)+Duuvt=G(u,v)+Dvv[S1]where u and v are concentrations of the two interacting morphogens: activator (u) and inhibitor (v) (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, in typical Turing applications, morphogen production and degradation are analyzed, we here presume that both types of molecules are produced and secreted into the lens by the cone cells in a preset manner, and it is the ability of these molecules to aggregate/polymerize that is controlled by the Turing-type mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concentrations u and v depend on two components: (i) the F(u,v) and G(u,v) functions that describe the reaction kinetics (aggregation/polymerization, disassembly/depolymerization, and interactions between the morphogens) and (ii) the component describing the diffusion of the two morphogens with the respective diffusion coefficients Du and Dv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This second component brings about the diffusion-driven instability, which is required for the unequal distribution of the morphogens and thus patterning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20, we introduce the following denominations:fu=Fu,fv=Fv,gu=Gu,gv=Gv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]In the subsequent analysis, we set fu  greater than  0 (activator stimulates its own aggregation); fv less_than 0 (inhibitor suppresses aggregation of the activator); gu  greater than  0 (activator stimulates activity of the inhibitor); gv less_than 0 (inhibitor depolymerizes); and Dv  greater than  Du (inhibitor diffuses faster than activator).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This presetting allows forming the diffusion-driven instability through the activatorinhibitor scheme (20); the other scheme [substrate depletion (20)] is not considered here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further use the derivative of the basic model of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16, as it allows easy obtaining of a large set of patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this derivative, the functions F(u,v) and G(u,v) are given linearly asG(u,v)=avu+bvv+cvdvvF(u,v)=auu+buv+cuduu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Two further parameters, du and dv, are present in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and in the modeling used in our paper to produce patterns on Fig 3 and Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitutingbv=bvdvau=audu[S4]and simplifying bv and au, the F(u,v) and G(u,v) functions gain the easier formF(u,v)=auu+buv+cuG(u,v)=avu+bvv+cv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]Finally, the initial reactiondiffusion set of Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 becomesut=auu+buv+cu+Duuvt=avu+bvv+cv+Dvv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]Schematically, these parameters of the Turing model are presented in Fig S4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2, one can see that fu=au,fv=bu,gu=av,gv=bv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current system, the concentrations u and v have the dimensions of [(number of molecules)/length3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters a, b, and c represent the rates of the respective reactions, and thus dimensions of a and b are [time1], and of c  [(number of molecules)/(time × length3)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion coefficients D have the dimensions of [length2/time].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The solution of the system of Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 can be given, following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20, as the sum of general solutions,wetsin(kx)[S7]where  is the solution eigenvalue with a particular wavenumber k. The wavenumber k determines the size of the patterns, whereas  determines the speed of increase or decrease of harmonics with the given k. Because the periodic structures with the negative eigenvalue will dampen with time, whereas those with the positive one increase with time, a stable Turing structure should typically has positive .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miura and Maini (20) have shown that the maximal  can be obtained ifk2=DuDv(fugv)+(Du+Dv)DuDvfvguDuDv(DvDu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]Following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, the wavelength  can be then calculated as=2k.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]To determine the order of magnitude of the parameters of our system, we assume that the diffusion coefficients have the same order, as do the rate constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set them, respectively, as D and f. Using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and reducing the similar terms, we conclude thatk2fD,10Df.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]As the period of the final structure in the patterns (i.e., cross section of the nipple or dimple or ridge in mazes and strands) will be of the same order as the wavelength corresponding to the maximal positive eigenvalue of the system of equations, we can determine the order of magnitude of the diffusion coefficients and the reaction rate constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BecauseD2100f,[S11]the diffusion constants become proportional to the reaction rate constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the nanopatterns we describe are of the order of 105 cm, the relation above becomesD1012f,[S12]dimensions of diffusion coefficients being square centimeters per second, and reaction rate constants being per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The table below provides a wide set of reaction rate constants for biological reactions, starting from the higher limit of 106 characteristic for fastest enzymatic reactions to lower values characteristic, e.g., for protein aggregation/polymerization (35):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As for the diffusion coefficients, the nanopatterning we study takes place in the developing lens, which can be considered a colloid or liquid crystal (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For colloids, diffusion coefficients can range from 106 cm2/s to 1015 cm2/s (36), whereas, for liquid crystals, the diffusion coefficient was estimated around 108 cm2/s (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We thus conclude that Turing nanopatterns with the wavelength of the order of 100 nm are likely to form in the colloidal system with reduced diffusion parameters, with the aggregation/polymerization and the disassembly/depolymerization of the interacting molecules being the underlying mechanisms of patterning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To adequately select the parameters used to perform the Turing modeling as on Fig 3 and Fig S4, we first investigate different ranges of parameters and their influence on formation of Turing patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the equations provided above, we could investigate the dependence of the wavelength max, corresponding the maximal eigenvalue , from the parameters (Du, Dv), (fu, gv), and (fv, gu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown as Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have thus performed modeling that quantitavely shows the feasibility of the Turing nanopatterns to form in the environment of a developing lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
