Shp2 and Pten have antagonistic roles in myeloproliferation but cooperate to promote erythropoiesis in mammals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the extensive attentions paid to phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) or SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase (Shp2) functions in cell signaling, how their regulated pathways are intertwined has never been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By creating a compound mutant mouse line with both genes deleted in blood cells, we have found that Pten and Shp2 can work antagonistically in myelopoiesis, while acting cooperatively in erythropoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of Shp2 suppressed myeloproliferative neoplasm induced by Pten loss but induced severe anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data explain why some pharmaceuticals designed to target a specific pathway can suppress one pathogenic process but trigger another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous data suggested a negative role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and a positive function of SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase (Shp2)/Ptpn11 in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we demonstrate that ablating Shp2 indeed suppressed the myeloproliferative effect of Pten loss, indicating directly opposing functions between pathways regulated by these two enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the Shp2 and Pten double-knockout mice suffered lethal anemia, a phenotype that reveals previously unappreciated cooperative roles of Pten and Shp2 in erythropoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lethal anemia was caused collectively by skewed progenitor differentiation and shortened erythrocyte lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, treatment of Pten-deficient mice with a specific Shp2 inhibitor suppressed myeloproliferative neoplasm while causing anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results identify concerted actions of Pten and Shp2 in promoting erythropoiesis, while acting antagonistically in myeloproliferative neoplasm development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study illustrates cell type-specific signal cross-talk in blood cell lineages, and will guide better design of pharmaceuticals for leukemia and other types of cancer in the era of precision medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional_Deletion_of_Shp2_Suppresses_MPN_Induced_by_Pten_Loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We generated a new mouse line with conditional deletion of both Pten and Shp2 in the hematopoietic compartment [Cre+:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2fl/fl, double knockout (DKO)], by crossing Ptenfl/fl and Shp2fl/fl mice with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyinosine-polycytidine (poly-I:C) injection induced efficiently Cre-mediated DNA excision at both Pten and Shp2 loci in bone marrow (BM) cells (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous data (8, 9), the conditional Pten KO (PKO) (Cre+:Ptenfl/fl) animals displayed significantly elevated counts of total white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes, with the latter exhibiting the most drastic increase (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the inducible Shp2 KO (SKO) (Cre+:Shp2fl/fl) mice exhibited opposite phenotypes of lowering blood cell counts, reinforcing a positive role for Shp2 in promoting hematopoiesis (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, dual deletion of Pten and Shp2 restored overall and specific WBC counts to nearly WT levels (Fig 1C), indicating opposing roles for Shp2 and Pten in myelopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, additional removal of Shp2 normalized the expansion of Pten-deficient Mac1+Gr1+ myeloid progenitors (Fig 1 D and E), and suppressed excessive proliferation of Pten/ Gr1+ cells in the spleen (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extramedullary hematopoiesis in PKO spleen disrupted the normal red-pulp/white-pulp structure, which was also partially rescued in DKO mice (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroacetate esterase staining showed apparent myeloid cell infiltration in the liver of PKO but not DKO animals (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To pinpoint the intersection of Shp2- and Pten-regulated signals in myelopoiesis, we evaluated common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs), and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GMP number was significantly increased in PKO BM, and additional deletion of Shp2 reduced the expansion of GMPs to WT levels (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moderate reduction of CMPs was seen in DKO BM, with more severe decrease in SKO (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEPs were reduced in SKO, with no significant changes in PKO and DKO mice (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LSK cell population enriched for HSCs were similarly decreased in mutants, with the most severe decrease seen in SKO mice at 2 wk after the final poly-I:C injection (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports by other groups (8, 9), we found that Pten deficiency led to extramedullary hematopoiesis manifested by substantial increase in spleen-derived myeloid colonies but unchanged BM-derived myeloid colonies using in vitro CFU-C assays (Fig 2 E and F and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional Shp2 removal abolished the increase and restored spleen- or BM-derived myeloid colonies to almost WT levels in general (Fig 2 E and F and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest a role of Shp2 in promoting myeloid proliferation at an early developmental stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We monitored MPN engraftment in lethally irradiated recipients reconstituted with PKO or DKO BM cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 1 × 106 BM nucleated cells (BMNCs) were transplanted, 67% recipients with PKO BM donor cells developed MPN within 3 mo, but only 33% mice engrafted with DKO BM showed MPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 2.55 × 105 BMNCs were engrafted, 55% PKO recipients developed MPN, in contrast to only 12.5% in recipients receiving DKO cells (Fig 2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest a putative therapeutic approach of targeting Shp2 for MPN induced by Pten deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have investigated the molecular mechanism for the antagonistic effects between Shp2 and Pten in Gr1+Mac1+ myeloid cell signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis detected elevated p-Akt signals in PKO cells, which was compromised by additional Shp2 ablation in DKO cells (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, p-Erk levels were significantly up-regulated in PKO myeloid progenitors but alleviated in DKO cells (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Pten and Shp2 regulate the PI3K-Akt pathway bidirectionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dual_Deletion_of_Shp2_and_Pten_Triggers_Lethal_Anemia_and_Skewed_Erythroid_Cell_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, despite the inhibitory effect of additional Shp2 deletion on MPN driven by Pten loss, the DKO mice had shorter lifespan than PKO mice and died within 30 d after poly-I:C induction of gene deletion (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shortened lifespan was not detected in the DKO BM transplantation recipients (Fig 2H) because of cotransplantation of CD45.1+ WT BM cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that concurrent ablation of Pten and Shp2 induced lethal anemia, and the DKO animals showed anemic signs, like pale toes and much smaller red blood cell (RBC) pellets shortly after the induced gene excision (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed nearly 50% reduction of RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit in DKO mice, compared with controls, at 1 wk after final injection of poly-I:C (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In moribund DKO animals, hematocrit was as low as 25% of normal counts (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moderate anemia was observed in mice with either Pten or Shp2 ablated as shown by the parameters of erythroid compartment (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, combined deletion of both genes dramatically aggravated the phenotype, indicating concerted action of Shp2 and Pten in erythropoiesis and maintenance of RBC homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased immature RBC frequency associated with higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (Table S1) was detected in peripheral blood of DKO mice (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrocytic anemia (high MCV) is often associated with deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid, but neither vitamin B12 nor folic acid was decreased in DKO sera, compared with controls (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although infiltration of myeloid cells was not detected in the spleen or liver of DKO mice, these organs were equally enlarged as in PKO animals, most likely because of compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis (Fig S3 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WrightGiemsa staining showed increased erythroblasts in BM and spleen cytospin specimens from DKO animals (Fig S3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of nucleated erythrocytes (double-positive for the DNA dye Hochest33342 and Ter119) was significantly increased in DKO BM, compared with WT, SKO, and PKO mice (Fig S3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also detected erythroblasts occasionally in the peripheral blood of DKO but not in WT, SKO, or PKO mice (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RBC maturation process can be divided into stages IIV, based on expression of transferrin receptor CD71 and Ter119 (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BM of DKO mice was characterized by expansion of early stage CD71highTer119low, CD71highTer119+, and CD71midTer119+ erythroblasts, accompanied by decrease of late stage CD71lowTer119+ erythroid cells (Fig 3 D and E), indicating abortive differentiation from erythroblasts to mature RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro erythroid colony forming unit (CFU-E) assay showed that erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) was elevated in the BM of DKO animals (Fig 3F), whereas more mature CFU-E was significantly reduced in the DKO BM (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate a blockage from early erythroid progenitors to CFU-E stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dramatic increase of serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels was detected in DKO mice 2 or 3 wk after poly-I:C injection, with only moderate elevation of serum Epo observed in PKO or SKO mice (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidently, the severe anemia in DKO mice was not caused by Epo deficiency, but rather the anemia triggered compensatory production of excessive Epo and consequently the erythroid progenitor expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Removal_of_Shp2_and_Pten_Leads_to_Enhanced_Reactive_Oxygen_Species_Accumulation_and_Shortened_RBC_Lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using sulfo-NHS-biotin labeling, we measured RBC survival rates in vivo for consecutive 3 wk, and detected significantly shortened lifespan of DKO erythrocytes, compared with WT (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the decreased lifespan is intrinsic to erythrocytes, we measured survival of sulfo-NHS-biotinlabeled donor RBCs in recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untreated Mx1-Cre+:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2fl/fl and Mx1-Cre:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2fl/fl BM cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated WT mice, and poly-I:C was given to the recipients 1 mo later to delete the engineered target genes in donor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed significantly shortened lifespan of DKO erythrocytes in recipients (Fig S4), indicating a cell-autonomous effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that oxidative stress is a critical determinant of erythrocyte lifespan, we used a probe 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) as a general oxidative stress indicator to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in different hematopoietic compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pten deletion caused significantly elevated ROS levels in erythrocytes, which was further aggravated in RBCs of DKO origin (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, increased ROS level was detected in BM Gr1+Mac1+ myeloid progenitors of PKO but not DKO animals (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt-mediated signaling was previously demonstrated to be an important regulator in defense against oxidative stress (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, phospho-Akt level of erythroblasts was excessively up-regulated in PKOs but not DKOs (Fig S6), suggesting other mechanisms were involved in the elevation of ROS in DKO erythrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine a possible effect of ROS accumulation, we investigated if antioxidant treatment can ameliorate the anemic phenotype of DKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were fed with 1 g/L N-acetyl cysteine and 4 g/L vitamin C drinking water and were injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg N-acetyl cysteine every other day for a month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty days after the initial treatment, poly-I:C was injected to delete the target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4C, antioxidant administration greatly improved the gross appearance of DKO animals manifested by hunched posture and rough hair coats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When peripheral blood was collected for complete blood cell counting, we found significantly increased RBC counts and hematocrit in DKO mice treated with antioxidants (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, antioxidants did not result in a full rescue of DKO anemia, even though down-regulation of ROS and significant elongation of life span in DKO RBCs were detected (Fig 4E and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, antioxidant treatment did not fully correct abnormal accumulation of erythroid progenitors (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results argue that the elevated ROS level and shortened RBC lifespan are not fully responsible for the lethal anemia phenotype in DKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined defects in the erythroid differentiation and survival contribute to the severe anemia in DKOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shp2_Inhibitor_Suppresses_MPN_While_Inducing_Anemia_in_PKO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the inhibitory role of additional Shp2 deletion on MPN induced by Pten loss, we further determined if chemical inhibition of Shp2 has a similar effect, by testing a novel Shp2 inhibitor 11a-1 in PKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11a-1 was recently demonstrated to specifically inhibit Shp2 phosphatase activity and attenuate Shp2-dependent signaling, and antiproliferative effect of 11a-1 treatment was seen in leukemia, lung, and breast cancer cell lines (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5 A and B, consecutive intraperitoneal injection of 11a-1 significantly suppressed the excessive myeloproliferation caused by loss of Pten, as indicated by the decrease of Gr1+Mac1+ cells in the BM and decreased granulocytes in the peripheral blood of 11a-1-treated PKOs, with no detectable effect in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, similar to the phenotype of DKO mice, injection of Shp2 inhibitor 11a-1 also triggered anemia development in PKO mice, as evaluated by RBC counts and hematocrit value (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the compound did not have significant impact on hematocrit or the peripheral RBC counts in WT mice (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 11a-1 treatment caused accumulation of CD71high and CD71mid erythroblast in the BM of PKO mice, reminiscent of the DKO phenotype, but not in WT mice (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a primary role of Shp2 is to promote the Ras-Erk pathway in cell signaling, we also tested the effect of Trametinib, a potent Mek inhibitor recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cancer treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the Shp2 inhibitor, injection of the Mek inhibitor Trametinib also induced anemia in PKO mice, with no effect in WT mice (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the anemia induced by the chemical compounds 11a-1 or Traminib in PKO mice was less severe than the phenotype of DKO mice with homozygous deletion of both Shp2 and Pten genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the genetic and pharmaceutical data argue that concurrent inhibition of Pten- and Shp2-regulated signals can cause severe anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pten is known to down-regulate the PI3K/Akt signaling by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (35)-trisphosphate (PIP3), but its role as a phospho-tyrosine phosphatase remains elusive thus far (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shp2 acts to promote the Erk pathway and it may regulate the PI3K-Akt pathway positively or negatively in different cell types (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several groups generated mutant mouse lines with conditional deletion of Shp2 or Pten in the hematopoietic compartment, which confirmed a negative role of Pten and a positive role of Shp2 in hematopoiesis (8, 9, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the apparently opposite phenotypes of PKO and SKO mice in several aspects, we have interrogated a possible antagonizing effect between Pten and Shp2, by creating a new compound mutant mouse line (DKO) with both Shp2 and Pten removed in hematopoietic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenotypic analysis of the DKO mice indeed revealed opposing roles of Pten and Shp2 in myelopoiesis, characterized by almost normalized counts of WBCs, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in DKO mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, ablating Shp2 largely compromised the excessive expansion of Mac1+Gr1+ myeloid progenitor cells induced by Pten deficiency (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFU assays in vitro also indicated mutually neutralizing effect of Shp2 and Pten deletion on most of the common and lineage-committed progenitors examined (Fig 2 E and F and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, BM transplantation demonstrated an inhibitory effect of Shp2 loss on MPN development induced by Pten loss (Fig 2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aggregate, these data indicate antagonistic roles of Pten and Shp2 in MPN development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The molecular mechanism underlying the opposing effects of Shp2 and Pten is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidently, Shp2 and Pten do not have direct physical interaction, nor do these two enzymes share common substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dramatic increase in phospho-Akt signals was detected in PKO cells, which was compromised by additional Shp2 ablation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the defective expression of Kit observed in Shp2-deficient myeloid cells was also alleviated by dual deletion of Pten and Shp2 (11), suggesting a cross-talk of their regulated downstream signals in hematopoietic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, impaired Erk signaling resulting from Shp2 deficiency may also counteract the effect of Akt hyperactivation induced by Pten loss, resulting in normalized myeloproliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unanticipated and most interesting data obtained in this study is the development of lethal anemia in DKO mice, as concerted actions of Pten and Shp2 in erythropoiesis were not predicted based on the previous knowledge of their functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severe anemia is clearly not because of Epo deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the serum Epo level was drastically elevated in DKO mice, compared with WT, SKO, and PKO animals (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the high circulating Epo levels, the DKO mice had dramatically increased number of progenitor cells and increased BFU-E (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the more mature CFU-E numbers were significantly reduced (Fig 3G), suggesting a cooperating role of Pten- and Shp2-regulated signals in promoting progenitor differentiation of erythroid lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative increase of CD71medTer119+, together with a decrease of CD71lowTer119+ cells, was also detected in DKO mice (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to defective progenitor differentiation, a survival problem of Shp2- and Pten-deficient RBCs also contributed to the lethal anemic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in vivo labeling experiment showed significantly shortened lifespan for RBCs in DKO mice (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated ROS levels were detected in DKO mice (Fig 4B), suggesting a role of oxidative stress in lowering RBC survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, treating DKO mice with antioxidant alleviated partially the anemic phenotype, as evidence by the increase of RBC number and hematocrit value (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we believe that combined defects in erythrocyte differentiation and survival contribute to the lethal anemic phenotype in DKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This story clearly illustrates a cell type-specific signal cross-talk in various blood cell lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shp2 and Pten can work either antagonistically or cooperatively in myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar analysis of two PIP3 phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP, Moody et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  generated Pten+/SHIP/ mice and found that the compound mutant developed leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was contrary to the prediction that exaggerated myeloproliferation and leukemogenesis phenotype might be detected in Pten+/SHIP/ mice compared with SHIP-deficient mice as a result of excessive PIP3 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one cannot simply predict the outcome of signal cross-talk based on previous knowledge on each molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the leukemogenic effect of activating PTPN11/Shp2 mutations or Shp2 overexpression in different types of human leukemia (30, 33, 34), Shp2 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for mechanism-based treatment of leukemia (30, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was demonstrated recently that a Shp2-inhibitory compound corrected oncogenic Kit-triggered MPN in mouse models (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the multifaceted roles of Shp2 and Pten in hematopoietic cells revealed in this study raise caution for clinical use of specific Shp2 inhibitors for patients with Pten mutation or deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its potent antimyeloproliferative effect, the Shp2 inhibitor caused anemia in PKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, treatment of PKO mice with the Mek inhibitor Trametinib also triggered anemia while suppressing myeloproliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Trametinib is being widely used in clinical treatment of melanoma and other types of cancer, with anemia reported as a frequently seen side effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high frequency of Pten gene mutation, inactivation, or defective expression in various types of cancer, it will be interesting to determine the correlation between patients anemia development and Pten deficiency in blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, genetic screening of Pten loss or inactivation may be necessary before administering Trametinib to leukemia or cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, despite a wealth of knowledge on functions of individual signaling molecules, design of most effective therapeutic strategies will require full understanding of cell type-specific cross-talks of different pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For in vitro CFU assay, 50,000 BMNCs or 100,000 spleen cells were seeded in MethoCultGF M3434 medium (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturers recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies were visualized and counted under microscope at day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was performed in duplicate for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the CFU-E forming capacity of BM cells, 40,000 BMNCs were seeded into MethoCultGF M3234 medium (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 6 units per milliliter recombinant human Epo (eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies were visualized and counted under microscope at day 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G-CSF, M-CSF, or GM-CSF responsive colony-forming cells were assessed by seeding 10,000 BM or 100,000 spleen cells in MethoCultGF M3234 medium (StemCell Technologies) containing 10 ng/mL G-CSF, M-CSF, or GM-CSF, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFU-G, CFU-M, or CFU-GM was enumerated at day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_of_Mice_with_Chemical_Compounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Shp2 inhibitor 11a-1 was dissolved in DMSO and injected into mice intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg) every day for 20 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEK inhibitor Trametinib (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was first dissolved in DMSO, then diluted in 0.5% hydroxylproxyl methylcellulose, 0.2% tween 80 (pH 8.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with Trametinib via oral gavage at a dosage of 1 mg/kg daily for 20 d. Poly-I:C was administrated for Cre recombinase induction on the first day of inhibitor treatment following standard procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cre+:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2fl/+ mice were used as PKO mice in most of these small compound treatment experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe significant differences between the Cre+:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2+/+ and Cre+:Ptenfl/fl:Shp2fl/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
