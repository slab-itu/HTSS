Mutation-independent rhodopsin gene therapy by knockdown and replacement with a single AAV vector  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of gene-augmentation strategies are entering clinical trials for the treatment of inherited retinal blindness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene therapy for autosomal dominant diseases faces significant obstacles that include allelic heterogeneity and the potential need to silence the mutated gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that a single-gene therapy vector that combines knockdown of the causative gene with its replacement by a resistant wild-type copy can prevent photoreceptor cell death and vision loss in a canine model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inherited retinal degenerations are caused by mutations in  greater than 250 genes that affect photoreceptor cells or the retinal pigment epithelium and result in vision loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For autosomal recessive and X-linked retinal degenerations, significant progress has been achieved in the field of gene therapy as evidenced by the growing number of clinical trials and the recent commercialization of the first gene therapy for a form of congenital blindness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite significant efforts to develop a treatment for the most common form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) caused by  greater than 150 mutations in the rhodopsin (RHO) gene, translation to the clinic has stalled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identified a highly efficient shRNA that targets human (and canine) RHO in a mutation-independent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a single adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector we combined this shRNA with a human RHO replacement cDNA made resistant to RNA interference and tested this construct in a naturally occurring canine model of RHO-adRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subretinal vector injections led to nearly complete suppression of endogenous canine RHO RNA, while the human RHO replacement cDNA resulted in up to 30% of normal RHO protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noninvasive retinal imaging showed photoreceptors in treated areas were completely protected from retinal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathology confirmed retention of normal photoreceptor structure and RHO expression in rod outer segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term ( greater than 8 mo) follow-up by retinal imaging and electroretinography indicated stable structural and functional preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficacy of this gene therapy in a clinically relevant large-animal model paves the way for treating patients with RHO-adRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Optimal_Suppression_of_WT_Rhodopsin_with_shRNA820  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four knockdown reagents, a previously identified (33) hammerhead ribozyme (Rz525) and three shRNAs (shRNA131, shRNA134, and shRNA820) that target distinct homologous regions of canine and human RHO (SI Appendix, Fig S1), were screened initially using in vitro assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of RHO expression was very effective with Rz525 both in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig S2) and in WT (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Table S1 group C) and RHO-mutant canine eyes (SI Appendix, Fig S4 AC and Table S1 group F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to severe retinal complications associated with the high viral titers of AAV2/5-Rz525 needed to achieve nearly complete suppression of RHO expression (SI Appendix, Supplemental Results and Fig S4 D and E), further development of Rz525 was discontinued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro screening of shRNAs showed that shRNA131 resulted in only an 50% reduction of WT human RHO protein (Fig 1 A and B) and failed to suppress mutant human RHO P23H (Fig 1 C and D) and T17M (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there was limited suppression of RHO expression in injected canine WT eyes (SI Appendix, Supplemental Results, Fig S5, and Table S1 group B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The shRNA that most potently suppressed expression of both WT and mutant (P23H and T17M) human RHO protein in vitro was shRNA820 (Fig 1 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, a codon-modified form of human RHO, RHO820, that contained four altered nucleotides at degenerate/wobble positions within the target site of shRNA820 was confirmed to be resistant to shRNA820 suppression (Fig 1 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once it was confirmed that shRNA820 targeted RHO in a mutation-independent manner, shRNA820 was selected as the lead knockdown reagent and was packaged in an AAV2/5 vector under the control of the H1 RNA promoter for further evaluation in WT and RHO-mutant dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Validation of shRNA820 was performed first in WT dogs to determine the titer at which RHO expression can be substantially reduced with expected changes occurring only in outer segments, where RHO is a major signaling and structural protein, but without major stress or degeneration of the remaining cellular compartments of rod photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subretinal injections with AAV-shRNA820 titers ranging from 1 × 1011 to 50 × 1011 viral genomes (vg)/mL were performed in 10 WT canine eyes (SI Appendix, Table S1 group A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treated eyes were evaluated at 78 wk postinjection by in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the retinal structure and were compared with uninjected control eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a representative uninjected WT eye, cross-sectional imaging in the superior retina with OCT revealed hypo- and hyper-scattering layers corresponding to different retinal lamina (Fig 2A, Left) (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) where the photoreceptor nuclei reside and the backscatter intensity originating near the inner segmentouter segment (IS/OS) junction were of primary interest in this study (Fig 2A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IS/OS intensity is expected to be sensitive to changes in outer segment length, alignment, and spatial density and thus can be used as a noninvasive surrogate measure of outer segment health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized IS/OS intensity topography of the uninjected WT eye tends to be uniform (Fig 2A, Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ONL thickness topography in the uninjected WT eye was also relatively homogeneous with incrementally greater values in the central retina supero-temporal to the optic nerve head (ONH) and incrementally smaller values in the nontapetal areas of superior and inferior retina (Fig 2A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyes with lower (1 × 1011 vg/mL) (Fig 2B) and intermediate (5 × 1011 vg/mL) (Fig 2C) titer injections showed no qualitative structural changes between the injected and neighboring uninjected regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define the optimal titer at which structural consequences of RHO knockdown are detectable but mild, retinal locations were systematically sampled (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IS/OS intensity and ONL thickness in a great majority of the locations injected with the two lowest titers (1 × 1011 and 2.5 × 1011 vg/mL) were comparable to those in uninjected control eyes (Fig 2 D and E, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, eyes injected with 10 × 1011 vg/mL showed the reduced IS/OS intensity expected from RHO knockdown (Fig 2D) and some ONL thickening suggesting a subclinical response to the vector administration (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyes injected with the highest titer (50 × 1011 vg/mL) showed vascular engorgement and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the vitreous; there also were abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging (Fig 2 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition to detectable changes occurred between 5 × 1011 and 8 × 1011 vg/mL (Fig 2 D and E, arrows), suggesting a range of potential effective titers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The great majority of the loci at uninjected sites in the treated eyes at all titers were consistent with results expected from uninjected eyes, confirming that the effects of RHO knockdown were localized to the area of the subretinal injection (Fig 2 D and E, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were humanely killed at 78 wk postinjection, and four eyes that had been treated with titers ranging from 1 × 1011 to 10 × 1011 vg/mL were processed for histology and rhodopsin immunohistochemistry (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of outer segment structure associated with a prominent reduction in rod opsin immunolabeling was seen in the area treated with the 10 × 1011 vg/mL titer vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also some detectable infiltration of inflammatory cells around retinal vessels, in the inner retina, and in the subretinal space (Fig 2F, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 5 × 1011 vg/mL some shortening of outer segments and reduction of rod opsin immunolabeling was found in the treated area compared with the untreated area of the same eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the two lowest titers (1× 1011 and 2.5 × 1011 vg/mL), outer segments were preserved, and rod opsin immunolabeling was comparable between treated and untreated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining six eyes injected with titers ranging from 1 × 1011 to 50 × 1011 vg/mL (Fig 2G) were used to assess the efficiency of AAV-shRNA820 in reducing the expression of endogenous canine RHO at both the RNA and protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute RNA quantification (Fig 2H) showed very low levels of RHO transcripts (03% of that found in untreated areas) in the treated areas of eyes injected with titers ranging from 50 × 1011 down to 5 × 1011 vg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower titers (1 × 1011 to 2.5 × 1011 vg/mL) knockdown efficiency was reduced, with 2274% of normal RHO RNA levels still remaining in the treated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of RHO protein persisting in the treated areas on immunoblots revealed a dose-dependent effect (Fig 2I), with undetectable levels in eyes treated with the two highest titers (50 × 1011 and 10 × 1011 vg/mL), 15% in the eye treated with 5 × 1011 vg/mL, and  greater than 47% in eyes treated with the two lowest titers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These studies showed that subretinal AAV vector delivery of shRNA820 can achieve very efficient silencing of WT canine RHO and suggested that the 5 × 1011 vg/mL titer may provide the optimal balance between the knockdown of a highly expressed structural protein in rod photoreceptors and retention of retinal integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Suppression_of_Mutant_RHO_with_shRNA820  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the efficiency of shRNA820 in heterozygous mutant retinas that express both WT and mutant RHO alleles, subretinal injections of AAV-shRNA820 were performed over a range of titers (1 × 1011 to 10 × 1011 vg/mL) in 10 RHO-mutant eyes that were followed for 810 wk postinjection (SI Appendix, Table S1 groups D and E) Since the RHO-mutant dog retinas are highly sensitive to light (4548), the animals were housed under dim red light from birth until the end of the study, and the surgical intervention was performed under infrared illumination (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four eyes were used for quantification of RHO knockdown efficiency at the RNA and protein levels (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Table S1 group D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the WT animals, at a titer of 10 × 1011 vg/mL there was complete silencing of RHO RNA and protein expression in the treated area (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar absence of RHO expression was achieved with the lower (5 × 1011 vg/mL) titer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interpretation of this result was confounded by OCT imaging revealing a partial loss of ONL thickness restricted to the treated area in this eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistent expression of RHO was seen with the lower (1 × 1011 and 2.5 × 1011 vg/mL) titers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we evaluated whether knockdown alone could arrest photoreceptor degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another set of four RHO-mutant eyes (SI Appendix, Table S1 group E) were also injected with the same range of titers of AAV-shRNA820, but at 68 wk postinjection they were exposed for 1 min to moderate-intensity white light known to cause acute retinal degeneration in this canine model (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks after light exposure, the eye injected with the titers of 10 × 1011 and 5 × 1011 vg/mL showed a distinct region of ONL retention corresponding to the treatment area (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe retinal degeneration outside the treatment area demonstrated the substantial rescue of photoreceptors achieved by knockdown alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were abnormalities with IS/OS intensity expected from the knockdown of RHO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the eye injected with the highest (10 × 1011 vg/mL) titer showed some ONL thickening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyes injected with the two lowest titers (2.5 × 1011 and 1 × 1011 vg/mL) had limited or no ONL retention in the treated area (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analysis of these eyes (Fig 3E) confirmed the results of in vivo retinal imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was ONL retention with shortened inner segments, loss of outer segment structure, and reduction in rod opsin immunolabeling following injection with the two highest titers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note: Some variability in the amounts of remaining RHO was observed by immunohistochemistry; panels in Fig 3E show areas with highest RHO immunolabeling.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the eye injected with the 10 × 1011 vg/mL titer, cell infiltrates were seen in the inner retina (Fig 3E, Upper), around retina vessels, and in the subretinal space and choroid of the treated area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the 2.5 × 1011 vg/mL titer severe ONL thinning was found within the treated area with the exception of a small island of ONL retention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest (1 × 1011 vg/mL) titer did not confer any protection against light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this eye, the ONL in the treated area resembled that of the untreated region; it was limited to a single row of cone somata with rare residual rod somata and rod opsin-positive debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together these findings confirm that shRNA820 can suppress both WT and T4R alleles in vivo and that AAV2/5-shRNA820 titers in the 5 × 1011 to 10 × 1011 vg/mL range confer protection of photoreceptor cells (but not their outer segments) from retinal degeneration in RHO-mutant retinas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partial protective effect likely results from efficient RHO suppression which leads to deconstruction of rod outer segments while keeping the inner segments and rod photoreceptor cell bodies intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need to protect the retina from mutant RHO-driven degeneration while retaining functional rods that have preserved light-sensing outer segments led us next to explore whether the suppression of endogenous canine RHO (WT and mutant) could be supplemented with the expression of human RHO cDNA (RHO820) made resistant to shRHA820.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Combined_Suppression_and_Replacement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Long-Term_Preservation_of_Retinal_Structure_and_Function_with_Single-Vector_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the long-term stability of the single-vector strategy and its ability to protect RHO-mutant eyes from degeneration, two RHO-mutant dogs were subretinally injected in one eye with AAV-shRNA820-RHO820 at the previously determined optimal titer of 5 × 1011 vg/mL, while the contralateral eyes received a similar volume of balanced salt solution (BSS) (SI Appendix, Table S1 group I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four eyes were repeatedly light exposed at 11, 15, 25, and 35 wk postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCT imaging was performed preinjection as well as immediately before and 2 wk after each light exposure (Fig 5A, Upper, timeline).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first light exposure, there was complete preservation of photoreceptors within the treated area, and this dramatic treatment effect persisted for 37 wk post injection, even after three additional light exposures (Fig 5A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis performed in sampled retinal locations (Fig 5B, Left) from the treated area of the two AAV-shRNA820-RHO820injected eyes showed a small increase in ONL thickness after injection that peaked near 12 wk before gradually returning to normal levels by 37 wk (Fig 5B, Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IS/OS signal remained detectable within the treated areas at all time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was, a slight decrease in IS/OS intensity that also peaked near 12 wk followed by a gradual return to normal levels by 37 wk postinjection (Fig 5B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electroretinography (ERG) measurements were performed 2.12.4 wk after each light exposure to assess retinal function (Fig 5A, Upper, timeline).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, ERGs of a RHO-mutant dog showed consistently better rod- and cone-mediated function in the AAV-shRNA820-RHO820treated eye (Fig 5C, green traces) than in the contralateral BSS-injected eye (Fig 5C, red traces); substantial ERG asymmetry was present between vector and BSS-treated eyes, and the asymmetry increased after each light exposure (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitatively, amplitudes of rod-dominated ERG traces showed a tendency to decrease over time in both the AAV- and BSS-injected eyes, likely due to continued photoreceptor degeneration occurring in the peripheral retina outside treatment areas (Fig 5D, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cone function appeared overall to be more stable throughout the 37-wk postinjection period with four intervening light exposures (Fig 5D, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, at each time point there were substantially greater rod and cone responses in treated eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results demonstrate that AAV-shRNA820-RHO820 preserves the integrity of the entire structure of rod photoreceptors and confers long-term protection of retinal structure and function from the degeneration that otherwise occurs rapidly in untreated RHO-mutant eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite considerable efforts at developing gene therapies for autosomal dominant diseases (51), only two involving antisense technology (antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA) have reached the clinical trial stage (NCT01041222 and NCT02363946), and these are for systemic diseases without a retinal phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of mutation-independent gene knockdown-and-replacement approaches have been explored for the treatment of dominantly inherited systemic and retinal diseases that result from toxic gain-of-function mutations and/or to circumvent high mutational heterogeneity (4043, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant challenge that likely has delayed the development of clinical therapies is the need to successfully fine-tune the level of reduction of both mutant and WT endogenous proteins while providing sufficient resistant replacement (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show in a naturally occurring large animal form of RHO-adRP that this dual-function strategy can effectively provide long-term photoreceptor preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that when both knockdown and replacement components are codelivered in the same viral vector, they provide increased efficacy and a better safety profile than when delivered separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapid_Assessment_of_Gene_Therapy_Efficacy_in_a_Naturally_Occurring_Large-Animal_Model_of_RHO-adRP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic approaches that include gene augmentation, mutation-dependent RHO suppression, and mutation-independent RHO knockdown and replacement have been tested to date only in transgenic animal models of RHO-adRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the hP23H mouse (5, 41, 43), the hP347S mouse (36, 38, 42, 55), and the mP23H (lines 1 and 3) rat (22, 23, 25, 26, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of animal models that have different ratios of mutant transgene to endogenous RHO copy numbers complicates comparisons of photoreceptor rescue outcomes among these studies and precludes estimating their potential efficiency in the human RHO-adRP retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a P23H opsin knock-in mouse that expresses equal levels of murine P23H and WT RHO was generated (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this model would have had no use in the current study, as the target site for shRNA820 in canine and human RHO RNA is not conserved in the mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To increase the predictive value of our studies in the context of a future human clinical trial, we used the RHO T4R mutant dog, the only naturally occurring model of RHO-adRP (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides its translational value for its human-sized eye, and its phenotypic similarities with class B patients (57), the RHOT4R/+ dog expresses equal amounts of mutant and WT RHO proteins (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both forms traffic normally to the rod outer segments (58) and sustain normal retinal structure and function until progressive areas of photoreceptor loss are detected in the inferior-temporal (SI Appendix, Fig S9) and central retina (57) within the first 2 y of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity to light, which has been recognized in other models of RHO-adRP (for review see supporting information table S1 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47) and suspected in class B patients (19, 45, 5961), has been well characterized in the canine RHO T4R model (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capitalizing on this light sensitivity, we previously developed a light-exposure protocol to experimentally trigger a rapid and synchronized loss of photoreceptors and accelerate the natural disease course (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RHO-mutant (but not WT) dogs undergo a complete loss of rods in the central to midperipheral retina within 2 wk following an acute (1-min) light exposure using intensity levels encountered in clinical patient settings (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used this disease-acceleration approach to obtain a rapid read-out of the effect of gene therapy intervention in preventing rod degeneration in RHO-mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparability of the molecular pathophysiology between the natural disease and light-accelerated disease (46, 48, 62) remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RHO_Suppression__The_Need_for_a_Potent_Knockdown_Component  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence from several animal model studies suggests that a toxic gain-of-function mechanism is associated with a number of RHO mutations including P23H (56, 63, 64), T17M (65, 66), and T4R/T4K (45, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This toxicity may be exacerbated following exposure to light in many RHO-adRP models including the RHO-mutant dog (see supporting information table S1 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we posited that under normal ambient illumination, the T4R mutation produces a protein that is highly toxic once bleached but is stable when bound to chromophore (58) and that efficient protection of rods would require significant knockdown of the mutant transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study examined the efficiency of several RHO-knockdown reagents, including three shRNAs and a hammerhead ribozyme, with the goal of identifying the most potent reagent capable of suppressing RHO expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rz525 tested in the RHO-mutant dog produced a 64% reduction in endogenous canine RHO protein that was not sufficient to confer protection from light-induced retinal degeneration (SI Appendix, Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirmed the high toxicity of the native mutant T4R protein, since remaining amounts as low as 18% of physiological levels of RHO were sufficient to cause disease in a heterozygous mutant retina, and argued for the need to achieve more efficient suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a complete suppression of RHO protein was obtained with Rz525, some ONL rescue was observed, but the need for a high viral titer (1013 vg/mL) was associated with severe retinal inflammation (SI Appendix, Fig S4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, only the most efficient shRNA (shRNA820) identified in vitro and following screening and testing in WT dogs was subsequently evaluated in mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results confirmed that optimal preservation occurred only when nearly complete suppression of RHO protein expression was achieved, whereas 86% knockdown of RHO provided only partial protection (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the most efficient knockdown reagents reported to date have achieved a 9095% suppression of human RHO RNA, but these results were obtained on FACS-sorted transduced rods (36, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we intentionally measured the levels of remaining RHO RNA and protein from biopsy punches of neuroretina collected within the treated area rather than from an enriched population of transduced rods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show a nearly complete knockdown of RHO message and product in RHO-mutant retinas (Fig 3 B, C, and E), suggesting not only that shRNA820 is extremely potent but also that rod transduction efficiency was very high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this was achieved with an AAV2/5 titer as low as 5 × 1011 vg/mL, which previously has been shown to be within the range of well-tolerated titers in dog retinas (44, 67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nearly complete suppression of RHO protein expression in WT and RHO-mutant dogs was associated with a loss of the outer segment, similar to the collapse of rod outer segment structure reported by others (36, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that suppression of RHO was not associated with any reduction in ONL thickness, suggesting that rods can survive for at least 10 wk following administration of shRNA820.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interval provides a window for concomitant expression of a resistant RHO replacement component to produce sufficient protein to prevent outer segment deconstruction or initiate outer segment regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RHO_Replacement__How_Much_Is_Enough__and_How_Much_Is_Too_Much?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As little as 23% overexpression of rhodopsin has been shown to cause retinotoxicity in transgenic mice (69, 70), thus calling for tight regulation of RHO gene-supplementation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, retinal degeneration was not observed when RHO gene augmentation was delivered postnatally in the hP23H RHO+/, mRHO+/+ transgenic mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetic configuration led to a twofold increase in RHO RNA and a 58% increase in RHO protein and resulted in both structural and functional rods for up to 6 mo posttreatment (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These apparently conflicting results suggest that mature rods may tolerate higher levels of RHO overexpression than developing photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, gene augmentation was not considered in the RHO-mutant dog because of the highly toxic gain of function of the T4R mutation and also because this strategy had failed to confer protection when tested in the hP23H RHO+/, mRHO+/ transgenic mouse that carries one mutant (hP23H) and one WT (mRHO) allele (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, replacement with a resistant RHO cDNA, RHO820, was evaluated together with shRNA820-mediated RHO suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the treated areas of mutant retinas injected 9 wk prior with AAV2/5-shRNA820-RHO820, total RHO protein levels as low as 18% of that found in untreated regions (Fig 4H) were sufficient to preserve rod outer segment structure (Fig 4C and SI Appendix, Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When retinas from two additional injected eyes were processed 4 wk later (13 wk postinjection), higher protein amounts (up to 33% of untreated areas) were measured (Fig 4H), which also sustained outer segment formation (Fig 4D and SI Appendix, Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the kinetics of RHO replacement are slower than the kinetics of suppression and that maximal levels of RHO expression may not be reached until several weeks post treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Previous efforts at copackaging the knockdown and replacement reagents within a same viral vector provided short-term (10 d postinjection) preservation of ONL thickness but failed to rescue rod outer segment structure in a hP23H RHO+/, mRHO+/ transgenic mouse (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to consideration of a two-vector approach whereby the knockdown and replacement reagents were packaged separately, enabling coadministration of different ratios of the two vectors to better control the levels of RHO suppression and replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy achieved preservation of ONL thickness, rod outer segment structure, and ERG function in the hP347S RHO+/, mRHO+/ transgenic mouse, but the effect was not sustained (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, coinjection of AAV-shRNA820 and AAV-RHO820 led to some degree of protection against light exposure, but signs of severe retinal inflammation were observed, likely because of the combined higher viral doses administered (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding led us to pursue the single-vector dual-function strategy that our group previously evaluated successfully in a mouse model (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ShRNA820 and RHO820 driven respectively by the human H1 RNA and the human opsin proximal promoters were successfully packaged within the cargo capacity limit of the recombinant AAV cassette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of this construct remained very high, achieving suppression of 98.5% of endogenous canine RHO RNA at 13 wk post injection and expression of human canine RHO at levels comparable to normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the protein level, replacement resulted in only about a third of normal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy between RNA and protein levels could be explained by several factors, including the possibility that synonymous codon modifications introduced at wobble/degenerate sites to generate the resistant RHO820 cDNA influenced its translation efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of codon frequency of the four modified codons at the RHO target site of shRNA820 showed for both canine and human RHO an increase in frequency for one codon, a decrease in frequency for the three others, and an overall decrease when all four were combined (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a correlation has been found between codon usage and relative tRNA abundance, particularly for highly expressed genes that are tissue specific (71), the introduction of three codons with lower frequency could have led to a reduced rate of RHO820 translation (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore it may be possible to improve rhodopsin expression by reducing the number of modifications in the replacement gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single mismatch between an siRNA and an mRNA may be sufficient to block RNA silencing if the mismatch occurs near the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage site (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible explanation unrelated to codon bias may be that the kinetics of RHO suppression are faster than the kinetics of RHO replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H1 RNA polymerase III promoter used in our vector is considered safer than the more potent U6 promoter, which leads to a very high level of shRNA expression and, potentially, to saturation of the processing system for endogenous miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, H1 RNA is expressed abundantly, and the promoter used here functions in all cell types tested (74, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain why at 9 wk postinjection there was already a prominent reduction (84%) of endogenous RHO RNA levels while RHO820 RNA levels reached only 59% of normal (Fig 4 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of RHO protein in the structurally preserved outer segment, retinal OCT imaging of the IS/OS intensity, a surrogate marker of IS/OS integrity, showed that the signal, although detectable, was decreased at 9 and 13 wk postinjection (Fig 4 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal analysis in two RHO-mutant dogs treated with AAV-shRNA820-RHO820 and submitted to four acute light-exposure events showed a similar decline in IS/OS intensity that peaked at 12 wk postinjection followed by a gradual and nearly complete recovery by 37 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Successful and complete protection of rods was achieved over the long term (37 wk/8.5 mo) following a single subretinal injection of AAV-shRNA820-RHO820 in mutants that repeatedly had acute light exposures that cause complete loss of rods in the central to midperipheral retina after just a single event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantially improved ERG responses were consistently seen in AAV-treated eyes at all time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the cone-mediated ERG response was stable, a slight decline in rod-dominated ERG function was noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight increase in ONL thickness without any clinical evidence of inflammation, as seen in dogs injected with AAV-mediated gene therapy in other studies (76, 77), was also observed here in the treated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase likely reflects intra- or intercellular swelling due to a transient and subclinical response to the viral vector, since this effect was not seen in the BSS-injected eyes before light exposure or in the natural history of uninjected eyes housed under standard or dim red cyclic illumination (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return of ONL thickness to normal preinjection values ruled out the hypothesis that the observed ERG decline was associated with photoreceptor loss within the treated regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the functional decline is likely explained by the additional loss of rods located in the untreated peripheral retina following cumulative light exposure, and this hypothesis is consistent with the similar decline in rod-dominated ERG amplitudes found in the contralateral BSS-injected eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have developed a single vector with dual RHO knockdown and replacement functions that provides complete and long-term protection of rods against a class B RHO mutation with a toxic gain of function identified in a naturally occurring large-animal model of RHO-adRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly efficient mutation-independent strategy raises hope that a common gene therapy for all RHO-adRP patients with class B mutations will be an achievable goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Material_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro assays conducted in HEK293T (ATCC) cells (33) were used to screen the efficiency of a hammerhead ribozyme (Rz525) and three shRNAs (shRNA131, shRNA134, and shRNA820) in suppressing WT and mutant (P23H, T17M) human RHO expression (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-complementary (79) and nonself-complementary AAV vectors were packaged in serotype 5 (80) by double-plasmid DNA transfection and were purified according to previously published methods (81, 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The titer of DNase-resistant vector genomes was measured by real-time PCR relative to a standard; purity was validated by silver-stained SDS/PAGE, sterility and the absence of endotoxin were confirmed, and aliquots were stored at 80 °C before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT and RHO-mutant dogs (45, 57) were used to evaluate the response to subretinal injections of AAV2/5 vectors carrying the most potent knockdown reagents, either alone (Rz525, shRNA820) or in combination (shRNA820) with a codon-modified resistant human RHO cDNA (RH0820) (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of the effect of RHO suppression and replacement was made by means of en face and cross-sectional in vivo retinal imaging, ERG, quantification of RHO protein and RNA levels, and morphological evaluation on retinal histological sections (76, 8385).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A light-exposure paradigm (4648) was used to accelerate the natural course of disease in the RHO-mutant dogs and rapidly assess whether the subretinally delivered AAV constructs prevented the onset of retinal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All dogs were bred and maintained at the University of Pennsylvania Retinal Disease Studies Facility (RDSF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (86) and the US Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations and complied with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methodological details are provided in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
