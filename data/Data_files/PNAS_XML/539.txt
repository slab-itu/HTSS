Elucidation of roles for vitamin B12 in regulation of folate, ubiquinone, and methionine metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a chemical probe mimic of vitamin B12, we reveal a light- and B12-dependent DNA regulator, and make the unexpected discovery of B12 having regulatory involvement in microbial folate, ubiquinone, and methionine processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest a pivotal role for B12 in the control of cell growth, which may lead to coordination of cell behavior in complex multicellular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As key research questions emerge from host-associated and environmental microbiomes, we anticipate that B12 regulatory control of metabolism will be found to be generalizable, will be critical for coordination of individual microbe and community metabolism, and that organismal interdependencies for B12 may be pertinent to microbiome organization, stability, and overall function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only a small fraction of vitamin B12-requiring organisms are able to synthesize B12 de novo, making it a common commodity in microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially recognized as an enzyme cofactor of a few enzymes, recent studies have revealed additional B12-binding enzymes and regulatory roles for B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the development and use of a B12-based chemical probe to identify B12-binding proteins in a nonphototrophic B12-producing bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two unexpected discoveries resulted from this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we identified a light-sensing B12-binding transcriptional regulator and demonstrated that it controls folate and ubiquinone biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our probe captured proteins involved in folate, methionine, and ubiquinone metabolism, suggesting that it may play a role as an allosteric effector of these processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These metabolic processes produce precursors for synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, B12 likely modulates growth, and by limiting its availability to auxotrophs, B12-producing organisms may facilitate coordination of community metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Development_of_an_Affinity-Based_B12_Probe_That_Mimics_Natural_Vitamin_B12  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the goal of conducting live-cell probe-labeling studies, we sought to develop a vitamin B12 affinity-based probe that would be recognized, transported, and bind proteins akin to native vitamin B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior research with fluorescent analogs of B12 found that modification of any of the carboxamide nitrogens emanating off the tetrapyrrole core resulted in moderate to severe impacts on protein binding affinity (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, modification of the ribose-5-hydroxy moiety of the ribose sugar resulted in biologically well-tolerated B12 analogs (1621).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable covalent bond-forming reactions between B12-ABP and target proteins, we developed a linker moiety to attach at the 5-hydroxy position of B12 (Fig 1A) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linker, 3, contains a diazirine for irreversible photocross-linking of the probe to B12-binding proteins, and an alkyne group to enable click chemistry that is used in postlive cell labeling to append fluorophores for fluorescence measurements or biotin for enrichment of probe targets, and subsequent LC-MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B12-ABP synthesis required four steps to develop the linker and append it to the ribose-5-hydroxy position (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the probe binds proteins akin to native B12, we demonstrated that transcobalamin, a B12-binding protein, was probe-labeled in a concentration-dependent manner and that the probe was outcompeted by addition of excess native cyanocobalamin (CNB12) (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell uptake and protein labeling by B12-ABP in Halomonas was experimentally validated by fluorescence gel analysis (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also expressed and purified the B12-dependent enzyme, MetH, from Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 and demonstrated labeling by B12-ABP and ablation of the binding upon addition of excess CNB12 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Affinity-Based_Protein_Profiling_of_Halomonas_sp_HL-48  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analyses (12) of the Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 genome revealed that it encodes machinery for synthesis and salvage of B12 and three B12-dependent enzymes; thus, we anticipated that our probe would capture proteins involved in these processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B12-ABP was added directly to live Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 cells after they had reached exponential growth in B12-deplete defined media (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 60 min, cells were UV-irradiated to stimulate probeprotein covalent bond formation via the diazirine moiety on B12-ABP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probed proteins were enriched by biotin affinity purification and quantitatively analyzed by LC-MSbased proteomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B12-ABP labeling of proteins was also competed with addition of excess CNB12, and the competition experiment was quantitatively analyzed by proteomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for only those proteins in which excess native CNB12 results in statistically significant diminished B12-ABP protein labeling, we identified a total of 41 proteins (summarized in Table 1; full details in Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of these proteins are components of three enzymes known to use B12 as a cofactor, namely the methionine synthase (MetH), ribonucleotide reductase (NrdJa/NrdJb), and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EutB/EutC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe also detected cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (BtuR), an enzyme that reacts with B12 and its biosynthetic precursors as a substrate, catalyzing their adenylosylation during de novo biosynthesis or salvage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CobW, also bound by the probe, is known to be involved in B12 biosynthesis, but its exact function is still not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed to be involved in cobalt insertion into a corrinoid precursor (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that we did not detect the vitamin B12 transporter, which we speculate is because of the low levels of the probe still retained on the transporter at the time UV was applied, or it may have been excluded from proteomic analysis because of it being a membrane component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that probe-labeled proteins are not artifacts of the labeling process, proteomic controls were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, samples treated with DMSO only (no probe), but for which all click chemistry steps were performed akin to the probed samples, were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, competition experiments with CNB12 were performed in which the B12-ABP (2 ) and CNB12 (100 M) were added concomitantly to HL-48 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LC-MS proteomics data were analyzed, and the control samples were used to statistically validate probe labeling (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For additional validation, we expressed and purified FolD, MetE (Table 1), and MetH (positive control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins were labeled with B12-ABP, and labeling was competed by addition of excess CNB12 during the labeling experiment, which resulted in significantly inhibited or near complete ablation of labeling (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the carbene generated by UV irradiation of the probe diazirine is rapidly protonated by water (2426), so it is highly unlikely that the probe with the carbene moiety transiently diffused away from one protein through aqueous cytosol and incidentally labeled other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by the labeling and competitive inhibition of purified MetH, FolD, and MetE, it is probable that the proteins identified in our proteomic measurements of B12-ABP labeling do indeed rely on B12 binding, or they are in very tight multienzyme complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we also performed a global proteomic analysis of Halomonas HL-48 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing the order of quantitative values from the global analysis to the B12-ABP chemoproteomic analysis, meaning the highest to lowest values for the 41 B12-binding proteins, they are correlative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that the probe labeling results in specific binding events, and does not follow the order of protein abundance; in fact, three proteins were not detected in the global proteome analysis that were identified by B12-ABP chemoproteome analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our results confirm that the probe binds to and labels expected enzymes that require B12 as a cofactor or use it as a substrate, and identify 34 candidate B12-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Potential_Allosteric_Control_Role_for_Vitamin_B12  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three probe-labeled proteins were identified that are involved at different points of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway that yields heme and B12 in Halomonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe labeled uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (HemE), which catalyzes the first reaction in heme biosynthesis from uroporphyrinogen III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This metabolite is also the precursor to vitamin B12 biosynthesis and, therefore, these anabolic processes compete for the same precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allosteric control of HemE would provide Halomonas a means by which to control flux through these pathways based on B12 availability, and suggests a fundamentally new role for B12 in cellular metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior reports on control of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway in other microbes have identified regulatory feedback controls by B12-dependent riboswitches (27) and redox signaling cascades (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking these data together, we find that vitamin B12 regulation of these steps could result in redirection of metabolism between biosynthesis of heme versus B12 biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B12_Interdependencies_in_Folate_and_Methionine_Metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examination of additional enzymes bound by the B12-ABP revealed a remarkable connection to processes linked by methionine synthase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two variants of methionine synthase, MetH and MetE, are encoded by Halomonas and responsible for conversion of homocysteine to methionine (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both enzymes were captured by the B12-ABP, yet only MetH is known to depend on B12 for function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many bacteria, MetE translation is repressed by an upstream cobalamin-binding riboswitch (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Halomonas the transcription of metE (CY41DRAFT_1840) is activated by MetR (CY41DRAFT_1841), but no upstream riboswitch for repression of MetE was detected (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new mechanism of control involving an allosteric interaction between MetE and B12 is suggested by our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that MetE binds B12, we expressed and purified the enzyme and labeled it with B12-ABP, and also demonstrated that addition of excess CNB12 during the labeling experiment results in significantly inhibited probe labeling (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, given the number of replicate analyses that were performed, if probe labeling of the methionine cycle and 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5mTHF) recycling pathways was purely ancillary, the proteomic results would likely be highly variable, but they are not (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The B12-ABP also captured all three enzymes needed to synthesize 5mTHF, the methyl donor used in the MetH reaction, and five enzymes associated with methionine metabolism and repair (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are not known to be B12-dependent; however, they are used in pathways that are linked by MetH and thereby may be probe-labeled because of close proximity effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In correlation to the role B12 plays in methionine cycling, nine S-adynosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent enzymes were probe -labeled (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these enzymes are methyltransferases involved in the modification of rRNA and tRNA, or synthesis of ubiquinone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, the B12-ABPlabeling results point to significant and previously unknown roles in control of methionine and 5mTHF recycling, and the processes in which intermediates are used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_a_B12-Dependent_DNA_Transcription_Factor_PhrR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probe labeling of Halomonas resulted in the identification of a B12-dependent transcription factor from the MerR family, which was named PhrR (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative genomics analysis of PhrR orthologs in Proteobacteria suggests that they belong to the previously uncharacterized group of light-controlled regulators of genes coding for DNA photolyases and other light dependent processes (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-terminal DNA-binding domains in PhrR proteins are 4149% similar to DNA-binding domains of the previously characterized B12-dependent light-inducible regulators LitR from Bacillus megaterium and Thermus thermophilus and CarH from Myxococcus xanthus (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PhrR proteins lack a canonical C-terminal B12-binding domain, and would not be characterized as B12-binding proteins by BLAST and domain searches using the trusted cut-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B12 is known to act as a photosensitive regulator of transcription factors, where photolysis of B12 leads to altered DNA binding (7, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and other Proteobacteria, orthologs of phrR are often colocalized on the chromosome with genes involved in photo-damage repair (phr) and cyclopropane fatty acid biosynthesis (cfa) (Fig 3 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these activities are beneficial under light stress, further supporting the idea that PhrR is a B12-dependent light-sensitive transcriptional regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we set out to more fully characterize the B12-dependency, light regulation, and regulatory role of PhrR in Halomonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reconstruction_of_PhrR_Regulons_in_Halomonas_and_Other_Gammaproteobacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthologs of phrR were identified in all 20 Halomonas species with sequenced genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most of these genomes, phrR is clustered on the chromosome with the photolyase gene phr, suggesting it is a primary target gene for PhrR-dependent transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the PhrR regulons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A conserved 21-bp palindrome was identified as a candidate PhrR-binding motif (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed PhrR regulons in the Halomonas genomes include several genes involved in light-dependent processes, such as DNA photolyases (phr, phr2), a blue light- and temperature-regulated antirepressor (bluF), the photoactive yellow protein (pyp), three folate biosynthesis genes (folE, folK, folM), two methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (mcp1, mcp2), one ubiquinone biosynthetic gene (ubiB), and several hypothetical enzymes and uncharacterized proteins (Fig 3B; for detailed list of binding sites detected and domains and their putative functional roles, see Datasets S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparative analysis of upstream gene regions in multiple Halomonas genomes (Fig S3) suggests that PhrR likely functions as a repressor of its target genes, similarly to LitR and CarH (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthologs of phrR were also identified in several species that belong to other lineages of Gammaproteobacteria, where they are also colocated with phr (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying a similar bioinformatics approach, we identified DNA binding site motifs for these PhrR orthologs (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most of the genomes, the reconstructed PhrR regulons control from one to four candidate operons (Datasets S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in contrast with Halomonas spp., which possess up to 14 candidate PhrR-controlled operons per genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Analysis_of_PhrR_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PhrR proteins from Halomonas species are distantly related to the B12-dependent repressors CarH from M. xanthus and LitR from T. thermophilus and B. megaterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LitR and CarH regulators are characterized by three Pfam domains: PF13411 (MerR HTH), PF02607 (B12-binding-2), and PF02310 (B12-binding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PhrR proteins have highly conserved DNA binding domains from the MerR family, and their C-terminal domains are very weakly similar to those in LitR/CarH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the B12-binding domains in the T. thermophilus LitR regulator was recently solved in complex with B12 (PDB ID code 3WHP) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the structure-based multiple alignment of the PhrR and LitR/CarH proteins to check the conservation of B12-binding residues in their C-terminal domains (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the proteins seem to be structurally similar, the potential B12-binding residues are not conserved in PhrR regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histidine residue located in the beginning of the PF02310 domain, which was found to be functionally important in the previous studies of LitR and CarH proteins, is not conserved in any of the studied PhrR proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the identified PhrR proteins in Gammaproteobacteria are characterized by highly diverged B12-binding domains (often not detectable by Pfam search) that use a different pattern of residues for interaction with B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future structure-functional studies will be required to identify these functionally important residues in the PhrR family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_PhrR-_and_LitR-Binding_DNA_Motifs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predicted lineage-specific PhrR-binding motifs demonstrated significant conservation across the analyzed taxonomic groups of Gammaproteobacteria (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved consensus of palindromic PhrR motifs is TRTACAa-(flexible linker)-tTGTAYA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the length of internal linker between two conserved half-sites in PhrR motifs showed a remarkable flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PhrR half-sites are separated by 3 bp in the Halomonadaceae, Chromatiales/Thiotrichales, 9 bp in Vibrionales and Marinomonas spp., 10 bp in Pseudomonadales, and 11 bp in Aeromonas and Shewanella spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the consensus half-site DNA motifs of PhrRs are similar to the experimentally determined DNA sites of the LitR regulators from B. megaterium and T. thermophilus (Fig S4), however, the linkers between half-sites in the latter operators are 14 bp in length (30, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity between half-site DNA motifs of PhrR operators correlates with high conservation of DNA-binding domains in PhrR and LitR (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Analysis_of_PhrR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the computationally predicted DNA-binding motif of PhrR, we heterologously expressed and purified the PhrR protein from Halomonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombinant PhrR protein exists partially as a dimer in solution (Fig S6), supporting the hypothesis that the PhrR dimer binds to its cognate palindromic DNA motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional spectrometry of the monomer fraction of PhrR incubated with fourfold molar excess of vitamin B12, a prospective ligand of PhrR, demonstrated specific ligand binding to the protein (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interaction of the purified PhrR protein with its cognate DNA motif was assessed using a fluorescence polarization assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that PhrR specifically binds to the synthetic DNA fragment containing the consensus PhrR-binding site, TTGTACAAtttTTGTACAA (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) value for the apo-PhrR protein interacting with the tested DNA fragment was 77 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of potential ligands, CNB12 (2 µM) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoB12, 4 µM), improved the PhrRDNA complex formation, resulting in decreased Kd values, 57 ± 9 nM and 25 ± 8 nM, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titration of the effect of B12-ABP and CNB12 on the interaction between PhrR (20 nM) and the DNA fragment revealed the apparent Kd values 4 ± 0.8 M and 0.4 ± 0.2 M for B12-ABP and CNB12, respectively (Fig 4B), demonstrating that the probe binds B12-dependent proteins akin to native vitamin B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further tested the effect of illumination on the interaction of AdoB12-PhrR with DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dark-incubated AdoB12-PhrR protein demonstrated specific binding to the consensus DNA motif, whereas illumination with white light for 5 min results in failure of PhrR to bind to the same DNA fragment (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the interaction of AdoB12-PhrR with six DNA fragments containing the predicted PhrR operators in Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tested DNA fragments demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase of fluorescence polarization, confirming specific interaction between the regulator and DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a negative control, we assessed the binding of PhrR with a DNA fragment containing a TrpR-binding site in Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent Kd values for the PhrR protein interacting with two high-scored PhrR binding sites from candidate promoter regions of the CY41DRAFT_3441 and CY41DRAFT_2637 genes were in the range of 3040 nM, whereas the low-scored PhrR sites found upstream of the pyp, phrR, folK/M, and folE genes have showed the apparent Kd values 60 ± 10 nM, 77 ± 36 nM, 103 ± 30 nM, and 16 ± 6 nM, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, further confirming the interaction between B12 and PhrR, B12-ABP labeling of purified PhrR is inhibited by addition of CNB12 (Fig S2 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

New_Mode_of_Light-Dependent_Global_Gene_Regulation_Controlling_Fatty_Acid_and_Folate_Biosynthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The comparative analysis of upstream promoter sequences in multiple Halomonas genomes (Fig S4) suggests that PhrR functions as a repressor of its target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the PhrR regulon genes are predicted to be de-repressed after exposure to light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this bioinformatics prediction, we evaluated the gene-expression pattern of selected genes from the PhrR regulon by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression profiles of three folate biosynthetic genes (folE, folK, and folM) from two different growth conditions (either constant light or dark) were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three genes tested showed up-regulation of expression when cells were grown in the light compared with those grown in the dark (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the regulation of PhrR is similar to the recently described CarH (7), in which B12 serves as a light sensor to modulate its activities, thus resulting in light-dependent gene regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further validate the unexpected linkage between B12 and folate biosynthesis, we measured the intracellular concentrations of folate and its derivatives in wild-type Halomonas and a deletion mutant that lacked phrR grown in light or dark conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, under light conditions wild-type Halomonas produced higher intracellular concentrations of tetrahydrofolate (THF) (Fig 5B and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light-responsive THF production was lost in the mutant and nearly all of the metabolite detected was THF, indicative of uncontrolled production of THF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our regulon analyses suggest that expression of a cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthase gene is controlled by PhrR (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this prediction, cellular levels of CFAs were measured in wild-type and mutant Halomonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that production of CFA in the wild-type was indeed higher during light growth (Fig 5C) and that the mutant produced significantly more CFA than the wild-type, regardless of the growth condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous to this study, vitamin B12 was recognized as a facilitator of enzyme function, a sensory component of transcriptional regulators that control functions required in light conditions, and an effector of riboswitches that repress protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our B12-ABP in a nonphotosynthetic organism, we validated that the probe captures proteins expected to interact with B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also discovered a transcriptional regulator, PhrR, which uses B12 as a light sensor and identified genes and processes that are under its control, including several that are not obviously linked to light stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also captured proteins with the B12-ABP not expected to bind B12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A remarkable overlap was revealed in processes that were under control of PhrR or captured by the B12-ABP; both were linked to ubiquinone biosynthesis, folate metabolism, and chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unprecedented connection between B12 and these processes suggest that B12 plays an even greater role in coordinating cellular metabolism than previously recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We speculate that our results reflect a role for B12 as an allosteric regulator in Halomonas, controlling metabolic flux between B12 and heme biosynthesis, biosynthesis of ubiquinone, interconversions between THF and 5meTHF, and metabolism of methionine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THF metabolites produced by enzymes bound by B12-ABP are used in the biosynthesis of purines, DNA, CoA, and serine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control of these enzymes would consequently have significant impact on host metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous genomic analysis of Halomonas HL-48 revealed that it only requires B12 as a cofactor for ethanolamine biosynthetic genes and riboswitch control of the B12 salvage system, thus making it surprising that it can synthesize such an energetically costly metabolite (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional use of B12 to control key metabolic processes could potentially justify the cost of making it and provide a means for this nonphototrophic organism to modulate its metabolism according to day/night cycles, like the cyanobacteria with which they coexist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings weave an intricate web of B12 regulation on metabolism within Halomonas, and points to a fundamental requirement for B12 in cell metabolism, regulation, and protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As key research questions emerge from host-associated and environmental microbiomes, we believe our approach and results suggest that B12 may be critical for coordination of individual microbe and community metabolism, and organismal interdependencies for B12 may be pertinent to microbiome organization, stability, and overall function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that these roles for B12 may be generalizable in myriad communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

B12-ABP_Binding_Assays_with_Transcobalamin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcobalamin (human transcobalamin 2, ACRO Biosystems), a known B12-binding protein, was used to demonstrate probe selectivity and confirm that the probe and native B12 bind at the same site on transcobalamin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcobalamin (10 µM) in PBS was labeled with B12-ABP (in DMSO) at 37 °C for 1 h, and UV-irradiated on ice at 365 nm immediately following probe labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For inhibition studies, transcobalamin (10 µM) in PBS was incubated with native CNB12 (10 or 20 µM) for 10 min, followed by addition of B12-ABP (10 µM) for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then UV-irradiated on ice at 365 nm for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize protein labeling and CNB12 competition by SDS/PAGE, we first incorporated tetramethylrhodamine onto the probe via click chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Azido-tetramethylrhodamine fluorophore (2.65 µM) was added to probe-labeled protein solutions followed by the addition of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; (22 µM), TBTA (Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-traizol-4-yl)methyl])amine) in a 4:1 solution t-butanol:DMSO (44.8 µM), copper sulfate (45 µM), and proteins were separated using 10% (wt/vol) Tris-Glycine SDS/PAGE gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Protein Simple FluorchemQ system (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To further evaluate selectivity of the purified proteins PhrR, MetE, MetH, and FolD (each at 2 M), proteins were labeled with B12-ABP (2 M) and competed with excess native CNB12 (10×, 25×, and 50× the B12-ABP concentration) for 30 min at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following labeling, UV irradiation, click chemistry, and gel electrophoresis were performed as described for the transcobalamin-labeling experiment (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Materials and Methods for additional experimental details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Binding_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interaction of the purified recombinant PhrR protein with its cognate DNA binding sites in Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 was assessed using a fluorescence polarization assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 29-bp DNA fragment containing the predicted consensus DNA binding motif of PhrR and 33-bp DNA fragments of promoter regions of three PhrR target genes from Halomonas sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HL-48 (Fig 4) were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments were obtained by annealing synthesized complementary oligonucleotides at a 1:10 ratio of 5-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein to unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 29-bp DNA fragment containing candidate site of TrpR repressor upstream of the trpR gene was used as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labeled dsDNA fragments were incubated at 24 °C with the increasing concentrations of the purified PhrR protein (5300 nM) in a 100-µL reaction mixture in 96-well black plates (VWR) for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding buffer contained 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herring sperm DNA (1 g) was added to the reaction mixture as a nonspecific competitor DNA to suppress nonspecific binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence-labeled DNA was detected with the FLA-5100 fluorescent image analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of adenosylcobalamin (AdoB12) and cyanocobalamin (CNB12) was tested by their addition to the incubation mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of light was tested by incubation of 3 M PhrR with 66 µM AdoB12 in the dark or under white light conditions for 5 min followed by fluorescence polarization assay testing of the PhrRDNA specific interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PhrR-AdoB12 mixture was illuminated by a white lamp in transilluminator (115 V, 0.37 Amp) in a 96-well transparent plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_Reconstruction_of_PhrR_Regulons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthologs of phrR (e.g., HELO_1271 in Halomonas elongata) were identified in all 17 Halomonas species with sequenced genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the integrative comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the PhrR regulons in the genomes of Halomonas species (as implemented in the RegPredict Web server, regpredict.lbl.gov) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach combines identification of candidate regulator binding sites with cross-genomic comparison of regulons and with functional context analysis of candidate target genes (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upstream regions of all phrR-containing operons from 17 Halomonas species, as well as from three other representatives of the Halomonadaceae family, were analyzed using a DNA motif recognition program (the Discover Profile procedure implemented in RegPredict) to identify the conserved PhrR-binding DNA motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identified PhrR motif is a 21-bp palindrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After construction of a positional-weight matrix for PhrR motif, we searched for additional PhrR-binding sites in the analyzed Halomonas genomes and performed a consistency check or cross-species comparison of the predicted PhrR regulons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most conserved regulatory sites confirmed by phylogenetic footprinting approach (Fig S4) were added to rebuild the positional weight matrix for PhrR sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores of candidate sites were calculated as the sum of positional nucleotide weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The score threshold was defined as the lowest score observed in the training set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further genomic scans using the improved PhrR motif matrix resulted in final reconstruction of PhrR regulons in the Halomonadaceae spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthologs of PhrR proteins from Halomonas spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were identified by BLAST searches against the nonredundant set of sequenced bacterial genomes and were further checked for their genomic context using the IMG database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PhrR orthologs were identified in several lineages of Gammaproteobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, the phrR orthologs are located in the vicinity of the phr or phrB genes encoding DNA photolyases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis of the PhrR-like proteins detected major groups of genomes encoding closely related PhrRs and provided a basis for PhrR binding site identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each group, we collected training sets of upstream DNA regions from the phrR-containing loci, identified conserved PhrR binding motifs, constructed a positional weight matrix, and searched for additional PhrR-binding sites in the genomes analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-species comparisons of the predicted sets of potentially regulated genes allowed us to tentatively define regulon composition for each analyzed lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the reconstructed PhrR regulon are captured and displayed in RegPrecise, a specialized database of bacterial regulons (regprecise.lbl.gov) (39), as a part of the PhrR collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

phrR_Mutant_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A markerless in-frame phrR deletion mutant of Halomonas HL-48 was constructed by crossover-PCR, as described previously (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 500-bp DNA fragments encoding sequence flanking phrR were generated by PCR using primer pairs (upstream 5-CAAACCCGGGCGCGAGCATCAGCCCGAAAGCC-3 and 5-GCGACGGTGTCCATTAGTGGCGGGCGCCAGTGCCTCTTAGTTG-3; downstream 5-GCCACTAATGGACACCGTCGCCGCGGCGGTGCCTCTCTCTGAACCG-3 and 5-GTGTCCCGGGAGCAAAGGCCACGGCGTCGTGG-3), joined by overlapping extension PCR, and then cloned into plasmid pDS3.0 SmaI site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli WM3064 was used for mating with HL-48 and primers that flanked the region targeted for deletion were used to identify desired mutants (5-ATGACAGCAGCACAGACGTCGTCGC-3 and 5-CTAGGTGGACAGCGCCTTGAAGGC-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CFA_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frozen Halomonas cell pellets were dried under vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 500 L of 1.25 M HCl in methanol was added and the mixture incubated at 100 °C for 2 h to release free-fatty acids and convert them into fatty-acid methyl esters (FAMEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 500 L of hexane was added to extract FAMEs, followed by addition of 500 L water to the methanol layer to facilitate separation and extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifuging for 5 min, the hexane layer collected and analyzed by GC-MS. For FAME data processing, peaks were matched and identified with two commercial databases, the NIST14 GC-MS library and Wiley GC-MS FAME Database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of FAME chemical standards (Sigma-Aldrich, C8-C28) was analyzed before sample analysis, and their retention time information was used to correct the retention time of FAME peaks in samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Proteins MetE, the B12-binding domain of MetH, PhrR, and FolD were recombinantly expressed and purified, then the proteins (2 M in PBS buffer) were labeled with B12-ABP (2 M) for 30 min at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, competition experiments were performed by carrying out protein labeling with the probe with simultaneous addition of excess CNB12 (10×, 25×, and 50× concentrations versus the B12-ABP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the 30-min incubation, the samples were UV-irradiated for 10 min at 365 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Azido-tetramethylrhodamine fluorophore (2.65 µM) was added to probe-labeled protein solutions followed by the addition of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (22 µM), TBTA (Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-traizol-4-yl)methyl])amine) in a 4:1 solution t-butanol:DMSO (44.8 µM), copper sulfate (45 µM), and proteins were separated using 10% (wt/vol) Tris-glycine SDS/PAGE gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Protein Simple FluorchemQ system; the results are shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For HL-48, proteins were labeled as described in the methods, and for CNB12 competition studies simultaneous addition of excess CNB12 (50× concentrations vs. the B12-ABP) was performed before UV irradiation and click chemistry to azido-biotin (see concentrations for click chemistry reagents listed just above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and Methods for additional details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analytical_Processing_of_LC-MS_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resulting MS/MS spectra from LC-MS analyses were searched using the MSGF+ algorithm against protein sequenced deduced from the Halomonas HL-48 genome sequence (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed our chemoproteomics data by tag-free quantitative accurate mass and time (AMT) tag proteomics and spectral counting, as described previously (22), with the following modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identified peptides of at least six amino acids in length having MS-GF score 1E-10, which corresponds to an estimated false-discovery rate (FDR) less_than 1% at the peptide level, were used to generate an AMT tag database (these same high-confidence peptides were used for spectral counting, in which observations of one or more peptides for a given protein are tabulated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For AMT tag analyses, MS spectra were deisotoped using the software tool Decon2LS, after which mass and elution time features were identified and matched with VIPER to peptides stored in the Cyanothece 51142 AMT tag database within mass measurement accuracy and elution time accuracy cut-offs of less_than2 ppm and less_than2%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured arbitrary abundance for a particular peptide was determined by integrating the area under each LC-MS peak for the detected feature matching to that peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matched features from each MS dataset were then filtered on an FDR of less than or equal to 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative peptide abundance measurements in replicate samples were scaled and normalized to the dataset with the least information using linear regression in DAnTE (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized peptide abundance values were then rolled up to proteins using RRollup; a minimum of five peptides was required for the Grubb's test, with a P value cut-off of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only peptides unique in identifying a single protein were used to estimate protein abundances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, proteins represented by two unique peptides were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm a protein as probe-labeled, we required the following: (i) the average of probe-labeled spectral counts must be two; (ii) a t test calculated between probe-labeled and no probe controls (DMSO addition only) was generated for both spectral counting and AMT tag data, in which we required that a t test value of  0.05 for either spectral counting or AMT tag; and (iii) the AMT tag values for B12-ABP labeling must be 1.5× (fold-change) the CNB12 competition experiment values, and a t test calculated between probe-labeled and CNB12 competition samples must be 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All AMT tag values shown in Dataset S1 are in log2; thereby, the fold-change measurements are calculated as = 2(probe value  control value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 41 proteins passing these criteria are shown in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solvents used for LC-MS analysis were of HPLC-grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction buffer was prepared by dissolving 2% sodium ascorbate (wt/vol) and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (vol/vol) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Folate conjugate was prepared as follows: Halomonas lysate (5 mL) was dialyzed by using 10K dialysis membrane and 500 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buffer was changed three times and dialysis was perform at 4 °C with stirring for 60 min for each time of buffer change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dialyzed sample was frozen and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sample preparation procedure for folate analysis was adopted with slight modifications, as previously described (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 50-mL cell culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was removed and 4 mL of extraction buffer was added to the centrifuge tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tube was then flushed with CO2 gas for 15 s and vortexed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter the centrifuge tube was placed in a boiling water bath for 12 min for extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tube was rapidly cooled on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supernatant was then transferred to another centrifuge tube and 50 µL dialyzed rat serum was added to per 1 mL of the cell extract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deconjugation was performed by flushing the centrifuge tube with carbon dioxide gas for 15 s and incubated in a thermomixer at 37 °C for 3 h. The tube was then boiled in a water bath for 5 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was collected, spiked with internal standard, filled to an exact volume of 5 mL, and then analyzed by LC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a custom-built capillary LC system (45) coupled with a Finnigan TSQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A C18 microsolid phase extraction column was installed on-line before a C18 reversed-phase capillary column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capillary column was connected to an in-house manufactured nanoESI emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-hundred angstrom C18 particles with 5-µm particle size (Phenomenex) packed in a 4 cm × 150 µm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies) was used as online micro-SPE for sample concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reversed-phase capillary column was made by slurry packing 5-µm Jupiter C18 bonded particles (Phenomenex) in a 35 cm × 150 µm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fused silica capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solvents used included 0.1% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile (mobile phase B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before LC gradient started, 5-µL samples were loaded onto micro-SPE column at 5 µL/min for 10 min with 2% B. LC separation was performed with a binary gradient of 295% B in 30 min and at 95% B for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rate through the column was 300 nL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESI was performed in the positive ion mode with the major MS parameters as follows: spray voltage, 2.4 kV; capillary temperature, 310 °C; scan width, 1.0 m/z; scan time 20 ms. All cell-culture samples were prepared and analyzed in three biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of folates was accomplished in selected reaction monitoring mode by using the quantification ion and confirmed by using confirmation ions (Dataset S4) with internal standard calibration (R2  greater than  0.99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xcalibur 2.2 software with a Genesis Peak Detection Algorithm was used for data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
