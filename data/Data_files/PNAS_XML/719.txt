Experimental evolution reveals an effective avenue to release catabolite repression via mutations in XylR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable feedstock for microbial production of fuels and chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D-glucose and D-xylose are the most abundant sugars in lignocellulosic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Economically feasible bioconversion of lignocellulose requires simultaneous utilization of both sugars, which is primarily prevented by carbon catabolite repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we characterize the genetic basis of three independent laboratory evolution trajectories for improved xylose fermentation and reveal an effective way to release carbon catabolite repression in Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microbial production of fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass provides promising biorenewable alternatives to the conventional petroleum-based products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heterogeneous sugar composition of lignocellulosic biomass hinders efficient microbial conversion due to carbon catabolite repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most abundant sugar monomers in lignocellulosic biomass materials are glucose and xylose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although industrial Escherichia coli strains efficiently use glucose, their ability to use xylose is often repressed in the presence of glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we independently evolved three E. coli strains from the same ancestor to achieve high efficiency for xylose fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each evolved strain has a point mutation in a transcriptional activator for xylose catabolic operons, either CRP or XylR, and these mutations are demonstrated to enhance xylose fermentation by allelic replacements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identified XylR variants (R121C and P363S) have a higher affinity to their DNA binding sites, leading to a xylose catabolic activation independent of catabolite repression control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon introducing these amino acid substitutions into the E. coli D-lactate producer TG114, 94% of a glucosexylose mixture (50 gL1 each) was used in mineral salt media that led to a 50% increase in product titer after 96 h of fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two amino acid substitutions in XylR enhance xylose utilization and release glucose-induced repression in different E. coli hosts, including wild type, suggesting its potential wide application in industrial E. coli biocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Identification_of_Primary_Genetic_Changes_of_E_coli_Adaptation_for_Improved_Xylose_Fermentation_to_D-Lactate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previously engineered D-lactateproducing E. coli strain XW043 significantly improved its xylose fermentation ability by laboratory adaptation, but the causative genetic mechanism remains elusive (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the absence of competing fermentation pathways in XW043, the evolutionary trajectories are likely strictly constrained to xyloselactate conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that characterization of repeated evolutionary trajectories would reveal the convergent causative mutations for this adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XW043 was evolved three times independently in mineral salt media containing 100 gL1 xylose (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial population was maintained at the exponential or early stationary phase in a fermentation vessel by serially transferring cultures into new media as previously described (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three evolutionary trajectories, a rapid adaptation occurred that simultaneously increased xylose catabolism, lactate titer, and cell growth (Fig 1B and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because lactate production is the only fermentation pathway supporting cell growth in XW043 under oxygen-limiting experimental conditions (20), increased xylose catabolism rates would lead to higher cell growth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of three evolution experiments, there was an approximately fivefold increase of lactate titers at 48 h compared with the ancestor strain XW043, accompanied with an increase in yield from 0.6 to 0.80.9 g lactate/1 g xylose (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the genetic changes responsible for the increased xylose catabolism, we sequenced the genomes of the ancestor XW043 and three representative evolved clones (one from each evolved population), designated as strains TL1, CM2, and LP2 using Illumina paired-end sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each clone was sequenced twice with an average 24-fold coverage per library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying a comprehensive analysis pipeline (details in SI Materials and Methods), overall 5 point mutations, a 1-bp deletion, 15 duplications, and 7 deletions in mostly uncharacterized genes were found in three evolved isolates compared with XW043 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we detected 60 breakpoints as an indicator for structural rearrangements occurring in all three evolved clones (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all of the mutations detected, three point mutations, one per clone, occurred at the transcriptional coactivators CRP and XylR that are critical for xylose catabolism (Fig 1A), suggesting a potential result of convergent evolution to relieve the predominant metabolic constraints in the ancestor strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three independently isolated point mutations result in amino acid changes in CRP (G141D in LP2) and XylR (R121C in CM2 and P363S in TL1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an IS10 insertion was identified in focA reading frame for all three evolved clones at different positions and orientations (Fig 1C and Fig S2A), thereby suggesting an independent origin for each insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Physiological_Effects_of_Convergent_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insertion of IS10 into focA is a common event for all three evolved isolates, suggesting that the loss of focA function may play a beneficial role for xylose to lactate conversion in XW043.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an in-frame deletion of focA in XW043 only showed a marginal positive effect on xylose fermentation (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, complementation of focA from a plasmid in all evolved strains did not restore the ancestral phenotype (Fig S2C), suggesting that the loss of focA function is not the main cause for improved xylose fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pflB gene is located downstream to focA, and IS10 insertion into focA may interfere with the complex promoter system for pflB that ranges from the upstream region of focA to the upstream region of pflB (22) (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the transcript levels of pflB in all evolved strains were lower than that of the ancestor as shown by qRT-PCR (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced expression of pflB from a plasmid in all evolved strains restored the ancestral phenotype at a large degree with only less than 25 gL1 lactate produced at 96 h (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complementation result indicates that the decreased pflB expression is beneficial for fermentative lactate production that is also extensively supported by previous work (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested if the missense mutations in crp and xylR have a beneficial effect on xylose fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacement of the wild-type copy crp of XW043 with the mutated form (G141D) in the chromosome doubled both xylose utilization and D-lactate titer after 96 h fermentation, and growth rate and final biomass were also increased (Fig 2A and Fig S3), thereby confirming the positive role for this mutation to improve xylose fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 32-kb chromosomal region containing xylR and other xylose catabolic genes is duplicated in both XW043 and all evolved strains as indicated by genome sequencing (Fig S4) probably because the precursor strain of XW043 was adapted for using hemicellulose hydrolysates as the carbon source (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one of the two xylR copies was mutated (R121C in CM2 and P363S in TL1), thereby conferring a quasi-heterozygous genotype (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were not able to replace xylR with its mutant alleles in XW043 using a -red recombinase-mediated two-step method (26) presumably because the second copy of wild-type xylR tended to replace the selection marker due to a favored intrachromosomal recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, using a -red recombinase-mediated intrachromosomal recombination approach (details in SI Materials and Methods), we successfully replaced the xylR mutations with a wild-type copy in both CM2 and TL1 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoration of the wild-type allele decreased xylose utilization rates of the initial 24 h by 40% and 65% compared with CM2 and TL1, respectively (Fig 2 B and C), indicating a positive effect of these xylR mutations on xylose fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the modified strains had decreased lactate production and cell growth rates (Fig 2 B and C and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoring wild-type xylR did not produce a complete ancestral phenotype, suggesting the presence of a potential synergy effect between beneficial mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further restored both wild-type focA and xylR in evolved background TL1 to reconstruct an ancestral phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this strain (CS4: TL1 xylR wt/wt, focA wt) performed even worse than XW043 (Fig 2C), indicating that both the xylR mutation and focA IS10 insertion are primary causative mutations with a synergy effect and that there are also further mutations epistatically interacting with the described mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if the identified xylR mutations have a universal effect and if the heterozygous xylR copies are required to improve xylose utilization, we substituted wild-type xylR with its mutant version (R121C, P363S, or both) in wild-type E. coli W (ATCC 9637) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mutants increased xylose utilization and cellular fermentative growth to different degrees (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xylose utilization rates were increased 2.4- and 4.3-fold compared with the wild-type strain within the initial 24 h for xylR R121C and P363S substitutions, respectively (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next combined both xylR mutations in a wild-type strain and observed a slightly additive effect (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of 96 h fermentation, 40 gL1 xylose remained unused in the broth for the wild-type strain, whereas only 10 gL1 remained for xylR P363S substitution or xylR R121C and P363S substitution (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

XylR_Variants_Show_Enhanced_Activity_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CRP G141D was previously identified as a mutant with an altered allosteric mechanism, and position 141 is involved in the interfacial interactions between subunits and domains (16, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially due to the CRP G141D mutation in the evolved strain LP2, the transcription of xylose catabolic genes was up-regulated by more than 10-fold as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike CRP and its mutant variants, which are well characterized, much less is known about XylR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the effects that xylR mutations potentially had on the transcriptional levels for its responsive genes, which are organized as two operons, xylAB and xylFGHR (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylAB and xylFGH transcripts were increased at least 20-fold in CM2 with xylR (wt/R121C) and 10-fold in TL1 with xylR (wt/P363S) compared with the ancestor strain XW043 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylR transcript alone shows only between 3.1- and 3.6-fold up-regulation, suggesting that the xylFGHR transcript is partially degraded at the 3 end or read-through of the RNA polymerase is prevented by clashing with proteins bound at the xylR-specific promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the crp transcript level is not significantly changed (Fig 3B), we concluded that the XylR mutations are the primary reason for up-regulation of the xyl operons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further study the molecular mechanism causing enhanced transcriptional activation by XylR variants, we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using three purified N-terminal His-tagged XylR variants (wild type, R121C, and P363S) and DNA fragments containing the binding sites IA and IF (upstream of and xylA and xylF, respectively) located in the intergenic region between xylAB and xylFGH (Fig 3A) (11, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation constant KD for each site was determined to measure their binding affinity (Fig 3 C and D and Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the gel-based assay allows for only a rough approximation, our data for the wild-type XylR are consistent with a previous report showing a KD of 33 ± 0.8 nM for IA and 25 ± 0.6 nM for IF, respectively (Fig 3D) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolved XylRs have a significantly lower KD, ranging from 3- to 14-fold depending on which binding site and variant (Fig 3D), suggesting that a higher binding affinity leads to a more stable transcription initiation complex and a subsequently higher transcriptional rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, wild-type XylR could not bind operator sequences in the absence of xylose, as the majority of DNA fragments remained unbound in the gel (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both XylR variants bound DNA even without xylose (Fig S6C), suggesting that these XylR variants have xylose-independent activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A twofold increase in binding of wild-type XylR to its responsive site was observed when 100 M xylose was added, but similar enhancement was much less significant for both XylR variants (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Amino_Acid_Substitutions_in_XylR_Release_CCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The higher binding affinity of the evolved XylR and the concomitant xylose independency led to the hypothesis that these amino acid substitutions in XylR are able to release CCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type E. coli W was used as the test strain for different genetic modifications to release CCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Batch fermentations were conducted using a mineral salt medium AM1 containing 100 gL1 of a glucosexylose mixture (50 gL1 each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type strain consumed all glucose but only 16% of the xylose after 96 h of fermentation (Fig 4A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the XylR variants R121C or P363S released CCR, and glucose and xylose were consumed simultaneously, eventually leading to 6169% of the xylose used (Fig 4A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LN6, the strain with both R121C and P363S substitutions, used 87 gL1 of the total sugars compared with 57 gL1 for wild type (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylose utilization rate was increased fourfold compared with wild type (81% of the xylose used after 96 h fermentation) and only 3 gL1 glucose remained unused in the fermentation broth (Fig 4A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRP G141D alone or together with xylR mutations did not enhance sugar coutilization (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigation of known mutations that relieve CCR such as mgsA (29) and crp* (I112L, T127I, and A144T) (30, 31) was also conducted in the same wild-type background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRP* only increased xylose utilization to 37% with impaired cell growth, whereas the mgsA deletion had no benefit in wild-type background (Fig 4A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two additional sugar compositions (the ratio of glucose to xylose is 1:2 or 2:1 by mass with the total sugar concentration at 100 gL1) were used to further compare the effect of crp* and xylR mutations on sugar coutilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylR mutations (R121C and P363S) yielded more total sugar utilization than crp* by 58% and 14% for these two conditions, respectively (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further demonstrate the application of our discovery in converting sugar mixtures into renewable chemicals, we substituted wild-type xylR with xylR (R121C and P363S) of a previously engineered D-lactate E. coli producer TG114, which efficiently converts glucose into D-lactate (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fermenting TG114 in a glucosexylose mixture, 50 gL1 of each sugar, showed that only 34% of the xylose was used due to CCR (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing R121C and P363S substitutions in xylR enabled the modified strain to use 88% of the xylose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the decreased glucose utilization caused by xylR mutations in wild-type background did not occur in TG114 background, and 50 gL1 glucose was completely fermented (Fig 4 and Fig S7) potentially due to the enhanced glucose fermentation ability of TG114 through a long-term adaptation (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, D-lactate production increased to 1.5-fold compared with TG114 with a final titer at 86 g L1 and a yield of 0.91 g g1 sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D-lactateproducing E. coli XW043 and TG114 (a derivative of E. coli W, ATCC9637) were kindly provided by Lonnie Ingrams laboratory at the University of Florida (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS5, LN4, LN5, LN6, LN8, LN24B, LN21, LN8C, and LN23C were genetically engineered in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PC05 containing CRP* was previously constructed (31) and generously provided by Patrick Cirino's laboratory at University of Houston, Houston.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmid pXW1 was constructed by inserting a native sequence (104 nucleotides after sacB ORF) containing a complete terminator sequence into a previously made plasmid, pLOI4162 (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sacB with its complete terminator serves as an effective counterselection marker for chromosomal engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original plasmid pLOI4162 containing the catsacB cassette was kindly provided by Lonnie Ingram's laboratory at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylR ORF and its variant genes were cloned between NdeI and BamHI sites in the pET-15b for expression and purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create pXylRwt (wild-type xylR cloned into pET-15b), the wild-type xylR was amplified from genomic DNA in the ancestral strain XW043 by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the BamHI site at the end of xylR ORF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pET-15b was digested with the NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and purified before ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified wild-type xylR PCR product was ligated into the BamHI site of pET-15b at 16 °C for 1 h using the Quick T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA ends were filled by the DNA Klenow fragment from Thermo Scientific by incubating for 15 min at room temperature and then at 16 °C for 3 h to self-ligate and create a complete plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This plasmid was then transformed into TOP10-competent E. coli cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing results showed that nine additional nucleotides accidentally were created at the cloning site downstream of the xylR start codon in the selected positive transformant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quick-change PCR was used to remove these additional nucleotides, and the sequence of xylR ORF was confirmed correctly by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, quick-change PCR was used to modify pXylRwt to create plasmids containing xylR variants pXylR R121C and pXylR P363S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers containing the desired mutation were used to amplify the plasmid DNA using the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase in 12 PCR cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removing the template plasmid DNA by DpnI (New England Biolabs) digestion, the newly synthesized DNA was transformed into TOP10 cells, and positive constructs were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloning strain TOP10 and pET-15b were kindly provided by David Nielsen's laboratory at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid pCA24N (empty vector) and its derivatives containing focA and pflB ORFs under an isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside (IPTG)inducible promoter were obtained from E. coli ASKA library, a complete plasmid set of E. coli ORF clones (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During strain construction, cultures were grown aerobically in shake flasks containing Luria broth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ampicillin (50 mgL1), kanamycin (50 mgL1), or chloramphenicol (40 mgL1) was added as appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fermentations were performed using AM1 mineral salt media supplemented with different carbon sources (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before fermentation, strains were streaked on AM1 agar plates with 2% xylose (wt/vol) from 80 °C glycerol stocks and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h in a container filled with argon gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells from plates were then grown in AM1 medium containing 2% xylose (wt/vol) buffered with 100 mM Mops in Erlenmeyer flasks as seed cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seed cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h before being harvested by centrifugation (5 min, 6,750 g, 4 °C) and used as a starting inoculum for batch fermentations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Batch fermentations were carried out in 500-mL fermentation vessels containing 300 mL AM1 media (100 gL1 xylose or varied sugar mixtures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial cell density was 0.022 mgdcwmL1, with an optical density (OD) value of 0.05 as measured by a Beckman DU730 spectrophotometer at 550 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fermentations were maintained at pH 7.0 by the automatic addition of 6 M KOH as previously described (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Batch fermentations of strains with plasmids from ASKA library were operated in a similar manner with 40 mgL1 chloramphenicol supplemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added 0.01 mM IPTG when fermentation was initiated to induce the expression of focA and pflB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose, xylose, and other organic acids in fermentation broth were measured by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad) and 4 mM sulfuric acid as the mobile phase (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Laboratory_Evolution_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strain XW043 was consecutively transferred into fresh media in the above mentioned fermentation vessels at 2448-h time periods for a total of 20 transfers (150 generations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 0.022 mgdcwmL1 (0.05 as OD550) and 0.0044 mgdcwmL1 (0.01 as OD550) as the starting cell densities for early transfers and late transfers (after the fifth transfer), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately every two transfers, a sample of the bacterial population was stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XW043 was evolved independently three times to improve its xylose utilization ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three or more independent clones were selected from each evolved population (the 20th transfer), and their fermentation performance was universally similar to that of the evolved populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One representative clone for each evolved population was selected for further genome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three clones are designated as TL1, CM2, and LP2 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Red recombinase technology was used to perform seamless chromosomal deletion, gene replacement, and intrachromosomal recombination as previously described (26, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA fragments used for the catsacB integration were obtained by PCR using pXW1 as template and primers containing 50 bp or longer homologous sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA fragments used for the second step integration containing homologous regions (500 bp flanking sequence on each side) and point mutations or gene clean deletions were assembled by fusion PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To replace xylR mutant allele with wild-type copy in evolved strains using intrachromosomal recombination, we first identified the integrated strain with xylR mutant allele replaced by catsacB cassette by colony PCR and Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the catsacB cassette of this strain was replaced intrachromosomally by wild-type allele with the aid of -red recombinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During strain constructions, 5% (wt/vol) arabinose and 10% (wt/vol) sucrose were used for -red recombinase induction and counterselection of sacB negative strains, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive clones from genetic manipulation were verified by colony PCR and Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genome_Sequencing__Assembly__and_Identification_of_de_Novo_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA from strains XW043, TL1, LP2, and CM2 was extracted and purified using the Promega Wizard genomic DNA purification kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracted DNA was sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer by the DNASU Next Generation Sequencing Core at Arizona State University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was fragmented to an average size of 500 bp, and adapter-ligated fragments were sequenced in both directions with coverage of at least 20×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each strain was sequenced twice to minimize technical errors, and all sequencing reads were deposited in NCBI (SRA accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SRP083931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SNP identification, the best practices work flow for variant detection developed by the Broad Institute was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the reads were mapped with Bowtie2 against the closest relative with a sequenced genome, LY180 ( accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CP006584).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplicate reads were marked using Picard Tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment was adjusted using GATKs function for indel realignment and base recalibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the latter, the realignment was also analyzed with the mpileup function of SAMtools to call a set of putative variants that was then used to recalibrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this final alignment, the raw variants were called using the UnifiedGenotyper from GATK and annotated using SnpEff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger duplications or deletions were identified by analyzing the read coverage with a sliding window approach using CNVnator and a bin size of 50 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other types of structural rearrangement were identified using a de novo assembly approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembled contigs by Velvet were combined using MAUVE and compared against the ancestral data using MUMmer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variants were filtered using SnpSift for occurrence in both sequencing duplicates and absence in the ancestral strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural variants from de novo assembly were only called if present in all three parallel evolved strains to reduce the false-positive rate and to identify only the most significant changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Real-Time_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNAs from 0.22 mgdcw (5 × 108 cells) were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were broken in the lysis buffer from the extraction kit using a FastPrep-24 disrupter (MP Biomedicals) with maximum speed twice (1 min for each time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optional on-column DNase treatment was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated RNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reverse transcription, the Maxima Reverse Transcriptase from Thermo Scientific was used, and 500 ng total RNA was primed with random hexamer oligonucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 2 L of a 1:20 cDNA dilution in subsequent real-time PCRs conducted with the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix from Thermo Scientific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative transcript levels were determined using the comparative CT method (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were normalized with the level of 16S ribosomal RNA (rrsA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unpaired Students t test indicates significance at P less_than 0.05 (*) with n = 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the small test amount, the significance level was not corrected for multiple testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All kits and enzymes were used according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the pET-15b derived constructs for overexpression and purification of His-tagged XylR proteins as previously described with minor modifications (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown in 50 mL Luria broth at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG when the culture density reached 0.27 g(dcw)L1 at 15 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubating for 16 h, all cells were harvested (6,750 g for 5 min, 4 °C), washed, and resuspended in 1 mL cold lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were lysed using a FastPrep-24 disrupter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After clarification at 30,000 g (30 min, 4 °C), supernatants were mixed and incubated with 250 L Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ni-NTA agarose containing His-tagged XylR proteins were loaded onto a column, washed with wash buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole), and eluted with elution buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD-10 Desalting Column (GE Health Life Sciences) was used for buffer exchange and imidazole removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XylR proteins were eluted in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl and were quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single band was observed in a SDSpolyacrylamide gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMSA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We amplified 200-bp DNA fragments containing one XylR binding site (IA and IF) using E. coli XW043 genomic DNA as a template by PCR and purified them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMSA was performed as previously described (41) with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10-L reaction mixture (75 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mgmL1 BSA) contained 1.5 nM DNA fragments, 2 mM xylose, and varied concentrations of XylR variants ranging from 0 to 400 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effect of xylose concentrations on DNA binding (IA site used as a representative), the concentration of XylR and its variants were fixed to 100 nM, and xylose concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 M were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, Orange DNA Loading Dye from Thermo Scientific was added to the reaction mixture to a final 0.5-fold concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound and unbound DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis using a native polyacrylamide gel (Mini-PROTEANTGX Precast Gel from Bio-Rad) at 5 Vcm1 for 3 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were stained with 40 gmL1 ethidium bromide and destained with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pixel densities were determined with ImageJ and fitted to the nonlinear regression model using R:B=Bmax[XylR]KD+[XylR]with B as the fraction of bound DNA, Bmax as the maximum fraction of bound DNA, and KD as the dissociation constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the primary genetic changes of the adaptation for xylose utilization in an E. coli D-lactate producer and found a way to effectively release CCR in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the strong selective pressure and short adaptation time, the convergent mutation patterns occurred in three parallel evolved populations (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the convergent mutations in crp and xylR identified in this work, previous research using similar experimental evolutionary approaches showed that beneficial mutations for enhanced xylose fermentations in E. coli biocatalysts occurred at sugar transporter genes, such as galP and gatC (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that there are potentially multiple evolutionary solutions for the same problem, and bacterial genotypic backgrounds may predetermine evolutionary trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current high-throughput next-generation sequencing capacity has significantly outpaced reverse engineering processes to characterize the causative mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One time-consuming bottleneck is to distinguish the causative mutations from mutational noise and sequencing errors (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, two strategies were used to effectively identify most critical mutations for the adapted phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, study of multiple independent evolutionary trajectories from the same ancestor facilitated the process of searching for important convergent mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, as sequencing technical errors were excluded by sequencing each genome twice with high coverage, linkage disequilibrium is probably the only source of noise, which we further reduced by focusing on only an individual evolved clone instead of the whole bacterial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified a G141D substitution in CRP enhancing transcription of xyl operons in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation was previously reported to alter allosteric regulation (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Position 141 is part of a hinge important for the intramolecular transduction of the activation signal (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRP G141D did not release CCR (Fig 4A), suggesting that this variant remains to be responsive to cAMP, which is consistent with other previously reported mutations at this position (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that a polar residue Asp at position 141 orients the DNA binding domain for a better interaction with operator sequences, resulting in an increased expression compared with wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, an intrinsically active CRP homolog of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris has an Asp residue at the corresponding position to G141 of E. coli CRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substitution of this Asp residue with the nonpolar residue Ala reduces the binding affinity to its promoter by 12-fold (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to CRP G141D, the identified XylR variants not only enhance xylose utilization but also release CCR, leading to an efficient coutilization of glucosexylose mixtures (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AraC-type transcription factor XylR has two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs, and its N-terminal ligand binding domain contains a unique periplasmic-binding protein fold that is structurally related to LacI/GalR transcription factors (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon xylose binding, XylR undergoes a conformational change orienting the two HTH motifs of the DNA binding domain in an active conformation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one instance, a Pro residue of XylR was substituted with Ser (P363S) at the site that connects the two HTH motifs, likely causing a significant reorientation and tighter binding to the DNA (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second variant is a R121C substitution, which is neither in close proximity to the DNA nor in close proximity to the ligand binding domain (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region is also not known to participate in signal communication from the N-terminal ligand binding to the C-terminal DNA binding domain (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effect on the binding affinity is similarly increased in both variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible mode of action might be an interaction of residue 121 with Thr185, which is directly connected to a helix motif that promotes dimerization of XylR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cys is less bulky than Arg, which might stabilize dimerization due to a reduced steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CCR in E. coli can be dramatically released simply by amino acid substitution in XylR as demonstrated here (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likely mechanism is that the enhanced binding of XylR variants to the operator sequences between xylAB and xylFGH operons enables independency from both CRP and xylose, thereby resulting in the observed sugar coutilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple genetic engineering approaches have previously been developed to release CCR in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of mgsA significantly enhanced sugar coutilization in an ethanologenic E. coli (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, glucose-induced repression is still severe in two tested strains with inactivated mgsA, LN24B (E. coli W mgsA) and TG114 (mgsA is deleted to prevent product impurity) (Fig 4), suggesting its limited application in a broad range of E. coli catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several cAMP-independent CRP mutants were discovered to release CCR to some extent (16, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But cell growth is often stunted by crp mutations, and sugar coutilization is not efficient, which was also observed in this work (Fig 4A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of the PTS system (deletion of ptsG or ptsI) is an effective approach to release CCR, but glucose uptake is significantly impaired and needs to be reengineered for glucose utilization, which involves extra genetic modifications or adaptation (7, 13, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this approach does not enhance the native xylose catabolism of E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, by simply substituting two residues in XylR of an established D-lactate producer, this modified strain is able to simultaneously ferment 50 gL1 glucose and 43 gL1 xylose and produce 86 gL1 lactate within 96 h in a mineral salt medium (Fig 4B), which shows advantages compared with previously engineered strains for lactate fermentative production using sugar mixtures in terms of the xylose utilization rate, lactate yield, and titer under a similar batch fermentation condition (14, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetic approach may be effective for other E. coli biocatalysts, as these XylR variants have a positive effect in a wild-type strain (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these XylR variants may also reduce arabinose-induced repression, which is caused by a competitive binding of AraC (activated by D-arabinose) to the regulatory regions of xyl operons (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced binding of these XylR variants to the operator sequences will potentially compete against AraC and achieve coutilization of arabinose and xylose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
