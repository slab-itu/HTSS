Measuring and modeling diffuse scattering in protein X-ray crystallography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural details of protein motions are critical to understanding many biological processes, but they are often hidden to conventional biophysical techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffuse X-ray scattering can reveal details of the correlated movements between atoms; however, the data collection historically has required extra effort and dedicated experimental protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have measured 3D diffuse intensities in X-ray diffraction from CypA and trypsin crystals using standard crystallographic data collection techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the resulting data is consistent with the protein motions resembling diffusion in a liquid or vibrations of a soft solid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that using diffuse scattering to model protein motions can become a component of routine crystallographic analysis through the extension of commonplace methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
X-ray diffraction has the potential to provide rich information about the structural dynamics of macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations, must be measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce because of the extra effort of collecting diffuse data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present 3D measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested translationlibrationscrew (TLS), liquid-like motions (LLM), and coarse-grained normal-modes (NM) models of protein motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and was refined against the diffuse data, whereas the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that dynamics-inspired NM structural models can simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Diffuse_Data_Show_Crystallographic_Symmetry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained nearly complete 3D anisotropic diffuse datasets D for CypA and trypsin using a PAD detector with synchrotron radiation (Methods, Fig 1, and SI Appendix, Fig S1), and used the Friedel and Laue group symmetry to quantify the level of crystallographic symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We averaged intensities between Friedel pairs to create a symmetrized map DF and calculated the linear correlation CCF between D and DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CypA and trypsin, CCF = 0.90 and 0.95, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We averaged P222-related reflections (corresponding to the P212121 space group of both CypA and trypsin) to produce the Laue symmetrized intensities, DL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear correlation CCL was then computed between D and DF, yielding CCL = 0.70 for CypA and CCL = 0.69 for trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations indicate the experimental diffuse intensity follows the Bragg peak symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TLS_Models_Yield_Low_Correlation_with_Diffuse_Scattering_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate how well TLS models agree with the molecular motions in the CypA crystal, we compared the experimental diffuse data to intensities calculated from three alternative TLS models: Phenix, TLSMD, and whole-molecule (SI Appendix, Fig S2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all three models predict different motions, the R factors are very similar: R,R-free = 16.4%, 18.1% for the whole-molecule and Phenix models; and 16.2%, 18.1% for the TLSMD model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlations between the calculated diffuse intensity for these models and the anisotropic experimental data are low: 0.03 for the phenix model; 0.04 for the TLSMD model; and 0.14 for the whole-molecule model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the pairwise correlations of the calculated diffuse intensities are low: 0.066 for whole-molecule/TLSMD; 0.116 for whole-molecule/Phenix; and 0.220 for Phenix/TLSMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like CypA, the three trypsin TLS models (SI Appendix, Fig S2 EH) yielded very similar R,R-free values: 15.1%, 16.7% for the whole-molecule model; 15.3%, 16.6% for the Phenix model; and 15.2%, 16.6% for the TLSMD model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlations between the calculated and experimental diffuse intensities are again low: 0.02 for the Phenix and TLSMD models, and 0.08 for the whole-molecule model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons of the calculated anisotropic diffuse intensity show that the whole-molecule motion is dissimilar to both the Phenix and TLSMD predictions (CC = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Phenix and TLSMD models yield much more similar diffuse intensities (CC = 0.515).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high correlation between these models is consistent with the similarity in the TLS groups (SI Appendix, Fig S2 FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low correlation of the CypA and trypsin TLS models with the diffuse data suggests that the protein motions might be correlated on a shorter length scale than provided by these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LLM_Models_Yield_Substantial_Correlation_with_Diffuse_Scattering_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One model that accounts for short-range correlations is LLM (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LLM model assumes that atomic displacements are uncorrelated between different unit cells, but are correlated within the unit cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation in the displacements is assumed to decay exponentially as ex/, where x is the separation of the atoms, and  is the length scale of the correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The displacements of all atoms are assigned a SD of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LLM model previously has been refined against 3D diffuse intensities obtained from crystalline staphylococcal nuclease (21) and calmodulin (18), yielding insights into correlated motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We refined isotropic LLM models of motions in CypA and trypsin against the experimental diffuse intensities (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CypA model was refined using data in the resolution range of 31.21.45 Å, and the trypsin model using 68- to 1.46-Å data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CypA, the refinement yielded  = 7.1 Å and  = 0.38 Å with a correlation of 0.518 between the calculated and experimental anisotropic intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest correlation between data and experiment occurs in the range of 3.673.28 Å, where the value is 0.74 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the trypsin dataset, the refinement yielded  = 8.35 Å and  = 0.32 Å with a correlation of 0.44, which is lower than for CypA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak value is 0.72 in the resolution range of 4.534.00 Å (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The refined LLM models also were compared with the data using simulated diffraction images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images corresponding to frame number 67 of the CypA data were obtained using the LLM model (Fig 3A) and the 3D diffuse data (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main bright features above and below the origin are similar between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the weaker features also appear to be similar, both at high and low resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity is diminished but still apparent for images obtained for frame number 45 of trypsin (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations provide a visual confirmation of the substantial correlations obtained for the 3D diffuse intensity (see SI Appendix, Fig S1, for visualization comparisons of the LLM model to the diffuse data in 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Normal_Modes_Can_Model_Both_Diffuse_and_Bragg_Scattering_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the potential of NMA to be developed for diffuse scattering studies, we developed coarse-grained elastic network models of the CypA and trypsin unit cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C coordinates and B factors for the NM models of diffuse scattering are by definition identical to those derived from the Bragg data (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the agreement of specific NM-derived conformational variations with the Bragg data, we eliminated the B factor constraint and generated 50-member ensembles from the 10 lowest-frequency nonzero modes (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more accurately model the Bragg data, we adjusted the overall spring constant and applied an additional uniform isotropic B factor to all atoms (Methods and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlations were high across resolution shells (Fig 2 C and D), yielding overall R factors of 38% (CypA) and 31% (trypsin) (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the predicted diffuse intensity from the NM models: the correlation of the CypA model with the data is 0.41 in the resolution range of 31.21.45 Å, and the correlation of the trypsin model with the data is 0.38 in the resolution range of 681.46 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with the data is substantial within individual resolution shells (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NM simulated diffraction image for CypA (Fig 3C) shows bright features that are found in the data (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative strength at high versus low resolution is greater than in the data, however, suggesting that this NM model is too rigid; this discrepancy might be addressed by softening the intraresidue interactions and optimizing the model against the diffuse scattering data directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparisons of simulated diffraction images for trypsin are consistent with the findings for CypA (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse X-ray scattering is a potentially valuable yet little exploited source of information about macromolecular dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffuse intensities can double the total number of measured data points in the crystallographic experiment while providing a parallel dataset against which structural dynamical models can be refined or validated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, measurement of 3D diffuse scattering data only has been pursued in dedicated efforts requiring extra still diffraction images and substantial optimization of experimental design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present collection of two datasets obtained using oscillation images using best current practices in room temperature protein crystallography (49), and the use of the data in evaluating TLS, LLM, and NM models, illustrates the potential for using diffuse scattering to increase understanding of protein structure variations in any X-ray crystallography experiment, representing a significant step toward moving diffuse scattering analysis into the mainstream of structural biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse data obtained for CypA and trypsin can distinguish among the TLS, LLM, and NM models of motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the agreement with the data are somewhat lower than in previous LLM models of 3D diffuse scattering (18, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the correlation of the LLM model with the data was 0.518 in the range of 31.21.45 Å for CypA, and 0.44 in the range of 681.46 Å for trypsin; in comparison, the correlation was 0.595 in the range of 102.5 Å for staphylococcal nuclease (21) and 0.55 in the range of 7.52.1 Å for calmodulin (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some possible explanations for the lower agreement for CypA and trypsin include the following: the use of higher-resolution data in the present studies; that LLM might be a better description of motions in staphylococcal nuclease and calmodulin than in CypA and trypsin; and that the measurements might have been more accurate in the past experiments, as the data collection was tailored for diffuse scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An apparent alignment of the residual intensity distribution with the unit cell axes (SI Appendix, Fig S2 C and F) suggests that an anisotropic LLM model might be more appropriate than an isotropic LLM model for CypA and trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The low correlation of the present TLS models with the diffuse intensity for CypA and trypsin suggests that the variations in the protein crystal might involve motions that are correlated on a shorter length scale than accounted for by these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLS models with large rigid domains might be more appropriate for interpreting small-scale diffuse features in the immediate neighborhood of Bragg peaks, similar to the rigid-body motions model of Doucet and Benoit (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods to integrate the small-scale features in protein crystallography onto a finer 3D reciprocal space grid than used here do exist (18) and could be used to investigate this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The agreement of the LLM models with 3D experimental diffuse data across multiple systems warrants further consideration for using diffuse scattering in model refinement and validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key finding is that the agreement of the LLM models with the diffuse data are higher than the TLS models, which currently are used widely in protein crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LLM model implies that the motions of atoms separated by more than 78 Å are relatively independent, and that atoms that are closer to each other move in a more concerted way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this length scale of the correlations is comparable to the size of the TLS domains; however, compared with the sharp domains of the TLS model, the exponential form of the correlations indicates that there is a smooth spatial transition between the correlated and uncorrelated atoms in the LLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smooth transition might be key to the increased agreement of the LLM with the diffuse data compared with the rigidly defined regions of the TLS model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The agreement of the NM models with the data assessed using either correlations across complete datasets (Fig 2) or simulated diffraction images (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S3) is substantial but slightly less than for the LLM models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to interpret this comparison in light of the fact that the covariance matrices of the NM models were normalized to agree with the Bragg data and not parameterized against the diffuse data (Methods), whereas the LLM model is parameterized against the diffuse data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in the coarse-grained NM model, the residues are treated as rigid; relaxing this approximation should lead to more accurate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with the Bragg data is currently limited by the fact that the parameter optimization used only the refined C positions and B factors to agree with the Bragg data and that heteroatoms, such as solvent, were not included in the calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results point to the potential for normal modes to be refined jointly against Bragg and diffuse scattering data as an alternative atomic displacement model, replacing TLS or individual B factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the 3D diffuse scattering data obtained here for CypA and trypsin, and previously for staphylococcal nuclease (21) and calmodulin (18), suggest that the protein structure varies more like a soft material than like a collection of independent rigid domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important consideration in developing these future refinement methods is to maintain a key advantage of TLS refinement at lower resolutions: the introduction of relatively few additional parameters for refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requirement also would be satisfied by NMA, which can have a low computational cost and general applicability, making it a promising model for integrating diffuse scattering into crystallographic model building and refinement (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this pursuit is well-motivated hinges on whether new biological insights can be gained from atomic displacements generated by NM models refined against Bragg and diffuse data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although use of TLS in model refinement is now widespread, it scarcely has been used to generate biological hypotheses (for exceptions, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50 and 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to TLS models, elastic network NM models have been widely used to draw functional inferences (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the encouraging agreement of the NM models with the diffuse scattering and the potential for NM models to yield insights about the importance of conformational dynamics in protein function provide a strong motivation for further developing NM models for protein X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse scattering also can be used to validate models of molecular motions other than those considered here, including models produced by ensemble refinement (11); multiconformer modeling performed by discrete (53, 54) or continuous (18, 55, 56) conformational sampling; and MD simulations (1315, 31, 3539, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, MD simulations now provide sufficient sampling to yield robust calculations of diffuse intensity (13), and these can be used to consider a myriad of intramolecular motions (e.g., loop openings and side-chain flips) (58) and lattice dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polikanov and Moore (46) recently have demonstrated the importance of lattice vibrations in explaining experimental diffuse scattering measurements of ribosome crystals, which indicates that models should simultaneously account for correlations that are coupled both within and across unit cell boundaries (18, 20); accounting for lattice vibrations more accurately also might yield improved Bragg integration (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, comparisons of crystal simulations and diffuse scattering can provide an additional observable for benchmarking improvements in energy functions and sampling schemes (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the initial successes of dynamics-based models of diffuse scattering indicate that crystal defects can play a secondary role in contributing to the diffuse signal, at least in some cases, consideration of crystal defects might become important to achieve the highest model accuracy and most general applicability of diffuse scattering in crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, as more X-ray data from both brighter conventional and X-ray free-electron laser light sources, accounting for all sources of Bragg and diffuse scattering will be necessary to model the total scattering needed for innovative phasing applications (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the datasets presented here demonstrate that diffuse scattering can now be routinely collected and that using these data will help us obtain an increasingly realistic picture of motion in protein crystals, including integrated descriptions of intramolecular motions, lattice vibrations, and crystal defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse_Data_Integration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After conventional crystallization, data collection, and processing (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text: Methods), image processing was performed, using the LUNUS collection of diffuse scattering tools (60), to transform raw images (Fig 1A) into ones in which the pixel values could be used to integrate 3D datasets (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam stop and image edges were masked, as were pixel values outside of the range 110,000 photon counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A beam polarization correction and solid-angle normalization were applied (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bragg peaks were removed using mode filtering with a mask width of 20 pixels and a histogram bin of one photon count.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse data integration was performed using a python script that calls DIALS methods within the Computational Crystallography Toolbox (CCTBX) (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The script obtains an indexing solution and uses the results to map each pixel in each diffraction image to fractional Miller indices hkl in reciprocal space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It sums the intensities from pixels in the neighborhood of each integer Miller index hkl and tracks the corresponding pixel counts, while ignoring pixels that fall within a 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 region about hkl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It writes the intensity sums and pixel counts for each frame on a grid, populated on an Ewald sphere that varies according to the crystal orientation for each image (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lunus methods were used to obtain a radial scattering vector intensity profile for each frame, which was used for scaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean diffuse intensity was calculated at each grid point using the scaled sums and pixel counts from all of the frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration yielded a CypA dataset with 438,627 measurements that is 98% complete to a resolution of 1.4 Å, and a trypsin dataset with 233,381 measurements that is 95% complete to 1.25-Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental and model diffuse intensities were compared using just the anisotropic component of the signal, which is primarily due to the protein (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lunus methods were used to subtract the radial average and obtain the anisotropic signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensities were symmetrized by averaging P222-equivalent points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparable degree of symmetry in the CypA and trypsin data suggests that the measurement of diffuse intensity is robust with respect to the difference in the phi angle oscillation during data collection (0.5° for CypA vs. 1° for trypsin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All images are available on SBGrid Data Grid (https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/68/ for CypA; https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/201/ for trypsin), and the symmetrized datasets are available in Datasets S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulated_Diffraction_Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffuse scattering images were simulated using methods similar to those for data integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A template frame was used to map each pixel to a fractional Miller index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new value of each pixel was obtained by linear interpolation between the nearest-neighbor integer points hkl in the 3D diffuse model or data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the 3D data, the images greatly enhanced the diffuse features compared with the raw images (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6) because of statistical averaging in data integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For visualization of simulated images, the minimum pixel value was computed within each pixel-width annulus about the beam center, and was subtracted from each pixel value within the annulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were displayed using Adxv version 1.9.10 (63), with display parameters selected for meaningful comparison of the diffuse features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TLS_Structure_Refinement_and_Diffuse_Scattering_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three independent TLS refinements were performed for CypA (SI Appendix, Fig S2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole-molecule selection consists of the entire molecule as a single TLS group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Phenix selection consists of the eight groups (residues 214, 1541, 4264, 6584, 85122, 123135, 136145, and 146165) identified by phenix.find_tls_groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TLSMD selection consists of eight groups (residues 215, 1655, 5680, 8185, 8691, 92124, 125143, and 144165) identified by the TLS Motion Determination web server (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All TLS refinement was performed within phenix.refine through five macrocycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the inclusion of TLS refinement, these macrocycles were identical to the initial structure refinement described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, for trypsin, we selected whole-molecule, Phenix, and TLSMD TLS refinement strategies as described above (SI Appendix, Fig S2 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Phenix selection consists of seven TLS groups: residues 1654, 55103, 104123, 124140, 141155, 156225, and 226245.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TLSMD selection consists of nine groups: residues 1652, 5398, 99115, 116144, 145171, 172220, 221224, 225237, and 238245.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural ensembles were generated using the phenix.tls_as_xyz method (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One thousand random samples were drawn assuming independent distributions for each domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffuse intensities were calculated using phenix.diffuse (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA and trypsin models were generated to a final resolution of 1.2 and 1.4 Å, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LLM_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LLM models of diffuse scattering were calculated using PDB entries 5F66 (CypA) and 5F6M (trypsin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature factors were set to zero and squared calculated structure factors I0(hkl) were computed using the structure_factors, as_intensity_array, and expand_to_p1 methods in CCTBX (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lunus symlt method was used to complete the grid using the P222 Laue group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given a correlation length  and amplitude of motion , the diffuse intensity at scattering vector s was calculated as DLLM(s)=42s22e42s22I0(s)*(s), with (s)=83/(1+42s22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier methods in Lunus (fftlt) were used for the convolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear correlation of the anisotropic intensities with the data was used as a target function for refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimization of the target with respect to  and  was performed using the Powell minimization method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NM_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NM model followed methods similar to those of Riccardi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic coordinates and isotropic displacement parameters were obtained from PDB entries 5F66 (CypA) and 5F6M (trypsin), and were expanded to the P1 unit cell using the iotbx.pdb methods in CCTBX (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hessian matrix H was defined using a modified anisotropic elastic network model (64), with springs between C atoms (i, j) within a cutoff radius of 25 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spring force constants were computed as kerij/, where rij is the closest distance between atoms i and j, either in the same unit cell or in neighboring unit cells;  = 10.5 Å; and k = 1 for rijless_than 25 Å and k = 0 otherwise (the nonzero value of k is arbitrary due to the normalization used below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covariances of atom pair displacements vij=rirj were obtained using the pseudoinverse of H as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of vij were renormalized to ij=vijij/(viivjj)1/2 using the isotropic displacement parameters i of the ith C atom from the Bragg refinement; the model was thus consistent with the refined crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diffuse intensity was computed as DNM(s)=ijfifje42(i2+j2)s2(e42s2ij1), where fi is the structure factor of the combined atoms in the residue associated with the ith C atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure factors were computed using a two-Gaussian approximation of atomic form factors; the parameters were obtained using the eltbx.X-ray_scattering methods in CCTBX (62); phase factors were applied using the atomic coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Bragg intensities were computed from ensembles generated by using the first 10 nonzero eigenvectors of H with corresponding inverse eigenvalues as their weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the overall scale of the spring constant was arbitrary in the NM model (see above), the amplitudes of motion were too large using the absolute eigenvalues; they were therefore scaled to maintain the connectivity of the backbones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty member ensemble models were generated by Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz) (65), which is a VMD (66) plugin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single B factor of 10 Å2 was applied to all atoms in the ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure factors were generated using phenix.fmodel and compared with the experimental data using phenix.reflection_statistics (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
