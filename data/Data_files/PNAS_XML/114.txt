Molecular stripping in the NF-B/IB/DNA genetic regulatory network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The classic models of genetic switches are based on thermodynamic control via binding affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex nonequilibrium eukaryotic gene networks with many targets such as the NF-B/IB/DNA system challenge this picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Waiting for unbinding from the numerous NF-B binding sites takes time that would allow wasteful overexpression of many genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active molecular stripping of NF-B from the DNA by IB solves the timescale problem raised in the classic picture based on thermodynamics alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic switches based on the NF-B/IB/DNA system are master regulators of an array of cellular responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent kinetic experiments have shown that IB can actively remove NF-B bound to its genetic sites via a process called molecular stripping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows the NF-B/IB/DNA switch to function under kinetic control rather than the thermodynamic control contemplated in the traditional models of gene switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained predictive energy landscape models for the constituent proteins by themselves and interacting with the DNA we explore the functional motions of the transcription factor NF-B and its various binary and ternary complexes with DNA and the inhibitor IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies show that the function of the NF-B/IB/DNA genetic switch is realized via an allosteric mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular stripping occurs through the activation of a domain twist mode by the binding of IB that occurs through conformational selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free energy calculations for DNA binding show that the binding of IB not only results in a significant decrease of the affinity of the transcription factor for the DNA but also kinetically speeds DNA release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections of the free energy onto various reaction coordinates reveal the structural details of the stripping pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Systems_Biology_of_NF-B_IB_DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transcription factor NF-B is central to the regulation of inflammatory responses, immune responses to infections, and programmed cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B is a collective name for a family of homo- and heterodimeric proteins that serve as a bridge from the extracellular signals to gene expression (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NF-B heterodimer p50p65 is the most abundant form, although other forms are also present in the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B is activated by a diverse set of extracellular stimuli that through an enzyme cascade mark the IB moiety for degradation, subsequently freeing NF-B from its inhibited complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its active, unbound form NF-B translocates to the nucleus, thereby initiating the transcription of hundreds of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its wide range of influence NF-B is considered a master regulator switch (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the target genes of NF-B is its own inhibitor IB, which we will refer to simply as IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting IB synthesis results in a negative feedback loop that governs the nuclear concentration of active NF-B, leading to pulses of activation and inactivation (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IB strips the NF-B off from its DNA targets and masks the nuclear localization signal of the NF-B (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting tightly bound NF-BIB complex (12) is thus prevented from reentering the nucleus (13, 14), thereby terminating all of the associated genetic activities of NF-B to restore the cellular resting state (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most complete mathematical models of NF-B signaling have assumed fast local equilibria for NF-B binding to the DNA (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent in vitro kinetic measurements of IB binding to the complex of NF-B with DNA challenge this equilibrium view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B dissociates from DNA in an IB concentration-dependent manner (7, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including this enhancement in models requires going beyond the purely equilibrium picture that envisions fast dissociation/association and that ignores competing binding at other gene sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A revised systems biology scheme showing the central role of molecular stripping is described in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo there are several thousand B binding sites (18); thus, if dissociation from these target and decoy sites would not be fast enough there would be wasteful overexpression of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid molecular stripping of NF-B from its DNA results in efficient down-regulation of the NF-B targets, ensuring the optimal expenditure of cellular resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations demonstrate a feasible mechanism for this molecular stripping reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structures__Dynamics__and_Thermodynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structures of the p50p65 heterodimer of NF-B bound with the DNA and with its inhibitor IB have already been resolved with X-ray crystallography (14, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, each of the available structures lacks at least one mechanistically crucial part of the NF-B molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of NF-BDNA (PDB ID code 1LE5) by Berkowitz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) lacks the crucial nuclear localization signal (NLS), and the entire p50 N-terminal binding domain is missing from the two existing crystal structures (14, 20) for NF-BIB (PDB ID codes 1IKN and 1NFI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the binding and stripping mechanisms, more complete structures are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct these structures (Fig 1B) we carried out simulations with a coarse-grained proteinDNA force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added the missing molecular fragments and regenerated the full structures of the various complexes by using the Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) for the interactions within and among the proteins (21) and the Three Sites Per Nucleotide (3SPN) model for the DNA (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA and protein are coupled through steric exclusion and electrostatics modeled at the mean field level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AWSEM is a coarse-grained predictive model based on the energy landscape formulation of protein folding theory (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It accounts explicitly for physically motivated interactions such as hydrogen bonding and solvent interactions to model tertiary structure relationships and incorporates evolutionary forces via bioinformatic terms that act locally in sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both kinds of interactions effectively sculpt the landscapes of naturally occurring proteins to be highly funneled toward the native state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AWSEM has proved successful in predicting structures of both protein monomers (21) and dimers (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3SPN force field is a coarse-grained model for the DNA that also includes physically motivated terms, such as base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatic repulsion of phosphate groups that give rise to the double-helical structure of the DNA with appropriate thermal and mechanical properties (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It gives a good account of the range of structural diversity of double-helical DNA (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the models can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D structures predicted by our code compare well with the available crystal structures of NF-BDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tertiary and secondary levels of structure are reproduced in the simulations with high fidelity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding interface between protein and DNA is also well predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also can compare the predicted complete structure of the complex NF-BIB with the crystal structure of an NF-BIB complex (PDB ID code 1IKN) in which the p50 binding domain has been removed (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the truncated complex aligns well with the simulated structure in the dimerization domain region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal structure of the truncated form, however, the p65 N-terminal binding domain has twisted further from its location in the NF-BDNA complex than it has in the predicted complete structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This larger domain twist in the artificially truncated crystal structure results from the higher flexibility of the p65 N-terminal domain allowed by the absence of steric conflicts with the neighboring p50 N-terminal domain (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both N-terminal domains are present, the orientation of the domains is sterically forced to be closer to the orientation seen in the crystal structure of NF-BDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations of a heterodimer in which the p50 N-terminal binding domain has been removed concur in predicting this additional twist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following sections we make use of our predicted full structures of the bound complexes to follow their formation dynamics and reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Naturally occurring proteins are minimally frustrated as a result of evolutionary development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of proteins to fold into unique native configurations on reasonable timescales is successfully explained by folding theories resting on the principle of minimal frustration (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frustration is not completely eliminated via evolutionary selection because functional constraints also sculpt the energy landscapes to allow functional motions of the folded proteins in the folded states and binding reactions (30, 31).The folded protein ensemble occupies the dominant basin of the free energy landscape where frustration properly localized in key regions of the protein chain opens up routes for specific functional dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frustration in biomolecules can be readily quantified and visualized using a spatially local version of the principle of minimal frustration (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An algorithm to do this is implemented in the frustratometer (32), which estimates the energetic contribution of contacts to the stability of the native state and compares these energies in the native structure to the distribution of energies that would be obtained by performing residue substitutions in the local environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native contacts whose energies are sufficiently deep in the energetically stabilizing part of the distribution are called minimally frustrated and are drawn as green lines on the structure, whereas the native contacts that are found sufficiently far in the energetically destabilizing region are called frustrated and are drawn as red lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative details of this algorithm including electrostatic effects have been discussed in previous papers (30, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The frustration patterns of the NF-B were analyzed in the structure of free NF-B, NF-B bound with the DNA, and NF-B bound with IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When electrostatic effects are included, localized high levels of frustration are found in the binding pocket of the NF-B dimer when considered by itself (Fig 2A) or when the protruding PEST sequence of the IB is truncated in the NF-BIB dimer (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frustration is largely caused by the positively charged residues which are located in close proximity to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding DNA or the IB PEST sequence, both of which are negatively charged, mitigates this frustration so that the necklace of frustration in the binding pocket (Fig 2 A and B) becomes unfrustrated after DNA binds (Fig 2C) or when the PEST sequence of the IB moves into the pocket (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, frustration analysis already hints that binding IB with its PEST can facilitate the stripping of NF-B from DNA by relieving frustration in the free NF-B that forms if the DNA dissociates by itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This origin of stripping is underlined by free energy calculations using umbrella sampling simulations of DNA binding to NF-B by itself and of DNA binding to a preexisting IBNF-B complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting structures for these simulations are the predicted structures previously described as well as a model of the ternary complex of IBNF-BDNA also created by AWSEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these starting points we used umbrella sampling to sample more broadly the complete ensemble of conformational states intermediate between those where the partners are fully bound and other conformations where they are completely released.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations capture the steps of molecular stripping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distances between either the center of mass of the dimerization domains with the center of mass of the DNA or with the center of mass of the IB were used as harmonic biasing terms for the umbrella sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the in vitro experiments were carried out on the short piece of DNA that we used in simulations (SI Appendix, Fig S2), we also carried out simulations that better mimic the way the transcription factor would approach a much longer full-length genomic DNA in vivo, by constraining the orientation of the DNA to remain parallel to the orientation of the initial bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without this constraint an intermediate forms in which the protein complex binds to the apex of the short DNA fragment (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing the orientational constraint removes this artificial effect of the finite length of the DNA fragment studied in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 1D free energy profiles for the biologically more relevant fixed orientation of the DNA (Fig 3A) show that the binding of IB not only changes the DNA binding free energy to NF-B but also alters the detailed mechanism by which DNA associates with and dissociates from NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IB lowers the barrier for DNA escape by at least 23 kcal (black arrows in Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change implies that a considerable acceleration of the rate of dissociation from the DNA can be induced by binding IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking at the profile from the DNA association viewpoint one sees that there is a significant kinetic barrier for DNA to associate with a preexisting NF-BIB complex, whereas DNA associates with free NF-B in a diffusion-limited manner as shown by the purely downhill profile for binary association in the absence of IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examining the free energy profile for IB dissociation from the ternary complex (Fig 3B) shows that there is a larger barrier for releasing IB from the complex than for releasing DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in harmony with kinetic mixing experiments that do not observe dissociation of the IB on the laboratory timescale (7, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the two 1D free energy profiles into a 2D free energy surface (Fig 3C) maps out the interchange of the two binding partners, through the approach of IB to the binary complex with DNA and the subsequent dissociation of the DNA from the resulting ternary complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a representation is reminiscent of the 20th-century pioneering studies of elementary gas phase reactions that made use of semiempirical surfaces (34) and quasi-classic mechanics (35) for obtaining detailed dynamical features of reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamical and thermodynamic aspects of molecular stripping can be studied at a higher level of structural detail by using additional collective coordinates as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower barrier for DNA dissociation from the ternary complex NF-BDNAIB compared with binary complex NF-BDNA and an even higher barrier for IB dissociation (Fig 3C) show that molecular stripping is not only thermodynamically but also kinetically favorable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Essential_Modes_of_Motion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Being a multidomain protein complex, as expected, the NF-B heterodimer can bend around the connecting hinge while the individual domains themselves remain relatively rigid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize this and other global slow timescale motions we performed many exhaustive simulations with a cumulative run time equivalent to more than 500 s of real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long sampling times are made possible by using our coarse-grained model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using long constant temperature simulations we first carried out principal component analysis in the Cartesian space spanned by the backbone C atoms of the free NF-B alone to uncover the dominant large amplitude modes of motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis of well-sampled trajectories of proteins in their native states provides a convenient simplifying lens to characterize their functional collective motions (31, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first principal component is the predominant motion that accounts for more than 70% of the amplitude of motion in unbound NF-B (SI Appendix, Fig S4), but a second component also plays a role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projection of the equilibrium ensemble of structures onto these two modes reveals that these large-amplitude motions are not quasi-harmonic in the free NF-B dimers, leading to multipeak distributions for these collective coordinates in the free form (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first principal component is largely a domain twist motion (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second principal component for the free NF-B is an overall domain breathing motion, resembling the opening and closing of the DNA binding cavity (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the free NF-B case, for both binary complexes the distribution of these coordinates is essentially single-peaked, with peaks in different locations for NF-BIB and for NF-BDNA (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IB binding and DNA binding couple to distinct motions of the free NF-B, namely dominantly to the twist when forming IBNF-B but to the breathing mode when forming NF-BDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Projecting the equilibrium ensemble of the binary complexes on principal components determined now by including both backbone atoms of NF-B and the backbone atoms of its binding partners (either DNA or IB) reveals the motions of the partners with respect to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal motion of the NFBDNA complex corresponds to sliding the NF-B along the DNA strands (SI Appendix, Fig S6), supporting the view that NF-B can easily perform a 1D diffusional motion along the DNA without being released.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second largest principal component for NF-BDNA as a whole complex corresponds to what was the domain twist motion of the free NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain breathing motion that is displaced upon DNA binding is heavily suppressed in fluctuating amplitude after the DNA binds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When IB binds to free NF-B the induced twist orients the domains so that only one of the NF-B monomers can now contact the DNA very closely (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is one of the key results of this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that IB acts as an allosteric effector precisely by selecting a conformation in the NF-BDNA most favorable for DNA dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the IB binds the NF-B, the DNA remains held by only a single N-terminal domain of NF-B coming from the p50 subunit (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both N-terminal domains contribute to holding strongly to the DNA before the twist transition has taken place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allosteric change through twisting ultimately allows the stripping of NF-B from its genomic binding sites on the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanistic_Picture_of_Molecular_Stripping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By mapping the free energy profile simultaneously onto the dissociation distances (Fig 3) and onto the principal components of free NF-B we can uncover the key mechanistic steps by which DNA dissociates from NF-B after the complex with IB forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following how the domain twist coordinate changes as the partners approach each other we see that the minimal free energy paths for dissociation of DNA have two stages (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first stage the domains twist (note the solid arrows in Fig 5 A and B), thereby loosening the steric and electrostatic grip of the transcription factor on the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This twist is then followed by a subsequent step in which the DNA separates from the complex whereas only one of the two domains holds on strongly to the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy surface for DNA dissociation from the binary complex NF-BDNA (Fig 5C) shows a bifurcation: The DNA can be induced to dissociate by rotating either one of the two DNA binding domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two dissociating paths do not have equal barriers, which highlights the symmetry breaking in the heterodimer of NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dissociation of DNA from the ternary complex proceeds by a different route (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5D and 6) than does DNA dissociation from the binary complex because the binding of the IB to the NF-BDNA binary complex has already induced the necessary domain twist of the p65 domain via a conformational selection mechanism (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In forming the ternary complex the DNA binding domain has already come to a more favorable orientation for releasing DNA, leading to lower kinetic barriers (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see the first step of molecular stripping occurs through an allosteric transition caused by the IB acting on the domain twist mode of the NF-B heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformational change facilitates the stripping of the NF-B from DNA by decreasing the barrier for further domain twist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once DNA leaves the ternary intermediate, the resulting bound complex of NF-BIB is thermodynamically much more stable (Fig 5A) than the starting complex with NF-B bound only to the DNA (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is then no surprise that the reverse reaction of DNA stripping the IB moiety from its complex with NF-B has not been observed in kinetic experiments (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermodynamic stability of the NF-BIB complex as well as the origin of barrier for the reverse reaction of DNA binding can be explained using electrostatic arguments as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second step of stripping, as the DNA begins to leave, the IB reconfigures through the motion of the PEST sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By being highly negatively charged the PEST sequence begins to compete with the DNA for binding to the positively charged NF-B binding pocket (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exchange of partners lowers the barrier for DNA dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As is seen on the free energy surface, once the DNA has completely left the cavity, the PEST sequence moves still further to occupy the cavity, thereby finally resolving the electrostatically frustrated interactions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5E and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looked at hypothetically in the reverse direction of association, the occupation of the DNA binding pocket by the PEST sequence leads to a free energy barrier inhibiting association of the DNA with the NF-BIB complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This barrier gives another way by which IB controls the transcriptional ability of the NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in both the pretransition state complex and the molecular stripping transition state itself the DNA remains bound transiently to the p50 subunit for which it has the higher affinity (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One may use other collective modes for investigating different mechanistic aspects of NF-B domain motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, using the breathing mode as a collective coordinate (Fig 5F) reveals a displacement in the breathing mode coordinate when DNA dissociates or binds to the free NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two DNA binding domains of NF-B first open and then close, approaching each other to seal the cavity between them, thus locking onto the target DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A detailed description of the materials and methods is given in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the simulations were carried out using electrostatically enhanced version of AWSEM force field for proteins (33) and 3SPN2c force field for DNA (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were done under constant temperature conditions, following the standard protocols of minimization and equilibration starting from either computationally predicted or available crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis was performed on an ensemble of structures generated by carrying out multiple independent constant temperature simulations with a cumulative time equivalent to over 500 s of real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to 100 large-scale domain change events have been registered in the simulations, each of which is estimated to take place on a 1- to 10-s timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free energy profiles were computed by carrying out umbrella sampling by restraining proteinprotein and proteinDNA center of mass distances with harmonic constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-cell experiments on NF-B regulation in vivo, mathematical modeling, in vitro kinetics, and structural studies have provided many important clues to NF-B signaling systems biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present simulations show that a detailed molecular-level understanding of the functional dynamics of the key NF-BIBDNA genetic switch elements can add more to the story.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work exhaustive long timescale, coarse-grained simulations for the free NF-B heterodimer and its bound complexes with DNA and IB have allowed us to explore structures, thermodynamics, and motions that have not been accessible to direct crystallographic study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations demonstrate that the NF-B/DNA/IB switch functions via an allosteric mechanism that involves conformational selection of a collective mode of domain twist accompanied by opening and closing of the cavity between the two DNA binding domains of the heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular stripping process of NF-B from its target genetic sites by IB proves both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable, suggesting a novel nonequilibrium mechanism for the efficient control of gene expression in this important master regulator system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
