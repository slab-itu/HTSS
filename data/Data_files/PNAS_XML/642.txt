Tropical dead zones and mass mortalities on coral reefs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxygen-starved coastal waters are rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the impacts of these dead zones in tropical ecosystems or their potential threat to coral reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document the deleterious effects of such an anoxic event on coral habitat and biodiversity, and show that the risk of dead-zone events to reefs worldwide likely has been seriously underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Awareness of, and research on, reef hypoxia is needed to address the threat posed by dead zones to coral reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Degradation of coastal water quality in the form of low dissolved oxygen levels (hypoxia) can harm biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human wellbeing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme hypoxic conditions along the coast, leading to what are often referred to as dead zones, are known primarily from temperate regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the potential threat of hypoxia in the tropics, even though the known risk factors, including eutrophication and elevated temperatures, are common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we document an unprecedented hypoxic event on the Caribbean coast of Panama and assess the risk of dead zones to coral reefs worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The event caused coral bleaching and massive mortality of corals and other reef-associated organisms, but observed shifts in community structure combined with laboratory experiments revealed that not all coral species are equally sensitive to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of global databases showed that coral reefs are associated with more than half of the known tropical dead zones worldwide, with 10% of all coral reefs at elevated risk for hypoxia based on local and global risk factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxic events in the tropics and associated mortality events have likely been underreported, perhaps by an order of magnitude, because of the lack of local scientific capacity for their detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring and management plans for coral reef resilience should incorporate the growing threat of coastal hypoxia and include support for increased detection and research capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Immediate effects of the hypoxic event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (AC) Photographs of the dominant reef-building coral A. lamarcki found alive in normoxic sites (A), bleached during a hypoxic event (B), and dead following hypoxia (C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Sampling initiated in the hypoxic area tracked initially high coral bleaching that declined in association with an increase in the prevalence of dead coral and a reduction in cover by living coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no change in cover of living, dead, or bleached coral during the same period at a nearby site without hypoxia (P  0.38 all analyses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total values for a given date are less_than100% because of noncoral habitat within the survey area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are the mean (±SE) of the percent cover of coral category and were analyzed by ANOVA (n = 4 transects with 40 points per time point per site) where P values indicate change through time within a given coral category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E and F) As is typical of hypoxic events, mortality affected a broad taxonomic cross-section of the community including reef crabs (E) and sponges (F), the latter showing gray, dead portions below the distinct depth horizon of the oxycline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AC courtesy of Cindy T.

Spatial distribution of hypoxia at 1012 m depth (October 2010) and its consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) There were two distinct pockets of hypoxia, one near the mainland with terrestrial inputs [lower left, near Almirante town (ALM)], and the other near dense settlements of Bocas del Toro (BDT) where the Bocas del Toro Research Station is located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land is shown in gray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color indicates the intensity of hypoxia as shown in the scale in the figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites 1 and 11 were initial reef-assessment sites (20102011); sites 110 were 10 subsequent coral-survey sites (2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B and C) Dissolved oxygen during the hypoxic period in 2010 was correlated with both the percent of coral cover at a site that was alive (B) and species richness of coral remaining alive in 2012 (C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed by Pearsons correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that dissolved oxygen levels were always 4.8 mg/L at the shallow depth (34 m) (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maps of water quality in shallow (Left) and deep (Right) water during the hypoxic period in October 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown for (A) oxygen, (B) salinity, and (C) temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent differences between depths in oxygen and salinity indicate the stratification of the water column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The map of oxygen at 1012 m is the same as in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Shifts in community structure toward hypoxia-tolerant coral species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Before the hypoxic event, using the record of all corals both alive and dead as a proxy for relative abundance, the cover of Agaricia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was consistently higher than S. intersepta across all four sites, and there was no difference among sites in the cover of either taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Following the hypoxic event, S. intersepta emerged as the dominant species among the corals remaining alive at the two sites that experienced hypoxia, whereas Agaricia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  persisted as the dominant living coral at the two sites that did not experience hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Subsequent laboratory tolerance experiments suggested that hypoxia, not thermal stress, was the primary driver of the mortality patterns in the field because S. intersepta had high survivorship across all treatments, and A. lamarcki (92% of Agaricia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at study sites) survivorship was affected by hypoxia but not by temperature treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cool = 28 °C; warm = 32 °C; normoxic = 5 mg/L dissolved oxygen; hypoxic = 0.5 mg/L dissolved oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Photos of A. lamarcki on day 0 (Left) and day 7 (Right) of the cool, hypoxic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note green algae colonizing dead colonies on day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data in A and B are mean (±SE) percent cover analyzed by ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data in C are the proportion of replicate containers with surviving corals analyzed by KaplanMeier survivorship analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different letters above bars indicate significant differences in percent cover and survivorship, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Worldwide distribution of dead zones and coral reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Global map with all known dead zones (red dots) and coral reefs where hypoxia has been implicated in mass mortality of reef organisms (gold dots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Documented dead zones are notably concentrated in temperate regions in areas with relatively greater research capacity, whereas coral reefs are found primarily in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid horizontal line represents the equator, and the upper and lower dashed lines represent the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity of purple color indicates densities of coral reef area per ecoregion, from lightest to darkest: 0, 11,000, 1,0012,500, 2,5015,000, 5,00110,000, and 10,00121,000 km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The proportion of coral reefs at elevated risk of hypoxia, for each major coral region and a global average weighted by relative coral area in each region, based on coastal geomorphology and anthropogenic drivers of low oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The distribution of dead zones by latitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead zones are relatively underrepresented in tropical regions and are overrepresented in temperate areas given the length of the coastline in each region (analysis by KolmogorovSmirnov test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Degrees of latitude are absolute values, so northern and southern hemisphere latitudes are pooled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Insets) Circle graphs show that tropical dead zones were likely to be first identified by research teams from temperate institutions, whereas temperate dead zones were never identified by teams from tropical institutions (analysis by 2 test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rank the research attention that hypoxia receives relative to other threats to coral reefs, we quantified the number of ICRS 2016 abstracts that examined the effects of climate/thermal stress, fishing, disease/invasive species, sedimentation/land use, ocean acidification, and hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature conditions at shallow (34 m) and deep (1012 m) depths at 19 sites in Bahia Almirante in October 2010, and maps of variation in each parameter across the study area (at 1012 m depth) were created in ArcGIS (Fig 2 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the initial response of coral reefs to hypoxia, we sampled the cover of live, dead, and bleached coral from representative reefs inside (site 1) and outside (site 11) the hypoxic area (Fig 2A) on November 2010, January 2011, and July 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then conducted a more detailed survey of coral cover and species richness at both shallow and deep depths at 10 sites that spanned the hypoxia gradient in April 2012 (Fig 2) and again in April 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for evidence of prior mass-mortality events that would truncate the size distribution of corals, we quantified colony size at two dead zone sites and two unimpacted sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the relative tolerance of A. lamarcki and S. intersepta to temperature and hypoxia conditions associated with the dead-zone event at the Bocas del Toro Research Station and to test whether levels of those factors during the event were sufficient to cause mortality in either species (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We updated the global database of hypoxic sites (7, 35) by conducting a literature search and then examined geographic trends in the risk of dead zones to coral reefs in three ways (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we quantified the proportion of coral reefs worldwide that are at elevated risk of exposure to hypoxia based on geomorphological setting and an index of exposure to anthropogenic factors (Fig 4 A and B) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we examined the proportion of known tropical hypoxic ecosystems in our global hypoxia database that contain coral reefs according to reef locations documented in the databases (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) and the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we searched the literature for all studies that associated hypoxia with the death of corals or other reef organisms (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether the distribution of known dead zones was disproportionately skewed away from the tropics and toward temperate regions by comparing the distribution of dead zones in our database with the distribution of relative coastline length across 5° latitude bins (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether research capacity could explain this skewness, we tested whether dead zones in tropical and temperate regions were more likely to have been first described by investigators from the other region (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extended materials and methods that detail procedures and analyses are available in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Rank_of_Threats_in_Abstracts_of_the_International_Coral_Reef_Symposium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The International Coral Reef Symposium is the premier event of coral reef science, occurring once every 4 y and thus represents an excellent snapshot of the activities of coral reef researchers around the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the relative attention given to various threats to coral reefs by attendees and their collaborators, we counted the number of abstracts that referenced each threat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following search terms for each topic to identify candidate abstracts and then examined each abstract for relevance to eliminate false positives: climate/thermal stress (thermal OR temperature OR warm* OR climate); fishing (fishing OR fisher OR fished OR harvest OR exploitation OR aquarium trade OR aquarium industry); disease/invasive species (disease OR pathogen OR epidemic OR infection OR invasive OR exotic species OR introduced species OR species introduction OR nonnative OR non-native); sedimentation/land use (sediment* OR runoff OR run-off OR turbid OR land use OR land-use OR land cover OR land-cover OR shoreline OR coastline OR development); ocean acidification (acidifi* OR pH OR OA); eutrophication (eutrophic* OR nutrient* OR nutrification OR sewage OR fertilizer); Hypoxia (anoxi* OR hypoxi* OR dead zone OR oxygen OR DO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abstracts were counted for each topic independently, so each abstract may have been counted toward more than one topic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Water-Quality_Survey  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed water-quality conditions at 19 sites on 1 October 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites were selected for coverage across Bahia Almirante that represented varying distances from land and isolation from channels with the open ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each site, a YSI Pro2030 sonde was used to measure dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, and depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized conditions across the bay using data collected from the same shallow (34 m) and deep (1012 m) depths as subsequent coral surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maps of variation in each parameter across the study area (at 1012 m depth) were created using the Gaussian kernel interpolation function with barriers in ArcGIS v10.2 with Geostatistical Analyst extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Initial_Coral_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the initial response of coral reefs to hypoxia, we sampled representative reefs inside (site 1) and outside (site 11) the hypoxic area (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reef at each site was surveyed in November 2010, January 2011, and July 2011 using the Reef Check protocol (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each site and time, four replicate 20-m transects were laid shallow (34 m depth) and deep (1012 m depth), and cover was recorded at 0.5-m intervals using the following categories: live coral, live bleached coral, dead coral, or other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each site and depth, the effect of time on the percent of cover by live coral and bleached coral was analyzed with one-way ANOVAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No data were collected at the shallow depth of the hypoxic site at the middle time point January 2011, so that depth and site were analyzed by comparing the two end points of November 2010 and July 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detailed_Coral_Survey  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We quantified the coral community at 10 sites that spanned the hypoxia gradient in Bahia Almirante in April 2012 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surveys were conducted at shallow (34 m) and deep (1012 m) depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each site and depth, we assessed the percent of coral cover by recording the identity and status (live or dead) of coral under 25 points in each of 24 randomly placed 50 × 50 cm quadrats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the relationship of the average proportion of living coral [live coral cover/(live coral cover + dead coral cover)] and coral species richness at each site with the dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity values at each site derived from the interpolated maps of each physical variable using linear least squares regression analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the potential interaction of temperature and hypoxia on organismal survivorship (19), we also considered the combined and interactive effects of dissolved oxygen and temperature on the percent of live coral cover and species richness with multiple linear regression using forward substitution model selection and found that the addition of a temperature term alone or the addition of temperature and temperature × dissolved oxygen interaction terms did not significantly improve the overall model fit (P  0.12 for all analyses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we found that salinity, which varied by less_than1 ppt across the study sites, did not contribute to patterns of coral cover or richness (P  0.12 for all analyses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not conduct similar analyses of the relationship between coral cover or coral diversity and physical parameters at shallow depths because some sites did not have coral reefs at shallow depths and thus the sample size was insufficient for rigorous analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen between shallow (34 m) and deep (1012 m) depths across our study area with a paired t test that compared the two depths at each of the 19 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We returned to our 10 survey sites in the spring of 2014 to examine if there was any trend of change in coral cover since our initial surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same survey methods and then tested for a change through time using a paired t test with average percent cover in 2012 and 2014 at each site as the response variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for evidence of prior mass-mortality events that would truncate the size distribution of corals, we conducted a detailed examination of colony size at two dead-zone sites and two unimpacted sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the length of the largest Agaricia lamarcki colony (living or dead) in each of 1923 randomly placed 50 × 50 cm quadrats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for differences among sites in the size of the largest colonies with a one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stress_Tolerance_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the relative tolerance of A. lamarcki and Stephanocoenia intersepta to temperature and hypoxia conditions associated with the dead-zone event at the Bocas del Toro Research Station and to test whether levels of those factors during the event were sufficient to cause mortality in either species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment focused on those two factors of interest and was not meant to mimic the full suite of conditions associated with the event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coral colonies (58 cm in diameter) were collected from a common site without previous evidence of hypoxic stress in April 2013 and then were acclimated to laboratory conditions in flowing seawater tanks at the Bocas del Toro Research Station for 1 wk before the start of experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed two temperature levels (low: 28 °C; high: 32 °C) by two dissolved oxygen treatments (normoxic: 5 mg/L; hypoxic: 0.5 mg/L, the minimum level observed in water-quality surveys) in a fully factorial design for each species, with eight replicate containers (volume: 3.7 L) per treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each replicate container contained three coral colonies of a given species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature of the replicate containers was maintained by heating a water bath surrounding each container with an Eheim Jager 300-W heater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen levels were maintained by bubbling each container with air for the normoxic treatment or with nitrogen for the hypoxic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water in each container was replaced with preconditioned water daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survivorship was analyzed by KaplanMeier 2 analysis as the proportion of containers with colonies alive after 7 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Hypoxia_Database  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined geographic trends in the occurrence of dead zones and research efforts in the global database first established by Diaz and Rosenberg (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That database was updated through 2011 by the World Resources Institute (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further updated that database through 2013 by conducting two searches of publications in the Web of Science for the years 20072013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first was an examination of all papers that have cited the 2008 Diaz and Rosenberg paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second used the search string Topic=(suboxic OR sub-oxic OR hypoxi* OR anoxi* OR dead zone OR anaerobic OR oxygen) AND (eutrophic* OR anthropogenic OR nutrient* OR pollut*) AND (coast* OR ocean OR estuar* OR marine OR sea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the papers yielded by the searches was examined for evidence of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen less_than 2.8 mg/L) and was cross-checked with the existing database to exclude redundant references.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our addendum with coordinates of newly identified dead zones is presented in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plotted the locations of known dead zones from this updated database on a global map and included a data layer of known coral reef densities by ecoregions from the following database accessed on 3 March 2015: www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=304e87e8b3154027935b226ecd2691aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_the_Risk_of_Coral_Reef_Hypoxia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the global potential incidence of hypoxia on coral reefs in three ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we quantified the proportion of coral reefs worldwide that are at elevated risk of exposure to hypoxia based on two classes of factors that contribute to the establishment of low oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first was the geomorphology of coral reef setting, because hypoxia is known to establish in semienclosed bays, estuaries, lagoons, and other coastal features with limited circulation; the second was exposure to anthropogenic factors such as eutrophication and warming that contribute to low oxygen levels (7, 3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the six major coral regions of the world we randomly sampled 100 reefs (n = 600 reefs total) and determined the proportion of reefs that are located in a semienclosed coastal setting and are also at a high, very high, or critical level of risk of integrated anthropogenic impacts using the World Resources Institute year 2050 projections (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined a weighted global average given the relative distribution of coral reef area across the six regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we estimated the relative risk of hypoxia to coral reefs by examining the proportion of known tropical hypoxic ecosystems in our global hypoxia database that contain coral reefs according to documented reef locations in the databases of the World Resources Institute (27), ReefBase (www.ReefBase.org/main.aspx, accessed 21 April 2015), and our search of the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, we searched the literature for all studies that associated hypoxia with the death of corals or other reef organisms using the search term: Topic=(suboxic OR sub-oxic OR hypoxi* OR anoxi* OR dead zone OR anaerobic OR oxygen) AND (coral*).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 20 instances in which hypoxia was implicated in the mortality of coral reef organisms, only one (40) had both oxygen and coral data; however, they attributed mortality primarily to co-occurring salinity and thermal stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Distribution_and_Estimation_of_Dead_Zones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the distribution of dead zones by latitude for temperate regions (60° to 24° and 24° to 60° latitude) and tropical regions (24° to 24° latitude) by plotting the number of dead zones per degree of latitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify comparisons between temperate and tropical areas, southern and northern data were plotted together as absolute degree of latitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four dead zones known to occur at polar latitudes (60°) were not included in the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested whether the distribution of known dead zones was disproportionately skewed away from the tropics and toward temperate regions by dividing the world into bins of five degrees of latitude and comparing the distribution of dead zones in our database with the distribution of relative coastline length across latitude bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis, we tested the null hypothesis that the likelihood of dead zone occurrence is proportional the amount of coastline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coastline length was determined by measuring the length of coastline on all continents and islands 100,000 km2 in Google Earth (v7.1.2.2041, accessed December 2014) using the latitude and longitude grid overlay and ruler function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made at a resolution that allowed a one degree of latitude division on the grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether the distributions of dead zones and coastline across latitude differed with a KolmogorovSmirnov two sample test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this difference was found to be significant (D = 0.39, P less_than 0.01), we then conducted a post hoc test to examine whether there was a consistent difference in the distribution of known dead zones and coastline in tropical or temperate regions by conducting a paired t test for both the tropical and temperate regions using the difference between the proportion of dead zones and coastline length in each latitude bin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also estimated the approximate number of dead zones yet to be described in the tropics, assuming that the number of dead zones scales with the length of shoreline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our database found 447 dead zones along 120,153 km of temperate shoreline (60° to 24.1° and 24.1°to 60° latitude), we estimated that 414 dead zones should be found along 111,161 km of tropical shorelines (24° to 24° latitude).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimate is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the 43 known tropical dead zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested whether dead zones in tropical and temperate regions were more likely to have been first described by investigators from the other region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the publications that first described each of the tropical dead zones and examined a randomly selected subsample of temperate dead zones for the same sample size (n = 43 per region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each publication we identified whether the lead authors home institution was in a tropical or temperate region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then conducted a 2 analysis to determine if the proportion of dead zones first identified by investigators from the other region differed in temperate and tropical regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
