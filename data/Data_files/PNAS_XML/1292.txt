Caspase-1 inhibition prevents glial inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in models of multiple sclerosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) was recently identified as the principal executioner of pyroptosis (fiery death), a type of proinflammatory programmed cell death driven by inflammasomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD, but whether this process contributes to neuroinflammation is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report evidence of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis as a primary mechanism of inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system during multiple sclerosis (MS), a debilitating and incurable demyelinating disease that causes profound loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying GSDMD induction and pyroptosis in oligodendrocytes and microglia, we discovered a previously unrecognized mechanism driving neuroinflammation and demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacologically inhibiting caspase-1 prevented pyroptosis in experimental models of MS, reducing demyelination and neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight therapeutic approaches for understanding and treating inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS of unknown cause that remains incurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammasome-associated caspases mediate the maturation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 and activate the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory programmed cell death, pyroptosis, was recently shown to be mediated by GSDMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report molecular evidence for GSDMD-mediated inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in both myeloid cells (macrophages/microglia) and, unexpectedly, in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (ODCs) in the CNS of patients with MS and in the MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in human microglia and ODCs in vitro after exposure to inflammatory stimuli and demonstrate caspase-1 inhibition by the small-molecule inhibitor VX-765 in both cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSDMD inhibition by siRNA transduction suppressed pyroptosis in human microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-765 treatment of EAE animals reduced the expression of inflammasome- and pyroptosis-associated proteins in the CNS, prevented axonal injury, and improved neurobehavioral performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in select glia cells is a previously unrecognized mechanism of inflammatory demyelination and represents a unique therapeutic opportunity for mitigating the disease process in MS and other CNS inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CNS_Inflammasome_Activation_and_Pyroptosis_in_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier studies have reported increased expression of inflammasome components in CNS tissues from patients with MS (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine CNS inflammasome expression in a systematic manner, a wider panel of inflammasome genes was assessed in postmortem samples from the frontal white matter of age- and sex-matched MS and non-MS patients (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript was detectable for all inflammasome-associated genes examined in human CNS tissue, with increased IL1B, IL18, CASP1, and GSDMD transcript levels in MS compared with non-MS samples (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, transcripts were detectable for all inflammasome sensors examined, including MEFV (encoding pyrin), NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2, and NLRP2 in MS tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NLRP3 expression was significantly elevated in MS white matter compared with non-MS controls (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIM2 levels were significantly elevated when all patients were included in the dataset; however, upon exclusion of the highest outlier, AIM2 transcript levels in MS patients only trended upwards compared with non-MS controls (P = 0.059 with outlier excluded versus P = 0.0365 with outlier included).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings prompted further examination of inflammasome-associated proteins in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of non-MS white matter with MS lesions revealed increased MHC class II immunoreactivity at the border of a demyelinated lesion (Fig 1 C, ii), indicating the robust recruitment of activated antigen-presenting cells in MS white matter, which was not observed in non-MS tissue (Fig 1 C, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 immunoreactivity was negligible in non-MS white matter (Fig 1 D, i), while IL-1 immunopositive cells were observed in MS tissues (Fig 1 D, ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent labeling demonstrated IL-1 immunoreactivity in MHC II+ myeloid cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase-1 immunoreactivity was detected in occasional cells in the white matter of non-MS tissue (Fig 1 E, i) but was markedly increased in MS tissues (Fig 1 E, ii) and localized within MHC II+ cells around blood vessels and in the CNS parenchyma (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although limited GSDMD immunoreactivity was observed in non-MS white matter (Fig 1 F, i), intense GSDMD immunostaining concentrated at the plasma membrane was observed in MS white matter (Fig 1 F, ii, Inset), forming a ring of fire that is consistent with GSDMDs role as a pore-forming membrane protein during pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the frequency of immunopositive cells verified a robust increase (P less_than 0.0001) in the number of IL-1+, caspase-1+, and GSDMD+ cells in white matter of MS versus non-MS patients (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In active MS lesions, cellular debris that was DAPI stained and GSDMD immunopositive was observed (Fig 1G), with only a few remaining intact nuclei, potentially indicating widespread death of GSDMD+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the intact cells, GSDMD immunolabeling was often expressed within Iba-1+ cells (Fig 1G, Insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, GSDMD was also detected in GST-pi+ ODCs (Fig 1H, Insets: GSDMD, red; GST-pi, green; DAPI, blue; overlap appears yellow), both with intact (Fig 1H) and dysmorphic (SI Appendix, Fig S1C) nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify coexpression of GSDMD with these cell markers of interest, the proportion of microglia (Iba-1+) and ODCs (GST-pi+) that were GSDMD+ was calculated in a subset of patients (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of GSDMD+ Iba-1+ microglia in MS white matter (46%) was higher than the proportion (24%) in non-MS samples (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was recapitulated in the GST-pi+ ODCs, wherein 53% of ODCs in MS white matter expressed GSDMD, compared with 38% in non-MS controls (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust increase in the proportion of microglia and ODCs expressing GSDMD underscored the potential impact of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis on MS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inflammasome_Activation_and_Pyroptosis_in_Human_Microglia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the above findings, inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in response to MS-relevant stimuli were assessed in both cultured human microglia and ODCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 was tested in both cell types to assess its efficacy for later use in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, microglia were exposed to the NLRP3 inflammasome activator nigericin with or without the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 (Fig 2) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nigericin was selected for initial VX-765 validation purposes due to its significant and reproducible induction of both inflammasome activation and pyroptosis (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, nigericin is a specific inducer of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the major sensor for DAMPs upstream of inflammasome activation; since NLRP3 emerged in MS as an inflammasome of interest (Fig 1), an NLRP3-specific, well-characterized inflammasome activator was initially used for validating VX-765 ex vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using confocal microscopy, we characterized the process of microglial pyroptosis following nigericin exposure (4 h, 5 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human microglia utilized for these experiments expressed microglial markers including Iba-1 constitutively (SI Appendix, Fig S2A), which was not significantly affected by nigericin exposure (SI Appendix, Fig S2 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nigericin-exposed microglia demonstrated a distinctive pyroptotic phenotype (Fig 2B), including the ring of fire, defined by a rounded morphology and the localization of GSDMD to the plasma membrane, often within pyroptotic bodies (Fig 2 B, i, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microglia at this stage of pyroptosis (SI Appendix, Fig S3) had an average of 7.2 ± 1.7 pyroptotic bodies per cell, averaging 8.2 ± 0.9 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ratio of GSDMD immunoreactivity in pyroptotic bodies compared with the cytoplasm was higher in microglia undergoing pyroptosis than in control cells, which had occasional membrane protrusions (P less_than 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon nigericin exposure, cell size also decreased (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 2C), which was accompanied by an increase in both IL-1 and GSDMD immunoreactivity (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effect of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on microglial pyroptosis, the proportion of microglia that demonstrated the characteristic ring-of-fire phenotype was quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 19.6% of nigericin-exposed microglia displayed the phenotype, this diminished to 9.6% when microglia were pretreated with VX-765 (P less_than 0.05) (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 (Fig 2G) and IL-18 (Fig 2H) release was also quantified following 24-h exposure to nigericin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Release of both cytokines was significantly reduced by VX-765 pretreatment in a concentration-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 release was also inhibited by VX-765 (P less_than 0.05) at earlier time points (1 h and 4 h) (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, nigericin exposure caused an increase in GSDMD and Il-1 immunoreactivity by immunoblot, which was diminished with VX-765 pretreatment (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length caspase-1 immunoreactivity was diminished with nigericin exposure, likely as a consequence of caspase-1 cleavage to form the p10 subunit upon activation; this effect was likewise inhibited by VX-765 (SI Appendix, Fig S5 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the loss of membrane integrity during pyroptosis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in cell culture supernatants, indicating extravasation of cellular contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nigericin exposure increased LDH release from microglia, while VX-765 treatment reduced its release in nigericin-exposed cells (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify GSDMD involvement in pyroptotic cell death, microglia were transfected with three GSDMD-targeting siRNAs or a universal negative siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An average knockdown of 70% was achieved over multiple biological replicates, as measured by Western blot (SI Appendix, Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knockdown caused a significant (P less_than 0.0001) decrease in LDH release in nigericin-exposed GSDMD-knockdown microglia compared with microglia transfected with nontargeting siRNA (SI Appendix, Fig S6C), thus verifying the role of GSDMD in microglial pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate these phenomena with a more MS-relevant stimulus, comparable analyses were performed in microglia exposed to extracellular ATP (1 M, 24 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP is known to contribute to the neuropathology of EAE through ligation of the P2X7 receptor (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP-exposed microglia also demonstrated a ring-of-fire phenotype including pyroptotic bodies (Fig 3 A and B, white arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with nigericin, exposure to ATP caused cellular rounding and shrinkage (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 3C) as well as an increase in both IL-1 and GSDMD intracellular immunoreactivity (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h postexposure 11.9% of ATP-exposed microglia demonstrated the ring-of-fire phenotype, which dropped to 2.3% in the presence of VX-765 (P less_than 0.05) (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with nigericin, ATP-induced IL-1 release and LDH release were significantly reduced by VX-765 pretreatment (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicated that VX-765 was an effective inhibitor of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in microglia in response to biologically relevant stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether GSDMD was equally important in ATP-induced microglial pyroptosis, microglia were transfected with three GSDMD-targeting siRNAs or a universal negative siRNA and were exposed to ATP with or without VX-765.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LDH release was significantly (P less_than 0.0001) reduced in GSDMD siRNA-transfected ATP-treated microglia (SI Appendix, Fig S6D) and was further reduced to baseline levels when GSDMD siRNA-transfected microglia were pretreated with VX-765 before ATP exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that the combination of pharmacological caspase-1 inhibition (VX-765) and genetic GSDMD inhibition (siRNA) ameliorated ATP-induced pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inflammasome_Activation_and_Pyroptosis_in_Human_Oligodendrocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that GSDMD was also observed in ODCs near or within MS lesions, pyroptosis was assessed in undifferentiated progenitors and differentiated human ODCs in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ATP is nontoxic to ODCs (44), the cells were instead exposed to increasing concentrations of TNF, an inflammasome-inducing cytokine with a well-established role in MS and known toxicity in ODCs (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNF concentration-dependent induction of pyroptosis-associated genes including GSDMD (Fig 4A) and CASP1 (Fig 4B) was observed in differentiated (growth factor negative, GF) ODCs at 24 h postexposure (P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undifferentiated (growth factor positive, GF+) progenitors, however, demonstrated minimal variations in GSDMD transcript levels and an increase in CASP1 transcript levels in response to low-dose TNF (SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were recapitulated at the protein level: caspase-1 and GSDMD immunoreactivity in differentiated ODCs increased (P less_than 0.0001) in response to TNF exposure (Fig 4 D and E), but immunoreactivity was unchanged in TNF-exposed progenitors (SI Appendix, Fig S7 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TNF-induced GSDMD immunoreactivity was decreased with VX-765 pretreatment (Fig 4E), suggesting a feedback loop in this model system whereby caspase-1 inhibition prevents further GSDMD up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiated ODCs also displayed morphological changes associated with TNF exposure (Fig 4 FH), including decreases in the number (Fig 4F) and length (Fig 4G) of processes (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were accompanied by a TNF-induced increase in the number of dysmorphic ODCs (defined by a condensed nucleus and few/no processes) in the population (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were reversed by VX-765 treatment (P less_than 0.001), providing definitive evidence that these morphological changes were caspase-1dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further evidence of nonapoptotic cell death included the release of extracellular LDH in differentiated TNF-exposed ODCs (SI Appendix, Fig S8F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this phenotype was not associated with an increase in IL1B transcript levels (SI Appendix, Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of extrinsic apoptosis-related genes, including CASP8, FADD, TRADD, and TRAF2, also revealed a lack of induction at the transcript level (SI Appendix, Fig S8 AD), suggesting that ODC cell death was unlikely to be due to apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CNS_Inflammasome_Activation_in_EAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although there is compelling evidence for inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of EAE (25, 26), the implicated genes and their temporal expression profiles within the CNS were uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it was imperative to establish whether the up-regulation of inflammasome genes observed in MS brains was recapitulated in the EAE model before considering CNS-targeted therapies to attenuate inflammasome activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, EAE was induced in C57/Bl6 mice using complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA)/MOG3555 with pertussis toxin, as previously reported by our group (46, 47), and tissues were collected at days 8 (preonset), 10 (onset), 15 (moderate disease), and 20 (peak disease) postinduction (PI) (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiling hindbrain transcript levels by RT-PCR revealed a significant increase in nlrp3 gene expression by day 8 PI, before onset of neurobehavioral deficits (Fig 5C), followed by il1b (Fig 5A), casp11 (SI Appendix, Fig S9A), and pyrin (SI Appendix, Fig S9B) at day 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Casp1 expression was significantly increased (Fig 5B) at day 15 and gsdmd at day 20 (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, ifng (SI Appendix, Fig S10E) and tnfa (SI Appendix, Fig S10A) were also significantly up-regulated in the hindbrain by day 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nlrp1, nlrc4, and aim2 were significantly up-regulated at different points in the disease course (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 C and E and S10G), while il18 was modestly up-regulated on day 15 (SI Appendix, Fig S9F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note not all NOD-like receptors were induced: nlrp6, nlrp2, and nlrp12 were unchanged (SI Appendix, Fig S10 B, D, and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oligodendrocytes_and_Myeloid_Cells_Undergo_Pyroptosis_in_EAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To extend the observations of GSDMD immunoreactivity and pyroptosis in human brains and cultured glial cells, spinal cords from CFA and EAE animals were examined, revealing an up-regulation of GSDMD (Fig 5 E, ii, shown in green) in spinal cord lesions compared with CFA-exposed control animals (Fig 5 E, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSDMD immunoreactivity was evident in Iba-1 immunopositive myeloid cells (Fig 5 E, iii; Iba-1, red; overlap with green appears yellow/orange) as well as in cells that were not Iba-1 immunopositive (Fig 5 E, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lumbar spinal cord sections were then colabeled with antibodies to GSDMD and GST-pi, revealing GST-pi immunopositive ODCs (purple) with the characteristic GSDMD immunopositive ring at the cell surface (green) in lesions (Fig 5 F, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These double-immunopositive cells were usually proximal to Iba-1immunopositive myeloid cells within the lesion (Fig 5 F, i, red), some of which were also GSDMD-immunopositive (green; overlap appears yellow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In high-magnification images (SI Appendix, Fig S11), microglia undergoing pyroptosis displayed GSDMD expression around the cell periphery, large dysmorphic nuclei, and only moderate Iba-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflammatory nature of this cell-death process was highlighted by the recruitment of GSDMD Iba-1+ reactive microglia (yellow arrows) in close proximity to GSDMD+ microglia undergoing pyroptosis (white arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify these findings, the proportions of GSDMD+ microglia and ODCs in the ventral spinal column were assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to MS patients, EAE animals displayed a significant (P less_than 0.0001) increase in the proportion of both microglia and ODCs immunopositive for GSDMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next determined whether GSDMD was expressed in ODCs coexpressing caspase-1, diminishing the likelihood that GSDMD was playing a noninflammasome-related role in ODCs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, immunofluorescent triple labeling was performed to assess caspase-1, GSDMD, and GST-pi immunoreactivity simultaneously (Fig 5 G, iv), revealing multiple GST-pi immunopositive cells (Fig 5 G, iii, purple) that were also positive for both GSDMD (Fig 5 G, iv, green) and caspase-1 (Fig 5 G, ii, red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of GST-pi+ ODCs in the ventral spinal cords from EAE animals were double immunopositive for GSDMD and caspase-1 (P less_than 0.001) (Fig 5J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSDMD-immunopositive astrocytes or neurons were not observed in the lumbar spinal cord during EAE (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EAE-Associated_Neuropathology_Is_Diminished_by_VX-765_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the striking changes in CNS inflammasome protein expression in EAE and the evidence for pyroptosis in both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells in the CNS, inhibition of caspase-1 with VX-765 was a logical experimental approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether VX-765 treatment influenced disease outcomes, EAE animals were treated with VX-765 (50 mg/kg i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  daily or with vehicle (PBS/DMSO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To recapitulate clinical circumstances, VX-765 or vehicle treatment was initiated after neurobehavioral deficits were observed (day 12 PI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Morphological analyses of spinal cords from each group were performed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, concentrating on the ventral columns because they largely mediate motor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PBS/DMSO-treated animals, the proportion of GSDMD+ microglia and oligodendrocytes decreased (P less_than 0.0001) upon treatment with VX-765 (Fig 5 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further immunohistochemistry studies revealed that parenchymal Iba-1 immunoreactivity was detected in ventral spinal cord white matter of CFA-exposed animals (Fig 6 A, i) but was markedly increased in EAE animals (Fig 6 A, ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-765 treatment attenuated myeloid cell activation as indicated by Iba-1 immunoreactivity (Fig 6 A, iii) (quantification is shown in SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 immunoreactivity was minimal in CFA-exposed animals (Fig 6 B, i) and was induced in EAE spinal cords (Fig 6 B, ii), compared with VX-765-treated animals (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 6 B, iii; quantified in Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase-1 immunoreactivity was also limited in CFA-exposed animals (Fig 6 C, i) and increased in vehicle-treated EAE animals (Fig 6 C, ii), but again caspase-1 expression was reduced with VX-765 treatment (P less_than 0.0001, quantified in Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSDMD expression was minimal in the spinal cords of CFA-exposed animals (Fig 6 D, i) but was enhanced in the spinal cords of EAE animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cells displayed GSDMD immunoreactivity at the plasma membrane (Fig 6 D, ii, Inset), consistent with pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-765 treatment suppressed GSDMD immunoreactivity (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 6 D, iii; quantified in Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VX-765_Treatment_Reduces_CNS_Inflammation__Prevents_Axonal_Injury__and_Improves_Neurobehavioral_Outcomes_in_EAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evaluation of transcript levels in spinal cord at day 20 PI revealed that il1b (Fig 7A), nlrp3 (Fig 7B), and casp1 (Fig 7C) were highly induced in the spinal cords of vehicle-treated EAE animals, but VX-765 treatment abrogated the induction of nlrp3 and casp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, other genes, including pyrin, ifng, and tnfa, were also suppressed in VX-765-treated EAE animals (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that VX-765 treatment reduced the expression of several key inflammasome- and inflammation-related genes in the CNS, pointing to an overall suppression of neuroinflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Axonal integrity was assessed by Bielchowskys silver staining in the ventral columns of spinal cords from the CFA, EAE + PBS, and EAE + VX-765 treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densely stained silver-positive axons were observed in the CFA-exposed animals (Fig 7E), while fewer silver-positive axons were detected in the EAE group (Fig 7F); VX-765 treatment preserved axonal density (Fig 7 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of motor neurons in the ventral horn was also quantified, indicating a loss of motor neurons in EAE animals at peak disease (P less_than 0.05) which was prevented by VX-765 treatment (P less_than 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the molecular and neuropathological findings indicating that inflammasome activation in EAE was suppressed by VX-765 treatment, neurobehavioral assessment permitted serial analyses of the effects of the therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-765 treatment reduced the severity of neurobehavioral deficits by day 15 PI (after only 3 d of treatment) compared with vehicle-treated EAE animals, which was sustained for most of the experiment (Fig 7I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, VX-765 treatment exerted significant and sustained beneficial effects on EAE-associated neurobehavioral deficits in conjunction with reduced CNS inflammasome activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This report provides compelling evidence for inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in both ODCs and microglia during inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological and molecular evidence of pyroptosis was observed in the CNS in both MS and EAE, indicated by caspase-1 immunoreactivity and GSDMD accumulation on the plasma membrane forming a distinctive ring of fire (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appearance mirrored that of human microglia undergoing pyroptosis in vitro, evidenced by the aggregation of GSDMD at the plasma membrane, release of inflammasome-associated cytokines, and extravasation of cellular contents (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3), all of which were prevented by pretreatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ODCs also demonstrated evidence of pyroptosis, albeit in the absence of inflammasome-associated cytokine release, thus representing an alternative paradigm in which IL-1 synthesis is not coincident with pyroptotic cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of EAE animals with VX-765 improved neurobehavioral performance, reduced neuropathological severity, and diminished molecular indicators of inflammation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the present observations defined a distinctive CNS inflammasome profile for MS and EAE, yielded the discovery of pyroptosis in microglia and ODCs during demyelination, and illustrated the potential therapeutic impact of caspase-1 inhibition using VX-765.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose a model in which dying ODCs release DAMPs that activate inflammasomes in resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These activated myeloid cells release both noninflammasome-dependent cytokines (e.g., TNF) and inflammasome-dependent cytokines (IL-1 and IL-18), which drive a persistent inflammatory cascade that activates infiltrating lymphocytes and causes neuronal and axonal toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of microglia/macrophages also undergoes pyroptosis, which further amplifies pathology through the release of neurotoxic and inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, reactive oxygen species) and intracellular DAMPs, many of which have recognized off-target effects on neurons and oligodendrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF released from activated microglia/macrophages promotes GSDMD up-regulation and pyroptosis in ODCs, further exacerbating tissue loss and demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By inhibiting caspase-1, VX-765 blocks inflammasome signaling, reduces cytokine-associated neurotoxicity, and prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in both myeloid cells and ODCs, leading to tissue preservation and improved disease outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While macrophage/microglia cell death has not been extensively characterized in MS, signs of cell degeneration in iron-containing microglia have been observed (48); this phenomenon has likely been underappreciated due to an influx of infiltrating blood-derived macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of myeloid cells with the prototypic ring of GSDMD immunoreactivity within MS and EAE lesions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 5, and 6) suggested that myeloid cells might undergo pyroptosis in the diseased brain, amplifying MS pathogenesis through the concomitant release of neurotoxic and inflammatory mediators and intracellular DAMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting microglial pyroptosis therapeutically might thus exert neuroprotective effects by preventing extravasation of cytotoxic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By contrast, damaged and dying ODCs in MS lesions are well characterized, and have been shown to express apoptotic markers (e.g., TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3), leading to the conclusion that apoptosis was at least partially responsible for ODC death (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, RIPK1-dependent necroptosis was also proposed as a mechanism for ODC degeneration, particularly in gray matter in MS (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study implicating pyroptosis in ODCs highlights the possibility that multiple cell death pathways may drive demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, certain apoptosis markers are now understood to be nonspecific; for instance, it has been shown that TUNEL labels cells undergoing both necroptosis (51) and pyroptosis (52), and cleaved caspase-3 can activate pyroptosis rather than apoptosis through the related protein gasdermin E (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that ODC death previously attributed to apoptosis or necroptosis might alternatively represent pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting GSDMD or upstream proinflammatory caspases, as shown herein, represents a paradigm-changing strategy to promote neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to therapeutically target inflammasome-associated cytokines in MS without targeting the pathways mediating cell death might have limited efficacy, as cytokine release appears to be dispensable for ODC pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, understanding caspase-mediated pyroptosis might enable the development of highly targeted approaches to mitigate neuroinflammation and promote neuroprotection in the clinical setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CNS inflammasome activation contributes to neuropathology through multiple mechanisms beyond pyroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 and IL-18 exert neurotoxic effects and activate lymphocytes infiltrating into the CNS (18, 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 enhances glutamate excitotoxicity in MS (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the well-defined role of IL-1 in the CNS during MS and EAE, inflammasome inhibition with VX-765 is a particularly apt choice, because it has been used with an acceptable safety profile in clinical trials for psoriasis (57) and epilepsy (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain penetrance data are also available for rodent models, verifying that it crosses the bloodbrain barrier (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another mechanism by which VX-765 might diminish EAE disease severity is through inflammasome inhibition in the peripheral (non-CNS) compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-18 and IL-1 promote autoreactive T cell priming and Th17 cell development and prime the endothelium for extravasation of immune cells during EAE (39, 6062).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize VX-765s effects on the peripheral response in our studies, daily VX-765 treatment was initiated after the onset of neurobehavioral signs, at which point CNS infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes was underway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ifng was significantly reduced and cd3e trended downward in the CNS of VX-765treated animals compared with vehicle-treated mice at peak disease, VX-765 did not block T cell infiltration; ifng remained up-regulated (15-fold) in the CNS compared with CFA controls, while cd3e was still induced (46-fold) in VX-765treated animals compared with CFA controls (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings implied that the efficacy of VX-765 could not be explained solely by effects on T cell infiltration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phytohemagglutinin/IL-2activated human lymphocytes also failed to show cytotoxicity with VX-765 treatment (SI Appendix, Fig S16), making T cell toxicity unlikely to be a protective mechanism during EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no inflammasome activation was detected in the spleens of EAE animals at peak disease (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that VX-765s therapeutic efficacy was not attributable to its effects on lymphocyte viability or inflammasome activation outside the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, a more direct administration route, such as intraventricular or intrathecal administration of VX-765, might clarify this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a clinical perspective, we anticipate that any effects of VX-765 on peripheral rather than CNS inflammasome activation would further attenuate the disease, given the well-established role of inflammasome-associated cytokines in T cell priming, migration, and CNS infiltration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several issues remain unanswered by the present studies, including the relative contribution of peripheral versus CNS inflammasome activation to disease pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dilemma is not addressed by contemporary inflammasome-null mouse models, in which both peripheral and CNS inflammasome functions are impacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies using the cuprizone model of demyelination in several inflammasome-null mouse models overcome this issue, as cuprizone does not have a peripheral autoimmune component (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential off-target effects of VX-765 are also an issue in terms of interpreting the current results, but the consistency of inflammasome inhibition points to a specific effect largely directed at CNS inflammasome activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the contributions of GSDMD and related gasdermins to MS pathogenesis await deeper analyses using null mice and more targeted therapeutic compounds as these reagents become available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, inflammasome activation and pyroptosis represent therapeutically targetable and previously unrecognized mechanisms driving neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in MS. Molecular profiles of CNS inflammasome activation were similar in MS and EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were complemented by evidence pointing to pyroptosis, mediated by GSDMD translocation to the plasma membrane, in both microglia/macrophages and ODCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of proinflammatory caspase activation using VX-765 resulted in reduced inflammasome activation and yielded improved outcomes in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings offer unique perspectives on MS pathogenesis and its treatment options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
