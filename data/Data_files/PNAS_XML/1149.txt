Identification of a highly neurotoxic -synuclein species inducing mitochondrial damage and mitophagy in Parkinsons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to the misfolding and aggregation of a protein called -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Synuclein aggregates found in the brains of PD patients are called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered the existence of a type of -synuclein aggregate, smaller than previously described and conformationally distinct, that we called p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* was present in neuronal cultures and mice brains injected with recombinant -synuclein fibrils as well as in the brains of PD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that p-syn* is made of trimmed -synuclein resulting from a failed cellular attempt to degrade fibrillar -synuclein aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that p-syn* is a major neurotoxic species inducing mitochondrial damage, fission, and mitophagy, therefore constituting a central player in PD pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exposure of cultured primary neurons to preformed -synuclein fibrils (PFFs) leads to the recruitment of endogenous -synuclein and its templated conversion into fibrillar phosphorylated -synuclein (p-synF) aggregates resembling those involved in Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-synF was described previously as inclusions morphologically similar to Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in PD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered the existence of a conformationally distinct, nonfibrillar, phosphorylated -syn species that we named p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We uniquely describe the existence of p-syn* in PFF-seeded primary neurons, mice brains, and PD patients brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through immunofluorescence and pharmacological manipulation we showed that p-syn* results from incomplete autophagic degradation of p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-synF was decorated with autophagic markers, but p-syn* was not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots revealed that p-syn* was N- and C-terminally trimmed, resulting in a 12.5-kDa fragment and a SDS-resistant dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After lysosomal release, p-syn* aggregates associated with mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome C release, and mitochondrial fragmentation visualized by confocal and stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* recruited phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) with which it remarkably colocalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACC1 phosphorylation indicates low ATP levels, AMPK activation, and oxidative stress and induces mitochondrial fragmentation via reduced lipoylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* also colocalized with BiP, a master regulator of the unfolded protein response and a resident protein of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are sites of mitochondrial fission and mitophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* aggregates were found in Parkin-positive mitophagic vacuoles and imaged by electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we showed that p-syn* induces mitochondrial toxicity and fission, energetic stress, and mitophagy, implicating p-syn* as a key neurotoxic -syn species and a therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Seeding_of_Primary_Neurons_with_-Syn_PFFs_Leads_to_Intracellular_Accumulation_of_Two_Conformers_of_P-Syn_with_Different_Morphologies_and_Cellular_Localization__P-Syn*_and_P-SynF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using two different antibodies specific to phosphorylated S129 -syn, we observed the existence of two distinct types of p-syn aggregates progressively accumulating over 14 d (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal demise prevented us from keeping the cultures past 2 wk postseeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first to appear and most abundant aggregates were visible as dot-like structures 23 d postinduction and rapidly formed elongated, bundled aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This form of p-syn is known to be fibrillar (20, 23) and was named p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As early as day 4, p-synF presented as long fibers similar to Lewy neurites (LNs) described in PD patients and, starting from day 6, as densely packed cage-like structures around the nucleus, always with a polarity, reminiscent of LBs (Fig 1, days 11 and 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a less abundant, mostly punctate p-syn entity was also observed, progressively accumulating in areas densely packed with p-synF in the perinuclear region; this distinctive form of p-syn was called p-syn* for p-syn STAR (-synuclein truncated adamant and reactive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells exposed to -syn monomers instead of PFFs did not accumulate p-syn aggregates (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* was found to accumulate exclusively in neuronal cells (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were made of 70% neuronal cells, with the great majority of nonneuronal cells being astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strictly selective and mutually exclusive immunoreactivity of p-syn* and p-synF toward two different antibodies both recognizing an epitope comprising phosphorylated S129 of p-syn (polyclonal and monoclonal, respectively, as described in Materials and Methods) indicated that these aggregates represent different conformers of p-syn and that the p-syn* antibody recognizes a conformational epitope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, we speculated that p-synF and p-syn* would share neither the same cellular interactome nor biological effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Syn*_Is_Also_Found_in_Vivo_in_PFF-Injected_Mice_and_PD_Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish the relevance of this finding in vivo, we examined the brains of mice stereotaxically injected with PFFs and killed after 30 d. Both p-synF and p-syn* inclusions were observed, with morphology and cellular localization remarkably similar to those in the neuronal cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the injection being made in the striatum, p-synF and p-syn* inclusions were present in both the cortex and the substantia nigra, showing the appearance of pathogenic p-syn in brain regions that project to the striatum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were more abundant in the cortex than in the substantia nigra (Fig 2 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, p-syn* conformers were also observed in brain sections of PD patients, showing the relevance of this p-syn species to human PD pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our observations in neuronal cultures, p-syn* aggregates were generally observed in the vicinity of LBs in PD patients brains (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not establish a quantitative relationship between the LB burden and the detection of p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients characteristics are presented in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Syn*_Is_a_Truncated_P-Syn_Resulting_from_Incomplete_Degradation_of_P-SynF_Fibrils  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our next series of experiments led to the discovery that p-syn* originates from a conformational change within the p-synF fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conversion appeared to take place according to three scenarios, depending on the density and thickness of the original p-synF fibril.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that these fibrils have been shown earlier to adopt a double-stranded structure (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first scenario may be described as the shedding of p-syn* from low-density, thin p-synF fibrils (Fig 3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, p-syn* appeared to be shed from the fibrils, along with a progressive disintegration of the p-synF core of the fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patches of p-syn* intermingled with patches of p-synF; ultimately the fibrillar core completely disappeared, and only newly generated p-syn* aggregates remained (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second scenario was observed with dense p-synF fibrils more clearly intertwined in a helical fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One strand of the helix unwound and was digested, giving rise to p-syn* aggregates decorating the remaining strand (Fig 3 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a third scenario, dense fibers of p-synF appeared to undergo conversion into p-syn* from one end of the fiber, with the conversion progressing toward the other end (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case one end of the fibril exhibited p-synF immunoreactivity, the other end p-syn* immunoreactivity, and a degradation front was clearly observed (Inset H2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Western blot analysis revealed that p-syn* is a truncated species of p-syn migrating at 12.5 kDa (Fig 3I, Right, red arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* was detected specifically in PFF-treated neurons in both the Triton X-100soluble and insoluble fractions, presumably corresponding to the free and fibril-bound aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* was also detected in a dimeric form at 25 kDa in the soluble and insoluble fractions of PFF-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the p-syn* antibody also detected basal levels of full-length p-syn (15-kDa band) present in the soluble fraction in both PBS- and PFF-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both a C-terminal (encompassing amino acids 129130) and an N-terminal (epitope 525) -syn antibody were able to detect p-syn* (Fig 3I, first three panels, red arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that truncated p-syn* resulted from a loss of 10 amino acids at the C terminus of p-syn and 15 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig 3I, scheme).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, a p-synF antibody, while recognizing full-length p-syn (Fig 3I, fourth panel, green arrows), did not recognize the 12.5-kDa truncated p-syn* species or the 25-kDa dimer thereof, emphasizing the differential immunoreactivity between p-syn* and p-synF (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these morphological and biochemical data show that p-syn* results from partial proteolytic degradation of p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that C-terminal truncation of p-synF, occurring at or close to amino acid 130, results in a conformational change of the epitope encompassing phosphorylated S129 along with conferring new immunoreactivity to p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Syn*_Is_a_Result_of_Incomplete_Autophagic_Degradation_of_P-SynF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
P62, an adaptor protein linking ubiquitinated protein aggregates to LC3 anchored in the membrane of the nascent autophagosome, labeled p-synF (but not p-syn*) with remarkable congruence (Fig 3 AH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strongly suggested that p-synF fibrils were undergoing autophagy and that p-syn* may result from this proteolytic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this hypothesis, we labeled PFF-treated cells with various markers recapitulating some major steps of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitin, p62, and LC3 antibodies revealed fibrillar aggregates and largely excluded p-syn* (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn*, however, was found in LAMP1-positive lysosomes (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed that p-synF underwent autophagy but that the autophagolysosomal digestion was incomplete, resulting in p-syn*bearing lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, 20S proteasomal degradation seemed to be nonspecific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells containing abundant p-synF, the 20S proteasome was found associated with p-synF fibrils but not with p-syn* aggregates (Fig S4 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells with low p-synF load, the 20S proteasome also localized with p-syn* (Fig S4 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the situation of abundant p-synF, the 20S proteasome subunit appeared up-regulated, as can be seen by the more abundant staining both in cytoplasm and nucleus compared with the PBS control or the low-fibril situation (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20S proteasome up-regulation was observed starting at 8 days post PFF seeding in neurons with a high load of fibrils and seemed to be a reaction to the failure of the cells to contain large p-synF fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a quantitative colocalization analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S4E shows the Manders colocalization coefficients for p-synF and p-syn*, confirming our observations that the great majority of p-synF was tagged by ubiquitin for degradation, subsequently engaging p62 and LC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, p-syn* colocalized mostly with LAMP1, and both p-synF and p-syn* colocalized with the 20S proteasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It appears that p-synF fibril growth was highly dynamic and was accompanied by the simultaneous formation of p-syn*, as we found p-synF aggregates engulfed in LAMP1 vesicles (autophagolysosomes or lysosomes) at days 23, before fibrils were seen in the cells (Fig 5 AC, see small p-syn* puncta in B and C) and when p-synF forms short protofibrils (Fig 5 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later on, when cells contained p-synF fibrils, LAMP1 vesicles were found engulfing the core of the fibrils (Fig 5G) or surrounding the fibrils (Fig 5H) and always contained p-syn* aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last step of p-syn* formation was the exit from the lysosomes, depicted in Fig 5 IK (see arrows pointing to p-syn* aggregates exiting disrupted lysosomes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the fluorescent dye LysoTracker Red DND-99, which stains acidic organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In p-syn*laden lysosomes (Fig 5L, arrows in the right enlarged square) LysoTracker DND-99 staining was absent, contrasting with the positive LysoTracker DND-99 signal in p-syn*negative, LAMP1-positive vesicles in the close vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that lysosomes bearing p-syn* inclusions lack the acidic internal environment, probably as a consequence of p-syn* accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, some elongated vesicles showing weak LAMP1 staining but a good LysoTracker DND-99 signal contained p-syn* inclusions organized in bead-like shapes, suggesting they were autophagolysosomes degrading a fibril (Fig 5L, arrowheads in the left enlarged square pointing to p-syn* aggregates in weakly LAMP1-positive vesicles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Autophagy_Modulation_Affects_the_Formation_of_P-Syn*  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we found that p-syn* results from autophagic degradation of p-synF, we tested whether modulation of the autophagic flux would affect the rate of p-syn* formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were treated for 2.5 days (from day 3.5 postexposure to PFFs) with autophagy modulators and were examined at the end of the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with rapamycin, an autophagy activator, resulted in the formation of larger (Fig 6B) and more numerous (Fig 6E) p-syn* aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with chloroquine, a compound disrupting lysosomal function, resulted in the net production of fewer p-syn* aggregates (Fig 6E); additionally, in a very few cells, we found a unique phenotype where cells exhibited numerous p-syn* aggregates in the absence of p-synF (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype contrasts with p-syn* otherwise being always found in cells containing p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that chloroquine treatment, by disabling lysosomes, reduces the exit rate of p-syn*, slows the phagocytic flux, and leads to a longer retention time of p-synF in autophagosomes, resulting in more complete conversion of p-synF into p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis also favors p-syn* being generated in the autophagolysosomal pathway, consistent with our observation of p-syn* inclusions in vesicles exhibiting features of autophagolysosomes (as described above; see Fig 5L, left enlarged square).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, treatment with 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), a compound which impairs the formation of autophagosomes, led to a decrease in the number of p-syn* aggregates generated (Fig 6 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, these data showed that the cellular autophagic activity level directly affects the rate of formation of p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

After_Lysosomal_Release__p-Syn*_Targets_Mitochondria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before lysosomal release, nascent p-syn* aggregates were found in the vicinity of mitochondrial networks but not colocalizing with them, and they sometimes harbored a serpentine morphology (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 AD and 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, mature, granular p-syn* aggregates were found abutting the end of mitochondrial tubules (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy (with spatial resolution less_than50 nm) to verify the direct association of p-syn* aggregates with the outer mitochondrial membrane (labeled with Tom20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* was found colocalizing with Tom20 on mitochondrial tubules (Fig 7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7F shows smaller p-syn* aggregates, allowing us to visualize the association with mitochondrial tubules and also with circular mitochondrial structures that might represent fissioned mitochondria (Fig 7F, Upper Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* deposition was frequently associated with areas of mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig 7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Syn*_Is_Mitotoxic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Life_Cycle_of_a_Mitotoxic_P-Syn_Species_Resulting_from_Failed_Degradation_of_P-SynF_Fibrils  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starting from our primary observation of p-syn* as a unique conformational -syn species, we performed a series of experiments to determine how p-syn* was generated, to which cellular organelle it localized, and what were its biological effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The life cycle of p-syn* is depicted in Fig 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model is as follows: In PFF-seeded neurons, -syn misfolds and forms primarily fibrillar p-synF aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-synF activates autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, autophagolysosomal degradation is incomplete and/or abnormal, generating an N- and C-terminally trimmed p-syn species, p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal truncation exposes a conformational epitope at the C terminus comprising pSer129, conferring p-syn* unique immunoreactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* is generated in autophagolysosomes and impairs the lysosomes, from which it eventually exits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* then attaches to mitochondria where it induces functional damage (ACC1 inactivation, loss of mitochondrial potential associated with oxidative and energetic stress), structural damage (mitochondrial fragmentation), and cytochrome C release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn* localizes to mitochondriaMAMs contacts (33) containing the misfolded protein response protein BiP (GRP78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAMs are involved in parkin-dependent mitophagy induction (34) that results from p-syn*induced mitochondrial fission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The life cycle of p-syn* ends with the mitophagic disposition of mitochondrial debris along with p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PFFs are internalized into neurons in culture, leading to the recruitment of endogenous -syn and the progressive accumulation of p-syn inclusions reminiscent of LBs and LNs (herein called p-synF) (14, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-syn aggregates persist despite colocalizing with components of the autophagic and proteasomal protein degradation machineries; thus it has been suggested that the aggregates are refractory to clearance (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we identified a unique conformation of p-syn with immunoreactivity to a different pS129 -syn antibody than that previously used to identify p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We named this p-syn species p-syn* due to its highly detrimental biological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, p-syn* is an N- and C-terminally trimmed p-syn species generated by incomplete autophagolysosomal degradation of p-synF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-terminal truncations of -syn by several proteases, such as calpain and cathepsin D, have been shown to promote fibrillization (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, an endolysosomal protease, asparagine endopeptidase, has been shown to cleave -syn N-terminally in the brain of PD patients and to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the light of our findings, we reinterpret the persistence and increase of p-syn fibrils in neuronal cells as resulting from a highly dynamic system, where p-syn fibrils are continuously degraded, as suggested by their tight association with markers of autophagic degradation, thereby generating p-syn* that migrates away from the fibrils and mediates neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth of p-synF fibrils is faster than fibril degradation, resulting in a net increase in cellular fibrillar content over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by our observation of p-synF being engulfed by autophagolysosomal vesicles as early as day 3, when p-synF is still in the protofibrillar stage (Fig 5 AF), with the appearance of spots of p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-synF then appears as increasingly long fibrils, sometimes entangled to form LB-like inclusions, but still being covered by autophagic markers and vesicles containing p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological variations in p-synF fibrils result in a variety of appearances of the p-synF degradation process (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logically, then, analysis of Manders colocalization coefficients showed that p-synF colocalized preponderantly with ubiquitin, the autophagy adaptor protein p62, and the autophagosomal marker LC3, while p-syn* colocalized mainly with LAMP1, labeling autophagolysosomes and lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the 20S proteasomal subunit decorated both p-synF and p-syn* (albeit p-synF preferentially, since p-syn* labeling was observed in low-fibril conditions) (Fig S4), which is interpreted as nonspecific ubiquitin-independent degradation, as p-syn* was rarely ubiquitinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the 20S proteasomal subunit by itself has limited and nonspecific proteolytic activity in an ubiquitin-independent fashion (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PFF seeding of neurons has been shown to induce adverse effects such as defective vesicular transport (23), elevated dendritic mitochondrial oxidant stress (38), and synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that p-synF fibrils sequester endogenous -syn, leading to a reduction of -syn labeling at the dendritic spines, likely accounting, at least in part, for the synaptic dysfunction (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial pathology in PD (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the neurotoxic mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal demise in PD are still largely unknown, and a direct relationship between the deposition of abnormal -syn and mitochondrial damage has not been established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that p-syn* represents the missing link between LB deposition and mitochondrial toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several facts support the role of p-syn* as a major mitotoxic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, using confocal and STED microscopy, we observed that p-syn* directly associates with mitochondrial tubules and with fragmented mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while p-syn* colocalized extensively with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20, mitochondrial tubules capped by p-syn* lacked MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeling, showing loss of inner membrane potential (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in agreement with previous findings that cell treatment with aggregated -syn leads to impairment of complex I of the electron transport chain and to reduced ATP and increased ROS production (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study also showed that a phosphomimetic mutant of -syn, S129E, binds to Tom20 and inhibits mitochondrial protein import (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, p-syn* inclusions usually colocalized with areas of increased cytochrome C staining (Fig 9 A and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytochrome C accumulation occurs after mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization, and its release is thought to follow outer membrane permeabilization (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, p-syn* remarkably colocalized with and sequestered pACC1 (Fig 9 B, D, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACC1 is phosphorylated upon AMPK activation due to increased AMP levels, ATP deprivation, and oxidative stress (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACC1 is listed in Mitocarta as a potential mitochondrial disease gene (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of mitochondrial ACC1 is necessary for fatty acid synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support the notion that p-syn* induces the recruitment of phosphorylated and inactive ACC1 at the mitochondrial membranes, thereby leading to decreased lipoylation and mitochondrial fragmentation mimicking an AAC1-knockdown phenotype (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, AMPK has independently been found to mediate mitochondrial fission (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, p-syn* was found in the vicinity of or associated with BiP (Fig 9C), a chaperone that is a master regulator of the UPR and a resident protein of the MAMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAMs are the sites of initiation of mitochondrial fission and Parkin-regulated mitophagy (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed p-syn* inclusions in parkin-positive mitophagic vacuoles (Fig 10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EM imaging of late-stage PFF-exposed neurons showed that the majority of p-syn* aggregates were found in mitophagic vacuoles abutting cytochrome C-positive, fragmented mitochondria (Fig 10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these findings position p-syn* as a major mitotoxic species triggering ACC1 inactivation, structural and functional mitochondrial damage, and mitophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of p-syn* raises the question as to whether this p-syn species induces ACC1 phosphorylation solely via AMPK activation or in conjunction with other kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, JNK activation has been shown to be involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic cell loss in animal models of neurodegeneration (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association of p-syn* with BiP also entails UPR activation, which remains to be examined in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other intriguing questions are whether p-syn* is involved not only in neurotoxicity but also in intracellular templating of endogenous -syn and whether p-syn* is propagated intercellularly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect p-syn* in the culture medium, but it might have been due to low levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of exosomes as vectors of intercellular communication and material exchange is a fascinating area of biology, and exosomes contribute to the propagation of misfolded proteins and -syn oligomers in particular (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular p-syn* also may simply result from neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the existence of an autoimmune response directed toward specific antigenic epitopes of p-syn in 40% of PD patients has been recently described (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two major antigenic epitopes clusters were found, one being centered around Y39 (two epitopes) and the other around S129 (three epitopes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the three S129 epitopes comprises amino acids 116130, corresponding to the C terminus of p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, p-syn* may be a player in driving the recently described autoimmune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our findings show that the exposure of phosphorylated S129 in p-syn* changes the immunoreactivity of the trimmed protein, which loses reactivity toward the p-synF antibody but becomes recognized by a different antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that pharmacological activation of autophagy exacerbates the production of p-syn*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, autophagy impediment reduces p-syn* production (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that any therapeutic approach aimed at accelerating the removal of fibrillary p-syn aggregates/LBs with autophagy enhancers should be considered very carefully, as it might result in the production of more toxic and/or immunogenic p-syn degradation products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PD, like other PMNDs [AD, ALS, and CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD)] is primarily due to the misfolding and aggregation of a host protein causing neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of these diseases, the involvement of large protein aggregates (amyloid plaques in AD and CJD and LBs in PD) in neurotoxicity is a matter of intense scrutiny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consensus emerged that oligomers, generated on or off the pathway to amyloid formation or resulting from fibril degradation, are primary players in protein-misfolding toxicity (4952).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of p-syn in PD pathology was recognized exactly two decades ago (10), and numerous studies have examined the morphology and localization of -syn aggregates (14, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the concept has emerged of the existence of different strains of -syn aggregates by analogy to prions, which are aggregates of misfolded prion protein (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was a need to identify toxic conformations of -syn and define their relationship to Lewy pathology (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study uniquely describes p-syn*, a small aggregate resulting from the failed degradation of p-synF fibrils, made of a truncated and conformationally distinct form of p-syn, and the direct link between p-syn* and injured mitochondria as well as with molecular actors of metabolic stress signaling, mitochondrial fragmentation, and mitophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of our findings is supported by the detection of p-syn* not only in our cell culture model but also in the brains of mice injected with PFF and in PD patients brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that p-syn* is a neurotoxic species central to the pathogenesis of PD and should be considered a therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
