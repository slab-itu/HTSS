Allometric scaling of estuarine ecosystem metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coastal margins host some of the most productive habitats on the planet, yet there is still significant uncertainty about the magnitude of carbon fluxes across the land/ocean interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling up in situ measurements into whole-ecosystem estimates of how these habitats contribute to global biogeochemical cycling has been hindered by their apparent heterogeneity, complex circulation, and sizes that range from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, I show that estuarine ecosystem metabolism varies predictably with ecosystem size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of this study is not simply that larger estuaries have lower specific ecosystem metabolism than smaller estuaries, but that this size scaling arises because the residence time of limiting nutrients does not scale isometrically with estuary size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are still significant uncertainties in the magnitude and direction of carbon fluxes through coastal ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important component of these biogeochemical budgets is ecosystem metabolism, the net result of organismal metabolic processes within an ecosystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, I present a synthesis of published ecosystem metabolism studies from coastal ecosystems and describe an empirical observation that size-dependent patterns in aquatic gross primary production and community respiration exist across a wide range of coastal geomorphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecosystem metabolism scales to the 3/4 power with volume in deeper estuaries dominated by pelagic primary production and nearly linearly with area in shallow estuaries dominated by benthic primary production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results can be explained by applying scaling arguments for efficient, directed transport networks developed to explain similar size-dependent patterns in organismal metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main conclusion from this synthesis is that the residence time of new, nutrient-rich water is a fundamental organizing principle for the observed patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residence time changes allometrically with size in pelagic ecosystems because velocities change by only an order of magnitude across systems that span more than ten orders of magnitude in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nonisometric change in velocity with size requires lower specific metabolic rates at larger ecosystem sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change in transport may also explain a shift from predominantly net heterotrophy to net autotrophy with increasing size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaling results are applied to the total estuarine area in the continental United States to estimate the contribution of estuarine systems to the overall coastal budget of organic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Metabolic_Scaling_for_Estuaries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consider an estuary of areal extent A and mean depth H with volume V=AH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this ecosystem there are n organisms that produce or respire organic carbon with an abundance per unit volume (organismal density) =n/V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary production and the formation of new biomass is generally limited by the availability of fixed inorganic nitrogen (31); respiration of organic carbon is tightly coupled to this production (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conservation of mass requires ecosystem metabolism to be the sum of the individual metabolic rates or, equivalently, the average (denoted by the overbar) organismal rate times the number of individuals: B=nbi=nb¯i (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total ecosystem metabolismB=Vb¯i=VE[1]is therefore a function of ecosystem size V and the average metabolic rate per unit volume, B/V=E=b¯i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain the observations in Fig 1, the goal is to establish how B and E vary with the size of the ecosystem V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possibility is to suppose that E is independent of V. Indeed, this is the result that is obtained if well-documented allometric relationships for abundance and metabolism as a function of organismal size are applied to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As organismal size vi increases, metabolic rate increases (33) b¯ivi while abundance decreases (34, 35) vi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaling exponent  for the sizemetabolism relationship in marine phytoplankton is often observed to be close to Kleibers 3/4 scaling (27), with deviations due to the physiology of nutrient uptake limitation (33); abundance is generally found to scale as the reciprocal of metabolism (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inserting these relationships into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 yields the prediction that ecosystem metabolism is independent of organism size and so scales linearly with ecosystem size: BVvivi=Vvi0; equivalently, the specific metabolic rate is independent of ecosystem size: B/V=EV0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the observations show that specific metabolism scales as EV1/4 and I argue next that this is because nutrient residence time does not scale isometrically with ecosystem size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relationships in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and observations in Fig 1 can be explained by modeling the nutrient delivery that supports coastal ecosystem metabolism as an efficient, directed-transport network (24, 26, 38), the scaling of which predicts how metabolic demand is limited by the flux of material through the system as a function of its size and dimensionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a D-dimensional system, it has been shown theoretically (24, 38) that efficient material flux (which is equal to the metabolic demand B at steady state) scales allometrically with the size of the transport network Q asBQD(D+1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]How metabolic demand ultimately scales with the system size depends on whether the transport network (i.e., the fluid environment) is internal or external to the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is evident in two cases: (i) pelagic ecosystems, where the transport network is internal to the system (and, in fact, is the system) and organisms are distributed in 3D space, and (ii) benthic ecosystems, where the transport network is external to the system and organisms are distributed in 2D space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of pelagic ecosystems, the volume of the transport network is constrained to scale isometrically with system size: QVLD, where L is a characteristic physical length scale and D=3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining this constraint with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, BLDDD+1V3/4 predicts that pelagic ecosystem metabolism should scale with volume to the 3/4 power (equivalently, specific ecosystem metabolism should scale with size to the 1/4 power: B/V=EV1/4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of benthic ecosystems, size is defined by area ALD with D=2; the fluid transport is external to the benthos, however, and so the transport network contains an extra dimension than the arrangement of metabolic sites (i.e., organisms): QLD+1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining this with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, BLD+1DD+1LDA predicts that benthic ecosystem metabolism should scale linearly with area (equivalently, specific metabolism should be independent of area: EA0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This theoretical scaling suggests there are two limits for estuarine ecosystem metabolism: shallow and deep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary production should shift from scaling linearly with area across shallow systems dominated by benthic primary production to scaling with volume to the 3/4 power across deeper ecosystems dominated by pelagic primary production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two scaling limits for benthic and pelagic ecosystems become evident when the dataset is separated into shallow and deep subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here I use a depth threshold of 2 m, which is consistent with a shift from predominantly benthic to pelagic primary production (Fig 1C); the results are not overly sensitive to this cutoff (discussion in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is good agreement between the observations and predicted scaling, particularly given that the compiled results have not been adjusted for nutrient loading, temperature, latitude, habitat, or methodological differences (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across shallow ecosystems, PA0.94V0.90 and HA0.04; metabolism across the deep ecosystems scales as PV0.75A0.91 and HA0.14 (Table 1 and Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaling for metabolism as a function of area in the deep subset is statistically different from PA at the 95% confidence interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Residence_Time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One conclusion to be drawn from these results is that a 3D transport network is a fundamental aspect of estuarine ecosystem metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is notable insofar as a typical approach in estuarine physics is to simplify the equations of motion on the basis of geometric scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, estuaries are much longer than they are wide and many orders of magnitude longer than they are deep (LxLyLz); these order of magnitude differences in geometry allow the NavierStokes equations to be reduced to the leading-order terms at the scale of interest, such as the along-channel response of estuarine salinity structure to river flow and tidal mixing (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this typical hydrodynamics approach, it might be expected that ecosystem metabolism would also scale as a one-dimensional network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But a one-dimensional ecosystem is inconsistent with the observation that BV3/4, because BQ1/2 (from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 with D=1) would require a transport network that increased superlinearly with size: QV3/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a 2D transport network, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 predicts BQ2/3; under the constraints of fluid transport (QV), pelagic metabolism would scale as BV2/3, a result that is statistically unlikely given the error bounds in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the only scenario that can match both the observations and scaling arguments across benthic and pelagic ecosystems is one where nutrient delivery to primary producers within aquatic ecosystems occurs through a transport network that scales three-dimensionally as QL3, a result that is central to understanding the observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can understand the different scaling in benthic and pelagic marine ecosystems by considering the relevant timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Banavar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26, 38) define a service volume D that satisfies the constraint EDV0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By definition, the volume (for D=3) or area (for D=2) D is inversely proportional to the specific metabolic rate and so  scales the distance traveled by a metabolite in a unit of time  given the speed u at which that metabolite is transported through the ecosystem: =u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metabolic time is the reciprocal of a characteristic organismal growth rate =1 and is independent of ecosystem size (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Introducing ED into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, we can rearrange the terms to understand that patterns in ecosystem metabolism as a function of ecosystem size are driven by changes in the ratio of a transport time to growth time,BLDLuDTD,[3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where T=L/u is a system-scale transport time: the average residence time of new, nutrient-rich water entering the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same ratio of parameters L/u emerges independently from dimensional analysis, lending support to efficient transport network scaling (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 shows that as residence time increases, total metabolism also increases; as the growth rate goes to zero, metabolic time becomes infinite and total metabolism goes to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 produces a relation for residence time as a function of the size and dimensionality of the transport network: TQ1/(D+1) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I have shown that the size of the transport network in both benthic and pelagic ecosystems scales as QL3, and so we have the insight that nutrient residence time in estuaries scales isometrically with size TL across shallow systems but allometrically with size TL3/4 across deep systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equivalently, the characteristic velocity scales as uL0 across shallow systems and uL1/4 across deep systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although this velocity scaling emerges from consideration of the spatial and temporal scales of material flux through a generic transport network, it is consistent with the fact that velocity is a function of depth in estuaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the freshwater Froude number Frf=u/(gSoceanH)1/2 (the net velocity due to river flow scaled by the maximum possible frontal propagation speed, where gSocean approximates the along-estuary baroclinic density gradient with a coefficient of haline contraction, gravity, and the ocean salinity) must be less than or equal to one, and so u scales at most as H1/2 for baroclinic flows; likewise, the barotropic tide is balanced by a friction term where uH1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it naturally follows that velocity is constant (in a scaling sense) across shallow systems because the depth is constant (HA0), whereas velocity increases allometrically with pelagic ecosystem size owing to the allometric geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is perhaps counterintuitive that increasing velocity leads to sublinear size scaling for pelagic ecosystem metabolism, given the general paradigm that production is intrinsically linked to mechanical energy (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One might reason that an increasing velocity with increasing ecosystem size would lead to greater productivity per unit area, but the metabolic time remains fixed and so increasing velocity results in a larger service volume, with the consequence that metabolism per unit size decreases (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we consider how net ecosystem production scales with size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While NEP=PR, P/R is plotted for representation on a log scale, such that log10P/Rless_than0 is net heterotrophic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the regression of P/R as a function of size (Fig 3) and the ratio of the coefficients derived individually for P and R (Table 1) indicate that most estuaries are net heterotrophic, consistent with the current consensus from budget estimates (3, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synthesis shows that NEP is a positive function of both area and volume, indicating a shift toward net autotrophy in larger, deeper ecosystems, although the error bounds are large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While clearly numerous factors contribute to the metabolic poise of an ecosystem (39, 45), this shift is reasonable in the context of the residence time dynamics discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we consider that there is a time lag between the formation of new organic carbon via net primary production and the respiration of that organic matter by grazers and/or decomposers and that this time lag is independent of ecosystem size, then the fraction of locally produced organic matter that is also locally respired within the system must decrease as velocities increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With isometric transport across shallow systems, larger systems are just as efficient at retaining material as smaller systems and so show no change in NEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Summary_and_Applications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
I compiled gross primary production, community respiration, and geomorphological data to test the hypothesis that estuarine ecosystem metabolism varies predictably with size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I found that that size-dependent patterns in gross primary production and community respiration exist across a wide range of coastal geomorphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling arguments for transport networks derived to explain patterns in organismal biology, as well as dimensional analysis, provide a plausible explanation for the observation that deeper systems, which are dominated by pelagic primary production, scale with volume to the 3/4 power whereas metabolic rates across shallow systems scale nearly linearly with area and volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main conclusion from this synthesis is that the residence time of new, nutrient-rich water is the basic organizing principle for the observed patterns of ecosystem metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residence time changes allometrically with size in pelagic ecosystems because velocities change by an order of magnitude across systems that span more than 10 orders of magnitude in size; a nonisometric change in velocity with size requires lower specific metabolic rates at larger ecosystem sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results may provide a unifying framework for the synthesis of coastal processes on regional and global levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such application could be to use the scaling equations to represent biogeochemical processes at subgrid scales in global geochemical models, although further work to reduce the error bounds is required to this end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible application is the formulation of detailed carbon-cycling budgets using very basic data that can be derived from aerial imagery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the empirical coefficients for the shallow and deep systems (as a function of area) can be applied to the estuarine intertidal (E1) and subtidal (E2) habitat types, respectively, in the US National Fish and Wildlife National Wetland Inventory dataset (46) (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken in sum, this method provides regional estimates of the role of estuaries in carbon cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this method, I estimate that estuaries along the US Atlantic Coast support 3.2 Tg Cy1 of gross primary production and respire 4.6 Tg Cy1, with a net balance of 1.4 Tg Cy1 over a total estuarine area of 45,950 km2, or 2.5 mol Cm2 y1 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herrmann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) estimate via a detailed budget synthesis using the National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment survey (47) that NEP for US East Coast estuaries is 1.5 Tg Cy1 over an area of 37,764 km2, equivalent to 3.3 mol Cm2y1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an improved understanding of why and how individual ecosystems deviate from the broader size-scaling trend, allometric scaling may be used to create robust estimates of the contribution that estuaries make to the global carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
