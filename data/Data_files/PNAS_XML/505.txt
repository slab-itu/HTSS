Role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and its variants in human cytomegalovirus control in vitro and in vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a growing health problem, creating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers for risk of infection are lacking, and the limited drugs that inhibit HCMV have major side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New strategies for virus control are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report on the role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor, in HCMV suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 activation (through IKK and IRF3) resulted in IFN response and HCMV inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific mutations in NOD1 showed differential effects on HCMV replication in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a nested study of HCMV vaccine, specific polymorphisms in NOD1 were detected in HCMV-infected women compared with noninfected women.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides direction for studies of innate immune response to HCMV and genetic susceptibility through NOD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Induction of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and downstream receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is known to up-regulate antiviral responses and suppress virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), which also signals through RIPK2, in HCMV control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 activation by Tri-DAP (NOD1 agonist) suppressed HCMV and induced IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse CMV was also inhibited through NOD1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 knockdown (KD) or inhibition of its activity with small molecule ML130 enhanced HCMV replication in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 mutations displayed differential effects on HCMV replication and antiviral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells overexpressing the E56K mutation in the caspase activation and recruitment domain, virus replication was enhanced, but in cells overexpressing the E266K mutation in the nucleotide-binding domain or the wild-type NOD1, HCMV was inhibited, changes that correlated with IFN- expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction of NOD1 and RIPK2 determined the outcome of virus replication, as evidenced by enhanced virus growth in NOD1 E56K mutant cells (which failed to interact with RIPK2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 activities were executed through IFN-, given that IFN- KD reduced the inhibitory effect of Tri-DAP on HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signaling through NOD1 resulting in HCMV suppression was IKK-dependent and correlated with nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IRF3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, NOD1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of HCMV infection in women who were infected with HCMV during participation in a glycoprotein B vaccine trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data indicate a role for NOD1 in HCMV control via RIPK2- IKK-IRF3 and suggest that its polymorphisms predict the risk of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOD1_Activation_Suppresses_HCMV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously reported that NOD2 expression was undetectable in noninfected HFFs but significantly induced after HCMV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 mRNA was abundant in noninfected HFFs and increased only modestly after infection (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the expression of NOD1 mRNA and protein was measured at 18 and 72 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a twofold to fourfold increase in NOD1 mRNA at both time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP pretreatment induced NOD1 mRNA to similar levels at 72 h. NOD1 protein was already expressed in noninfected cells, and no significant change in its expression was observed after infection; however, its activation by pretreatment with Tri-DAP (10 g/mL) resulted in HCMV inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus suppression was confirmed by decreased pp28-luciferase activity in second cycle infection (Fig 1C), viral protein expression (Fig 1D), and a plaque reduction assay using the Towne strain (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Tri-DAP on HCMV replication was not secondary to cellular toxicity, as in treated HFFs during the same time frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP did not affect cell viability (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Tri-DAP was specific to HCMV, given that HSV-1 was not inhibited after Tri-DAP pretreatment (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_NOD1-Dependent_Anti-MCMV_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BALB/c mice (34 wk) were pretreated with iE-DAP (Invivogen), 500 g once daily for 2 d, followed by infection with MCMV at 106 PFU/mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iE-DAP activity was confirmed by the induction of the chemokine RANTES in serum samples collected at 4 h after administration of the second dose (P less_than 0.01) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 14 d postinfection, mice were killed, intracardiac blood samples were collected, and tissue homogenates were prepared for plaque assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In iE-DAPpretreated mice, real-time PCR for gB (P less_than 0.001) (Fig 2B) and plaque numbers in salivary glands, liver, and spleen (P less_than 0.001) (Fig 2C) were significantly reduced compared with values in infected-only mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ganciclovir (GCV), used as a direct antiviral agent, inhibited MCMV, as expected (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NOD1_KD_or_Inhibition_of_Its_Activity_Results_in_Enhanced_HCMV_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that NOD1 activation limited HCMV replication, we tested the effect of NOD1 KD or inhibition of its activity by the small molecule ML130.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using shRNA for NOD1, we found decreases in NOD1 mRNA of 80% in noninfected HFFs and 50% in HCMV-infected HFFs (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On infection, a twofold to threefold reduction in NOD1 protein expression was observed in NOD1 KD cells compared with control cells (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase activity from pp28 (Fig 3C) and Western blot analysis for pp65 were measured in control (GIPZ) and NOD1 KD cells (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first replication cycle, there was no difference in pp28-luciferase activity between control and NOD1 KD cells; however, after the second cycle, pp28-luciferase activity and pp65 expression were increased in NOD1 KD cells compared with control cells (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus titers measured using supernatants collected from the first cycle showed a mild (nonsignificant) increase in plaque numbers in NOD1 KD cells (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that NOD1 might play a role in suppressing HCMV; however, because of its abundance in noninfected and infected cells, we suspected that the effects of its KD were moderate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To achieve a more significant inhibition of NOD1 activity, we used ML130, a specific NOD1 inhibitor (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ML130 did not affect cell viability even at a concentration of 100 µM, as determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolim bromide (MTT) assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HFFs were pretreated with ML130 for 72 h at a concentration sufficient to inhibit NOD1 activity (5 M) but not NOD2 or TNF- activity, followed by HCMV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant increase was observed in second cycle pp28-luciferase activity (Fig 3F) and virus titer (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of ML130 was specific to HCMV, given that pretreatment of HFFs followed by HSV-1 infection did not change the number of plaques (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Effects_of_NOD1_Mutations_on_HCMV_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether mutations in specific regions of NOD1 affect HCMV replication, we generated stable cell lines overexpressing wild-type (WT) NOD1 and two NOD1 mutants, E56K (in the CARD) and E266K (in the NBD), using a doxycycline-inducible lentivirus system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E56K mutation was reported to abrogate NOD1 signaling by abolishing its interaction with RIPK2 (23, 24), indicating a role for NOD1RIPK2 interaction in executing downstream signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E266K mutation in NOD1 has been suggested to increase the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection (25); however, its effect on NOD1 function remains undetermined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After doxycycline induction, NOD1 mRNA was induced by 75- to 160-fold (Fig 4A), and the expression of NOD1 protein was increased in the overexpressing cell lines compared with Tripz control (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured HCMV replication in the different NOD1-overexpressing cells and found that pp28-luciferase activity was reduced by 60% at 96 hpi in the WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, but was increased in the E56K- overexpressing cells (Fig 4 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants collected after the first cycle were used for second cycle infection and virus titration (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant virus inhibition was observed in the NOD1 WT and E266K cells, as opposed to increased HCMV replication in the E56K-overexpressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of HCMV proteins correlated with luciferase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant decreases in IE1/2, UL44, and pp65 were seen in cells overexpressing NOD1 WT or the E266K mutant; however, cells overexpressing the E56K NOD1 mutant consistently showed an inability to suppress HCMV or its protein expression (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for IE1/2 using a clinical isolate of HCMV showed reduced IE1/2 expression in NOD1 WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, but not in E56K-overexpressing cells (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes in HCMV replication/protein expression were not secondary to lentivirus transduction or cellular toxicity; virus uptake was similar irrespective of the overexpressing cell line, based on pp65 level at 2 hpi (Fig 4G), and the MTT assay revealed no effect on cell viability after 4 d of doxycycline induction (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these effects were not secondary to altered cytokine expression induced by HCMV infection of the different cell lines; infection with purified HCMV Towne showed the same pattern of luciferase activity and viral protein expression depending on the cell line used (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, HSV-1 replication was not altered in any of the overexpressing cell lines after 24 h (first cycle) or 48 h (second cycle; Fig 4I), again indicating no role for NOD1 in controlling HSV-1 replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data reveal that specific functional mutations in NOD1 may affect HCMV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm that the observed antiviral activity in cells overexpressing the NOD1 WT or mutants was through NOD1, we performed Tri-DAP pretreatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in cells overexpressing the WT or E266K NOD1, luciferase activity was significantly inhibited (Fig S2A) and the expression level of viral proteins was reduced (Fig S2B); however, in the E56K-overexpressing cells, Tri-DAP pretreatment did not result in HCMV inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Signaling_Downstream_of_NOD1_in_HCMV-Infected_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tri-DAP activates a signaling pathway downstream of NOD1, through NF-B (26), and the antiviral response to HCMV involves IRF3 (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because IFN- is responsive to these transcription factors, we tested signaling in NOD1 KD and Tri-DAPpretreated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured IL-8 and IFN- transcripts in NOD1 KD and control cells at 24 hpi (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection resulted in a 14-fold increase in both IL8 and IFN- in GIPZ control cells, but only sixfold and twofold increases, respectively, in NOD1 KD cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant reduction in IFN- expression was observed in infected NOD1 KD cells compared with control cells (P less_than 0.01), but no change in RIG-I transcripts was observed, supporting the specificity of the NOD1 KD system (Fig 5A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured NF-B (p65) expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control cells, HCMV infection resulted in NF-B localization into the nucleus, but in the NOD1 KD cells, the changes in NF-B localization were not as evident (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOD1 activation by Tri-DAP followed by HCMV infection induced IFN- mRNA (Fig 5C, Left), as well as secreted IFN- (Fig 5C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the expression of RIPK2, NF-B, and IRF3 at 24 hpi in Tri-DAPpretreated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection induced cytoplasmic expression of RIPK2, which was further induced in infected Tri-DAPpretreated cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the effect of infection, Tri-DAP induced NF-B in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP treatment followed by infection further increased NF- in both fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of IRF3 activation differed from that of NF-B, in that pretreatment with Tri-DAP without infection did not change nuclear IRF3 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Tri-DAP on IRF3 phosphorylation was enhanced only after infection (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that NOD1 activation results in enhanced downstream signaling, some independent of infection (NF-B) and others triggered only by HCMV infection (IFN pathway).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Signaling_Induced_Downstream_of_NOD1_WT_and_NOD1_Mutant_Cell_Lines_on_HCMV_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that HCMV replication was restricted in NOD1 WT and E266K mutant cell lines, but not in those overexpressing the E56K mutant, we tested the signaling induced by these constructs in transfected HEK293.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids encoding for NOD1 WT, E56K, and E266K were cotransfected with NF-B or IFN- luciferase reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of NOD1 WT or E266K plasmid induced NF-B activity in HEK293, but the E56K mutant failed to induce NF-B (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No induction of IFN- was seen with any of the plasmids (Fig 6B), in agreement with the data Fig 5D, demonstrating that IRF3 activation through NOD1 occurred only on infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-8 and IFN- mRNA was measured in the stably transduced overexpressing cells at 24 h after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-8 mRNA was induced in control, NOD1 WT, and E266K-overexpressing cells, but enhanced induction was not observed in the E56K-overexpressing cells (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, IFN- was induced on infection of control cells, and enhanced induction was observed in WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, but not in E56K-overexpressing cells (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured the expression of proteins downstream of NOD1 in the HCMV-infected overexpressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RIPK2 induction was observed in infected NOD1 WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, but not in E56K-overexpressing cells (Fig 6E), and phospho-IRF3 was not induced in the latter (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear translocation of NF-B was observed on infection of WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, but not of E56K-overexpressing cells (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone 3 levels also were reduced in the nuclear fraction of E56K (Fig 6F), whereas lamin B levels were similar among all of the cell lines, possibly representing NF-Bmediated changes in histone 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B expression is regulated by inhibitory IB proteins, which are regulated by upstream IKKs (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of IB proteins results in their degradation and release of the NF-B complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas IB was reduced in WT and E266K-overexpressing cells, its expression was increased in E56K-overexpressing cells, supporting the lack of nuclear translocation of NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation of RIPK2, followed by immunoblotting for NOD1-His, showed that an intact RIPK2NOD1 interaction in all overexpressing cells except the E56K cells (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional confirmation for the NOD1RIPK2 interaction was obtained in RIPK2 KD cells (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP pretreatment in these cells did not reduce CMV-pp65 expression (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expected induction of IFN- and CXCL10 mRNA was observed in the control line, but not in the RIPK2 KD cells (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that NOD1 activation suppresses HCMV replication, and that mutations in NOD1 that potentially affect its interaction with RIPK2 and resulting downstream signaling will determine its capability to suppress HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NOD1_and_NOD2_Cooperate_in_HCMV_Inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings indicate that HCMV suppression is achieved through NOD1 activation and its interaction with RIPK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our previous report of HCMV inhibition by the NOD2 activator, MDP (14), here we investigated the combined effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment of HFFs with MDP together with Tri-DAP augmented virus suppression to a greater degree than pretreatment with MDP or Tri-DAP alone, based on first and second replication cycle (Fig S4A), plaque reduction (Fig S4B), and viral protein expression (Fig S4C) data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HCMV_Inhibition_via_NOD1_Requires_IFN-  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Tri-DAP pretreatment inhibited HCMV replication along with IFN- induction, and because the NOD1-overexpressing cells exhibited differing effects on IFN- mRNA, we tested whether the effects of Tri-DAP in HCMV-infected cells are IFN-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, control and IFN- KD cells were pretreated with Tri-DAP, followed by infection [at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP pretreatment reduced HCMV plaque formation and viral protein expression in control cells, but not in IFN- KD cells (Fig 7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFA performed after infection with TB40 similarly showed reduced IE1/2 staining in control cells, but not in the IFN- KD cells (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the observed effects was secondary to cellular toxicity (Fig 7D), and virus uptake was similar in the different cell lines (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HCMV_Inhibition_via_NOD1_Is_Dependent_on_IKK  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOD1 activation by Tri-DAP results in signaling, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-B accompanied by IKK (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Tri-DAP induced NF-B in noninfected cells, we investigated whether NOD1 activity in HCMV suppression is dependent on the canonical pathway or on the alternative NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we performed Tri-DAP pretreatment, followed by infection, in IKK KD, IKK KD, and control transduced cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once KD of IKK and IKK (Fig 8A) and similar virus entry into the three cell lines were confirmed (Fig 8B), Tri-DAP pretreatment was performed, followed by infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus replication was efficient in all three cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control and IKK KD cells, Tri-DAP pretreatment suppressed HCMV replication to a similar degree, as evidenced by viral protein expression (Fig 8C), first and second cycle luciferase activity (Fig 8D), and a plaque reduction assay using TB40 (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the IKK KD cells, Tri-DAP could not suppress HCMV, suggesting that the anti-HCMV activity of Tri-DAP is independent of the IKK arm but requires the alternative IKK pathway (Fig 8 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with previous reports of the general mechanism of Tri-DAP showing the need for IKK for translocation of NF-B (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In control transduced cells, IKK was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, whereas IKK was confined to the cytoplasm (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tri-DAP pretreatment increased the cytoplasmic expression of IKK as well as pIKK/ in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control and IKK KD cells, Tri-DAP triggered NF-B translocation into the nucleus, whereas in IKK KD cells it did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRF3 phosphorylation in the different cell lines revealed an increase in the cytoplasm after Tri-DAP pretreatment, and a more significant increase in the nuclear fraction after Tri-DAP pretreatment and infection (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Tri-DAP pretreatment followed by infection similarly induced nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IRF3 in IKK KD cells, in the IKK KD cells, IRF3 remained in the cytoplasm (Fig 9 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with these findings, mRNA expression of IFN- and CXCL-10 was enhanced in control and IKK cells, but no such induction was observed in IKK KD cells (Fig 9 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IKK mediates an IRF3 effect in response to Tri-DAP that amplifies the antiviral cytokine response (Fig S5, model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNPs_in_NOD1_Are_Significantly_Associated_with_HCMV_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, because mutations in NOD1 were seen to affect HCMV replication in vitro, we asked whether SNPs in NOD1 had clinical relevance for predicting the risk of HCMV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HCMV gB vaccine trial provided a unique opportunity to address this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic data for 29 selected innate immune response genes and 768 SNPs were available from 383 women (152 who had received vaccine and 231 who had received placebo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty women in the vaccine group and 32 women in the placebo group were infected with HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparative analysis of SNPs in all infected and all noninfected women revealed that of six statistically significant SNPs, three were in introns 6, 9, and 12 of NOD1 (Fig S6 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs in NOD1 were more significantly associated with HCMV infection compared with noninfected controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The innate immune response to HCMV involves an orchestrated system composed of multiple receptors residing in different cellular compartments (1, 4, 7, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing of these receptors and understanding their function and networking, as well as strategies used by HCMV to counteract their activities, are of paramount importance for HCMV control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, pathways that are specific to HCMV and not shared by other herpesviruses may affect the targeting of unique host responses to HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward this effort, here we report the role of NOD1 in HCMV suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 and NOD2 are the most well-studied NLRs in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 is also expressed in epithelial cells, and our results demonstrate its abundance in HFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD2 is induced by inflammatory signals, and we previously reported its significant induction in HCMV-infected HFFs starting at 24 hpi and thereafter (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NOD1, activation rather than induction appears to play a role in HCMV inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its abundance in HFFs, the response of NOD1 to HCMV was observed over a wider range of MOI in contrast to NOD2, which responded efficiently to a lower MOI (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment of mice with two doses of iE-DAP already initiated a sufficient signaling milieu that limited MCMV replication, although the exact balance of signaling activation and virus inhibition merits more detailed study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NOD1 protein contains an N-terminal CARD, an intermediary NBD that is required for nucleotide binding and self-oligomerization, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) that detects conserved microbial patterns and modulates NLR activity (26, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD2 recognizes MDP, which is present on most peptidoglycans (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bacterial sensors, NOD1 and NOD2 induce downstream signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NF-B is a major signaling pathway downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, type I IFNs were induced via NOD1 during infection with H. pylori, reminiscent of an antiviral response (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD2-dependent IFN- production during infection with Listeria resulted from synergy with other cytosolic microbial sensors (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for IFN induction through NOD1 and NOD2 is also supported by reports of their ability to sense viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA viruses activated IRF3 in an NOD2- and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-dependent manner (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD2-deficient mice had enhanced susceptibility to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), decreased IRF3 phosphorylation, and type I IFN production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redundancy of innate immune response pathways to herpesviruses is well known, and some of the recently described pattern recognition receptors, such as IFI16 and cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), appear to be broad sensors of different herpesviruses (29, 3641).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of NOD1, specific HCMV suppression through NOD1 activation (but not HSV-1 suppression) suggests the possible use of specialized pathways through HCMV which could be targeted for virus control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the basis of our previous finding that NOD2 induction by HCMV resulted in an antiviral response, in the present study we investigated the role of NOD1 in HCMV inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 overexpression or activation by Tri-DAP inhibited HCMV, but not HSV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mutations in the CARD that interacts with RIPK2 abolished the inhibitory effect of NOD1 on HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD1 activation resulted in induction of NF-B and IFN- signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of Tri-DAP on NF-B activation were observed in both noninfected and HCMV-infected cells, but changes in IFN- were observed only in infected cells, supporting the model in which the NF-Bdependent IFN- pathway is required for NOD1 activities in infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was confirmed by using IFN- KD cells, in which HCMV suppression by Tri-DAP was abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the requirements of the IKK-dependent classical NF-B pathway and the alternative IKK-dependent pathway (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In IKK KD cells, Tri-DAP inhibited HCMV, suggesting that the canonical NF-B pathway is not required for Tri-DAP activity against HCMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some remaining kinase activity could still induce NF-B activation, it is unlikely that HCMV would be inhibited similarly in the respective cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of Tri-DAP against HCMV was significantly reduced in IKK KD cells, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is only one published report of IRF3 activation by IKK after its interaction with the NF-Binducing kinase (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that nuclear translocation of IRF3 did not occur in IKK KD cells in response to Tri-DAP treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in another study, IKK was not required for NOD1 activation of IFN signaling in an H. pylori model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of IKK was not studied in that model, the induction of IFN through NOD1 signaling was found to depend on TBK1 and IKK (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear translocation of NF-B is a direct response to Tri-DAPstimulated NOD1 (26), and is dependent on IKK (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas IKK is predominantly cytoplasmic, IKK shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an increase in both NF-B and IKK in response to Tri-DAP (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IKK KD resulted in reduced IKK-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-B and IRF3 in response to Tri-DAP, indicating the requirement for IKK in mediating an anti-HCMV response via NF-B and IRF3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a summary model of HCMV control by NOD1 through IKK, leading to IRF3 activation and IFN- induction (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, IRF3 and NF-B translocate to the nucleus in control and IKK KD cells, in response to HCMV infection and Tri-DAP, and a cumulative effect is observed when Tri-DAP precedes infection (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of this pathway is IKK-dependent; Tri-DAP stimulation results in increased NF-B and IRF3 protein levels, but nuclear translocation does not occur in the absence of IKK (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutations in NOD1 and NOD2 leading to loss or gain of function are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (19, 4549).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that the NOD2 mutation associated with severe Crohns disease (3020C) results in enhanced HCMV replication in vitro (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide in vitro evidence indicating that specific mutations in NOD1 result in either reduced or enhanced HCMV replication, as determined by NOD1 interaction with RIPK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laboratory-generated E56K mutation is an example that disrupts the interaction between NOD1 and RIPK2, but other mutations have been reported as well (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a significant body of literature implicates associations between SNPs in NOD1 and several immune-related diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, atopic eczema, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis (4649), a link between these observed associations and specific NOD1 activity has not been established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these genetic variants lie outside of protein-coding genes, and although they may or may not have a direct effect on protein structure, it is highly likely that cryptic splice sites are generated by these intronic polymorphisms, resulting in altered protein translation, stability, and expression of multiple isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, polymorphisms in the LRR domain of NOD1 that contribute to differences in expression levels of naturally occurring splice variants of NOD1 have been associated with differential inflammatory responses (48, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our genetic analysis of 29 selected innate immune response genes revealed that intronic SNPs in NOD1 were highly predictive of the risk of HCMV infection in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of previous studies of host genetics and susceptibility to human herpesvirus infections have investigated SNPs in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (46, 47); for example, an SNP in TLR2 was found to be associated with HCMV replication and disease in a small cohort of liver transplant recipients (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest a role for genetic variation in NOD1 as a predictor of the risk of HCMV acquisition, although its impact on virus replication and disease in a high-risk population remains to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that a combination of NOD1 SNPs may determine protein folding/accessibility for interaction with RIPK2 and induction of antiviral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These human SNPs should be further investigated for their effect on LRR-mediated responses and the resulting NOD1-RIPK2 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collaboration between NOD1 and NOD2 has been identified in a Salmonella typhimurium colitis model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in either NOD1 or NOD2 were not susceptible to infection, but mice deficient in both NOD1 and NOD2 exhibited increased Salmonella colonization of the intestine (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it appears that for HCMV, collaboration between NOD1 and NOD2 may have an additive effect in virus suppression, with NOD1 activation inducing an early tier of innate immune response, followed by a second tier through NOD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that in IFN- KD cells, pretreatment with MDP could not suppress HCMV or induce NOD2, suggesting that NOD2 activities require IFN- (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, IFN signaling was found to induce RIPK2 expression and downstream signaling in macrophages with a variety of stimuli (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present data on the combined effect of MDP and Tri-DAP on HCMV replication, the lack of anti-HCMV activity of Tri-DAP in IFN- KD cells, and the role of IKK in inducing NF-B and IRF3 downstream of NOD1 point to a model of initial activities through NOD1, resulting in IFN- signaling leading to NOD2 induction and RIPK2 activation and further inhibiting HCMV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, here we provide information on a specific innate immune response pathway for HCMV control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will examine the role of NOD1 and NOD2 in vivo and with the aim of uncovering strategies used by HCMV to counteract activities through these receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Statistical analysis of SNPs was done as reported previously (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, 28 AIMs were genotyped for evaluation of population stratification using principal components analysis in the statistical program Eigenstrat (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association analysis was done in PLINK version 1.062 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink) using linear regression and an additive model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A HardyWeinberg P value threshold of 103 and a minor allele frequency of  greater than 0.01 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A modified Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons based on the number of genes (owing to high LD), resulting in a threshold P value of 0.0017 for significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNP data were released for 383 women (99% of the attempted samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Culture_and_Viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HFFs, passage 1216 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); CRL-2088], were grown in DMEM containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Gibco) in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1 d before infection or treatment, 8 × 104 cells were seeded into each well of 12-well tissue culture plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection was carried out at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell or MOI 2 as specified for specific lentivirus-transduced cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pp28-luciferase Towne HCMV that expresses luciferase under the control of pp28 late promoter has been described previously (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase activity was measured at 72 or 96 hpi using the GloMax-Multi+ Detection System (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For virus replication assays, supernatants were collected at 96 hpi from cells infected with pp28-luciferase Towne (20% of total volume per well) and used for a second cycle infection of fresh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates after 72 h. The HCMV TB40 strain (ATCC; VR-1578) was used for plaque reduction assays and IFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical isolates of HCMV and HSV-1 were used for IFA and plaque reduction assays, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These isolates were obtained from the microbiology laboratory at Johns Hopkins Hospital with no identifiers that could be linked to a specific patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HSV-1 luciferase, KOS/Dlux/oriS, was kindly provided by David A. Leib, Dartmouth Medical School.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plaque_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HFFs were seeded into 12-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well) and treated with Tri-DAP, MDP, or combination of Tri-DAP and MDP (10 µg/mL) for 72 h, followed by infection with the TB40 performed in triplicates at 100 plaques per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 90 min, the medium was aspirated, and DMEM containing 0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose and 4% (vol/vol) FBS were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following incubation at 37 °C for 10 d, the overlay was removed, and plaques were counted after crystal violet staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plaque assays using HCMV Towne were performed similarly in Tri-DAPpretreated KD cells, including IFN-, IKK, and IKK (described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of pretreatment with Tri-DAP or ML130 was tested in HSV-1infected HFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plaque assay was performed similar to that for HCMV, but with incubation for 72 h after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibition_of_MCMV_Replication_with_iE-DAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal work was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the National Institutes of Healths Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal protocol (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MO13M296) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infection experiments, 3- to 4-wk-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 23 d of adaptation to the housing environment, the mice were pretreated with iE-DAP (two daily doses of 500 g each) (55) or saline intraperitoneally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was collected at 4 h after the second dose of iE-DAP for measurement of the chemokine RANTES by ELISA (R&D Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were then infected with 106 PFU of tissue culture-derived MCMV (Smith strain, VR-1399; ATCC) and killed after 14 d. Intracardiac blood was collected before sacrifice for a gB real-time PCR assay (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salivary glands, liver, and spleen were harvested and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organs were homogenized in DMEM at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two million mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were seeded into 24-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each sample, 2.5% of the salivary gland or 10% of liver/spleen homogenate was used for infection of MEFs in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plaques were counted after 3 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cellular_Toxicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT, lentivirus-transduced GIPZ (control), and IFN- KD cells were pretreated with Tri-DAP for 72 h, after which 20 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being shaken at 150 rpm in a Gyrotory Shaker Model G2 (New Brunswick Scientific Company, Inc., Edison, NJ) for 5 min, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The conversion of yellow solution to dark-blue formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of living cells was quantified by measuring absorbance at 560 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Lentiviruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, 21 µg of gag/pol, 7 µg of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, and 7 µg of shRNAmir plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, the packaged lentivirus particles were concentrated from the medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged at 1,750 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel 100 membrane (EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation, 2 mL of cold PBS was added, and the tubes were centrifuged again for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_NOD1-Overexpressing_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT and mutant human NOD1 plasmids were constructed in pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers for PCR amplification of the NOD1 gene were BamHI-NOD1*F, ACTAGGATCCATGGAAGAGCAGGGCCACAG and EcoRI-NOD1*R, CTAGGAATTCTCAGAAACAGATAATCCGCTTC (underscored nucleotides indicate the restriction enzyme sites of BamH I and EcoR I, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were digested with BamH I and EcoR I and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For DNA mutagenesis, overlapping primers containing the desired base change (in bold) were used for amplification of the upstream and downstream segment of NOD1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full length of mutagenic NOD1 cDNA was amplified from the recombinant segments with the primer BamHI-NOD1*F and EcoRI-NOD1*R. The primers for generating NOD1 mutants were NOD1-E56K*F, CGAAGATGCGAAGATTGTGTGTGCCTGCCCC; NOD1-E56K*R, ACACACAATCTTCGCATCTTCGGCCGAGAAG and NOD1-E266K*F, GGACCCCAAGGAGGTGTTTGCCTTCC; NOD1-E266K*R, CAAACACCTCCTTGGGGTCCCGCTCTGGGTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first and overlapping PCR program was performed at the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of PCR (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 2 min), and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constructs for lentivirus expression of WT and NOD1 mutants were amplified from the respective pcDNA4/HisMax plasmids with primers NOD1-TRIPZ*F, GGGATCCACCGGTCCATGGGGGGTTCTCATCATCATC and NOD1-TRIPZ*R, GGGATCCACGCGTTCATCAGAAACAGATAATCCGCTTC (underlined nucleotides indicate the restricted enzyme sites of Age I and Mlu I), and subcloned into Tripz lentiviral vector (Open Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of the new constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human NOD1-Tripz and Tripz control empty vector were packaged using lentivirus and transduced into HFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal numbers of NOD1-overexpressing and control cells were seeded into each well before infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation_and_qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RevertAid First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA from total RNA using oligo-dT primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative reverse-transcriptase reactions were included to ensure the specificity of qRT-PCR reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthesis of first-strand cDNA from mRNA template was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. qRT-PCR was performed using specific primers and SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a two-step cycling protocol (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reactions were performed in triplicate, with GAPDH as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression levels of the tested genes were normalized to the expression of GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences were as follows: NOD1 forward, 5-CCTGAGCAACAACAATCTCAACGACTA-3, NOD1 reverse, 5-TTTACCCCACCGTCAGTGATC- 3; IFN- forward, 5-GATTCATCTAGCACTGGCTGG-3, IFN- reverse, 5-CTTCAGGTAATGCAGAATCC-3; IL-8 forward, 5-TGCAGCTCTGTGTGAAGGTGCAGT-3, IL-8 reverse, 5-CAGTGTGGTCCACTCTCAATCACTC-3; RIG-I forward, 5-ATCCCAACCGATATCATTTCTGATC-3, RIG-I reverse, 5-TTCCACCAATTTCTCTGCACCTGC-3; GAPDH forward, 5-TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC-3, GAPDH reverse, 5- ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lentivirus-Mediated_KD_of_NOD1__IFN-__IKK__IKK__and_NOD2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir constructs (Open Biosystems) were used for NOD1 KD in HFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two clones (shNOD1#2: V2LHS_69528 and shNOD1#5: V3LHS_309375) targeting different regions of NOD1 mRNA were combined to generate stable cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control nontargeting GIPZ plasmid was used to rule out nonspecific effects of shRNAmir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual shRNAmir constructs were packaged using lentivirus as described previously (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentivirus particles containing shRNAmir were transduced into HFFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 0.5 ×106 cells were plated onto T-25 flasks, and 40 µL of concentrated virus and polybrene (final concentration, 8 µg/mL) were added to the cells, followed by incubation for 4 h. After transduction, puromycin (2 µg/mL) was added to select for stably transduced cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control and NOD1 KD cells were counted, and an equal number of cells was plated into each well before infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KD of IFN- and NOD2 in HFFs was recently reported from our laboratory (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validated TRC shRNA clones for RIPK2 (N0000218097, N0000218326, and N0000230255) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRC control (pLKO.1) was obtained from Addgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids for IKK and IKK KD and control lentivirus (pYNC352) were kindly provided by Dr. Young Choi, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and have been described previously (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SDS_PAGE_and_Immunoblot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell lysates containing equivalent amount of proteins were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer [125 mM TrisHCl pH 6.8, 4% (vol/vol) SDS, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5% (vol/vol) -mercaptoethanol], followed by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denatured proteins were resolved in SDS polyacrylamide gels (815%) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were incubated in blocking solution [5% wt/vol nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBST)] for 1 h, washed with PBST, and then incubated with antibody at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were washed with PBST and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with PBST, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Dura and Pico reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antibodies for HCMV proteins were mouse anti-IE1&2 (MAB810, 1:2,000; EMD Millipore), mouse anti-HCMV UL83 (pp65, 1:2,000; Vector Laboratories), and mouse anti-UL44 (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse anti-human -actin (1:5,000) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbit anti-RIPK2 (1:5,000), mouse antiNF-B (p65, 1:1,000), and rabbit anti-IRF3 (1:1,000) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbit anti human-NOD1 antibody (1:2,000), rabbit monoclonal anti-pIB (1:2,000), rabbit anti-IKK and anti-IKK, rabbit mAb 2697 anti-pIKK/ (Ser176/180; 1:1,000), and rabbit anti-histone H3 (1:2,000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbit anti-lamin B (1:1,000; Abcam) served as a nuclear loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and GE Healthcare, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Cytoplasmic_and_Nuclear_Extracts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated from HCMV-infected or mock-infected HFFs at 24 hpi as reported previously (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended on ice for 15 min in buffer A containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then lysed by adding 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and cytosolic supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 9,600 × g for 30 s. Crude nuclei were washed twice with buffer A to prevent cytosolic contamination, and the nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending cell pellets with buffer C, containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was incubated for 15 min with vigorous shaking on a rocker at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain the nuclear proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IFA_for_HCMV_IE1_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HFFs were seeded into four-well chamber slides (5 × 104 cells/well) and pretreated with Tri-DAP (10 µg/mL) for 72 h. Infection was performed with a clinical isolate of HCMV or TB40 (MOI 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 hpi, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at 20 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then blocked with 7.5% (wt/vol) BSA and incubated for 1 h with anti-human CMV IE1/2 antibody (MAB810; 1:500 in 0.5% BSA), followed by incubation with FITC-anti mouse antibody (F8521, 1:500 in 0.5% BSA; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transfection_of_NOD1_Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293 cells were used for cotransfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NOD1 plasmids (WT, E56K, and E266K) were cotransfected with NF-B (Stratagene) and IFN- luciferase reporter plasmids (59) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter plasmids were used at 100 ng, and all NOD1 plasmids were used at 500 ng.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNP_Selection_for_the_Genetic_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 29 genes known to be associated with innate immune responses were selected, including TLRs and associated intracellular signaling molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified tag SNPs within the gene and in the 10 kb flanking each side of the genes, using the LDselect algorithm in individuals from the publicly available HapMap Yoruba, Nigeria population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tagging SNPs, we used an R2 value  greater than 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs with a high R2 value are correlated and can give information about one another, and thus they are grouped together and one SNPtermed a tag SNPis selected to represent them all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection was restricted to those SNPs with a minor allele frequency  greater than 1% in the African population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, all SNPs were evaluated using a proprietary algorithm from Illumina that assesses the likelihood that an assay will succeed on the Illumina genotyping platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only those with a design score  greater than 0.8 were selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nonsynonymous SNPs, a more liberal cutoff score  greater than 0.4 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty-one additional SNPs with previously reported associations in a variety of human diseases, 157 nonsynonymous SNPs, and 28 AIMs were also typed, for a total of 768 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  African Americans are typically of a mixed ethnic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allele frequencies of SNPs can vary by race and ethnicity; therefore, it is important to assess the degree of mixture in an admixed individual when analyzing SNP data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the cases and controls have differing amounts of admixture, then variation in allele frequency by race can cause the appearance of an association with the phenotype of interest, when actually the association is with race.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including AIMs in the SNP panel allows an assessment of admixture and allows differing amounts of admixture to be controlled for in the data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
