Copper nanoparticle ensembles for selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2C3 products  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to carbon-based products, which can be used directly as fuels or indirectly as fuel precursors, is suggested as one of the promising solutions for sustainability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only does this process allow using renewables such as solar electricity as energy input, but CO2 emitted from the consumption process can be recycled back into fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of this technology depends on the value added to the product that forms from CO2, and therefore it is important to facilitate multicarbon product generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work presents a copper-based catalyst, formed in situ from an ensemble of nanoparticles, that is able to selectively generate C2C3 products at low overpotentials with good stability, where their efficient formation has been difficult to achieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct conversion of carbon dioxide to multicarbon products remains as a grand challenge in electrochemical CO2 reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various forms of oxidized copper have been demonstrated as electrocatalysts that still require large overpotentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that an ensemble of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) enables selective formation of C2C3 products at low overpotentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densely packed Cu NP ensembles underwent structural transformation during electrolysis into electrocatalytically active cube-like particles intermixed with smaller nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethylene, ethanol, and n-propanol are the major C2C3 products with onset potential at 0.53 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and C2C3 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaching 50% at only 0.75 V. Thus, the catalyst exhibits selective generation of C2C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates at considerably lowered overpotentials in neutral pH aqueous media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this approach suggests new opportunities in realizing multicarbon product formation from CO2, where the majority of efforts has been to use oxidized copper-based materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust catalytic performance is demonstrated by 10 h of stable operation with C2C3 current density 10 mA/cm2 (at 0.75 V), rendering it attractive for solar-to-fuel applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tafel analysis suggests reductive CO coupling as a rate determining step for C2 products, while n-propanol (C3) production seems to have a discrete pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monodisperse Cu NPs (size 6.7 nm) prepared (SI Appendix, Fig S1) were directly deposited onto carbon paper support (1 cm2geo) to form densely packed NP ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cu NP loading was systematically increased (SI Appendix, Table S1) starting from the lowest loading of 2 g of Cu (×1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Number density of NPs was determined based on the estimated surface area of the carbon paper support (24, 26) (SI Appendix, Fig S2), which was at 5.9 cm2real/cm2geo (roughness factor 5.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the NPs are isolated at the lowest loading condition, and increased loadings resulted in densely packed arrangements of Cu NPs (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ×22.5 loading, the surface was mostly covered with closely packed Cu NPs (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cu NP ensembles with varied loading densities were tested for their electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, under identical conditions of 0.1 M KHCO3 at 1 atm CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From product analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S4), we found that increased loadings resulted in a drastic rise of the C2C3 faradaic efficiency (FE) (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S5 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend is consistent with the observed loss of C1 products, indicating that carbon-based intermediates could be effectively coupled to yield multicarbon products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When plotting the relative ratio of the C2C3 FE to C1 FE (Fig 1C), charge consumed to reduce CO2 was mainly from the reaction pathways to C2C3 products at increased loading conditions, reaching up to 76% out of the total CO2 reduction products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends can be seen with CO2 reduction dominating over the competing H2 evolution (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among various C2C3 products, ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (EtOH), and n-propanol (n-PrOH) were the majority, constituting 94% out of the total C2C3 products generated (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When probing the product distribution over time for the ×22.5 loading condition, an abrupt change occurred during the initial period (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen was the dominant product when gas products were measured 3 min after the start of electrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selectivity for C2H4 increased afterward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend was found for the liquid products as well (SI Appendix, Fig S6), where liquids analyzed for the first 7 min had less multicarbon products relative to formate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual inspection of the electrode (SI Appendix, Fig S7) also supported the fact that product distribution was shifting during its initial electrochemical testing, as more gas bubbles were observed at the beginning of electrolysis, probably due to the majority of charge being consumed for two-electron transfer products, such as hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This observation indicated that the NP ensemble may go through a structural transformation process during initial electrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of the starting densely packed Cu NPs (×22.5 loading, Fig 1A), cube-like particles (10  40 nm) mixed together with smaller NPs were observed on the carbon support after electrolysis (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon-paper supports with lower loading were also checked after electrolysis and a trend could be observed: the more densely packed the Cu NPs, the more likely the formation of cube-like particles (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Cu NPs were sparsely covering the support, random aggregates of NPs together with the pristine NPs could be found after electrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface-area analysis of Cu NP ensembles after electrolysis also showed that the densely packed NPs transformed to larger particles (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, loss of surface ligands during electrolysis and structural transformation was confirmed by elemental analysis (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural transformation of the NP ensemble (Fig 2A) occurred during the initial stage of electrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed from observation of the electrode 7 min after the start of electrolysis (Fig 2C), which coincided with the shift in catalytic activity (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negligible catalytic activity of the underlying carbon paper (SI Appendix, Fig S13) further supports that the structure derived from Cu NP ensembles is responsible for enhanced C2C3 formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This catalytically active structure formed starting from densely packed Cu NP ensembles (×22.5 loading on carbon-paper support in 0.1 M KHCO3), hereafter referred to as trans-CuEn, was further investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the initial loading density of Cu NP ensembles (and their densely packed-ness) tends to govern their structural transformation during electrolysis and resulting electrochemical activity, we tried to intentionally separate the Cu NPs in the precursor state to trans-CuEn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected the transformation process to cube-like structures to be disrupted, leading to diminished C2C3 selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cu NPs (×22.5 loading) were mixed with carbon black before depositing on carbon-paper support (SI Appendix, Fig S14), which led to NPs being spatially separated from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this condition, substantial loss of C2C3 product selectivity (FE from 49 to 17%) was observed (Fig 2D), while CO and HCOO became major products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When particles were examined after electrolysis, the structure more resembled what would be observed for low-density conditions (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cu NPs have been observed to electrically fuse into irregularly shaped large crystals under strong bias conditions (less_than1.25 V vs. RHE), reaching a similar state irrespective of the initial conditions (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we find that structural transformation can be caused not only under low bias conditions, but controlled by the initial arrangement of NPs, and consequently catalytic behavior for multicarbon products can be significantly improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As trans-CuEn displays cubic-shaped particles, copper nanocubes loaded onto carbon-paper support were tested under identical conditions for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Cu nanocubes that have been previously studied for CO2 reduction (26) (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, cubes with edge length 25 nm were used (with copper loading mass identical to trans-CuEn) to approximately match the cubic-shaped particles that vary in size (10  40 nm) for trans-CuEn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to trans-CuEn, observed structural changes were minimal where the cubes seem to have sintered or roughened (SI Appendix, Fig S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, only small amounts of multicarbon products were detected (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is consistent with the earlier report of Cu nanocubes, which claims multicarbon product formation at high overpotentials (less_than1 V vs. RHE) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we find that simple reproduction of the key morphological feature present in trans-CuEn is insufficient to reach high multicarbon selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This leads to the possibility of cube-like particles derived in situ during electrolysis featuring unique active sites for C2C3 formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, scanning tunneling microscopy investigation of copper for carbon monoxide reduction has shown not only the reconstruction of a polycrystalline surface to a (100) surface, but also the additional structural transformation unique to the (100) reconstructed copper, leading to stepped surfaces which selectively generate ethanol (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this observation may have been for reducing CO, together with the findings here, it brings into attention the importance of in situ structural transformation for multicarbon product formation in copper-based catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we would like to point out that while the vast majority of research has been to use oxide-derived structures, with even some reports claiming the importance of remaining oxidized copper (29, 41), the catalytically active structure derived here is from pristine Cu NPs (with a thin layer of surface oxide naturally present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that the structural transformation observed is unique to the original Cu NPs (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it would be important to understand how this structural transformation proceeds and what type of active site motifs are present under working conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially the case for copper, which may oxidize after electrolysis, possibly leading to the loss of surface atomic information (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also cannot rule out the possibility that high multicarbon selectivity stems from having a mixture of particles (42), which are the cube-like ones together with smaller particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With all of these taken into consideration, further investigation into the structural origin of high multicarbon selectivity from Cu NP ensembles is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we investigated the role of the catalyst support by depositing Cu NPs onto a highly polished graphite plate (1 cm2real, roughness factor 1), while keeping the NP density (/cm2real) identical to that of trans-CuEn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural transformation occurred in a similar way resulting in cubic-shaped particles (SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, H2 and C1 products were the major products (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this difference is due to local pH effects discussed in earlier reports (32, 4346), as the loss in the real surface area of the underlying support led to a sharp decrease of the geometric current density (lowered to 1/5 of the original).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased local pH by large current density of trans-CuEn (on carbon-paper support) could play a role in determining its catalytic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it seems that it is important to not only start from a high density of closely packed Cu NPs to facilitate the structural transformation, but also have the underlying support provide sufficient surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows why high C2C3 selectivity was not observed from the previous report of Cu NP monolayers (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catalytic activity of trans-CuEn was further probed at various potentials (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S19) in 0.1 M KHCO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of C2C3 formation was observed at only 0.57 V vs. RHE, with products mainly comprising C2H4, EtOH, and n-PrOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with that of the pristine copper foil (18), overpotentials were lowered by 180 mV for C2H4 and 390 mV for EtOH and n-PrOH, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this potential, a substantial rise in C2C3 FE was observed (SI Appendix, Table S4), with the highest selectivity toward C2C3 products (55%) achieved at 0.86 V vs. RHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high selectivity for C2C3 products, including oxygenates, is quite significant, compared with previously reported catalysts for C2C3 product formation around similar overpotentials applied in neutral pH aqueous media (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, catalysts for multicarbon products have been Cu-based (mostly derived from oxides or halides) and require bias applied close to and beyond 1 V vs. RHE (SI Appendix, Table S6), where even only some of them reach product distributions dominated by C2C3 products (C2C3  greater than  C1 + H2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, with major efforts in the field toward using oxidized Cu as a starting template, the discovery of this catalyst presents an approach to achieving high C2C3 selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, FE for two-electron reduced products (CO and formate) could be lowered to 1%, implying that almost all of the CO2 interacting with the catalyst could undergo CC coupling to yield more complex products (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In assessing catalytic performance for multicarbon product formation, earlier reports have been using C2H4/CH4 FE ratio as a figure of merit and trans-CuEn exhibits significantly high values at low overpotentials (252 at 0.78 V vs. RHE) that are comparable or better than previous catalysts reported for selective formation of C2H4 (SI Appendix, Fig S20 and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More negative bias applied leads to increase in CH4 formation and C1 FE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been suggested that larger cations promote higher concentrations of CO2 near the catalyst surface, leading to increased activity (17, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further optimization, Cu NP ensembles were tested in 0.1 M CsHCO3 aqueous electrolyte saturated with 1 atm CO2 and a similar trend was observed where increased loading densities resulted in higher C2C3 selectivity (SI Appendix, Fig S21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformation of Cu NP ensembles (at optimized condition of ×32.5 loading in 0.1 M CsHCO3) consistently resulted in cube-shaped particles mixed together with smaller NPs (SI Appendix, Fig S22), hereafter referred to as trans-CuEn 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity of trans-CuEn 2 was measured at various potentials (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S23) and high C2C3 selectivity was observed at more positive potentials with the onset of C2C3 formation at only 0.53 V vs. RHE (SI Appendix, Table S3), which is 40 mV less of applied overpotential compared with that observed in 0.1 M KHCO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highest C2C3 selectivity (50%) was observed at 0.75 V vs. RHE, shifting the potential 110 mV more positive relative to the point of maximum C2C3 FE in 0.1 M KHCO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, with this catalytic structure, selective electrocatalytic conversion CO2 to C2C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates could be achieved at significantly reduced overpotentials, compared with what have been demonstrated up to now (SI Appendix, Tables S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the main products were C2H4, EtOH, and n-PrOH (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Table S8) constituting up to 95% of total C2C3 products (SI Appendix, Fig S24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, not only were FEs of CO and formate decreased to very low levels (12%), but CH4 formation could also be suppressed (less_than1%) across the entire potential region, resulting in a significantly high C2H4/CH4 ratio (2,133 at 0.73 V vs. RHE) at low overpotentials (SI Appendix, Fig S24 and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its high C2C3 selectivity in 0.1 M CsHCO3, the proportion of C2C3 products among the total CO2 reduced products reached up to 90% (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the real surface area of trans-CuEn 2 measured (SI Appendix, Fig S25), specific current density plots and Tafel slopes of the three major products could be obtained (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both C2H4 and EtOH exhibit similar slopes (120 mV/dec), indicative of a rate-determining step with a common intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, C2H4 and EtOH start forming in the potential region where CO evolution is dominant and increase while CO diminishes (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B and 4B), suggesting that formation of these C2 products is essentially limited by the coupling of major C1 intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been also shown that higher coverages of *CO can be expected in the region where CO formation is majorly observed (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, with a slope close to 120 mV/dec suggesting a single electron transfer step, we expect the rate-determining step to be a reductive coupling (i.e., dimerization) step of adsorbed CO intermediates, predicted from theory and carbon monoxide reduction experiments on copper (43, 4951):*CO+*CO+e*C2O2.On the other hand, n-PrOH exhibits a different slope, suggesting a distinct rate-determining step from that of C2 products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimated value is rather close to that observed for CH4 on copper foil (86 mV/dec) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been reported that n-PrOH formation only occurs when reactants include both CO (carbon monoxide) and C2H4, while CO reduction solely leads to EtOH (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If C3 products followed the same pathway as C2 products, n-PrOH should have been observed upon CO reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it may be that n-PrOH formation requires coupling between CO and hydrogenated carbon [e.g., carbene (*CH2)], which is a major intermediate in the pathway to CH4 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CH4 formation activity of trans-CuEn and -CuEn 2 supports this idea as well (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B and 4B and SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to C2H4 and EtOH, n-PrOH reaches peak selectivity at a more positive potential and the potential in which n-PrOH FE drops coincides well with the point where CH4 FE starts to rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still unclear how formation of C3 products occur and an in-depth study of the mechanistic pathways to these products is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-term stability was demonstrated by 10 h electrolysis of trans-CuEn 2 at 0.75 V vs. RHE (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average C2C3 FE reached 50% for the overall run and structural features of trans-CuEn 2 were maintained as well (SI Appendix, Fig S26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, stable C2C3 product current density of 10 mA/cm2geo was achieved, which is potentially attractive for solar-to-fuel applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long-term electrolysis accumulates significant amounts of liquid products, propionaldehyde, likely to be the precursor to n-PrOH, was detected (SI Appendix, Fig S27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stable and selective C2C3 product generation achieved by the structurally transformed Cu NP ensembles presents a promising future direction to renewables-powered artificial carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projected solar-to-fuel efficiencies of multicarbon products (SI Appendix, Fig S28), assuming combination of commercial Si photovoltaic devices and electrolysis configurations recently demonstrated for effective syngas formation (52, 53), are comparable or better than natural photosynthesis (e.g., 2.8% for C2H4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant mass activities are achieved as well (SI Appendix, Fig S29), desirable in terms of cost-effectiveness, due to extremely low mass (gCu) used compared with other methods that rely on bulk Cu oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown how an ensemble of Cu NPs can enable selective electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to C2C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates at significantly reduced overpotentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural evolution of densely arranged Cu NPs resulted in C2C3 active nanostructures and experimental investigation of the parameters affecting structural transformation and their catalytic behavior was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the discovery of this active catalytic structure formed in situ, efforts in deepening the understanding of how NPs and atoms within evolve under electrically biased and chemically relevant conditions seem necessary, which will shed light on the key structural features for CO2 conversion to multicarbon products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we anticipate that the unique approach of using NPs as precursors to an active nanostructured material will lead to a wide expansion of the materials library for various catalytic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Copper NPs in this work are synthesized by reducing copper precursors at high temperatures with tetradecylphosphonic acid used as surface ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densely packed arrangement of copper NPs on carbon support is achieved by directly loading these particles in solution to a carbon-paper electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper NPs deposited electrodes are tested for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in neutral pH aqueous environments (0.1 M KHCO3 or CsHCO3 at 1 atm CO2), with products measured by gas chromatography and NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Original copper NPs and the structures formed during electrolysis are characterized by various methods, including electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details of the experimental methods are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
