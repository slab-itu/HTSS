title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system can modulate host intestinal mechanics to displace gut bacterial symbionts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, uses the syringe-like type VI secretion system (T6SS) to pierce adjacent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of the T6SS in invasion of intestines already occupied by symbiotic microbes, we genetically engineered V. cholerae strains and performed live 3D imaging in zebrafish to find that V. cholerae can expel a resident bacterial species in a T6SS-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the T6SS acts primarily to increase the strength of gut contractions, rather than directly killing the bacterial competitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of an actin cross-linking domain from the T6SS returned gut activity to normal and eliminated V. choleraes competitive advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal a strategy by which pathogens can manipulate host biomechanics to redefine gut communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Host-associated microbiota help defend against bacterial pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which pathogens overcome this defense remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a zebrafish model and used live imaging to directly study how the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae invades the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gut microbiota of fish monocolonized by symbiotic strain Aeromonas veronii was displaced by V. cholerae expressing its type VI secretion system (T6SS), a syringe-like apparatus that deploys effector proteins into target cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, displacement was independent of T6SS-mediated killing of A. veronii, driven instead by T6SS-induced enhancement of zebrafish intestinal movements that led to expulsion of the resident microbiota by the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deleting an actin cross-linking domain from the T6SS apparatus returned intestinal motility to normal and thwarted expulsion, without weakening V. choleraes ability to kill A. veronii in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that bacteria can manipulate host physiology to influence intermicrobial competition has implications for both pathogenesis and microbiome engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human-Derived_V_cholerae_Colonizes_the_Larval_Zebrafish_Intestine_but_Exhibits_Weak_Intraspecies_T6SS-Mediated_Killing_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A streptomycin-resistant mutant of patient-derived El Tor biotype C6706 served as a wild-type strain (denoted T6SSWT) because of its proficiency at T6-mediated bacterial killing (40, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS and immunity genes are well characterized in this strain, allowing construction of variants that differed in T6SS expression, immunity, and functionality (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strain constitutive for T6SS expression, termed T6SS+, was previously constructed by replacement of the native qstR promoter, and a T6SS derivative of this strain was constructed by deletion of the vasK gene (vasK) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further deletion of three T6 immunity genes (tsiV13) generated a T6SS Imm strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each strain was labeled fluorescently with a chromosomally introduced teal or orange fluorescent protein to enable microscopy (43) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the human-derived V. cholerae and its variants could colonize the larval zebrafish gut, we inoculated flasks housing germ-free larvae with a single bacterial strain at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then dissected the gut at 6 dpf and determined intestinal bacterial abundance by serial plating and counting of colony-forming units (CFUs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we also considered a previously examined zebrafish symbiont, ZWU0020, assigned to the genus Vibrio (30, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All V. cholerae strains examined could colonize the larval zebrafish intestine robustly to an abundance of approximately 104 CFU per gut, which is roughly one order of magnitude lower than that of the symbiotic Vibrio (Fig 1 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct observation by light sheet fluorescence microscopy at 5 dpf showed that each strain of V. cholerae was abundant and highly motile in the intestinal lumen (Fig 1C and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then asked whether we could detect signatures of T6SS-mediated intraspecies competition in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the in vitro assays, we mixed two V. cholerae strains in liquid culture at an approximate 1:1 ratio (measured as 1.2 ± 0.5 across all pairs of strains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these was always the T6SS Imm strain, which, lacking immunity to T6SS, served as a target for interbacterial killing (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We spotted the mix onto nylon membranes on agar plates and allowed the microbes to interact in close proximity for 3 h. We then quantified killing by measuring the ratio of CFU counts for each pair of strains, which we distinguished by their fluorescent markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS and T6SSWT strains were only slightly enhanced compared with the target; however, the T6SS+ strain dominated the mixture, indicating T6SS-mediated killing (Fig 1E), consistent with previous in vitro work (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, we coinoculated zebrafish flasks at 5 dpf with the orange-labeled T6SS Imm strain and one of either the teal-labeled wild-type, T6SS defective, or T6SS+ constitutive strains at an approximate 1:1 initial ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The initial ratios were 0.94 ± 0.06, 1.2 ± 0.1, and 1.05 ± 0.10, respectively, for these three strain combinations.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined their ratios in the fish at 6 dpf using gut dissection and plating, again differentiating the strains by their fluorescence (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that compared with the T6SS strain, the T6SS+ and wild-type strains had a small and variable competitive advantage over the T6SS Imm target strain, with abundance ratios of 6.8 ± 2.9, 5.8 ± 2.6, and 3.0 ± 0.4 for challenge by T6SS+, T6SSWT, and T6SS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in vivo killing rate by T6SS competent cells was only roughly a factor of 2 higher for strains with functional T6SS compared with strains without the functional T6SS (Fig 1F); this is far less dramatic than the in vitro killing of V. cholerae by other V. cholerae (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Constitutive_Expression_of_T6SS_Potentiates_V_cholerae_Invasion_of_Zebrafish_Intestines_Occupied_by_a_Symbiotic_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next addressed the key question of whether the T6SS can affect the ability to invade an established intestinal microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used as our target species Aeromonas veronii strain ZOR0001 (hereinafter referred to as Aeromonas), a Gram-negative bacterium native to and commonly found in the zebrafish intestine (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown that this strain can robustly monocolonize germ-free larval zebrafish at 103105 bacteria per gut (29, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aeromonas forms dense bacterial aggregates in vivo (29) and can be invaded by symbiotic Vibrio sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZWU0020 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first determined whether Aeromonas was susceptible to T6-mediated killing by V. cholerae in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mixed Aeromonas and V. cholerae strains in liquid culture and spotted them onto nylon membranes as in the previously described in vitro experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then quantified killing by measuring Aeromonas CFU counts before and after the membrane incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aeromonas CFU counts when mixed with T6SS V. cholerae were indistinguishable from those of a control mix of Aeromonas with Aeromonas (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type V. cholerae, and particularly the T6SS+ strain, decreased Aeromonas CFU counts significantly, indicating high interspecies killing rates (Fig 2A and Movies S2S4), consistent with previously reported in vitro results with an Escherichia coli target (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the role of the T6SS in vivo, we monocolonized zebrafish by inoculating flasks containing germ-free larvae with Aeromonas at 4 dpf and then inoculated with one of the V. cholerae strains at 5 dpf (Fig 2B; approximately 30 animals per V. cholerae strain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gut dissection and serial plating at 6 dpf revealed dramatic differences in Aeromonas abundance, depending on the T6SS of the invading strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aeromonas challenged by T6SS or T6SS Imm V. cholerae persisted in the gut at approximately 1,000 CFU per fish on average (Fig 2C, top two panels); however, Aeromonas challenged by the T6SS+ V. cholerae fell to single-digit numbers, with zero detectable Aeromonas in 50% of the fish (Fig 2C, bottom panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aeromonas challenged by the wild-type V. cholerae showed intermediate numbers between the T6SS-challenged and the T6SS+-challenged strains (Fig 2C, third panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live imaging at 24 h after the V. cholerae inoculation demonstrated the differential impacts on the resident Aeromonas, with large populations consisting of dense clusters and discrete individuals in the gut of larvae challenged by T6SS V. cholerae (Fig 2D) and few Aeromonas remaining in the gut of larvae challenged by T6SS+ V. cholerae (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the invading V. cholerae strains was present at 6 dpf at approximately 104 CFU per gut (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aeromonas_Are_Expelled_in_Frequent_Sudden_Collapses_from_Fish_Guts_Invaded_by_T6SS-Expressing_V_cholerae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better characterize the strong T6SS-mediated effect of V. cholerae on gut-resident Aeromonas, we monitored bacterial population dynamics over 1217 h using light sheet fluorescence microscopy, capturing a 3D image spanning the entire larval intestine every 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same inoculation protocol and began live imaging at 8 h after V. cholerae inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previous work, we found that Aeromonas populations residing in the zebrafish intestine can be punctuated by occasional large collapses corresponding to ejection from the gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fish monocolonized with Aeromonas, these collapses occurred at a mean rate of pc = 0.04 ± 0.02 h1, but in fish invaded by the symbiont Vibrio ZWU0020, the rate of collapse increased to pc = 0.07 ± 0.02 h1 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, as in that previous work, we defined a collapse as a population drop of at least a factor of 10 in one 20-min time interval, together with at a drop of least a factor of 2 relative to the original population at the subsequent time step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aeromonas population was strikingly stable when invaded by the T6SS strains; we observed no collapses during the entire 58.0-h and 70.3-h total imaging times for T6SS (n = 5 fish) and T6SS Imm (n = 6 fish) V. cholerae challenges, respectively (Fig 3A, first two panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenge by the wild-type V. cholerae resulted in two population collapses in 72.7 h, corresponding to a collapse rate of pc = 0.03 ± 0.02 h1 (Fig 3A, third panel; n = 6 fish).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenge by T6SS+ V. cholerae gave rise to large and frequent collapses, a total of eight in 64.3 h (Fig 3A, fourth panel; n = 5 fish), corresponding to a collapse rate of pc = 0.12 ± 0.04 h1, nearly twice as large as that induced by the fish-symbiont Vibrio ZWU0020 (30) (Fig 3 BD and Movies S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Constitutively_Expressed_T6SS_Alters_the_Intestinal_Movements_of_Larval_Zebrafish_in_an_ACD-Dependent_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The larval zebrafish intestine, like the intestines of other animals, has periodic propagative contractions that drive the motion of dense aggregates of Aeromonas and can ultimately cause their ejection (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether the collapses in the Aeromonas populations observed in the T6SS+ competition (Fig 3 BD) could be due to greater gut motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared intestinal movements of germ-free fish and fish monoassociated with the various V. cholerae strains using DICM, which allowed direct visualization of the intestinal epithelial tissue and luminal space (Fig 4A) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used image velocimetry techniques to quantify the frequency and amplitude of intestinal contractile waves (Fig 4 BD) (30, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the strains altered the frequency of peristaltic contractions compared with germ-free fish (Fig 4E); however, the amplitude of the contractions was greatly enhanced in the fish colonized with the T6SS+ strain, but not with other strains (Fig 4F and Movies S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the effecta roughly 200% increase in the amplitude of contractions compared with germ-free fishwas remarkable and unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, treatment with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine or deletion of all enteric neurons induces at most a change in peristaltic amplitude of approximately 40% (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although this T6SS-dependent alteration of host gut motility was unexpected, there are well-established precedents for T6SS-mediated V. cholerae interactions with eukaryotic cells driven by an ACD present in the C terminus of the VgrG-1 spike protein of the T6 secretion apparatus (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the ACD also might be responsible for the greater amplitude of gut motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we deleted the ACD of vgrG-1 in the constitutive T6SS-expressing V. cholerae T6SS+ strain (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we monocolonized zebrafish larvae with T6SS+ ACD V. cholerae, we observed no increase in either the frequency or amplitude of intestinal contractions compared with germ-free fish (Fig 4 E and F); however, this strain maintained the ability to kill Aeromonas in vitro at a rate similar to that of the T6SS+ strain, which indicates an otherwise functional T6SS (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the VgrG-1 ACD is specifically necessary for the increased amplitude of intestinal contractions observed in fish monocolonized with the T6SS+ strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then tested the ability of T6SS+ ACD V. cholerae to invade an intestinal Aeromonas population using the same zebrafish invasion assay described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Aeromonas population dropped precipitously following T6SS+ V. cholerae introduction, Aeromonas after T6SS+ ACD V. cholerae introduction remained abundant, averaging approximately 1,000 CFU per fish (n = 31 fish), similar to the numbers seen when challenged by T6SS strains (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS+ ACD V. cholerae was nonetheless present in the gut at high abundance, approximately 104 CFU per gut (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experiment demonstrates that removing the T6SS ACD eliminates V. choleraes ability to displace a competitor, despite an otherwise functional T6SS capable of killing in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that the ability of V. cholerae to dominate a gut colonized by Aeromonas works specifically by increasing the amplitude of host peristalsis in a manner dependent on the VgrG-1 ACD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that V. cholerae can use its type VI secretion system to amplify the intestinal contractions in zebrafish and induce the host to expel from its gut a resident microbiota of the genus Aeromonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling of T6SS activity to host contractions depended on an ACD of the T6SS apparatus; when the ACD was deleted, V. cholerae could no longer induce enhanced host contractions, and dense Aeromonas communities remained in the gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect on the host peristalsis was specific; deleting the ACD did not affect the ability of V. cholerae to kill Aeromonas on contact, and did not affect the ability of V. cholerae to enter and occupy the host intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V. cholerae itself seemed unaffected by the enhanced intestinal motility, likely due to its ability to remain planktonic and motile inside the zebrafish gut (Fig 1C and Movie S1), which is similar to what was seen previously for the highly motile symbiont Vibrio ZWU0020 (30, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results show that an enteric colonizer (V. cholerae) can use a previously undiscovered hostmicrobe interaction (T6SS-dependent enhancement of gut contractions) to influence the population dynamics of a competitor (Aeromonas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existence of this interspecies interaction raises intriguing questions and opens avenues for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps at the forefront is the question of what leads T6SS-affected host cells, likely lining the gut, to unleash large contractions of the entire organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host cellular mechanism is likely complex and could involve one or more cell types: immune cells, which at larval stages in zebrafish include neutrophils and macrophages that can respond to microbial presence (44) and may take up T6SS-active intestinal bacteria; epithelial cells, varieties of which line the gut and lie in close proximity to luminal bacteria; cells of the enteric nervous system, which include enteric neurons that coordinate muscle activity; and the smooth muscle cells that are the proximate cause of contractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the cells and signaling mechanisms that link the bacterial T6SS to intestinal mechanics is a challenging but attainable goal for research groups in the years to come.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tools of transgenic and gnotobiotic zebrafish together with 3D live imaging and image analysis empower future studies to discover new links between cellular processes and macroscopic organ behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This newly discovered T6SS function is important in its own right, standing out from previously identified mechanisms for orchestrating the ecology of the microbiome (48) because it highlights the role of the host fluid-mechanical environment in shaping gut population dynamics, an emergent theme in contemporary microbiome research (30, 47, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T6SS can mediate interbacterial toxicity (51) and may be an important weapon that bacteria use to fight each other within the animal intestinal microbiome (22, 24, 25, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report suggests that the host immune system also may play a role in this T6SS warfare (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the prevalence of T6SS among bacteria, the possibility that gut-colonizing bacteria can use the T6SS to manipulate host peristalsis suggests that this could be a common tactic for bacteria to indirectly influence interbacterial competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, exogenous delivery of T6SS proteins, or their engineering into otherwise beneficial microbes, could offer a new path to therapeutic modulation of human gastrointestinal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observations may also inform our understanding of T6SS regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that chitinous material triggers T6SS activity in V. cholerae (19, 36, 40); chitin can be found in crab shells, zooplankton exoskeletons, and marine snow commonly colonized by Vibrios in aquatic environments (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that wild-type C6706 V. cholerae, but not T6SS derivatives, was capable of modest killing of Aeromonas in vitro (Fig 2A), consistent with previously reported findings for C6706 T6 killing of an E. coli target (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed small reductions in Aeromonas counts and rare extinction events in vivo (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2C and 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the germ-free zebrafish used here were not provided with a chitin source, it is interesting to speculate that endogenous chitin production recently documented within the juvenile zebrafish gut (54) induced the wild-type V. cholerae T6-mediated activity observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the presence of chitin in fish diets, either naturally or in aquaculture, may alter the abundance of V. cholerae in the fish intestinal microbiome, with potential implications for the transmission of disease to humans from aquatic reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will determine the contribution of chitin signaling in T6 expression by V. cholerae in fish intestinal environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most directly, our work sheds light on the role of the T6SS in the ecological dynamics of V. cholerae colonization of a vertebrate host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the T6SS to amplify host intestinal mechanics was previously undetected, likely for three reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the development of cholera in humans is a complex, multifactorial process in which the role of T6SS may be confounded by other factors, most importantly the strong effects of the cholera toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the animal models typically used in cholera research are not native cholera hosts, and the mechanisms of their colonization may be different; however, fish naturally host V. cholerae, and because zebrafish colonization depends less on other factors, we could detect the effects of T6SS on intestinal movements, and we could then use genetically modified V. cholerae strains to confirm the molecular mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the zebrafish model allows direct, quantitative, in vivo imaging using modern microscopy methods, in contrast to indirect, static, DNA- or RNA-sequencingbased assays typically used to study mouse or human microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo imaging greatly facilitates observations of intestinal activity and enables the discovery of sudden spatiotemporal changes in bacterial distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How our findings may map onto V. cholerae colonization in humans is unknown, but a role for T6SS-mediated activity is certainly plausible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishing this will require further investigation, especially for the potential aim of designing therapeutics that target the T6SS to prevent colonization in humans or in environmental reservoirs, such as fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our results enhance our understanding of the strategies and abilities of V. cholerae, a pathogen that continues to impact millions of people worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethics_Statement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments involving zebrafish were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Oregons Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed standard methods (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gnotobiotic_Techniques  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wild-type larval zebrafish devoid of microbes were derived as described previously (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, fertile eggs were collected and placed in a sterile antibiotic embryo media solution consisting of 100 g/mL ampicillin, 250 ng/mL amphotericin B, 10 g/mL gentamycin, 1 g/mL tetracycline, and 1 g/mL chloramphenicol for approximately 6 h. The eggs were then washed in a sodium hypochlorite solution and a polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Washed embryos were distributed in sets of 15 into tissue culture flasks containing 15 L of sterile embryo media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flasks of larval zebrafish were inspected for sterility before being used in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Strains_and_Culture_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. veronii (ZOR0001; PRJNA205571) and Vibrio (ZWU0020, PRJNA205585) were isolated from the zebrafish intestinal tract as described previously (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strains were fluorescently labeled with EGFP or dTomato for imaging experiments using methods similar to those described previously (30, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All V. cholerae strains were derivatives of El Tor C6706 str-2 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cultures were routinely grown at 30 °C or 37 °C in Lysogeny broth (LB) with shaking, or statically on LB agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In-frame deletion mutants and promoter replacements in V. cholerae were constructed using a previously described allelic-exchange method (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard molecular biology-based methods were used for DNA manipulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA-modifying enzymes and restriction nucleases (Promega and New England BioLabs), Gibson assembly mix (New England BioLabs), and Q5, Phusion, and OneTaq DNA polymerases (New England BioLabs) were used following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recombinant DNA constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Culture-Based_Quantification_of_Bacterial_Populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Germ-free larval zebrafish were inoculated with select bacterial strains as described previously (30, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria were grown on a shaker in Luria broth for 1014 h at 30 °C, prepared for inoculation by pelleting for 2 min at 7,000 × g, and washed once in sterile embryo media before inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inoculum of 106 CFU/mL was used for Aeromonas ZOR0001 (PRJNA205571) and Vibrio ZWU0020 (PRJNA205585) strains, and an inoculum of 107 CFU/mL was used for V. cholerae strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial inoculums were added directly to tissue culture flasks containing germ-free larval zebrafish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Measurements_of_Bacterial_Competition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vitro killing assays, bacterial strains were inoculated from glycerol stock and shaken in LB at 30 °C or 37 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then harvested, washed twice in sterile PBS, and normalized to OD600 = 1 in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairs of strains were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and 25 L of the liquid was spotted onto a 0.20-m-diameter porous nylon membrane filter (EMD Millipore) placed on an LB agar plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being allowed to dry, the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Each membrane was then carefully removed from the agar plate and vortexed in sterile PBS for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The killing rate was assessed by comparing the target cell numbers before and after incubation by plating and counting CFUs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An antibiotic-resistant marker (streptomycin or gentamicin) inserted into the target strain chromosome enabled discrimination of target cells for CFU counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vitro time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, bacterial strains were inoculated from glycerol stocks and shaken in LB at 30 °C or 37 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overnight culture was brought back to exponential phase by diluting 70 L of culture into 4 mL of fresh LB and shaking for 3 h at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frames and coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to form an agar pad using 1% low-melting-point agarose in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exponential-phase cells were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in fresh LB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 1 L of mixed cells (vol:vol ratio = 1:1) was spotted onto the agar pad, allowed to dry, and then covered with a coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescent-labeled cells were imaged in each of two fluorescence channels (mTFP and mKO) every 10 min using a 63× oil immersion objective lens on an inverted wide-field fluorescent microscope (Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquired images were processed with customized MATLAB scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro time-lapse images were processed by aligning to correct for field drift and cropping to keep areas that overlap in all images, and then identifying cells by thresholding based on fluorescence intensity, identifying connected above-threshold pixels as bacterial objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MATLAB script used to perform this analysis is available at https://github.com/Jinyuan1998/T6SSinvitro_imageAnalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Light_Sheet_Fluorescence_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Light sheet microscopy was performed on a home-built light sheet microscope based on the design of Keller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27) as described previously (29, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the beams from either of two continuous-wave lasers (Coherent Sapphire, 448 nm and 561 nm) were rapidly scanned using a galvanometer mirror and then demagnified to create a thin sheet of excitation light perpendicular to and at the focus of an imaging objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimen was moved through this sheet in 1-m steps, and fluorescence emission was captured to create a 3D image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To image the entire larval zebrafish gut, four subregions were imaged and later manually registered and stitched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All exposure times were 30 ms, and the excitation laser power was set to 5 mW measured at the laser output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 5.5-megapixel scientific-grade complementary metal oxide semiconductor camera (Cooke Corporation) with a 40× 1.0 NA objective lens (Zeiss) was used for all light sheet imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For time series imaging, scans were done at 20-min intervals for 1217 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Handling_and_Mounting_for_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimens were prepared for imaging as described previously (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larval zebrafish were anesthetized using tricaine methanesulfonate at 120 g/mL, placed in melted 0.5% agarose gel at no more than 42 °C, and pulled individually into glass capillaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each capillary was then mounted on a holder on a computer-controlled translation stage, and each fish was extruded in a plug of gel into a specimen chamber filled with sterile embryo media and tricaine methanesulfonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluid in the specimen chamber was maintained at 28 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All time-series experiments were performed overnight beginning in the evening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging-Based_Quantification_of_Bacterial_Populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo gut bacterial populations (Fig 3) were quantified from light sheet images using an analysis pipeline as described previously (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, bacterial aggregates and individual bacteria were identified separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of bacteria per aggregate was estimated by dividing the total fluorescence intensity of the clump by the average intensity of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discrete individuals were detected using a wavelet-based spot detection algorithm, with autofluorescent host cells and other nonbacterial identified objects rejected using a support vector machine-based classifier augmented with manual curation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Collapses of bacterial populations were identified from light sheet microscopy time series images and visually confirmed as described previously (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population collapses in Aeromonas were defined as a decrease in the total population of at least a factor of 10 in one time step (20 min), together with at least a factor of 2 decrease relative to the original population at the next time step, the latter to false-positive results from single bad data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intestinal_Motility_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intestinal motility in larval zebrafish was imaged using DICM as described previously (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Videos were recorded at 5 fps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A velocity vector field was determined from the image series using image velocimetry, and the amplitudes and frequencies of gut motions along the anteroposterior (AP) axis were obtained using a previously described analysis pipeline (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the AP component of the vector field was averaged along the dorsoventral direction, resulting in a scalar motility measure at each position along the gut axis and at each time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of gut contractions was calculated as the location of the first peak in the temporal autocorrelation of the motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude was calculated as the square root of the spatially averaged power spectrum at the previously determined frequency, providing the magnitude of the periodic motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
