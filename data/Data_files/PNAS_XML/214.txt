Actomyosin dynamics drive local membrane component organization in an in vitro active composite layer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This manuscript addresses the role of active processes in the spatial organization and dynamics of cell surface components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a reconstituted minimal system, we provide experimental evidence for a proposed clustering mechanism that relies on the intrinsic, active mechanics of actin filaments and myosin motors expected to be present at the cell cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between the actomyosin and the lipid bilayer gives rise to an emergent active composite with properties that resemble those observed in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clustering mechanism is a key feature of the active composite cell surface model and furthers our understanding of the multiple ways in which the cell surface might regulate its composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The surface of a living cell provides a platform for receptor signaling, protein sorting, transport, and endocytosis, whose regulation requires the local control of membrane organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has revealed a role for dynamic actomyosin in membrane protein and lipid organization, suggesting that the cell surface behaves as an active composite composed of a fluid bilayer and a thin film of active actomyosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reconstitute an analogous system in vitro that consists of a fluid lipid bilayer coupled via membrane-associated actin-binding proteins to dynamic actin filaments and myosin motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon complete consumption of ATP, this system settles into distinct phases of actin organization, namely bundled filaments, linked apolar asters, and a lattice of polar asters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These depend on actin concentration, filament length, and actin/myosin ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During formation of the polar aster phase, advection of the self-organizing actomyosin network drives transient clustering of actin-associated membrane components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regeneration of ATP supports a constitutively remodeling actomyosin state, which in turn drives active fluctuations of coupled membrane components, resembling those observed at the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a multicomponent membrane bilayer, this remodeling actomyosin layer contributes to changes in the extent and dynamics of phase-segregating domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show how local membrane composition can be driven by active processes arising from actomyosin, highlighting the fundamental basis of the active composite model of the cell surface, and indicate its relevance to the study of membrane organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dynamic_Association_of_a_Lipid_Bilayer_Probe_with_Actin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We created supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) doped with 2% Ni2+-chelated lipids [DGS-NTA(Ni2+)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ni2+-chelated lipids recruit histidine-rich proteins, including an engineered membraneactin linker (HYE) constructed from the actin-binding domain of Ezrin (EzrABD), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and 10 tandem histidine residues allowing stable SLB binding during the time of an experiment (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the EzrABD as a membraneactin linker because we previously found that it is sufficient to confer actin-dependent clustering to fusion proteins in vivo (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also created variants of HYE: one with a point mutation in the EzrABD (R579A) that abolishes actin binding (48) and ablates the ability to cluster transmembrane proteins (15), and another, nonfluorescent derivative, HKE, with the tripeptide KCK in place of YFP (Fig 1 A and B) (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, bilayers containing either HYE or HKE recruited actin filaments (Fig S1B), resulting in a thin film adjacent to the bilayer (Fig 1C and Fig S1C), whereas HYE(R579A) was unable to localize actin to the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin concentrations were restricted to the range of 1001,000 nM to limit the actin layer thickness to less than 10 actin filaments (see Table S1 for details of the experimental conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We controlled the length of these filaments by adding stoichiometric amounts of capping protein (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce contractile stresses and flows, we added the motor protein myosin II and ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Membrane-Tethered_Actin_Filaments_Alter_the_Mobility_of_HYE_Constructs_That_Are_Competent_to_Bind_Actin_as_Well_as_Those_That_Cannot_Bind_Actin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first characterized the lateral mobility of actin-binding EzrABD constructs in the absence and presence of filamentous actin using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobility of SLB-bound proteins was probed by observing the diffusion of His10-tagged fluorescent proteins in FRAP experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRAP curves could be well fit to a single exponential function, from which we computed an effective diffusion coefficient; His10-GFP and HYE showed a similar diffusion coefficient in the absence of actin (Fig S1 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adding increasing concentrations of filamentous actin decreased the effective diffusion coefficient of wild-type HYE but had no effect on the R579A mutant (Fig 1C and Fig S1G), and the immobile fraction of HYE was slightly increased from 12% to 16% in the presence of 1,000 nM actin (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing the average length of actin filaments by using capping protein (CP) (Fig S1D) increased HYE mobility as judged by FRAP (Fig 1D) and FCS measurements (Fig S1 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the recovery of HYE in regions covered by actin filaments reflects the transient nature of the interaction of EzrABD with actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when we tethered actin filaments to bilayers with the nonfluorescent Ezrin construct, HKE, and then measured diffusion of HYE(R579A) in the same bilayers, we observed a significant reduction in mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobility of HYE(R579A) decreased monotonically with increasing actin concentrations, but this effect was less pronounced than that observed with wild-type HYE (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, His10-GFP did not show a significant reduction in its mobility in the presence of actin filaments tethered via HKE to SLBs as detected by FCS (Fig S1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the fluidity of the lipid bilayer itself was not affected by the membrane tethered actin network, as the recovery of the fluorescently labeled lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (RhoPE) was unchanged (Fig S1K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a previous report on the effect of a dense actin network on the diffusion of other membrane-associated proteins in vitro (41) and show that the association of actin with the membrane bilayer provides an impedance for the mobility of membrane components that can sterically and biochemically interact with actin filaments, evoking the idea of a membrane fence (7, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is to be noted that this effect is diminished when the actin filaments are too short to form an entangled meshwork as observed when we reduced actin-filament length with titrated amounts of capping protein (Fig 1D and Fig S1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Myosin_Motors_and_Membrane-Bound_Actin_Filaments_Self-Organize_into_Distinct_Configurations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we added bipolar myosin filamentscomposed of 100500 proteins (51) with lengths between 0.5 and 1.2 µm (Fig S2A)to a bilayer-bound thin film of actin filaments in the presence of a fixed amount of ATP and allowed the system to evolve until the ATP was consumed, we reproducibly observed three distinct organizational states: (i) filament bundles, (ii) linked apolar asters, and (iii) disordered lattices of polar asters (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of actomyosin networks in the bundled state was correlated over distances  greater than 5 µm (Fig S2 B and C), whereas the polar aster state was characterized by islands of actin reflected in a local minimum of the spatial density correlation (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linked apolar aster phase was characterized by a low correlation in filament orientation (Fig S2 B and C) and by the absence of oscillations in the spatial density correlation (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three states (after consumption of the ATP pool) were obtained by varying (i) actin concentration, (ii) filament length, and (iii) filament-to-motor ratios (Fig 2B and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the polar asters most closely reflect the organization of the contractile platforms that were proposed by our theoretical model, and that are supposed to be responsible for the clustering of membrane particles (15), we focus in the following on these structures and conducted further experiments in conditions geared toward aster formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Polar_Aster_Phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next characterized the architecture and dynamics of the polar aster phase in multiple ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we noted that the size of a single aster depends on the average actin filament length (Fig 2C), in which myosin motors have contracted multiple filaments into a configuration that blocks further rearrangement, indicative of a jammed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, analyzing their spatial distribution revealed that the asters formed a disordered lattice with a characteristic spacing on the order of microns (Fig S2E and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the localization of fluorescently labeled capping protein demonstrated the polar nature of the actin asters, in which all filaments are oriented with their (capped) barbed ends facing inward, toward the core of the aster while pointed ends face outward (Fig 2D and Fig S2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this interpretation, we also observed that fluorescently labeled myosin IIa barbed-enddirected motorlies in the cores of asters (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar observations of actin and myosin organization were obtained in samples imaged by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning the sample with multipoint structural illumination microscopy (SIM) in all three spatial dimensions allowed the clear visualization of the contraction of single actin filaments into asters (Fig 2D) and of the thin film of membrane bound F-actin (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of linked apolar asters, however, the distribution of capping protein was more spread out, as some filaments are linked by multiple myosin filaments on both ends (Fig S2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the central region of sporadically forming larger asters, we observed distinct rings of capping protein (Fig S2I), another hallmark of myosin-driven polarity sorting and filament organization (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is to be noted that the formation of actin asters (as well as the other configurations obtained under different initial conditions) occurred over the major area of the sample, which was tested by the imaging of multiple regions at random positions (Fig S2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bilayer_Components_Are_Advected_by_Contractile_Actomyosin_Flows  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked whether contractile actomyosin flows advect coupled bilayer components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed the dynamics of the contractile system and its associated membrane components as the system approached the steady-state polar aster configuration described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle image velocimetry (PIV) of movies of labeled actin filaments revealed regions where the net divergence of the velocity was negative at the sites of aster formation, and with myosin-driven contractile flows of 0.51 µm/min (Fig S3 AC) as observed in other in vitro studies (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key prediction of the active composite model is that contractile actin currents will advect actin-binding membrane proteins into clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this prediction, we observed that the HYE construct forms clusters that colocalize with forming, myosin-induced actin asters (Fig 3 A and B and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of the regions of aster formation confirmed that the clustering of HYE occurred only when and where actin flows were contractile (i.e., at positions and times where the divergence of actin velocity is negative; Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whenever the local contractile currents ceased, the associated HYE clusters dissolved, indicating that cluster formation was due to myosin-generated flows and not simply increased actin density in the aster (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further characterized the myosin dependence of density fluctuations in membrane-associated proteins by a cross-correlation analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected time-lapse movies of labeled actin and HYE and, for every 5 × 5 pixel region, computed (i) the temporal cross-correlation coefficient between the intensities of HYE and labeled actin and (ii) the temporal variance of the local actin density (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter distinguishes between regions of static and dynamic actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that HYE and actin dynamics were correlated only in regions where the actin network was dynamic (Fig 3 D and E and Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These zones of strong correlation appeared only during the contractile period of aster formation and were absent before myosin addition as well as in the jammed steady state (Fig 3 D and E and Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Advection of membrane-associated proteins was not the result of bulk hydrodynamic flow in the membrane, but required specific interaction between the membrane component and filamentous actin, because HYE(R579A) did not cluster in bilayers to which actin was linked via HKE (Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, no effect of actomyosin-driven HYE on bulk lipid dynamics could be detected by the use of the fluorescently labeled lipid RhoPE and the cross-correlation analysis (Fig S3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the PIV data of actin flows (Fig 3C) and the cross-correlation analysis (Fig 3 D and E) indicated that advection drives clustering of actin-associated components during myosin-dependent aster formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emergence_of_an_Active_ActinMembrane_Composite_at_High_Concentrations_of_ATP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon complete ATP consumption (initial ATP, less_than0.01 mM), our actomyosin networks eventually reached a static steady state consistent with earlier reports (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cortex of a living cell, however, is continuously driven out of equilibrium by high concentrations (25 mM) of ATP (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic this situation, we added ATP (1 mM final concentration) to preformed, membrane-associated actomyosin asters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of ATP induced a period of reorganization during which large, static asters dissolved (Fig 4A and Movie S2), and the system moved to a new steady state, characterized by highly dynamic actin filaments (Fig S4A) with a statistically uniform, time-averaged density at length scales of  greater than 5 µm (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse movies revealed transient, localized accumulations of actin filaments that accreted and dispersed over tens of seconds (Fig S4A, Upper, and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the same result when we reconstituted the system with an ATP-regenerating system (Fig S4A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dynamic density fluctuations persisted for several minutes after addition of ATP (and much longer with the ATP regeneration system) (Fig S4 B and C), suggesting a nonequilibrium steady state in which continuous remodeling was driven by persistent myosin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked whether the dynamics of HYE were affected by the continuous remodeling of the actomyosin network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high ATP concentrations, the cross-correlation analysis of HYE and actin densities had a trend similar to that observed during contractile aster formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, HYE and actin dynamics were strongly correlated in regions of highly dynamic actin (Fig 4 B and C and Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active composite framework (33) predicts large, myosin-dependent spatial and temporal fluctuations in HYE density, similar to those observed for GPI-anchored proteins in living cells (15) and for other active systems in both theory and experiment (47, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other phases of the actomyosin system, the pixel intensity distribution of HYE in the driven steady state showed a broader, non-Gaussian distribution, with a significant rightward skew indicative of HYE clustering (Fig 4D and Fig S4 E and F), similar to that observed for GPI-anchored proteins in vivo, consistent with theoretical predictions (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key statistical signature of actively driven systems is the appearance of giant number fluctuations (56), which we previously observed for GPI-anchored proteins in live cells (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for the presence of giant number fluctuations in our reconstituted system by measuring variations in HYE intensity over different spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we varied the size of our observation window and measured how fluctuations in fluorescence intensity change with window size (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, for systems at equilibrium (i.e., no actin, actin alone, or static actomyosin cases), HYE intensity fluctuations scaled with the window size b as b with  = 0.49 (±0.02; n = 27), in good agreement with the expected behavior of number fluctuations in an equilibrium system away from criticality ( = 0.5) (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the constitutively remodeling steady state exhibited  = 0.86 (±0.09; n = 7), when evaluated over window sizes larger than the mean F-actin length (5 µm) (Fig 4 E and F, Fig S4 G and H, and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed these giant number fluctuations in our reconstituted system only at high concentrations of ATP (Fig 4E) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the average size of dynamic clusters produced in this driven steady state was significantly smaller than our smallest interrogation window, and, therefore, we were analyzing fluctuations that occur on a length scale significantly larger than the cluster size (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the large number fluctuations are a consequence of active driving of HYE by the myosin-propelled actin filaments upon ATP consumption, and that this actomyosinmembrane system can be considered as an active composite system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Consequences_of_an_Actomyosin_Layer_on_a_Phase-Separating_Lipid_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After establishing the effect of the active actomyosin layer on the organization of a single passive membrane component (HYE) in a homogenous bilayer, we asked whether this activity could have effects on the configuration of a multicomponent bilayer, namely the phase segregation behavior of lipids in the SLB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we formed a standard ternary lipid mixture of DOPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and cholesterol, doped with RhoPE as a marker for liquid disordered domains and DGS-NTA(Ni2+) on mica sheets (42), and imaged the system on a confocal microscope with a low magnification (20×, N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.75) (Fig 5A and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After formation of bilayers and subsequent addition of HYE and actin filaments in the homogenous mixed lipid phase at 37 °C, we decreased the temperature to 28 °C to induce phase separation, mounted the chamber on the microscope, and began imaging (with a minimal dead time of 60 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition temperature for this lipid mix was about Tc = 33 °C in agreement with previous reports (58), which we only could roughly estimate by warming the sample up from T = 28 °C to T = 37 °C as our setup did not allow controlled, repeated heating and cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HYE and actin were homogeneously distributed in regions devoid of visible lipid domains (Fig 5B, Top), HYE was excluded from liquid ordered (lo) domains and located in the liquid disordered (ld) phase as expected for the DGS-NTA(Ni2+) lipids (Fig 5B, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that actin filaments followed HYE and were excluded from lo domains as well, eventually resulting in a more bundled organization in the ld phase irrespective of the F-actin length (Fig 5B, Fig S5A, and Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the behavior of lo domains over time, a steady growth was detected in the HYE-only bilayers (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This growth of the average size of lo domains was slowed down by membrane-bound actin filaments, whereat longer, entangling actin filaments acted as barriers for lo domains (Fig 5 C and D), but shorter actin filaments (shorter than the domain diameter) succumbed to their displacement (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, the presence of active myosin motors together with longer actin filaments stalled the increase of average domain size even though at the outset of observation the phase segregation was comparable to that obtained with or without bound actin filaments (Fig 5 C and D and Fig S5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared net lo-domain area fraction in a given frame from the beginning of imaging (t0) to later time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In free SLBs and those with F-actin alone, the net area of lo domains (Alo) remained roughly constant over this time window but decreased in the presence of the remodeling actomyosin network (Fig 5E, Fig S5D, and Table S4 for experimental details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely to be due to a loss of small domains (compared with the actin filament length) by the local remodeling of the actomyosin network in combination with a cessation in growth of larger domains (Fig S5B and Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-correlation between actin filaments and HYE in the presence of myosin contraction still showed the signature of actomyosin-induced advection, indicating that it is indeed the actomyosin activity causing the loss of lo domains (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed this lo domain reduction reliably only in the presence of long, entangled actin filament networks, possibly a result of the size-dependent interplay between actin filaments and lo domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these experiments indicate that the engagement of the actomyosin layer on a phase-segregating bilayer influences its phase segregation characteristics in a length scale-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actin filament length scale sets a limit on the domain sizes, the actomyosin network can act on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of this interplay will also depend on the strength of actinmembrane link, and to which component of the lipid bilayer actin is linked to, underscoring the complex nature of active actomyosin membrane composite systems that remain to be studied in more detail in future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we show that myosin-driven actin networks affect the organization of membrane proteins, transforming the actinmyosinmembrane system under continuous ATP consumption to an active composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examining first the patterns formed by actin filaments and myosin motors, we found that filament length is an important determinant in actomyosin structure formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in other in vitro works, long actin filaments form bundled structures (37, 54) or contracted networks (35, 37, 59) under the action of myosin II, whereas at the shorter actin filament lengths used here, they gave rise to compact, isolated asters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the following parameters characterize the different static states obtained: (i) actin filament length, (ii) myosin-to-actin filament ratio, and (iii) F-actin concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into consideration the complexity of the cell cortex composition (25), the Arp2/3 complex and the Formin, mDia1, are major factors controlling actin polymerization and giving rise to branched and straight filaments, respectively (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The action of actin filament severing agent cofilin could serve to further differentiate the population of filaments, giving rise to a hierarchy of length scales in which smaller filaments may form structures such as the asters observed here, whereas longer filaments would assemble into a dense meshwork or stress fibers (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the system exhibiting distinct states, similar starting conditions result for certain parameters (e.g., [actin] = 600 nM, [myoII] = 90, Lf-actin = 3 µm), in different configurations, which most likely reflects the lack of precise control of actin filament length in our system and the proximity to a phase boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally and importantly, a continuous supply of ATP and the transient binding of actin filaments to the bilayer drives the system into a mode of continuous remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focusing on the effect of the actomyosin system on the dynamics of membrane components, we found that the process of aster formation transiently accumulated a membrane component coupled to actin (HYE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PIV and cross-correlation analysis indicate that the transient accumulation was driven by the contractile flows induced by myosin and was not merely a result of the increased actin density at the aster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the advection of HYE by actomyosin did not induce hydrodynamic flows in the bilayer, as evidenced by the lack of clustering of bilayer components that were not capable of binding actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At high ATP concentrations (1 mM; or in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system), persistent motor activity continually exerted stresses on the filaments driving only the actin-associated membrane components out of equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed hallmarks of active dynamics on the bilayer, such as persistent advection, clustering, and anomalous density fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a reconstituted active composite system has been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the actin cortex may influence plasma membrane organization not only through the interaction of lipids and proteins with a stable actin meshwork (9, 42) or polymerizing actin (40, 44), but also through the flows of actin filaments generated by myosin-induced stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the flows of myosin-driven short actin filaments influence only those membrane components (proteins and lipids) that can bind to actin such as HYE, whereas the mutant HYE(R579A) and the inert lipid RhoPE do not show a change in their dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this behavior is entirely consistent with our earlier observations in cells and theoretical predictions, where actin-associated components exhibit nonequilibrium behavior, such as giant fluctuations and temperature-independent diffusion behavior whereas unconnected components remain inert (13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmembrane proteins with actin-binding domains in their cytoplasmic tails directly associate with actin at the inner leaflet, and we have recently shown that long acyl chain-containing outer-leaflet GPI-anchored proteins interact with actin-associated phosphatidylserine (PS) at the cytoplasmic leaflet, in the presence of adequate cholesterol (60), indicating that the actin-dependent clustering of membrane components requires a direct link to actin filaments and actomyosin dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These may be understood in terms of the active hydrodynamics of actin filaments and myosin (56), which does not necessarily induce measurable hydrodynamic flows in the plasma membrane of unconnected components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that these observations do not exclude either the picket fence or phase segregation mechanisms that have been proposed earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of actin and myosin-induced stresses, i.e., processes described by active mechanics, should be included to arrive at a more complete description of the membrane in a living cell (33, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the context of a phase-segregating membrane bilayer, we found that the remodeling actomyosin layer contributed to a change in the size and dynamics of already formed (lo) domains (reduced/stalled growth), compared with a free membrane or one with associated static F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although at this point we do not fully understand the reason for the reduced membrane domain segregation, it is likely that the active actomyosin churns up the phase-segregating bilayer to create either domains smaller than the optical limit or simply mixes up the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our data indicate that the membrane domains influence the actin organization, imposing a minimal length scale for actin filaments on the order of the membrane domain diameter, below which domains will not be affected by actomyosin dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of slowing of domain growth may be amplified in our system by frictional coupling to the substrate that is likely to influence domain growth and dynamics (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of F-actin on domain dynamics is expected to be much stronger in a freestanding membrane system such as observed in GUVs (40, 43) or support-free planar bilayers (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theoretical work from the laboratory of one of us suggests that the phase-segregating active composite membrane will exhibit specific characteristics in the distribution of domain sizes and its scaling behavior (63), and the experiments shown here exemplify the number of effects that such an active composite system can have on their dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The active composite nature of the cell surface also has implications for cellular function in the context of signaling, as several signaling proteins resident in the cell membrane have the capability to interact with cortical actin either directly (64), via linkers (65), or indeed via transbilayer interactions of inner leaflet lipids (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signaling that originates at the cell surface may be influenced, enhanced, or facilitated by interacting with actomyosin-related proteins (such as nucleators) that locally regulate the dynamics of actin such that cell surface proteins are organized optimally for their function, resulting in enhanced reaction rates on the cell surface (66) or an efficient reading of a spatially inhomogeneous external ligand (67); indeed, any function in which the spatiotemporal dynamics of cell surface proteins is important is a potential target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We emphasize that the system we have described here is a minimal realization of an active composite layer, where we have included only key ingredients: small actin filaments of prescribed length confined to a thin film on a supported membrane bilayer by using an actin-binding binding membrane components (HYE) and, finally, ATP and myosin minifilaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results on the actin configurations obtained after consuming the ATP in the system are consistent with the prediction of our earlier theory [and indeed others have predicted this for related systems (52, 68)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length scale of clustering and actomyosin structures demonstrated here are larger than those proposed for the cell in the context of GPI-anchored proteins, but this can be attributed to the differences in length scales (Lactin = 27 µm in vitro, Lactin = 0.10.3 µm in vivo; LmyoII = 0.51.2 µm in vitro, LmyoII = 0.2 µm in vivo), composition, and local environment between our in vitro system and the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time required for aster formation at low ATP levels (3060 s) is longer than expected in cells, likely due to the jamming of actin filaments during this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the actin dynamics observed in the remodeling state (less_than1 s) more closely resembles the turnover of nanoclusters in the cell (0.11 s1) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ease with which this in vitro system reproduces the essential signatures of an active composite argues for its relevance to the understanding of membrane organization of the living cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Active actin and myosin were purified from chicken breast with minor modifications of protocols described earlier (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-tagged C-terminal fragment of Ezrin and its isoforms (HYE, HKE, and HYE-RA) as well as CP were purified from bacterial lysates using affinity chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supported lipid bilayers were formed by small unilamellar vesicles of DOPC and NTA-lipids in custom-built experimental chambers on cleaned glass slides, to localize the His-tagged proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actin length was regulated by titrated amounts of CP during F-actin polymerization or by shear forces through pipetting F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After addition of polymerized actin, myosin II was added to the chamber in ATP-containing buffers and appropriate salt conditions to generate minifilaments (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase-segregating lipid mixtures of multiple lipid species and cholesterol were prepared in chloroform, deposited on experimental chambers formed on freshly cleaved mica supports (100-m thickness), and rehydrated for bilayer formation (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence imaging was carried out on a custom-designed total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, and electron microscopy on myosin II filaments was performed following established protocols (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image analysis was carried out by pipelines developed specifically for the purpose of each experiment by using available routines in Image J and Matlab, which are available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed descriptions of the material and methods used in this study are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reagents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If not otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl] (nickel salt) [DGS-NTA(Ni2+)], and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (RhoPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Actin_and_Myosin_II_Purification_and_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Actin was purified from chicken breast following the protocol from Spudich and Watt (69) and kept on ice in monomeric form in G-buffer (2 mM Tris base, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TCEP-HCl, 0.04% NaN3, 0.1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0); myosin II was obtained from chicken breast following a modified protocol from Pollard (70) and kept in monomeric form in myoII-buffer (500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chicken actin and myosin II were fluorescently labeled with maleimide-Atto565, and maleimide-Atto633, respectively (Atto-Tec GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For maleimide labeling, monomeric protein was reduced for 30 min on ice with 5 mM TCEP followed by buffer exchange using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with buffer lacking reducing agent (for actin: 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.0; for myosin: 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maleimide dyes were added in 5 molar excess, incubated for 15 min on ice, and the reaction was quenched with 10 mM DTT for 510 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monomeric actin and myosin were then polymerized at room temperature (RT) by adjusting the buffer conditions (for actin: 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2; for myosin II: 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) and separated from unbound dye by centrifugation [for actin: TLA100.3 (Beckman Coulter) at 200,000 × g and RT for 20 min; myosin II: 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min], removal of the supernatant, resuspension of the pellet, and dialysis in protein monomer buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For myosin II, functional proteins are separated from dead heads by a round of binding and unbinding to F-actin at 5:1 actin-to-myosin ratio (switch from no ATP to 3 mM ATP) followed by a spin at 200,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 rotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant containing functional myosin II is dialyzed against myoII-buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_and_Purification_of_Protein_Constructs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EzrABD constructs [HYE, HKE, HYE(R579A)] are based on the human C-terminal Ezrin cDNAs described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48, kindly provided by Helen Morrison, Leibniz Institute of Age Research, Jena, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added on the N-terminal side of the EzrABD [or EzrABD(R579A)] 10×His domains followed by a yellow fluorescent protein and a single arginine as linker, expressed the protein in Escherichia coli, and purified it as described in detail elsewhere (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of affinity of the EzrABD for F-actin is reported to be in the nanomolar range (48), and the 10×His domain provided a stable binding to bilayers containing 2%mol DGS-NTA(Ni2+) lipids at buffer conditions used in this study (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate fluorescently tagged CP, the 1- and 2-isoforms of murine heterodimeric capping protein were cloned into pETM20 and pETM33, respectively, and an N-terminal SNAP-tag was fused to the -subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both subunits were coexpressed in E. coli (Rosetta) for 16 h at 18 °C and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) over a 5-mL HiTrap Chelating column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) followed by combined TEV/Prescission cleavage of the N-terminal tags overnight on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After desalting over a HiLoad Desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), uncleaved protein and free tags, both of which still contained a His-tag, were removed by recirculation over the IMAC column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flowthrough containing the fully cleaved heterodimer was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography over a Mono Q column and labeled with a 1.5-fold molar excess of the fluorescent SNAP substrate (SNAP surface Alexa Fluor 647) (New England BioLabs) overnight on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labeled protein was separated from free dye by gel filtration over a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare Life Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in storage buffer [10 mM TrisCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of the N-terminal SNAP-tag did not affect capping activity as measured by polymerization of pyrene-actin in bulk or capping in single-filament total internal reflection fluorescence microscope assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supported_Lipid_Bilayer_and_Experimental_Chamber_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glassware for lipid handling and SLB formation was cleaned with Hellmanex III (Hellma Analytics) following the manufacturers instructions, immersed in 3 M NaOH and sonicated for 20 min (Bath Sonicator; Optics Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between the steps, glass was thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ water, and finally blown dry with N2 (glass slides) or placed for 3 h in a drying oven at 80 °C (glass vials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experimental chamber, the middle part of 0.2-mL PCR tubes (Tarsons Products) without their lid were stuck to cleaned cover slides (borosilicate no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1; 25-mm diameter; Warner Instruments) using UV glue (NOA88; Norland Products) and an UV ozone cleaner (PSD-UV8T; Novascan) for curing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imaging, the cover slide was mounted on a microscope stage in a fitting metal chamber (RC40-HP; Warner Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SLBs were formed by fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipid mixtures containing 98% mol DOPC and 2% mol DGS-NTA(Ni2+) were mixed together with 1 mL of chloroform (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in a cleaned amber glass vial (B7990-2A; Thermo Fisher Scientific), dried under a N2 stream, placed in a vacuum desiccator overnight, and resuspended in SUV storage buffer [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 5% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 7.2] to a final lipid concentration of 4 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SUVs of 80-nm diameter were formed by the extrusion method using a lipid extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) with an 80-nm pore size polycarbonate filter membrane (GE Whatman).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For SLB formation, 1020 µL of SUV mix were added to 100 µL of SLB formation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Hepes, pH 5.5), incubated for 20 min at RT, and washed 10 times with SLB working buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 0.1 mg/mL -casein, pH 7.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments with F-actin, SLB working buffer was replaced by 100 µL of KMEH (50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of Hepes as pH buffer instead of imidazole allowed a more stable binding of His-tagged proteins to DGS-NTA(Ni2+) lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Formation_of_Phase-Separating_SLBs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on a method described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42, a lipid mix of 32.6%mol DOPC, 32.6%mol DPPC and 32.7%mol cholesterol with additional 2%mol DGS-NTA(Ni2+) and 0.1%mol RhoPE was prepared in chloroform at a total lipid concentration of 2 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A circular mica sheet (grade V-1, 12-mm diameter; SPI Supplies) was freshly cleaved to 100-µm thickness and fixed on a cover slide (borosilicate no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1; 24 × 40 mm; Thomas Scientific) with UV glue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A drop of lipid mixture was placed on the mica glass; the mica glass was immediately placed on a swing bucket rotor and centrifuged for a minute at 5,000 × g and RT to spread the lipid film, followed by 20 min in a vacuum desiccator to ensure total evaporation of the chloroform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mica glass was then mounted on a cover slide using double-sided sticky tape, and SLB formation was initiated by injection of 200 µL of SLB working buffer and incubation for 20 min at 43 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 times wash with KMEH, HYE followed by F-actin, myosin and ATP regenerator were added sequentially (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experimental condition, samples were prepared individually, and the chambers were sealed with silicon grease to avoid any evaporation and placed on the microscope stage at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Formation_of_Actomyosin_Network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a typical experiment, 10 nM HYE was added to SLBs and incubated for 40 min followed by three washes with KMEH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this incubation time, F-actin was polymerized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlabeled G-actin was mixed with 10%mol Rhodamine, Atto-565 or Atto-633labeled G-actin, and 10%vol of 10× ME buffer (100 mM MgCl2, 20 mM EGTA, pH 7.2), and incubated for 2 min to replace G-actinbound Ca2+ ions with Mg2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, capping protein and polymerization buffer were added to induce F-actin polymerization in a test tube at a final G-actin concentration of 5 µM in KMEH supplemented with 2 mM ATP and 1 mg/mL BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20- to 30-min incubation, the desired amount of F-actin was transferred to SLBs using blunt-cut 200-µL pipette tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An incubation of 30 min allowed the F-actin layer to bind to the SLB at steady state; labeled or unlabeled myosin was added afterward and evolution of the actomyosin system was observed for 3090 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce remodeling of the actomyosin system, Mg-ATP (100 mM) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM or 20× ATP regenerating mix (10 mM Mg-ATP, 100 mM creatine phosphate, and 100 U/mL creatine kinase) to reach a 1× dilution (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regenerating mix worked at 37 °C at least for 20 min (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The open chamber design allowed the addition of each component (e.g., 1 µL of 100 mM ATP into 100 µL of buffer) from top without induction of flows that would perturb the actin network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental conditions for the presented experiments are depicted in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electron microscopy on myosin II filaments was performed following the protocol in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Acquisition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images were generally acquired using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse Ti equipped with a TIRF unit fed by a fiber coupled to an Agilent monolithic laser combiner MLC400 with the laser lines 405, 488, 561, and 653 nm (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were collected with a 100×, 1.49 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective either with an EMCCD camera (Evolve 512; Photometrics) yielding a pixel size of 154 nm or with a sCMOS camera (Zyla 5.5 sCMOS; Andor) yielding a pixel size of 65 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multicolor, time lapse, and stream acquisition was controlled and recorded using the software µManager (https://micro-manager.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measures of membrane particle diffusion, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on a Zeiss LSM 5 live (Zeiss) equipped with a FRAP unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microscope control and data collection were done via the LSM 5 software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, we performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) using the Confocor 2 module on a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were imaged at 488-nm laser line illumination and focused with a 40×, 1.2 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  water-immersion lens using the descanned detectors in the confocal scan head; the laser beam for FCS was parked at a specified z distance from the coverslips, based on high counts per molecules, indicating the position of the supported lipid bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FCS spot size was typically of 200-nm radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each measurement comprises fluorescence intensity time traces collected over six iterations of 10 s each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity data are autocorrelated using the on-board hardware correlator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autocorrelation amplitude versus time data were fitted using maximum entropy method (MEMFCS)-based algorithms (9) to obtain distributions of diffusion timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For phase-separating SLBs on mica, we used a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope in combination with a confocal spinning disk unit (Yokogawa CSU-22 scan head), and images were collected with an EMCCD camera (Andor Ixon + 897) using a 100×, 1.4 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oil or a 20×, 0.75 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  air objective (both Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For SIM, samples were fixed with 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde for 60 min (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and imaged on a home-built instant structured illumination microscope with a 100×, 1.45 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olympus TIRF oil objective and a pixel size of 55 nm that was set up by Hari Shroff and coworkers (73) at the Marine Biology Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we used a standard Leica TCS STED system in combination with a 100×, 1.4 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leica STED white oil objective, and recorded images of unfixed samples with a pixel size of 30 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basic image analysis, such as measurements of myosin II length and extraction of intensity profiles, was performed in ImageJ (imagej.nih.gov/ij/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actin length distribution was measured with the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ (www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All further analysis was performed with Matlab (MathWorks) as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
