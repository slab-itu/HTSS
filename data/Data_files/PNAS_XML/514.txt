Structural basis of influenza virus fusion inhibition by the antiviral drug Arbidol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza virus is an important human pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circulating strains of influenza virus are constantly mutating and are acquiring resistance to all approved drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, development of influenza therapeutics against novel targets is urgently required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hemagglutinin envelope glycoprotein (HA) is a promising target for small-molecule design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Arbidol is the only available antiviral drug that targets the HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of structural information on drugHA complexes has hindered further therapeutic development efforts against this viral pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report crystal structures of Arbidol in complex with influenza HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural information advances our understanding of how small molecules, such as Arbidol, can function as influenza fusion inhibitors and can be used for development of broad-spectrum, small-molecule therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The broad-spectrum antiviral drug Arbidol shows efficacy against influenza viruses by targeting the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the structural basis of the mechanism underlying fusion inhibition by Arbidol has remained obscure, thereby hindering its further development as a specific and optimized influenza therapeutic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined crystal structures of Arbidol in complex with influenza virus HA from pandemic 1968 H3N2 and recent 2013 H7N9 viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arbidol binds in a hydrophobic cavity in the HA trimer stem at the interface between two protomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cavity is distal to the conserved epitope targeted by broadly neutralizing stem antibodies and is 16 Å from the fusion peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arbidol primarily makes hydrophobic interactions with the binding site but also induces some conformational rearrangements to form a network of inter- and intraprotomer salt bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By functioning as molecular glue, Arbidol stabilizes the prefusion conformation of HA that inhibits the large conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion in the low pH of the endosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique binding mode compared with the small-molecule inhibitors of other class I fusion proteins enhances our understanding of how small molecules can function as fusion inhibitors and guides the development of broad-spectrum therapeutics against influenza virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Crystal_Structures_of_Arbidol_in_Complex_with_HAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the structural basis of fusion inhibition by Arbidol (Fig 2A and Fig S1), we determined the crystal structures of Arbidol in complex with HAs from pathogenic viruses H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7/SH2) and H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3/HK68) at 2.37-Å and 2.54-Å resolution, respectively (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24, Table 1, and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures were obtained by soaking apo crystals of H7/SH2 and H3/HK68 HAs with 2.5 mM Arbidol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies that used mass spectroscopy and in silico modeling predicted that Arbidol would bind in a cavity along the threefold symmetry axis of the HA trimer and interact with the fusion peptide (22, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the electron density maps clearly demonstrate that Arbidol binds further up the stem region, 16 Å from the fusion peptide, with three Arbidol sites per trimer (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arbidol-binding site is located at the interface between adjacent protomers of the HA trimer and is composed of A, C, and C -helices from HA2 (C refers to the adjacent protomer) and short C-terminal loops and an N-terminal -hairpin from HA1 (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protomer 1 contributes HA2 Arg54Glu57 from helix-A, Lys58Asn60 from loop-B, Trp92Glu103 from helix-C, and HA1 Pro293, Phe294, and Arg307 from the C-terminal loops (Note: HA1 residues are written in italics throughout, and HA2 residues are written in regular font).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protomer 2 contributes Glu90Ala101 from helix-C, K310 from a short loop close to the HA1 C terminus, and Leu29 from a -hairpin turn (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative positions of helices A, C, and C on HA are shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding site is disassembled in the postfusion form (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induced_Fit_in_the_ArbidolH7_SH2_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the apo structure of H7/SH2 HA [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 4LN6], the Arbidol-binding site contains four internal salt bridges formed by residues from adjacent protomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Glu90 carboxyl from helix-C is involved in a salt-bridge network with Arg307 (protomer 1) and Lys310 (protomer 2) from the short C-terminal loops of HA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the Glu103 carboxyl from helix-C interacts with Arg54 from helix-A (Fig 3A) within protomer 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the H7/SH2 HA apo conformation, Arbidol may experience some steric hindrance from Arg307 and Arg54 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, upon binding of Arbidol, large conformational changes in these charged residues are observed in the binding site, likely because of induced fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some existing salt bridges are broken, and new ones are formed (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg307 rotates by 90°, and Glu90 reorients to maintain the Glu90Arg307 interaction, whereas the Glu90Lys310 interaction is broken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the Glu103Arg54 interaction is disrupted as Arg54 reorients to become more solvent-exposed, opening up the cavity so Arbidol can bind; Glu57 and Glu97 reorient to form new salt bridges with Arg54 (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interactions of Arbidol with HA in the ArbidolH7/SH2 complex can be grouped into polar and nonpolar categories (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central part of the binding pocket is hydrophobic with polar charged resides framing the top and bottom of the cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the large number of nonpolar residues surrounding the binding cavity, Arbidol is positioned so that it does not form any direct H-bonds with binding-site residues, although water-mediated H-bonds with Glu90 and Lys310 are established (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformation of Glu97 is such that its aliphatic portion lines the binding site and packs across the face of the Arbidol thiophenyl ring (Fig 2D), and the charged end is oriented away from the ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arbidol thiophenol group occupies a cavity formed by hydrophobic residues Leu55, Leu99, Leu29, Leu98, and Ala101 (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C1 hydrogen (CH) from the aromatic ring of Tyr94 of helix-C and the methyl of the ethylacetate moiety of Arbidol make CH interactions with the indole ring of Arbidol and Phe294, respectively (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such unconventional H-bonds can contribute 1 Kcal/mol to the binding energy (2628).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the carbonyl of the ethylacetate moiety forms an intramolecular H-bond with the Arbidol dimethylamine group that constrains the Arbidol conformation so that the ethylacetate moiety is directed toward the hydrophobic patch containing Pro293 and Phe294 and stabilizes the CH interactions (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Accommodation_of_Arbidol_in_the_H3_HK68-Binding_Pocket  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Arbidol-binding pocket in apo H3/HK68 HA, the carboxyl groups of Asp90 and Glu97 are involved in salt-bridge interactions with Lys310 and Arg54, respectively (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike H7/SH2, these preexisting salt bridges do not pose a steric hindrance for binding Arbidol; therefore, they are maintained in the ArbidolH3/HK68 complex (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, upon Arbidol binding, a new salt bridge is formed between Glu57 and Arg54 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, compared with H7/SH2, H3/HK68 accommodates Arbidol without undergoing any major conformational changes in the binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shape_Complementarity_in_the_Arbidol-Binding_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arbidol has high shape complementarity with the binding sites in these two HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Arbidol thiophenyl and indole rings are buried inside the cavity, the polar substituents, hydroxyl and bromine groups on the indole ring, are partially exposed to solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall Arbidol buries 565580 Å2 of surface area on the HAs with high normalized shape complementarity of 0.730.80 (a value of 1 represents a perfect fit) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stabilization_of_the_Prefusion_Conformation_of_HA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acid-induced conformational changes in HA at low pH render HA susceptible to proteases and lead to the postfusion conformation (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assay the ability of Arbidol to prevent low pH-induced conformational changes in HA, we performed a trypsin-susceptibility assay (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the trypsin-susceptibility assay, group 1 H1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) HA is readily converted to its protease-susceptible postfusion form at low pH (5.0) but not at neutral pH (7.4) (Fig 5, lanes 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arbidol inhibits the conversion of PR8 HA to the postfusion conformation at low pH (5.0), thereby preventing its digestion by trypsin (Fig 5, lane 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with observations for the fusion-inhibiting stem-targeting antibody CR9114 Fab (Fig 5, lane 3) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mechanism_of_Arbidol-Binding_and_-Resistance_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through structure-based characterization of ArbidolHA complexes, we have shown that Arbidol binds in a hydrophobic cavity at the interface between two protomers within the HA trimer, with three identical binding sites being related by the threefold symmetry axis of the HA trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding site in group 2 HAs features an inner hydrophobic core and a solvent-exposed, highly charged periphery; residues in the binding site are contributed from -helices A and C in one protomer and from helix-C from a second protomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In H7/SH2, where steric clashes are likely to arise with the HA apo conformation, Arbidol appears to use an induced fit mechanism involving major and minor conformational changes in the binding pocket that results in the breaking of existing salt bridges and the formation of new ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the apo conformation of the binding pocket of H3/HK68 HA does not pose a steric hindrance to Arbidol, significant conformational changes or salt-bridge alterations are not observed during the formation of the ArbidolH3/HK68 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Arbidol interacts with two protomers in the trimer and establishes new interprotomer interactions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4), it can serve to clamp the protomers together, thereby stabilizing the trimer and rendering it resistant to the low pH-mediated conformational changes that occur during membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A prior study to investigate the mechanism of action of Arbidol using mass spectrometry and in silico docking had predicted a pocket close to the fusion peptide as the potential Arbidol-binding site (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, characterization of resistance to Arbidol in influenza virus identified four single point mutations, K51N, K117R, Q27N, and Q42H, in the HA2 subunit of H7N7 A/chicken/Germany/27 HA (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study also proposed a model for Arbidol docking in a cavity close to the fusion peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the resistance mutations did not map close to their predicted site, the authors refrained from deriving a mechanism of action for Arbidol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that these resistance mutations also do not map on the actual Arbidol-binding site identified here in H3/HK68 and H7/SH2 HAs; only the K51N mutation is in the relative vicinity of the Arbidol-binding site (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study that used fluorescence quenching and thermal stability assays suggested the proximity of W92 and R54 residues to the Arbidol-binding site (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these residues were earlier shown to be proximal to the binding site of another HA fusion inhibitor, tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (32, 33), the authors predicted that Arbidol may bind to a similar site (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, resistance mutations against TBHQ, which indeed binds to a portion of the Arbidol site (Fig S3) and demonstrates limited interactions with group 2 HAs, do not correlate with any direct interactions in the smaller TBHQ-binding pocket (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may result from the complexity of the structural rearrangements induced in the HA by low pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, additional studies on escape mutants, conducted in the light of the structures solved here, will be helpful in further understanding the mechanisms of Arbidol function and resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conformational_Flexibility_of_Arbidol_in_Group_2_HAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although influenza H7/SH2 and H3/HK68 HAs belong to the same phylogenetic group, i.e., group 2 HAs, Arbidol adopts slightly different conformations in the binding sites of the two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the Arbidol-binding sites in the apo structures of H7/SH2 (PDB ID code 4LN6) and H3/HK68 (PDB ID code 4FNK) HAs reveals two differences: E90D and R307K in helix-C of protomer 2 and 1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These seemingly conservative substitutions have a significant effect on the Arbidol interaction with the HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In apo H7/SH2 HA, Arg307 interacts with Glu90 and provides potential steric hindrance to Arbidol binding, whereas in the ArbidolH7/SH2 complex Arg307 flips by 90° so that its salt bridge with Glu90 is retained but Arbidol binding is not hindered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Arbidol were to adopt an identical binding mode in H3/HK68 HA, steric hindrance from Lys307 would be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Arbidol demonstrates conformational flexibility to accommodate the apo conformation of Lys307, whereas the thiophenol group binds identically to the two HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the indole ring exhibits a displacement of 1.6 Å and a dihedral angle shift of 17.4° between the two bound conformations (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, by displacing the indole ring, Arbidol engages Lys307 in an H-bond interaction (Fig 4D), whereas Arg307 does not make any direct contacts with Arbidol (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group-Specific_Binding_of_Arbidol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Arbidol has broad-spectrum activity against influenza viruses (1618, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the Arbidol-binding site in group 2 HAs against the corresponding region in group 1 HA [H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1/PR8; PDB ID code 1RU7)] reveals important structural differences between the two groups (Fig 7 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of the Arbidol-binding pocket of group 2 HAs, H7/SH2 and H3/HK68, is 8701,150 Å3, whereas the corresponding pocket in group 1 HAs is 10-fold smaller (90150 Å3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In group 1, the Arbidol-binding site is primarily blocked by an extra turn of the short -helix (HA2 residues 5760).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This helix is further stabilized by an interprotomer salt bridge between Lys58 and Glu97 that causes the side chains of these two residues also to occupy the binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In group 2 HAs, Lys58 is disordered, and Glu97 interacts with Arg54 and projects away from the Arbidol-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in group 1 HAs, the side chains of Met59 and Leu101 also project inwards to block the Arbidol pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding Thr59 and Ala101, respectively, in group 2 HAs have shorter side chains (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other residues that, although conserved in the two groups, obstruct the Arbidol pocket in group 1 HAs are Trp92, Tyr94, and Leu98; these residues interact with Arbidol in group 2 HAs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the structural analysis described here suggests either that large conformational rearrangements would have to occur in group 1 HAs in the site identified in group 2 HAs on Arbidol binding or that Arbidol occupies a distinct group-specific binding site in group 1 HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It similarly was noted that the binding site of TBHQ would be much more restricted in group 1 HAs than in group 2 HAs (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in a previous study on Arbidol derivatives, one of the more potent inhibitors exhibited higher affinity to group 2 than to group 1 influenza A viruses, but the increases in affinity were not reflected in antiviral effects (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distinct_Binding_Modes_of_Fusion_Inhibitors_in_Class_I_Fusion_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These ArbidolHA structures can be compared with the structures of complexes of small-molecule fusion inhibitors against other class I fusion glycoproteins, such as the RSV fusion protein (RSV F) and EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP) (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors of RSV F GP bind to a hydrophobic pocket around the threefold symmetry axis within the central cavity of the metastable prefusion structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pocket is adjacent to the fusion peptide and permits a stoichiometry of only one inhibitor per trimer of RSV F (Fig 8A) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EBOV GP, inhibitors bind with a stoichiometry of three ligands per trimer in a hydrophobic cavity between the attachment (GP1) and fusion (GP2) subunits at the base of the fusion peptide (Fig 8B) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike these inhibitors of other class I fusion proteins, Arbidol binds at a unique location, 16Å from the fusion peptide, with a stoichiometry of three ligands per HA trimer (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these class I fusion glycoproteins are related to each other in their fusion mechanism, their inhibitor-binding sites are in completely different locations relative to the threefold symmetry axis and to the fusion peptide and with respect to the vertical location on the stem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they are all bound in hydrophobic pockets surrounded by surface-exposed charged residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implication_of_the_Arbidol-Binding_Site_for_Therapeutic_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Arbidol-binding sites in H7/SH2 and H3/HK68 HAs reveal many interesting features that can be further explored to develop optimized influenza therapeutics by a structure-based design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, indole ring substituents may be modified to improve hydrophobic interactions and introduce additional polar interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thiophenol group is buried in a hydrophobic cavity containing an ordered water molecule, which mediates H-bonds between Glu103 and backbone carbonyls of Lys51 and Leu29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polar substituents at the meta position of the thiophenol ring could sustain the H-bond network by replacing the water molecule, thus allowing entropic gain (Fig 2D and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the indole ring substituents, the hydroxyl, dimethylamine, and ethylacetate groups, which are in the vicinity of Lys310, Glu90, Pro293, and Phe294, respectively (Fig 2D), can be modified to improve ArbidolHA interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water-mediated H-bond between the hydroxyl and Lys310 (Fig 3D) may be improved further with a bulkier polar substituent that can displace the water molecule to gain binding entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacing the dimethylamine with a more charged moiety may result in the formation of a salt bridge with Glu90.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrolysis-prone ethylacetate moiety may be replaced with a rigid hydrophobic group to improve molecular stability and gain nonpolar contacts with Pro293 and Phe294.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, such a substitution might improve the bioavailability profile of Arbidol and result in a smaller therapeutic dosage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall Arbidol represents a remarkable scaffold for further optimization to improve its specificity, efficacy, and applicability as a specific influenza drug for therapeutic use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structures of ArbidolHA complexes solved here identify a mechanism of influenza virus fusion inhibition by small molecules that is distinct from the HA-targeting antibodies and from other class I fusion protein inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arbidol occupies a discrete binding pocket similar to the pocket partially occupied by the much smaller, fragment-like molecule TBHQ and functions as a molecular glue to stabilize the HA trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By revealing the binding mode of Arbidol and its key interactions with HAs, these structures provide useful guidelines for structureactivity relationship studies to improve the efficacy of Arbidol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this work should accelerate the development of optimal inhibitors of the influenza virus fusion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression_and_Purification_of_HA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HA ectodomain was expressed using our baculovirus expression system as described previously (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, each HA was fused with a gp67 signal peptide at the N terminus and to a thrombin cleavage site, foldon trimerization domain, and His6-tag at the C terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressed HAs were purified using metal affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For crystallization studies, the HAs were digested with 5 mU trypsin (New England Biolabs) per milligram of HA for 16 h at 4 °C to produce uniformly cleaved HA1/HA2 subunits and to remove the trimerization domain and the His6-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The digested material was purified by gel filtration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystallization_and_Structure_Determination_of_Arbidol-H7_SH2_and_H3_HK68_HA_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gel filtration fractions containing the H7/SH2 and H3/HK68 HAs were concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallization screens were set up using sitting drop-vapor diffusion using previously reported crystallization conditions for both HAs: H7/SH2 [1720% (wt/vol) PEG3350, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, 20 °C] (38) and H3/HK68 (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, 200 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.5, 20 °C) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 37 d, diffraction-quality crystals were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting crystals were soaked with a final concentration of 2.5 mM Arbidol for 10 min, cryoprotected with 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and then flash-cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA CAT) 23ID-D beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory and at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 11-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffraction data were processed with HKL-2000 (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (40) with HA models from H7/SH2 (PDB ID code 4LN6) and H3/HK68 (PDB ID code 4FNK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refinement was carried out in Phenix (41), alternating with manual rebuilding and adjustment in COOT (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trypsin-Susceptibility_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the proteolysis experiment, 5 M PR8 H1 HA was preincubated separately with 400 M of Arbidol and 10 M CR9114 Fab for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control reactions were incubated with 2% (vol/vol) DMSO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH of each reaction was lowered using 1-M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One reaction was retained at pH 7.4 to assess digestion at neutral pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction solutions then were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, the reaction solutions were equilibrated at room temperature, and the pH was neutralized by the addition of 200 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trypsin-ultra (New England Biolabs, Inc.) was added to all samples at a final ratio of 1:50 by mass, and the samples were digested for 30 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation with trypsin, the reaction solutions were equilibrated at room temperature, quenched by the addition of nonreducing SDS buffer, and boiled for 2 min at 100 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were analyzed by 420% SDS/PAGE gel and imaged using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface areas buried on the HA upon binding of Arbidol were calculated with the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies (PISA) server at the European Bioinformatics Institute (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MacPyMOL (DeLano Scientific) was used to render structure figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final coordinates were validated using MolProbity (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arbidol-binding pocket volume was calculated using the CASTp program (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
