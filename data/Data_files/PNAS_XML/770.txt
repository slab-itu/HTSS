Nitric oxide is an obligate bacterial nitrification intermediate produced by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The enzymatic reactions that occur during nitrification are natures means to use ammonia as cellular fuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete understanding of nitrification and related processes are vital to sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing view of the first phase of nitrification is that ammonia oxidizing bacteria use two enzymes, ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, to oxidize ammonia to nitrite via hydroxylamine as an obligate intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work reveals nitric oxide as an additional obligate intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented findings necessitate revision of a key biogeochemical process, identify a new bioenergetic role for nitric oxide, predict participation of a third enzyme in the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, and will inform models toward sustainable agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ammonia (NH3)-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) emit substantial amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), both of which contribute to the harmful environmental side effects of large-scale agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The currently accepted model for AOB metabolism involves NH3 oxidation to nitrite (NO2) via a single obligate intermediate, hydroxylamine (NH2OH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this model, the multiheme enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of NH2OH to NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that HAO oxidizes NH2OH by only three electrons to NO under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO2 observed in HAO activity assays is a nonenzymatic product resulting from the oxidation of NO by O2 under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present study implies that aerobic NH3 oxidation by AOB occurs via two obligate intermediates, NH2OH and NO, necessitating a mediator of the third enzymatic step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two models for the obligate intermediates of NH3 oxidation to NO2 by AOB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HAO NH2OH oxidation products in each model are those proposed in previous literature (NH2OH obligate intermediate model) or this work (NH2OH/NO obligate intermediate model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid boxes surround obligate intermediates and products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Square brackets enclose proposed enzyme-bound intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathways in red are proposed nonenzymatic pathways leading to N2O, HNO, NO, NO3, and nonenzymatic NO2 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E is a proposed NO oxidoreductase necessary to oxidize NO to NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HAO_Does_Not_Produce_NO2_in_the_Absence_of_O2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To firmly establish conditions under which NO2 is produced by HAO, we repeated several previously reported HAO turnover experiments (15, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under aerobic turnover conditions, HAO oxidizes NH2OH to a mixture of NO2 and NO3 (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated 150 nM HAO with 5 µM phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and various concentrations of NH2OH at pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the time scale of the experiment, O2 rapidly oxidizes reduced PMS (k = 180 M1s1) (27) and therefore can be used in catalytic concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the NH2OH was consumed within 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NO2 concentration was determined via the Griess diazotization assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined NO2 and NO3 concentrations were determined by quantifying NO2 in parallel samples pretreated with NO3 reductase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed NO2 concentrations consistently accounted for 40% of the added NH2OH (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost all of the remaining NH2OH was accounted for as NO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Omitting PMS or HAO from the reaction mixture causes NH2OH oxidase activity to decrease substantially (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of HAO, less than 5% of the NH2OH is consumed over a prolonged 5-h incubation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, final NO2 and NO3 concentrations are negligible, which is consistent with the necessity of HAO for NH2OH oxidase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When PMS is omitted, only 15% of the NH2OH was consumed over 5 h, most of which was converted to NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This slower NH2OH consumption rate is consistent with the previously reported HAO activity with O2 as the sole oxidant (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under anaerobic conditions, neither NO2 nor NO3 are produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an anaerobic glovebox, 150 nM HAO was treated with 200 µM PMS and 100 µM NH2OH at pH 8.0 for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, NH2OH is completely consumed and negligible concentrations of NO2 or NO3 were observed (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1), which is consistent with previous reports (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of NO2 or NO3 indicated that their production is O2 dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The low stoichiometry of NO2 produced from NH2OH strongly suggests that NO2 is not the product of HAO activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, more NO3 is produced than NO2, which is inconsistent with the assignment of the latter species as the product of HAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed mixture of NO2 and NO3 formed during HAO oxidation of NH2OH under aerobic conditions is consistent with previous work (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low O2 concentration, the reaction mixture is more complex; Hooper and coworkers (17) showed that under these conditions, four products are observedNO2, NO3, N2O, and NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observed product mixtures could be the result of competing reactions of a common reactive species, which is the true HAO enzymatic product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of NO among the four products at low O2 concentration strongly suggests that NO is this reactive molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions of NO that produce N2O, NO2, or NO3 are well characterized; the latter two products require O2 for their formation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that HAO oxidizes NH2OH to NO and that NO2 is not a direct enzymatic product but is instead, a result of nonenzymatic oxidation of NO by O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, neither NO2 nor NO3 is observed as a product of NH2OH oxidation by HAO under anaerobic conditions (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the presence of O2, NO has a short lifetime and thus, would be difficult to detect as a product of HAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aqueous NO reacts with O2 to form NO2 (4k = 8 × 106 M2s1) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this reaction being second order with respect to NO, the half-life of aqueous NO is 5.656 s when the NO concentration is 10100 µM under air-saturated conditions (230 µM O2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O2 has been reported to react with reduced PMS to form superoxide (O2) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent reaction of O2 with NO to form NO3 is above the diffusion-controlled limit (k = 4.3 × 109 M1s1) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without O2, NO could still be difficult to detect; Pacheco and coworkers reported that NO reacts with reduced HAO (k = 1.5 × 1010 M2s1) (31); this could account for the N2O produced under anaerobic or low O2 conditions (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of these potential side reactions, we quantified NO produced during HAO turnover using NO sequestering or scavenging methods that kinetically outcompete these NO reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HAO_Stoichiometrically_Oxidizes_NH2OH_to_NO_Under_Anaerobic_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for NO as an HAO product, an NO sequestration system developed by Pacheco and coworkers was used (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, catalase rapidly binds NO (kon = 1.3 × 107 M1s1) (33) with concomitant appearance of defined UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption features (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalase exhibits a Soret band at 403 nm and poorly resolved absorbance features between 500 and 700 nm (SI Appendix, Fig S2A, solid black trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon treatment of catalase with NO, the Soret band shifts to 433 nm and two well-resolved features at 542 and 579 nm appear (SI Appendix, Fig S2A, black dashed trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO can be quantified from the change in absorption at 433 nm (A433) resulting from NO binding to catalase (433 = 47.9 mM1cm1) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples containing catalase and HAO in anaerobic turnover conditions exhibit features consistent with NO binding to catalase (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were prepared containing 150 nM HAO, 100 µM 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), 10 µM catalase, and 200 µM NH2OH at pH 8.0 under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV-vis absorption spectra collected after incubating these samples for 5 min exhibited a decrease in intensity of the catalase 403 nm Soret band and appearance of absorption features consistent with NO binding to catalase (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These absorption features are absent when HAO is excluded from the reaction mixture (SI Appendix, Fig S2B), indicating that NO production is HAO dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that NO is at least one product of NH2OH oxidation by HAO under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the amount of NO released under anaerobic conditions, similar sample conditions were used and the NH2OH concentration was varied with excess catalase present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions were monitored at 433 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of NH2OH initiated an increase in the 433 nm absorbance (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absorbance increase was not observed in the absence of HAO (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using A433 to quantify the amount of NO released, we found that 88100% of the NH2OH was converted to NO (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parallel reactions were performed in the absence of catalase to determine the oxidant stoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor and quantify the reduction of DCPIP or horse heart cyt c at 605 (605 = 20.3 mM1cm1) or 550 nm (550 = 19.6 mM1cm1), respectively (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At several NH2OH concentrations, 1.51.7 mol DCPIP or 2.83.0 mol cyt c were reduced per 1 mol NH2OH (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data are consistent with the quantitative three-electron oxidation of NH2OH to NO by HAO under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HAO_Oxidizes_NH2OH_to_NO_Under_Aerobic_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under the canonical model of HAO activity (Fig 1, NH2OH obligate intermediate model), HAO requires O2 to complete the oxidation of NH2OH to NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observed quantitative oxidation of NH2OH to NO could result from the lack of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that NO remains the product of HAO catalysis in the presence of O2, we used ferrous-O2 hemoglobin (oxyHb) to simultaneously scavenge and quantify NO under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, NO reacts with oxyHb to form ferric-hemoglobin (metHb) and NO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxyHb to metHb conversion can be monitored from the resulting UV-vis absorption increase at 421 nm and concomitant decrease at 401 nm (A421 and A401, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in A421 and A401 provides the concentration of oxyHb converted to metHb (421401 = 77.3 mM1cm1) (34) and indirectly, the concentration of NO released during HAO turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of this assay showed that HAO produced NO under aerobic turnover conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were prepared containing 150 nM HAO, 20 µM oxyHb, 25 µM DCPIP, and varying NH2OH concentrations at pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of HAO, the absorption at 401 nm decreased over 30 s with a concomitant increase in absorption at 421 nm (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These absorption changes were not observed in the absence of HAO, once again indicating that NO production is HAO dependent (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A421401 for samples containing HAO was consistent with the production of 2.4 and 2.9 µM NO when the reaction was initiated with either 3 or 4 µM NH2OH, respectively (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each of these concentrations, NO accounted for 75% of the NH2OH added to the reaction mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the full complement of NO was not detected, the oxidant stoichiometry with respect to NH2OH was consistent with its full conversion to NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples without oxyHb were prepared containing 150 nM HAO, 20 µM cyt c, and 3.4 µM NH2OH at pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By monitoring cyt c as described above, we found that 2.91 (0.05) mol cyt c were reduced per 1 mol NH2OH (Table 1); this is consistent with the three-electron oxidation of NH2OH to NO and suggests that conversion to NO is quantitative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result in turn suggests that the NH2OH is completely converted to NO but not all of it reacts with oxyHb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fraction of the NO could react with O2 to form NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the expected NO2 concentrations for these experiments were beneath the limit of detection of the Griess assay (less_than1 µM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NO2 formation was observed under similar conditions at higher NH2OH concentrations (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined data provide evidence that HAO-driven NH2OH oxidation terminates at NO even under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO2_Is_a_Nonenzymatic_Product_of_NO_Oxidation_by_O2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results thus far suggest that NO, not NO2, is the product of enzymatic NH2OH oxidation by HAO, implying that NO2 results from the nonenzymatic reaction of the NO with O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this model, the NO2 concentration should decrease in the presence of an NO scavenger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we reacted 150 nM HAO with 5 µM PMS at various NH2OH concentrations under aerobic conditions in the absence or presence of the NO scavenger oxyHb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples containing oxyHb showed a 6675% decrease in NO2 formation (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loss of NO2 is consistent with our hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining NO2 in the presence of oxyHb suggests that some NO reacts with O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This competition between the NO reactions with oxyHb and O2 also likely accounts for the lower-than-expected conversion of oxyHb to metHb discussed above (Fig 3B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO_Is_an_Obligate_Ammonia_Oxidation_Intermediate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NO production by HAO has been previously observed in the absence of O2 but was attributed to incomplete NH2OH oxidation when oxidant or O2 concentrations were insufficient (17, 18, 31, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed above, the detection of NO as the HAO product was likely obscured by several rapid, nonenzymatic NO reaction pathways, especially when O2 was present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work quantified the NO produced under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions and demonstrates that NO2 is not an enzymatic product of HAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The revised N. europaea HAO product is consistent with that of the K. stuttgartiensis kustc1061 protein that Kartal and coworkers (20) purified and characterized; in their paper, the authors proposed that a tyrosine above the active site pocket (Y358) present in N. europaea HAO but absent in K. stuttgartiensis kustc1061 facilitates the {FeNO}6 reaction with H2O to form NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results indicate that the N. europaea HAO and kustc1061 NH2OH oxidation products are identical and, therefore, Y358 does not promote NO2 formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We briefly note that in this same paper, the authors reported that N. europaea HAO oxidized NH2OH by four electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no evidence was presented demonstrating NO2 production or the absence of NO formation by N. europaea HAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude based on our results that the NH2OH oxidation products of N. europaea HAO and K. stuttgartiensis kustc1061 enzymes are both NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consolidation of the activities of these proteins suggests a similar physiological function of heme P460-containing octaheme proteins in aerobic and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oxidation of NH2OH to NO instead of NO2 implies that AOB require three steps to oxidize NH3 to NO2, with both NH2OH and NO acting as obligate intermediates (Fig 1, NH2OH/NO obligate intermediate model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility accounting for the total conversion of NH3 to NO2 in aerobic cell culture is that NO is the terminal product of the enzymatic NH3 oxidation pathway, and free NO is nonenzymatically oxidized to NO2 by O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results confirm those of previous studies showing that NO3 is a significant by-product of in vitro NH2OH oxidation by HAO and appears only under aerobic conditions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome suggests that, much like NO2, NO3 results from a side reaction of NO under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is no evidence for a NO3 reductase in the genome of N. europaea (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lack of observed NO3 formation by intact AOB (18) suggests that the NH3 oxidation pathway requires an unidentified component that rapidly transforms NO to NO2 to outcompete side reactions that produce NO3 or N2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an agent would also avoid nonenzymatic oxidation of NO to NO2, thereby permitting the full complement of four electrons to be removed from NH2OH for entry into cellular electron transport chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility for this third step is the Cu NO2 reductase NirK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NirK generally functions to reduce NO2 to NO in denitrification or nitrifier denitrification pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NirK deletion variants of N. europaea show no disruption in N2O production under anaerobic conditions, which suggests that NirK is unnecessary for nitrifier denitrification in these organisms (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these variant strains exhibit considerably decreased NO2 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these observations, we hypothesize that NirK catalyzes the oxidation of NO produced by HAO to form NO2, for which there is precedent in the literature (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined, emergent picture strongly implicates a three-step oxidation of NH3 oxidation to NO2 by AOB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whether enzymatic NH2OH oxidation terminates at NO or proceeds via a third enzymatic step to NO2, energy transduction remains productive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the currently accepted model, hydroxylation of NH3 to NH2OH requires two electrons for turnover of AMO (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reducing equivalents are believed to be furnished from the pool of electrons liberated from NH2OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Termination of enzymatic NH2OH oxidation at NO liberates three electrons; after cycling AMO, one net electron remains for cellular respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we note termination at NO yields more free energy per mol N, assuming cellular respiration involving O2 as a terminal electron acceptor (40):2NH2OH+32O22NO+3H2O;G°=117.4kcalmol N[3]NH2OH+O2NO2+H2O+H+;G°=70kcalmol N[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of HAO as an NO source may provide insights into the environmental impacts of AOB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2O emissions from AOB are largely attributed to nitrifier denitrification (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this pathway activates under anaerobic conditions, and AOB have been shown to emit N2O under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we have recently identified a source of N2O originating from NH2OH (21), N2O is usually the result of NO reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results identify HAO as a major source of NO under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that N2O production under aerobic conditions arises when the rate of NO production outcompetes the rate of its oxidation to NO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would result in higher intracellular NO concentrations that lead to NO emission or its conversion to N2O by the respiratory nitric oxide reductase, NorBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, NO could be scavenged by cyt P460 or cyt c554 to form N2O (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decrease in the rate of NO oxidation to NO2 might be expected at low O2 concentrations, and this may help explain the observed increase in N2O emissions at low O2 or during oxic to anoxic transitions (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presently afforded revision of HAOs activity should facilitate understanding of the sources and rates of NO and N2O emissions from ammonia oxidizing bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

General_Considerations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified N. europaea HAO was a generous gift from Prof. Sean Elliott, Boston University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Milli-Q water (18.2 M; Millipore) was used in the preparation of all buffers and solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OHHCl) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalase and ferrous hemoglobin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other chemicals were purchased from VWR International and used as obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV-vis absorption measurements were performed using a Flame spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics) or a Cary 60 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO2 was quantified using the Griess diazotization assay (Cayman Chemical) and measuring the resulting absorbance at 542 nm (542 = 50 mM1cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined NO2 and NO3 concentrations were determined by treating samples with nitrate reductase and cofactor solution (Cayman Chemical) at room temperature for 1 h followed by NO2 quantitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DCPIP (605 = 20.3 mM1cm1), oxyHb (415 = 131 mM1cm1) (34), catalase (403 = 120 mM1cm1) (32, 34), cyt c (550 = 28.0 mM1cm1), and phenazine methosulfate (PMS; 388 = 26.3 mM1cm1) (43) were quantified by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NH2OH stocks were quantified by the method of Frear and Burrell (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO was generated from disodium 1-(hydroxyl-NNO-azoxy)-l-proline (PROLI-NONOate; Cayman Chemical) where the NO was quantified by FeIIEDTA as previously reported (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stoichiometry_of_NO2_and_NO3_by_HAO_Under_Various_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Solutions used for NO2 and NO3 determination under aerobic HAO conditions contained 150 nM HAO and 5 µM PMS in 1 mL of air-saturated 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was initiated by addition of an appropriate volume of an NH2OH stock solution in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For samples treated with oxyHb, the conditions were identical except that the samples were incubated in the presence of 30 µM oxyHb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anaerobic samples were prepared in an MBraun glovebox maintained under an N2 atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditions after mixing were 150 nM HAO, 100 µM NH2OH, and 200 µM PMS in 1 mL of degassed 250 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was initiated by addition of an appropriate volume of an NH2OH stock solution in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then analyzed for NO2 and NO3 as described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

NO production under anaerobic conditions was monitored by using a catalase NO-binding assay previously described by Pacheco and coworkers (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the stoichiometry of NH2OH oxidation to NO, anaerobic solutions containing 150 nM HAO, 8 µM catalase, and 25 µM DCPIP in 1 mL of degassed 250 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, were prepared in an anaerobic glovebox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reactions were performed at room temperature and initiated by addition of an appropriate volume of an anaerobic stock of NH2OH dissolved in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions were monitored at 433 nm by a UV-vis absorption spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of NO generated was determined from the change in absorption at 433 nm and using the extinction coefficient of 433 = 47.9 mM1cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stoichiometry of NH2OH to reduced DCPIP was monitored in parallel reactions under identical reaction conditions except that catalase was omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of DCPIP reduced was determined from the change in absorption at 605 nm and using the extinction coefficient 605 = 20.3 mM1cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the stoichiometry of NH2OH to cyt c reduction, the reactions conditions were similar to the DCPIP reaction, except the DCPIP was replaced with 20 µM cyt c. The reaction was monitored at 550 nm and the concentration of cyt c reduced determined using the extinction coefficient, 550 = 19.6 mM1cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To determine the stoichiometry of NH2OH oxidation to NO, solutions were prepared containing 150 nM HAO, 20 µM oxyHb and 25 µM DCPIP in 1 mL of air-saturated 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were initiated by addition of an appropriate volume of a NH2OH stock solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions were simultaneously monitored at 401 and 421 nm by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of NO generated was determined via the change in absorption at 421 nm minus the change in absorbance at 401 nm and using the extinction coefficient of 421401 = 77.3 mM1cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stoichiometry of NH2OH to cyt c reduction was performed under identical reaction conditions except the oxyHb was omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyt c reduction was quantified as described above for the anaerobic experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
