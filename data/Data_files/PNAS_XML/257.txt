Genetic background and epigenetic modifications in the core of the nucleus accumbens predict addiction-like behavior in a rat model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Determining the factors that render an individual more susceptible or resilient to cocaine addiction has great implications for treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploit a unique model to demonstrate that genetic differences in vulnerability to cocaine addiction exist in the rat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined gene expression and the epigenetic regulation of two genesfibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2)in the nucleus accumbens core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low levels of D2 mRNA, via epigenetic modifications, may play a role in susceptibility to cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, binding of a repressive mark on histones (H3K9me3) at the D2 promoter is associated with the propensity to relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, low levels of FGF2, which persist even following prolonged self-administration, may protect individuals from cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides a demonstration in the rat of a clear genetic difference in the propensity for addiction-related behaviors following prolonged cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It relies on the use of selectively bred high-responder (bHR) and low-responder (bLR) rat lines that differ in several characteristics associated with temperament, including novelty-induced locomotion and impulsivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that bHR rats exhibit behaviors reminiscent of human addiction, including persistent cocaine-seeking and increased reinstatement of cocaine seeking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To uncover potential underlying mechanisms of this differential vulnerability, we focused on the core of the nucleus accumbens and examined expression and epigenetic regulation of two transcripts previously implicated in bHR/bLR differences: fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to bHRs, bLRs had lower FGF2 mRNA levels and increased association of a repressive mark on histones (H3K9me3) at the FGF2 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences were apparent under basal conditions and persisted even following prolonged cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, bHRs had lower D2 mRNA under basal conditions, with greater association of H3K9me3 at the D2 promoter and these differences were no longer apparent following prolonged cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlational analyses indicate that the association of H3K9me3 at D2 may be a critical substrate underlying the propensity to relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that low D2 mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens core, likely mediated via epigenetic modifications, may render individuals more susceptible to cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, low FGF2 levels, which appear immutable even following prolonged cocaine exposure, may serve as a protective factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental timeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of bHR and bLR rats from the F24 generation was killed at baseline, around postnatal day (PND) 70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other rats from the F24 and F26 generations underwent prolonged cocaine self-administration consisting of an acquisition phase (days 120) and a maintenance phase (days 2060).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats from the F24 generation were tested for the effects of cue removal (day 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats from the F26 generation were tested for drug-induced reinstatement test (day 70), followed by 1 mo of abstinence and then a cue-induced reinstatement test (day 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were collected 1 wk later, when rats were 170 d of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asterisk indicates the last day of cocaine exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acquisition_of_Self-Administration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Self-administration training was conducted in a manner that allowed us to control for the amount of drug intake and the number of drugcue pairings (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imposing an infusion criterion during training also allowed us to minimize the potential impact of differences in locomotor activity on the acquisition of drug-taking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although more bLRs than bHRs failed to meet infusion criterion, there were no significant differences in the ability to learn to self-administer cocaine as measured by responses in the active and inactive nose-ports (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, both phenotypes learned to distinguish between the nose-ports [Effect of Port, F(1, 78) = 363.2, P less_than 0.0001] and both increased responding appropriately in the active port with increasing infusion criterion [Effect of Infusion Criterion, F(3, 78) = 21.1, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as expected, pokes into the inactive port decreased or remained stable [Port × Infusion Criterion, F(3, 78) = 199.4, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there was a significant difference in responding at the active vs. inactive port at infusion criterion 10, 20, and 45 (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the fact that all rats were self-administering the same amount of drug, there were phenotypic differences in the rate at which they self-administered during the initial phases of training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant Effect of Phenotype [F(1, 28) = 13.4, P = 0.001], an Effect of Infusion Criterion [F(3, 38) = 23.3, P less_than 0.0001], and a significant Phenotype × Infusion Criterion interaction [F(3, 38) = 4.9, P = 0.006] (Fig 2B) for interinfusion interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to bLRs, bHRs took the drug more rapidly during the initial phases of training, at infusion criteria 5 (P = 0.004) and 10 (P = 0.006).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after 1 wk of training (i.e., once the rats moved up to infusion criterion 20), there were no significant differences in the rate of intake (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the self-administration testing, a bHR was only removed from the testing chamber once a bLR had completed its session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the amount of time in the testing chamber was controlled for, as was the amount of cocaine intake and number of drugcue pairings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cue_Removal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of the discrete cocaine-associated cue to control drug-taking behavior was assessed after 30 self-administration sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the light in the active port that typically accompanied cocaine delivery was no longer illuminated (Fig 3B), bHRs took half the number of cocaine infusions per minute, whereas bLRs maintained their baseline number of infusions [t(15) = 3.8, P = 0.002] (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, the mean interinfusion interval doubled for bHRs when the cue light was removed [t(15) = 2.5, P = 0.02] (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the discrete cue light associated with cocaine infusions had greater control over behavior for bHRs compared with bLRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Persistence_of_Drug-Seeking_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine differences in the persistence of cocaine seeking, we assessed the number of nose pokes in the active ports during the drug not available period (25), when the house light was turned off (Fig 4B), and during the drug available period, when the house light was turned on (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior was examined across 40 self-administration sessions (after the initial training period of 20 sessions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following prolonged cocaine self-administration, bHRs showed enhanced cocaine-seeking behavior during the drug not available periods relative to bLRs (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these bHR/bLR differences were apparent only during the latter, and not the early, phases of cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, bHRs begin to seek the drug when it is no longer available only after 40 sessions [Phase × Phenotype interaction, F(1, 25) = 4.6, P = 0.04; bHR vs. bLR at Late phase, P = 0.03] (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences between phenotypes during the Late phase are driven by the tendency for bHRs to increase their drug-seeking behavior during the drug not available period over time (Early vs. Late phase, P = 0.09).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences between phenotypes and no significant interactions for responding during the drug available phase (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with prolonged drug experience, bHRs, but not bLRs, develop a tendency to seek drug when it is no longer available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cocaine_Priming-Induced_Reinstatement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following varying periods of abstinence (39, 40) and extinction, priming injections of cocaine or re-exposure to a cocaine-paired cue can reinstate drug-seeking behavior, as measured by responses on the manipulandum (e.g., nose-port) that previously resulted in cocaine delivery (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reinstatement model is commonly used in rodents to study relapse (for review, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 and 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One week after the prolonged cocaine self-administration experience, bHR and bLR rats were exposed to 11 extinction sessions conducted over 3 d, and then tested for cocaine priming-induced reinstatement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last two extinction sessions occurred on the test day, immediately preceding the reinstatement test session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there were differences in behavior during extinction (Fig 5A; Effect of Phenotype [F(1, 14) = 23.9, P less_than 0.001], Port [F(1, 294) = 76.5, P less_than 0.001], Session [F(10, 294) = 19.9, P less_than 0.001, all interactions, P less_than 0.05]) these differences could be because of inherent differences in locomotor activity in the bred lines, rather than the rate of extinction per se (see SI Results for additional details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the significantly greater levels of responding upon initial placement in the testing chambers makes it difficult to determine if bHRs are slower to extinguish, as might be expected in an addiction-prone phenotype; or faster, because of the drastic decrease in responding across subsequent sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following extinction, cocaine priming-induced reinstatement was assessed using a within-session ascending doseresponse procedure (similar to refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40 and 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a mixed linear-regression model was used to analyze responses in both nose-ports across cocaine doses (Fig 5C), there was not a significant effect of Phenotype, and no significant interactions, but there was a significant Effect of Port [F(1, 120) = 5.7, P = 0.02].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the number of pokes into each port was analyzed separately, there was a significant effect of Dose for responses in the active port [F(1, 3) = 7.2, P = 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the inactive port, there was a significant effect of Dose [F(3, 14) = 5.4, P = 0.01] and a significant Phenotype × Dose interaction [F(3, 14) = 5.7, P = 0.02].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, additional analyses to account for phenotypic differences in responding in the inactive port were warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently analyzed the number of pokes in the active port relative to those in the inactive port, and these data were square root-transformed to achieve homogeneity of variance across doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the square root-transformed ratio of responding in the active/inactive port as the dependent variable, bHRs exhibited an increase in responding relative to bLRs (Fig 5D) [Effect of Phenotype, F(1, 12) = 7.3, P = 0.02], with an overall Effect of Dose [F(2, 35) = 4.3, P = 0.02], but no significant Phenotype × Dose interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both phenotypes altered responding as a function of dose, but the difference between phenotypes was similar across doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when an alternative statistical approach was used in which the levels of responding in the inactive port were considered as a covariate, similar results emerged (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, when these data are analyzed in a manner that accounts for differences in responding at the inactive port, which may be reflective of inherent or cocaine-induced differences in activity levels (19), we find that bHRs appear to be more susceptible to drug-induced reinstatement relative to bLRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cue-Induced_Reinstatement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After 1 mo of abstinence following the cocaine priming-induced reinstatement test, rats were exposed to 13 extinction sessions conducted over the course of 4 d (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last three extinction sessions occurred on the test day, immediately preceding the reinstatement test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As above, there were significant differences in behavior during extinction (SI Results), but it is difficult to determine if these differences can be attributed to the rate of extinction per se, or inherent differences in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the cue-induced reinstatement test, responses in the active nose-port resulted in the presentation of the discrete cue light previously associated with cocaine delivery (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, bHRs respond much more vigorously for presentation of the cue light relative to bLRs: Effect of Phenotype [F(1, 28) = 9.4, P = 0.005]; Effect of Port [F(1, 28) = 18.3, P = 0.0002]; Phenotype × Port interaction, F(1, 28) = 6.4, P = 0.017] (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both phenotypes distinguish between the active and inactive ports (P less_than 0.01 for both); yet, there is a significant difference between bHRs and bLRs only for responses at the active port (P = 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that bHRs are more susceptible than bLRs to cue-induced reinstatement, and provide further evidence that the discrete cocaine-associated cue-light attains greater motivational value for bHRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Principal_Components_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the behavioral outcomes described above could be reduced to fewer dimensions that might account for individual differences in addiction liability, principal components analysis was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When bHRs and bLRs are combined into a single population, the behavioral variables can be reduced to two factors that, together, account for 70% of the variance (Fig 6 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor 1, which accounts for 48% of the overall variance, has strong loadings ( greater than 0.7) from four behavioral variables: locomotor response to novelty, acquisition, persistence of drug-seeking behavior, and drug-induced reinstatement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in these bred lines this constellation of traits appear to be related and, when exhibited together, may contribute to addiction liability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor 2, which is orthogonal to Factor 1 and accounts for 22% of the total variance, is comprised largely of a single variable: cue-induced reinstatement (loading = 0.89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cue-induced reinstatement may therefore represent a distinct behavioral variable that captures a separate dimension of addiction liability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When principal components analysis was conducted for each of the phenotypes separately, a different picture emerged, with some constructs similarly correlated within each phenotype, and others, such as the persistence of drug-seeking behavior, phenotype-dependent (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Addiction_Score__Selection_of_Brain_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the neurobiological consequences of addiction-like behavior, brains were analyzed from six bLR rats and six bHR rats that were identified as the least or most addiction-prone, respectively, based on a calculated Addiction Score (SI Materials and Methods and SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FGF2_in_the_Nucleus_Accumbens_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with our previous findings (34, 35), FGF2 mRNA levels in the core of the nucleus accumbens were higher in bHRs relative to bLRs under basal conditions [t(9) = 5.77, P = 0.0003], and these differences were also apparent following prolonged cocaine self-administration [t(9) = 2.42, P = 0.038] (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, relative to bLRs, bHRs had lower levels of association of the repressive mark H3K9me3 at the FGF2 promoter under basal conditions [t(9) = 15.63, P less_than 0.0001] and following prolonged cocaine exposure [t(9) = 9.97, P less_than 0.0001] (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither FGF2 mRNA levels nor the association of H3K9me3 at FGF2 correlated significantly with any of the addiction-like behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the differences in FGF2 gene expression and its association with H3K9me3 represent a stable trait of the bHR and bLR phenotypes, which does not appear to account for the differences in addictive behavior per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, in view of the fact that early life FGF2 administration promotes self-administration (33), we suggest that the low levels of FGF2 expression serve as a protective factor, enhancing resiliency to cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dopamine_D2_Receptor_in_the_Nucleus_Accumbens_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In agreement with our previous findings (19, 35), dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in the core of the nucleus accumbens was lower in bHRs relative to bLRs under basal conditions [t(9) = 3.55, P = 0.006] (Fig 7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following prolonged cocaine self-administration, however, these significant differences were no longer observed (Fig 7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association of H3K9me3 at the D2 promoter was consistent with the gene-expression findings, showing greater association of this repressive mark in bHRs relative to bLRs under basal conditions [t(9) = 10.31, P less_than 0.0001], and no significant differences following cocaine self-administration (Fig 7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there was a significant positive correlation between the binding ratio of H3K9me3 at D2 and the propensity for cue-induced reinstatement, as measured by the ratio of pokes in the active vs. inactive ports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation is significant when the phenotypes are combined into a single population (R2 = 0.65, P = 0.001) (Fig 8), when they are analyzed separately in bHRs (R2 = 0.79, P = 0.02) and bLRs (R2 = 0.70, P = 0.04) (Fig S3), and when the two apparent bHR outliers are removed from the combined dataset (R2 = 0.44, P = 0.04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses suggest that the greater the coupling of the histone H3K9me3 at the D2 promoter, the more likely one is to exhibit cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior after extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selectively_Bred_Rats_(bHR_and_bLR)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
bHR and bLR male rats from the 24th (bHR, n = 11; bLR, n = 11) and 26th (bHR, n = 19; bLR, n = 18) generations of our in-house breeding colony (74) were used for these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rats are bred based on locomotor response to an inescapable novel environment, as previously described (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The founding population of these lines was comprised of SpragueDawley rats purchased from three different breeding colonies at Charles River Laboratories and a number of measures were taken to maximize initial genetic variation and to minimize inbreeding in these lines (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males and females that fall within the top and bottom 20% of locomotor scores are selected for breeding, allowing us to predict with almost 100% certainty that bLR offspring will be generated from a bLR/bLR breeding pair and bHR offspring from a bHR/bHR breeding pair (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, before the start of these studies, around 55 d of age, the bHR/bLR phenotype was confirmed by testing rats for locomotor response to a novel environment, as previously described (17, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were housed in pairs of the same phenotype and kept on a 12-hlight/12-hdark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prolonged_Self-Administration_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Self-administration training began around 80 d of age, following recovery from surgery (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the duration of the self-administration studies, rats were singly housed and a controlled feeding procedure was implemented such that 25 g of chow was provided after each self-administration session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feeding procedure allowed rats to maintain bodyweight throughout the prolonged self-administration studies and prevented loss of catheter patency because of excessive growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The controlled feeding schedule also helped ensure that the rats were motivated to self-administer cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Addiction_Score__Selection_of_Brain_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Addiction Score was calculated based on the sum of the following measures: (i) Inverse Acquisition Score = (1/average intertrial interval at infusion criteria 5 and 10); Persistence of Drug Seeking = [(average of pokes in active port during drug not available/pokes in active port during drug available for sessions 3540 of maintenance phase) × 100]; Drug-induced reinstatement = [(average [pokes in active port/pokes in inactive port in response to 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg cocaine]/(pokes in active port/pokes in inactive port in response to vehicle)]; Cue-induced reinstatement = (average pokes in active port/pokes in inactive port).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, higher values represented rats with the most pronounced drug-taking and drug-seeking behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brain_Tissue_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rats from the 26th generation that underwent the prolonged self-administration procedures were killed 1 wk following the cue-induced reinstatement test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 1 mo elapsed between the last drug experience (i.e., cocaine priming-induced reinstatement) and the time of tissue collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After self-administration, tissue was collected and analyzed from the six rats per phenotype, chosen based on their Addiction Score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the time of killing, brains were removed, rapidly frozen in isopentane and then stored at 80 °C until further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were cut on a cryostat into 10-µm-thick coronal sections and mounted onto slides in a serial manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serial method we used resulted in multiple sets of slides with adjacent sections that could be used for cresyl-staining, LCM, and in situ hybridization, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain sections were obtained throughout the rostral-caudal gradient of the brain, but the focus of the current studies was on the nucleus accumbens core (between bregma 1.7 and 1.0 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following LCM, the extracted tissue for each rat was pooled and suspended in 500 µL of nuclear lysis buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear extract was quantified using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation and an equal amount of nuclear extract was added for the ChIP assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The putative promoter regions were identified from the National Center for Botechnology Information gene bank and the primers were selected using software from Thermo Fisher Scientific (tools.thermofisher.com/content.cfm?pageid=9716).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FGF2 and D2, the promoter sequences were obtained from GenBank ID-U78079.1 and GenBank ID-U79717.1 and the primers directed to the gene promoters listed in Table S2 (which were further BLAST with the promoter sequence) were used for amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PCR, Taq MeanGreen Master Mix (Syzygy Biotech) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the thermal cycler reaction, the mix was first subjected to 94 °C for 3 min, followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s Annealing was done at 58 °C for 40 s and extension at 72 °C for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycles were repeated 34 times for FGF2 and 31 times for D2, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amplified products were mixed with loading dye and run in 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gels were imaged with the Spectroline UV Transilluminator 2.5 Amp, Model UC-312R attached to a camera (Kodak DC 290: Kodak Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System 120), and the software used to capture the image before analysis was Kodak 1D Limited Edition v3.6.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total DNA (input) and immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health Image software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the binding ratio of H3K9me3 normalized to input for each target of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Hybridization_Histochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The D2 receptor probe was a 495-bp fragment directed against the rat D2 mRNA, and the FGF2 probe was a 278-bp fragment directed against rat FGF mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of the hybridization signal was previously confirmed by control experiments using sense probes (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each probe was diluted in hybridization buffer, and brain sections were coverslipped and incubated overnight at 55 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were rinsed and dehydrated and sections were exposed to film for 7 d for detection of D2 mRNA and for 13 wk for FGF2 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autoradiograms were captured and digitized using Microtek ScanMaker 1000XL and the scanner was driven by Lasersoft Imaging (SilverFast) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A macro (Serge Campeau, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) was integrated into the ImageJ software, which enabled signal above background to be automatically determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative IOD of these signal pixels was obtained by multiplying the size of the area quantified by the signal intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal for each probe was quantified in the core of the nucleus accumbens (between Bregma levels 1.7 and 1.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical density measurements were taken from the left and right sides of at least two brain sections per animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mean IOD value was then generated for each region of interest to yield one data point per animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent t tests were used to examine phenotypic differences for D2 and FGF mRNA at baseline and following prolonged self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative approach for accounting for differences in responding in the inactive port during the cocaine priming-induced reinstatement test, we ran an ANCOVA using SPSS (v22) that incorporated the number of pokes into the inactive port as a continuous covariate, with pokes into the active port as the dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error terms within a rat were allowed to have a general (unstructured) covariance structure, with different error variances for different doses and general covariances of the repeated measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of negative covariances between some of the errors precluded the use of mixed-effects (or multilevel) models with random rat effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cue-Induced_Reinstatement__Extinction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the total number of responses across all extinction sessions was examined, there was a significant effect of Phenotype [F(1, 28) = 17.2, P = 0.0003] and Port [F(1, 28) = 6.2, P = 0.02], but no significant interaction, as the differences in responding between the phenotypes was similar for both the active and inactive ports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When responding was considered with Session as the repeated variable there was a significant effect of Phenotype [F(1, 14) = 19.2, P = 0.001], Port [F(1, 350) = 12.1, P = 0.001], and Session [F(12, 350) = 5.1, P less_than 0.001], and a significant Phenotype × Session interaction [F(12, 350) = 5.1, P = 0.002] for nose pokes during the extinction sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted pairwise comparisons based on the patterns of responding we saw during the previous extinction sessions and, as shown in Fig 5B, the significant differences in responding in the active port were again restricted to the first session on each day of testing (i.e., session 1, P less_than 0.001; session 4, P = 0.007; session 8, P = 0.03) with no significant differences after session 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant differences in responding in the inactive port were only apparent on session 1 (P = 0.02) and session 6 (P less_than 0.001), with the latter being because of a single rat exhibiting aberrant behavior that session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to above, we do not believe these data support differences in the rate of extinction as currently measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

As shown in Table S1, when the principal components analysis was conducted for each of the phenotypes separately, three factors were identified for bHRs that together accounted for 91% of the variance in their behavior, and two factors were identified for bLRs that together accounted for 81% of the variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bHRs, Factor 1 accounted for 37% of the variance and was largely defined by locomotor response to novelty and cue-induced reinstatement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor 2 accounted for 29% of the variance and was largely defined by behavior during the acquisition phase of cocaine self-administration and drug-induced reinstatement; and Factor 3 accounted for 23% of the variance and had a single significant loading associated with the persistence of drug-seeking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bLRs, Factor 1 accounted for 51% of the variance in behavior and was largely defined by locomotor response to novelty, persistence of drug-seeking behavior, and cue-induced reinstatement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor 2 for bLRs was very similar to Factor 2 for bHRs, accounting for 30% of the variance in behavior and defined primarily by behavior during the acquisition phase and drug-induced reinstatement (in agreement with ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although there appear to be similar constructs underlying some of the addiction-related behaviors exhibited by bHRs and bLRs, others are phenotype-dependent; notably, the persistence of drug-seeking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Addiction_Score  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resulting Addiction Scores ranged between 22 and 190, and brains were analyzed from the extremes of the population, resulting in six bLRs within the range of 2244 and six bHRs within 53190.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to reiterate, however, that despite the range in Addiction Scores, all rats received the same amount of cocaine throughout the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data presented here demonstrate the role of genetics in addictive behavior, as evidenced by the fact that rats selectively bred based on locomotor response to a novel environment differ on a number of behaviors reminiscent of human addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to bLRs, bHR rats are more likely to seek cocaine when it is no longer available and more susceptible to control by cocaine itself and cocaine-associated cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, following prolonged cocaine self-administration, bHR rats exhibit: (i) attenuated drug-taking behavior when the discrete drug-associated cue-light is removed; (ii) increased drug-seeking behavior when drug delivery is not available; and (iii) increased propensity for reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The selective breeding of these rat lines, in conjunction with the fact that we controlled for the amount of cocaine intake throughout the self-administration period, provide a unique opportunity to examine the neurobiological antecedents and consequences of addiction liability and prolonged cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended previous findings (36), showing that, relative to bHRs, bLRs have lower levels of FGF2 mRNA and greater levels of association of the H3K9me3 at the FGF2 promoter, specifically in the nucleus accumbens core, and these differences persist following prolonged cocaine exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in agreement with previous findings (19, 35), we show that, relative to bLRs, bHRs have lower levels of D2 mRNA in the nucleus accumbens core under basal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Novel to the present study, we demonstrate that, relative to bLRs, bHRs showed greater levels of association of H3K9me3 at the D2 promoter in the nucleus accumbens core, and these phenotypic differences in gene expression and epigenetic regulation of D2 were no longer observed following prolonged cocaine self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps most interestingly, however, we found that the association of H3K9me3 at the D2 promoter is positively correlated with cue-induced drug-seeking or the propensity to relapse following 1 mo of abstinence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that cocaine addiction liability may, in part, be driven by epigenetic modifications that result in low levels of the dopamine D2 receptor in the nucleus accumbens core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, low FGF2 levels in the nucleus accumbens core may serve as a protective factor, decreasing the likelihood that an individual will transition to cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual_Differences_in_Cocaine_Addiction_Liability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the years, preclinical studies have shifted the focus from the initiation of drug-taking behavior to compulsive drug use (25, 4649).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One prominent example is a study demonstrating that the diagnostic criteria for addiction could be modeled in rats (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the emergence of this animal model of addiction, it was reported that locomotor response to noveltyor sensation-seeking as measured in the ratis not associated with addiction liability per se (21, 25, 50), but does remain a good predictor of the initial propensity to take drugs (22, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the design of the present study did not permit phenotypic differences to emerge in the acquisition of drug-taking behavior as it is typically assessed (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in number of infusions), we did find that bHRs initially self-administered cocaine at a faster rate than bLRs, and more bLRs than bHRs failed to meet infusion criteria early in training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the notion that locomotor response to novelty is associated with the initial propensity to take psychostimulant drugs (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although willingness to experiment with illicit drugs is a critical element contributing to vulnerability to substance abuse (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50), elucidating the factors contributing to the conversion from initial drug-taking behavior to addiction is of great value for potential therapeutic interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the transition to cocaine addiction, we examined the persistence of cocaine-seeking behavior, or the inability to refrain from drug-seeking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of previous studies (25, 52), we found that only after prolonged self-administration experience did rats begin to exhibit addiction-like behaviors: seeking cocaine when it was not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only bHRs showed evidence for this switch to persistent cocaine use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the behavior of bLRs was relatively stable throughout the maintenance phase, with prolonged experience bHRs showed an enhanced tendency to increase drug-seeking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because relapse is one of the biggest problems in the treatment of addiction (53), and most often triggered by environmental cues that have previously been associated with the drug-taking experience (5456), we examined the ability of the drug-associated cue to control behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even during relatively early phases of self-administration training, the drug-associated cue acquired the ability to control cocaine-taking behavior of bHRs, but not bLRs (similar to refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38 and 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bHRs were also more susceptible to cue-induced reinstatement after 1 mo of forced abstinence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the cue-induced reinstatement test, bHRs responded four times more than bLRs for presentation of the discrete cue light in the absence of cocaine reward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are in agreement with those showing that bHRs have a greater propensity to attribute incentive salience to drug-associated cues (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that the ability of the discrete drug-associated cue to control behavior contributes, at least in part, to the addictive behaviors exhibited by bHRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The findings reported here are in contrast to those in outbred rats, for which there is no association between addiction liability and locomotor response to novelty (21, 22, 25, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to reiterate, however, that the bred lines exhibit differences in other traits that have been associated with addiction liability, including impulsivity (19), and these differences are not necessarily apparent in outbred LR/HR rats (22, 23; see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the principal components analysis conducted here revealed a relationship between locomotor response to novelty, acquisition of drug-taking behavior, the persistence of drug-seeking behavior, and drug-induced reinstatement, all of which loaded onto a single factor accounting for close to 50% of the variance in behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at least in these bred lines, this constellation of traits, when expressed together, may contribute to addiction liability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neurobiological_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_Cocaine_Addiction_Liability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine neurobiological antecedents that might contribute to individual differences in the initial propensity to take drugs, we examined brains from a subset of bLR and bHR rats that were killed under basal conditions at 70 d old, the same time that selectively bred counterparts began self-administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the consequences of the prolonged cocaine exposure were assessed in the brains of rats that were 170 d old, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that aging might have contributed to phenotypic differences that were apparent at the latter time point and not under basal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the pattern of differences we found does not support this explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the aim of the study was not to compare across time points, but to instead examine what phenotypic differences exist before and then following the cocaine-taking experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, using rats that are selectively bred based on locomotor response to novelty, we demonstrated differences in the genetic predisposition for cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bHR rats exhibit greater addictive behavior relative to bLR rats, as measured by the ability of a cocaine-associated cue to control behavior, the persistence of cocaine-seeking behavior, and an increased propensity for reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, differential patterns of FGF2 expression and its epigenetic regulation in the nucleus accumbens core exist before and following prolonged cocaine self-administration, whereas differential patterns in expression and epigenetic regulation of the dopamine D2 receptor were only evident before the cocaine-taking experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, the epigenetic regulation of D2 seems to be predictive of the propensity for cue-induced reinstatement or relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that low D2 mRNA levels resulting from epigenetic modifications in the nucleus accumbens core is associated with greater susceptibility, whereas low levels of FGF2 and its epigenetic regulation may protect individuals from cocaine addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Laser_Capture_Microdissection_for_Chromatin_Immunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For laser-capture microdissection (LCM) for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), 10-µm-thick coronal sections were cross-linked in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C and after proper washes, LCM was performed as described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each rat, seven slides were used, resulting in the bilateral collection of 4050 nucleus accumbens cores per rat for the ChIP assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chromatin was extracted and sheared (Branson) from the LCM-captured tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of DNA was quantified and one-fifth of the lysate was aliquoted for input before immunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin from each sample was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein-DNA-antibody complexes were precipitated with Dynabeads@protein A (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C, then eluted and reverse cross-linked with 0.3 M NaCl at 65 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were digested with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA was extracted and purified (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific primers (SI Materials and Methods and Table S2) directed to the gene promoters for FGF2 or D2 were used for amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following PCR, the input and immunoprecipitated DNA for each sample were run on 1% agarose gels and quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health Image software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of immunoprecpitated DNA was normalized to the input for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Hybridization_Histochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (76, 77) using brain sections adjacent to those used for LCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postfixed sections were hybridized with a 35S-labeled cRNA probe directed against rat FGF2 mRNA or D2 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following posthybridization rinses and dehydration, slides were opposed to Kodak Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autoradiograms were captured and digitized and the magnitude of the signal from the hybridized 35S-cRNA probe was determined using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health Image software) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One bLR sample from the post self-administration group had to be eliminated from the FGF2 mRNA analysis because of poor tissue quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
