Convective flow reversal in self-powered enzyme micropumps  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface-bound enzymes act as pumps in the presence of their specific substrates or promoters, thereby combining sensing and fluidic pumping into a single self-powered microdevice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a combination of theory and experiments, we have elucidated the mechanism of the prototypical urease-based pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that even simple enzymatic reactions can drive complex, time-dependent flows whose direction and speed depend critically on the relative diffusivities and expansion coefficients of the reactants and products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach allows us to accurately predict the behavior of new pump designs under different conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface-bound enzymes can act as pumps that drive large-scale fluid flows in the presence of their substrates or promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, enzymatic catalysis can be harnessed for on demand pumping in nano- and microfluidic devices powered by an intrinsic energy source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms controlling the pumping have not, however, been completely elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we combine theory and experiments to demonstrate a previously unreported spatiotemporal variation in pumping behavior in urease-based pumps and uncover the mechanisms behind these dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a theoretical model for the transduction of chemical energy into mechanical fluid flow in these systems, capturing buoyancy effects due to the solution containing nonuniform concentrations of substrate and product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the qualitative features of the flow depend on the ratios of diffusivities =DP/DS and expansion coefficients =P/S of the reaction substrate (S) and product (P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If  greater than 1 and  greater than  (or if less_than1 and less_than), an unexpected phenomenon arises: the flow direction reverses with time and distance from the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the model and show that both the speed and direction of fluid pumping (i) depend on the enzyme activity and coverage, (ii) vary with the distance from the pump, and (iii) evolve with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings permit the rational design of enzymatic pumps that accurately control the direction and speed of fluid flow without external power sources, enabling effective, self-powered fluidic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible mechanisms of fluid convection in enzyme-powered micropumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluid flow observed in enzyme-powered micropumps in the presence of substrate has been attributed to two factors: (A) thermal buoyancy and (B) solutal buoyancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exothermic enzymatic reactions heat the fluid, lowering solution density and causing fluid to be drawn in and rise above the pump (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutal buoyancy effects arise from the differences in density between the reactants and the products of an enzymatic reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Converting reactants to products can either decrease the density of the solution at the pattern surface, which drives flows as in A, or increase the density, which drives convective flows in the opposite direction as in B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Urease-Pump_Experiments_with_Different_Enzyme_Coverage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Streptavidin-functionalized patterns were incubated for 34 h with enzyme solutions of different concentrations that were prepared previously by serial dilutions from a stock enzyme solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme concentrations prepared were as follows: 6.0 × 106 M, 3.0 × 106 M, 3.0 × 107 M, 3.0 × 108 M, 3.0 × 109 M, 3.0 × 1010 M, 3.0 × 1012 M, 3.0 × 1013 M, 3.0 × 1015 M, 3.0 × 1016 M, 3.0 × 1018 M, 3.0 × 1019 M, and 3.0 × 1020 M. Each solution was used to incubate one functionalized pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After enzyme immobilization, the patterns were washed with 10 mM PBS buffer, and secure-seal hybridization chambers (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with dimensions of 20 mm diameter and 1.3 mm height were used to form a closed-system device, to which 500 mM urea in 10 mM PBS buffer solution was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor the fluid flow in all our experiments, sulfate-functionalized polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences Inc.), 2 µm in size, were introduced as tracers suspended in the substrate solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movies were captured using an optical setup composed of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 MAT) with a halogen lamp (12 V max, 100 W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation light was focused into the sample through a 20× objective (EC Epiplan-NEOFLUAR 20×/0.55 HD DIC /0; Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission light was collected by the objective, passed through interference filters, and finally detected by a high-sensitivity Flea 3 USB 3 digital camera (FL3-U3-32S2C; Point Gray Research), with a resolution of 2,080 × 1,552 pixels at 60 frames per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-minute movies were recorded using this camera, attached to the optical microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experiments comparing pumping speeds as a function of enzyme coverage, movies were recorded at a distance of 50 m from the enzyme pump at four different locations around it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported pumping speeds correspond to the speeds obtained after 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare pumping speeds as a function of time for intermediate enzyme coverage, movies were taken every 5 min at a distance of 50 m away from the enzyme pump, focusing on one side of the patch only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the spatiotemporal analysis of the pumping behavior of urease pumps at low enzyme coverage, 1-min movies were taken 50 m away from the patch surface on four sides to compare speeds and fluid direction, thereby ruling out extraneous flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microscope was then focused on one side of the patch, and 1-min movies were taken close to the pump and at increasing distances (1 mm apart) away from the Au patch until the wall was reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole process was then repeated five times to monitor the behavior at different time intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure fluid pumping speed in each experiment, 30 tracer particles were tracked for time intervals of 1246 s, depending on the system, using Tracker, a video analysis and modeling software (Open Source Physics and comPADRE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment was repeated five times to ensure repeatability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supplementary_Analysis_of_Theoretical_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fundamental origin of the observed time-dependent flow structure is a competition between substrate- and product-driven flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the reaction proceeds, substrate is locally depleted at the enzyme patch, lowering the fluid density and driving an inward convective flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the reaction product is formed at the enzyme patch, increasing the density of the solution and driving convection outward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net flow is determined by the balance between these two opposing effects and depends on differences in the diffusivities and expansion coefficients between the substrate and product species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now analyze the model to uncover qualitative features of the pumping behavior and, moreover, determine conditions on the diffusivities and expansion coefficients that lead to reversal of pumping direction over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full system of equations for the evolution of the chemical fields (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) and fluid flow (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) cannot be solved analytically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore use numerical simulations to obtain the solutions in the most general cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide a qualitative understanding of the possible outcomes and predict when flow reversal is possible, we consider a limiting case for which the problem becomes mathematically tractable; namely, we neglect advection terms in the transport equation for the chemicals (substrate and product).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplification is reasonable when flow speeds are low, corresponding to pumping at low reaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approximation, our theoretical analysis proceeds as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Numerical_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations of the pump setup shown in Fig 2 were carried out on a 3D computational grid with typical (e.g., for results in Fig 4) grid spacing x=R/32 and overall size 320x×16x×320x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Convergence tests were performed to confirm that grid refinement produced negligible differences in flow and concentration fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radius and height of the circular enzyme patch was R=32x and h=x, respectively, reflecting the thin surface layer to which the enzymes attach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Analysis_of_the_Density_Differences_Between_Reactants_and_Products_in_the_UreaseUrea_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existence of a solutal density gradient in the ureaseurea system was confirmed by measuring quantitatively the density difference between solutions containing urea and urease, freshly prepared and after reaction (2 d after preparation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate concentration was 500 mM in 10 mM PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme concentration was the lowest enzyme concentration used for pattern soaking for which the fluid flow direction was still outward ([E] = 3.0 × 107 M; high enzyme coverage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values obtained are specified in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the density of pure water to be water=0.998g/mL, we then estimate the expansion coefficient ratio as =(finalwater)/(initialwater)1.19±0.08.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimate treats the buffer, which is altered as the reaction proceeds, as part of the substrate and product solute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a combination of theory and experiments to uncover the mechanism behind the remarkable spatiotemporal variations in pumping in urease-based pumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having ruled out several mechanisms, we formulated a model that accounts for buoyancy effects due to nonuniform concentrations of substrate and product that have different diffusivities and volumetric expansion coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the qualitative features of the flow depend on the ratios of diffusivities =DP/DS and expansion coefficients =P/S of the reaction substrate and product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If  greater than 1 and  greater than  (or if less_than1 and less_than), then the flow direction reverses with time and distance from the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At any given position, the flow direction at later times can be opposite to that at earlier times, and within a certain range of time, the flow direction near the pump can be opposite to that far from the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical simulations showed that chemical advection at large Péclet numbers could delay the reversal or otherwise alter the flow pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental results clearly confirmed the validity of our model, providing an example where the flow near the pump is initially in the outward direction but changes to inward pumping over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region of inward pumping then gradually spreads farther out in space, replacing outward pumping in the entire system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are unexpected and surprising as previous experiments with several enzyme micropumps have seen flow speeds only decay over time as substrate is consumed (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, however, we show that the flow direction can change over tens of minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our work clearly illustrates that a simple chemical reaction of the form SP catalyzed by a patch of immobilized enzymes can drive a complex, time-dependent flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance between inward convective flow, driven by substrate depletion at the pump, and outward flow, driven by product formation at the pump, can result in flow reversal if the substrate and product have different diffusivities and different expansion coefficients satisfying the conditions above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated in experiments, this flow reversal is observable even with small differences in diffusivity and expansion coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore expect that many other reaction systems can exhibit similar behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We showed that, for low reaction rates, the flow induced by these enzymatic pumps is roughly proportional to the local horizontal gradients in fluid density and could therefore be predicted from a simple 2D model for the density evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a density field can be computed quickly, using fundamental solutions of the diffusion equation, whereas simulation of diffusion and advection in 3D domains is computationally demanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our approach enables rapid evaluation of the behavior of new pump designs under different conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, flows due to multiple patches with differing enzyme loadings and arranged arbitrarily in the chamber can be predicted with our technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, thermal effects can be incorporated in a similar manner, treating heat as one of the reaction products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More accurate quantitative predictions of pumping can be achieved by extending the model to include the effects of substrate depletion on the rate of reaction (e.g., MichaelisMenten kinetics) and cross-diffusion terms (the flux of a chemical species due to concentration gradients of another species; this flux can be significant in some systems) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the overall flow is sensitive to small changes in substrate and product concentration profiles, these nonlinear terms may affect the overall pumping behavior if the reaction rate is sufficiently high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can also model more complex situations, such as oscillatory or sequential activation of pumps that could be engineered with multiple enzyme types interconnected by reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Numerical_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finite difference method was used to numerically solve the advectiondiffusionreaction equations governing concentration fields (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), with second-order finite differences used for the Laplace operator and the first-order upwind scheme used for the advective term when we investigated the effects of finite Péclet number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction term was implemented as a source contribution in the grid cells occupied by the patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our model assumes a constant reaction rate, it is possible for substrate concentrations to become negative over the course of a simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore verified in all simulations that the concentration changes remained small, justifying our assumption of constant reaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluid flow was simulated using the lattice Boltzmann method (22, 23) with the D3Q19 scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buoyancy force, defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, was implemented as a body force acting at each grid point (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bounce-back rules were adopted to enforce the no-slip boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of finite difference and lattice Boltzmann methods has proved to be effective in modeling advectiondiffusion processes (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biotinylation_of_Enzymes_(27)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A urease [Canavalia ensiformis (Jack bean)] (Sigma Aldrich) solution (2 mg/mL) was prepared with 100 mM PBS as the buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before completing the total volume of the enzyme solution, 10 µL of a 0.1-mM 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) biotin solution was added per mL of enzyme solution to get a ratio of 4:1 enzyme:biotin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, followed by dialysis of the final solution and washes with 10 mM PBS (details in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrated enzyme solution (stored at 4 °C) was used later for the preparation of enzyme solutions of different concentrations, using serial dilutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biotinylation_of_Au_Patterns__Enzyme_Immobilization__and_Particle_Tracking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Au (90 nm) was patterned on a PEG-functionalized glass surface (MicroSurfaces), using an electron beam, with a 10-nm adhesion layer of Cr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylation of the circular Au patterns (radius = 3 mm) was achieved through the formation of a SAM, using a biotinthiol linker (28) (preparation details in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A solution of the linker in a solvent mixture of 1:1 H2O:ethanol (8 mL of solution per milligram of biotin) was used for overnight incubation of the patterns at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, the patterns were washed several times with deionized water, followed by washes with 10 mM PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAM-modified surfaces were then incubated in a streptavidin (ProZyme) solution (9 M in 10 mM PBS) for 3 h, followed by incubation with enzymebiotin solutions for 34 h before the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functionalized surfaces were washed with 10 mM PBS buffer after each incubation period to remove unbound material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the experimental modifications of this procedure to control enzyme coverage are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Secure-seal hybridization chambers (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with dimensions of 20 mm diameter and 1.3 mm height were used to form closed-system devices, to which solutions of 500 mM urea in 10 mM PBS buffer solution were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor the fluid flow in all our experiments, 2 µm sulfate functionalized polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences Inc.) were introduced as tracers suspended in the substrate solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movies were captured using an optical setup composed of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 MAT) with a halogen lamp (12 V max, 100 W) and a high-sensitivity Flea 3 USB 3 Digital Camera (FL3-U3-32S2C; Point Gray Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure fluid pumping speed in each experiment, 30 tracer particles were tracked using Tracker (Open Source Physics and comPADRE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Materials and Methods for tables of pumping speeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
