Mutation in human CLPX elevates levels of -aminolevulinate synthase and protoporphyrin IX to promote erythropoietic protoporphyria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although heme synthesis is ubiquitous, specific regulatory mechanisms couple heme production to cellular demand and environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of these regulatory mechanisms is highlighted by clinical variability in porphyrias caused by loss-of-function mutations in heme synthesis enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heme synthesis is also controlled by the mitochondrial AAA+ unfoldase ClpX, which participates in both heme-dependent degradation of -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) and ALAS activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reports a human familial mutation in CLPX that contributes to erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) by partially inactivating CLPX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced CLPX activity increases ALAS post-translational stability, causing pathological accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in human patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus identify an additional gene that promotes PPIX overproduction and EPP and highlight the complex gene network contributing to disorders of heme metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Loss-of-function mutations in genes for heme biosynthetic enzymes can give rise to congenital porphyrias, eight forms of which have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic penetrance of the porphyrias is clinically variable, underscoring the role of additional causative, contributing, and modifier genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously discovered that the mitochondrial AAA+ unfoldase ClpX promotes heme biosynthesis by activation of -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), which catalyzes the first step of heme synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPX has also been reported to mediate heme-induced turnover of ALAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a dominant mutation in the ATPase active site of human CLPX, p.Gly298Asp, that results in pathological accumulation of the heme biosynthesis intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amassing of PPIX in erythroid cells promotes erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) in the affected family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation in CLPX inactivates its ATPase activity, resulting in coassembly of mutant and WT protomers to form an enzyme with reduced activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of low-activity CLPX increases the posttranslational stability of ALAS, causing increased ALAS protein and ALA levels, leading to abnormal accumulation of PPIX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus identify an additional molecular mechanism underlying the development of EPP and further our understanding of the multiple mechanisms by which CLPX controls heme metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An_EPP-Affected_Family_Carries_a_Dominant_CLPX_Allele  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recently identified a family from Northern France in which the proband suffers from EPP of unknown etiology (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proband, an 18-y-old Caucasian female, was referred to the French Center of Porphyria because of early-onset (9 mo) acute photosensitivity, characterized by painful phototoxic reactions and elevated levels of free and zinc-chelated erythroid PPIX, phenotypes suggestive of EPP (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of diagnosis, she also presented with a microcytic iron-deficiency anemia (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Her ferrochelatase (FECH) activity was normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, she did not carry any of the known gain-of-function mutations in the ALAS2 gene that lead to EPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No point mutations or large FECH gene deletions on chromosome 18 (3), where the FECH gene is located, were identified by linkage and comparative genomic hybridization array analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, she did not harbor the c.31548C FECH low-expressed allele (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that the proband has an unusual form of EPP (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the probands family members, her father (II.4) and uncle (II.2) also presented with free and zinc-PPIX accumulation in erythrocytes and associated mild photosensitivity, but without the complete clinical symptoms of EPP (Fig 1A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After linkage analysis and exclusion of candidate genes (SI Appendix, Table S1), whole-exome sequencing revealed that the proband (III.2) carried a single nucleotide substitution (g.27511 G  greater than  A) at the exon 7 splice junction border in one of her two CLPX alleles (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation was not present in 126,216 control reference exomes queried in the genome aggregation database (gnomad.broadinstitute.org), suggesting that it is not a common human polymorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish the inheritance pattern of this mutation, we performed Sanger sequencing of gDNA obtained from whole blood of the probands relatives and collected clinical data from these family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among nuclear family members, only the probands father (II.4) and uncle (II.2) harbored the identical heterozygous CLPX mutation (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the G  greater than  A transition in CLPX cDNA was fully segregated with the PPIX accumulation and was inherited in a pattern consistent with Mendelian dominance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pre-mRNA from the mutant allele was normally spliced (Fig 1C), and the mutation was predicted to encode the single amino acid p.Gly298Asp substitution in the mature CLPX protein (CLPXGD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that this CLPX mutation increases PPIX production with incomplete penetrance for full EPP; disease progression and severity are likely influenced by environmental conditions and/or genetic modifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we went on to explore the molecular mechanism by which this CLPX mutation alters heme metabolism and contributes to EPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CLPXGD_Has_a_Defective_ATPase_Active_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human CLPX glycine 298 is a highly conserved residue in the Walker A motif (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motif forms part of the ATP-binding pocket and participates in the positioning and hydrolysis of ATP (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G298D mutation is predicted to prevent ATP binding by steric occlusion or distortion of the active site (Fig 2B); thus, we sought to determine whether the CLPX G298D mutation in our pedigree caused EPP by disrupting the regulatory function(s) of CLPX on heme synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the consequence of the G298D mutation on CLPX activity, we assayed ATPase activity of wild-type (WT) murine CLPX and a G298D CLPX variant (CLPXGD) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPXGD lacked detectable ATPase activity and partially suppressed the ATPase of WT CLPX protomers (Fig 2C), suggesting that the dominant-negative phenotype of the mutant allele could be caused by heterooligomerization of WT and mutant CLPX subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of WT CLPX ATPase activity by CLPXGD plateaued at a 30% reduction in activity, indicating that WT CLPX protomers within any heterooligomers retain partial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CLPXGD_Increases_ALAS_and_PPIX_Levels_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether CLPXGD could induce erythropoietic porphyria, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged CLPX and CLPXGD in HEK293T cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293T cells that expressed CLPXGD contained 1.5-fold more PPIX than control or CLPX-expressing cells (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CLPX modulates ALAS activity (9, 10), which in turn can alter downstream PPIX levels, we analyzed ALAS activity in CLPX-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HEK293T fibroblasts, expression of CLPX decreased endogenous ALAS1 activity (Fig 3C), and this CLPX effect also lowered ALAS1 protein levels (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the expression of CLPXGD resulted in increased activity of ALAS1 (Fig 3C) and a parallel increase in the level of ALAS1 protein (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, consistent with the findings reported by Kubota et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10), CRISPR-mediated disruption of CLPX in K562 cells also caused an increase in ALAS1 protein levels (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression of CLPXGD in Friend mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Fig 3D) similarly increased PPIX production (Fig 3E) and increased ALAS2 activity (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we observed that the expression of CLPXGD increased ALAS2 protein levels, whereas expression of CLPX decreased ALAS2 levels (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the decrease in ALAS2 protein caused by CLPXGD expression did not change the total ALAS activity measured (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether CLPXGD similarly increased ALAS activity in an animal model, we injected equal amounts of cRNA encoding FLAG-tagged CLPX and CLPXGD into zebrafish embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected CLPX and CLPXGD cRNA was efficiently translated into CLPX protein (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPXGD expression caused an approximately twofold increase in ALAS activity (Fig 3H), consistent with cell culture data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed similar increases in ALAS protein levels and activity in patient-derived cells as in CLPXGD-expressing cell and animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALAS1 levels (Fig 4A) and activity (Table 2) were elevated, as demonstrated by accumulation of the ALA metabolite in EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cells obtained from CLPXWT/GD individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modestly increased ALAS2 levels were also found in erythroid cells obtained from differentiation of primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the index cases (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data demonstrate that expression of CLPXGD in cell cultures and zebrafish phenocopies the CLPXGD effect in patient cells, causing increased ALAS protein, higher ALA levels, and thus accumulation of PPIX, the biochemical hallmark of EPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CLPXGD_Slows_ALAS_Degradation_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An attractive hypothesis to explain how CLPXGD causes PPIX accumulation is that the reduced activity of mixed hexamers of WT CLPX and CLPXGD reduces the rate of CLPX-dependent degradation of both ALAS1 (10) and ALAS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we assessed whether CLPXGD increased ALAS activity by increasing the stability of the ALAS proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored the rate of ALAS1 and ALAS2 turnover in cultured cells by Western blot analysis following inhibition of protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, we treated CLPX- or CLPXGD-expressing HEK293T cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit de novo translation (1115), and monitored the decrease in ALAS1 or ALAS2 protein over several hours by Western blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALAS1 degradation was slow specifically in cells expressing CLPXGD (Fig 4 C and D, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, CLPXGD itself was less stable than CLPX (Fig 4 C and D, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALAS2 degradation was also decreased by expression of CLPXGD in differentiating MEL cells (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, impaired CLPX-dependent turnover of ALAS could explain the alterations in both housekeeping and erythroid-specific heme synthesis caused by the presence of heterozygous CLPXGD and CLPXWT alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assembly_of_CLPX-CLPXGD_Heteromeric_CLPX_Unfoldase_and_CLPXP_Protease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work with Escherichia coli and human homologs of ClpX and ClpP has demonstrated that ATP binding stabilizes ClpX hexamers and is essential for ClpXP complex formation (1618).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the effect of the G298D mutation on the ATPase active site of ClpX, we believed it important to directly test the ability of CLPXGD to coassemble with WT CLPX and with CLPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested complex formation among these purified protein variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the interaction of CLPXGD with WT CLPX protomers was not substantially perturbed, as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On analysis of CLPX-CLPP complex formation by CLPP pulldown, WT CLPX was pulled down by CLPP in at ATP-dependent manner, whereas CLPXGD was not pulled down by CLPP (Fig 5B), as predicted because of its defective ATP-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an equimolar mixture of CLPXGD and WT CLPX, however, both CLPX variants coisolated with CLPP, but the total amount of CLPX recovered was reduced to half of that recovered from the WT CLPX-only condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that mixed hexamers composed of WT and G298D CLPX interact more weakly with CLPP than fully WT CLPX hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, along with reducing the ATPase activity of CLPX in the cell, CLPXGD likely also reduces the abundance and degradation activity of CLPXP complexes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If CLPXP directly degrades the ALAS proteins, then this weakened CLPX-CLPP interaction would be expected to contribute to the reduced ALAS1 and ALAS2 turnover that we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work has shown that ClpX activates ALAS by accelerating incorporation of the essential ALAS cofactor, pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of one of two ClpX homologs in zebrafish, clpxa, caused an erythropoietic anemia that was chemically complemented by the addition of ALA, indicating that this anemia was due to reduced ALAS activity (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in this previous study, the CLPXP proteolytic complex was not observed to degrade ALAS2 in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data reported here and by Kubota et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) suggest that additional factors, such as autoregulatory free heme or collaboration with the Lon protease (19), may be required for CLPX-mediated degradation of ALAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our present results, we suggest a model that integrates both mechanisms by which ClpX modulates ALAS activity, acceleration of PLP cofactor incorporation (activation), and promotion of ALAS protein turnover (degradation) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance of these mechanisms in vivo determines whether stimulation or suppression of ALAS activity by CLPX is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CLPX is absent or expressed at only a low level, both ALAS activation and degradation are strongly blocked, causing an accumulation of ALAS with decreased enzymatic activity and thus reduced ALA synthesis, causing anemia (Fig 5C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, CLPXWT/GD heterozygous individuals contain CLPXWT/GD heteromeric complexes with reduced ATPase activity and weakened interaction with CLPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting reduction in ALAS degradation has a stronger phenotypic consequence than possible decreased activation, likely due in part to the weaker interaction of CLPXWT/GD heterohexamers with the CLPP peptidase, resulting in a net increase in ALA and PPIX (Fig 5C, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is well established with bacterial ClpXP that the unfolding of some protein substrates requires much more ATP and a higher ClpX-ATPase rate compared with other proteins, and the differences depend on the specific structure of the substrate protein (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed CLPXWT/GD enzyme may be more defective in the complete ALAS unfolding required for degradation than in the limited unfolding that we proposed is required for activation (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when cells contain CLPXWT/GD heterohexamers, active, intact ALAS accumulates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular FECH activity and iron levels are insufficient to convert the resulting excess PPIX to heme, causing cells to accumulate free and zinc-PPIX and leading to symptoms of porphyria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pedigree of the probands family clearly demonstrates the dominant coinheritance of PPIX accumulation with the CLPXGD allele through vertical transmission over two generations (Fig1 and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human dominantly inherited diseases are often characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable presentation of disease symptoms, usually due to differences in the influence of environmental factors and/or modifier genes on different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the human dominant CLPX disorder behaves in this manner, as observed for the previously reported dominant porphyrias (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have uncovered a new molecular basis for EPP, a defect in the AAA+ unfoldase CLPX that results in aberrant control of the key heme synthetic enzyme ALAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the contribution of ClpX and ClpXP to essential organismal processes such as heme synthesis (9, 10) and mitochondrial respiration (21, 22), it is likely that CLPX mutations contribute to additional mitochondriopathies and metabolic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Causative recessive mutations in CLPP have been identified in Perrault syndrome (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no unfoldase-independent role of ClpP is known or predicted, CLPX activity is likely required for the CLPP function(s) that are perturbed in Perrault syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPX mutations also could contribute to sideroblastic anemia by slowing PLP incorporation into ALAS2, phenocopying XLPP caused by ALAS2 mutations that inhibit PLP binding (2528).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with large doses of vitamin B6 (to yield PLP) might bypass a deficiency in CLPX-stimulated PLP incorporation into ALAS2 in a manner analogous to treatment of patients with XLPP with B6-responsive ALAS2 mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the genetic variant of EPP reported here shares more similarities with ALAS2-based EPP (XLPP) than with FECH-based EPP, it could be helpful to treat patients with CLPX-based EPP with supplemental iron to convert excess PPIX to heme, as has been beneficial for patients with XLPP with a normal FECH gene (3, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incomplete EPP penetrance and variable clinical symptoms observed among the CLPXGD-carrying individuals may be based in environmental factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EPP, whether iron therapy is effective or might even sometimes worsen the disease is a matter of debate (30, 31); however, recent work suggests that iron status can modulate the phenotype both in congenital erythropoietic porphyria (32) and in XLPP (3, 5, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we speculate that the iron deficiency of the index CLPXGD patient may result from an independent pathological process that contributes to the penetrance of EPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is our hope that further understanding of the complex network of enzyme and cofactor interactions controlling heme synthesis will continue to contribute ideas for therapeutic strategies to treat diseases caused by aberrant regulation of heme metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The study was approved by local Ethics Committees in accordance with the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects and its subsequent amendments of the Declaration of Helsinki (R162-167 and 14515-4, French ethical agreement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All family members provided written informed consent, and the European Union Institutional Review Board at INSERM approved the protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertebrate animal studies were performed in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols at Boston Childrens Hospital, Brigham & Womens Hospital, and MIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diagnosis of EPP was based on biochemical analyses of porphyrins in plasma, feces, and erythrocytes, and on FECH enzymatic assays performed according to the European Porphyria Network (EPNET) guidelines and quality control schemes (porphyria.eu/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erythroid porphyrins were measured as described previously (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of zinc-protoporphyrin was calculated from fluorescence emission spectra of extracted of erythrocyte hemolysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Porphyrins were extracted as described previously (34) and analyzed by HPLC (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular ALA levels were measured by LC-MS/MS (UPLC-Xevo TQMS; Waters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were sonicated in the presence of 1 mM succinylacetone, and samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using MCX columns (Waters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPIX in HEK293T and MEL cells and ALAS activity were quantified as described previously (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_Metabolite_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lymphoblastoid cells were obtained from the Biological Resource Center, Hôpital Cochin-APHP (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% l-glutamine 200 mM, 10 mM Hepes, and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPX genotypes were identified by Sanger sequencing (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DS19 MEL clones were a gift from Arthur Skoultchi (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), and the Biological Resource Center at Hôpital Cochin-APHP generously established the lymphoblastoid cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation (PAA Laboratories) from 60 mL of peripheral whole blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD34+ cells were purified using immunomagnetic beads (MACS CD34+ MicroBead Kit; Miltenyi Biotec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD34+ cells were differentiated into erythroid cells by culture in Iscoves Modified Dulbeccos Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 15% BIT 9500 (Stemcell Technologies), 2 U/mL EPO, 100 ng/mL SCF, 10 ng/mL IL-6, and 10 ng/mL IL-3 (Miltenyi Biotec), MEL (DS19 subclone) cells were differentiated by incubation in complete DMEM supplemented with 2% DMSO for 3 d. To assess hemoglobinization, o-dianisidine staining was performed as described previously (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoprecipitation_and_Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zebrafish embryos at 24 h postfertilization with eGFP expression were lysed in groups of 50 embryos in RIPA buffer/protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) by dounce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clarified soluble lysate after centrifugation was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h at 4 °C, after which immune complex beads were serially washed with PBST/protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and eluted in boiling Laemmli loading solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eluted immune complex was resolved on SDS/PAGE and visualized by Western blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ALAS1 (ab84962; Abcam), anti-ALAS2 (ab184964; Abcam or rabbit anti-human ALAS2; Agios Pharmaceutical), anti-CLPX (AP1067b; Abgent), anti-HSP60 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ANT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CHX_Block  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibition of translation was carried out with 100 g/mL CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested at indicated times after CHX treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins obtained from whole-cell lysates (HEK293T cells) or mitochondrial fractions (MEL cells) were resolved by SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALAS1, ALAS2, and CLPX were detected by Western blot analysis, and protein levels were quantified using ImageJ (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CLPX_Biochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Murine CLPX variants and human CLPPHis6 were expressed and purified as described previously (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial expression vectors for the CLPXGD and CLPX-3xFLAG proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and isothermal assembly, respectively, of the previously reported CLPX expression vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPX ATPase activity was monitored at 30 °C by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in an NADH-coupled assay (2.5 mM ATP, 1 mM NADH, 7.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase, and 20 U/mL pyruvate kinase) in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Co-IP of purified CLPX-3xFLAG and CLPX variants was performed with FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated magnetic agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here 0.25 M CLPX-3xFLAG and 0.25 M CLPX or CLPXGD were incubated in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/mL acetylated BSA, and 1 mM DTT with 12 L of beads in a 50-L total volume on ice for 45 min with intermittent gentle mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads and bound proteins were washed three times in binding buffer and eluted on ice for 45 min with 30 L of 1 mg/mL 3xFLAG peptide in binding buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE, stained with Sypro Orange, and imaged with a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coisolation of CLPX variants with human CLPPHis6 was performed using His-Tag Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the same buffer used for anti-FLAG co-IP, except for the addition of 10 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPX variants were mixed together as indicated, and CLPPHis6 and ATPS were added as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-Tag Dynabeads were added in an equal volume of buffer to yield a concentration of 0.3 M total CLPX hexamer (CLPX-3xFLAG, CLPXGD, or an equimolar mixture of both) and 0.3 M CLPP 14-mer in 30 L. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with intermittent gentle mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads and bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer, then eluted for 10 min at room temperature in 30 L of binding buffer with 300 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE, stained with Sypro Red, and imaged with a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
