Host target modification as a strategy to counter pathogen hijacking of the jasmonate hormone receptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pathogen infections can cause significant crop losses worldwide and major disturbances in natural ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the molecular basis of plant disease susceptibility is important for the development of new strategies to prevent disease outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have identified the plant jasmonate (JA) hormone receptor as one of the common targets of pathogen virulence factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we modified the JA receptor and showed that transgenic Arabidopsis plants with the modified JA receptor gained resistance to bacterial pathogens that secrete a potent JA-mimicking toxin to promote infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that host target modification may be developed as a new strategy to protect the disease-vulnerable components of the susceptible plant against highly evolved pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the past decade, characterization of the host targets of pathogen virulence factors took a center stage in the study of pathogenesis and disease susceptibility in plants and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the impressive knowledge of host targets has not been broadly exploited to inhibit pathogen infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that host target modification could be a promising new approach to protect the disease-vulnerable components of plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, recent studies have identified the plant hormone jasmonate (JA) receptor as one of the common targets of virulence factors from highly evolved biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, for example, produce proteinaceous effectors, as well as a JA-mimicking toxin, coronatine (COR), to activate JA signaling as a mechanism to promote disease susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guided by the crystal structure of the JA receptor and evolutionary clues, we succeeded in modifying the JA receptor to allow for sufficient endogenous JA signaling but greatly reduced sensitivity to COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing this modified receptor not only are fertile and maintain a high level of insect defense, but also gain the ability to resist COR-producing pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tomato and P. syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  maculicola.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that host target modification can be a promising new approach to prevent the virulence action of highly evolved pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Large-Scale__Targeted_Alanine_Substitution_Mutagenesis_of_the_COI1_Protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We began our study by conducting an expanded mutagenesis of the COI1 protein to identify amino acid residues that might differentially affect the actions of JA-Ile vs. COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected a total of 42 amino acids in or near the COI1 ligand binding pocket for alanine substitution mutagenesis (a detailed description of the rationale and results can be found in Supplemental Description of Results of Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis of the COI1 Protein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we were able to identify 21 alanine substitutions that disrupted COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction, including eight COI1 residues that make direct contact with JA-Ile (36) (Fig S1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none disrupted only COR-dependent interaction but still maintained JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore strengthen the notion that COR is a remarkable mimic of JA-Ile and that most, if not all, COI1 residues that are important for the action of JA-Ile are also important for COR action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure-Guided_Modeling_of_JA-Ile_COR_Binding_Sites_in_COI1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our initial mutagenesis was based on alanine substitution, which resulted in a reduction of the side-chain size for all of the amino acid residues targeted for mutagenesis, except for G357A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we considered increasing the side-chain sizes of residues that are in contact with JA-Ile/COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that although COR and JA-Ile are highly similar in structure, the flexibilities of COR and JA-Ile in the binding pocket are different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the cyclohexene ring and the ethyl-cyclopropane group of COR appear more rigid than the equivalent parts (the pentenyl side-chain and the isoleucine side-chain, respectively) of JA-Ile (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the higher rigidity of the cyclohexene ring and the ethyl-cyclopropane group of COR may be more prone than the equivalent parts of JA-Ile to physical hindrance from an increased size of the amino acid side-chain with which COR/JA-Ile are in direct contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the above hypothesis, residues A86 and A384 attracted our attention for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in silico analysis of the putative JA-Ile binding pockets in diverse plant species for which the COI1 protein sequences are available revealed that, although most residues in the JA binding site are highly conserved across taxa, residues at positions 86 and 384 exhibit a higher degree of polymorphism (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moss species Physcomitrella patens, for example, isoleucine or valine occupy the corresponding position of A384 (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positions of A86 and A384 in Selaginella moellendorffii are replaced by isoleucine/valine and serine, respectively (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that, although core JA signaling genes are found in P. patens (38), neither JA nor JA-Ile could be detected in P. patens (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, (9S,13S)-12-oxophytodienoic acid [cis-(+)-OPDA], the precursor of JA biosynthesis, is synthesized in P. patens, suggesting that P. patens may produce an alternative, OPDA-related ligand (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated that, during plant evolution, the polymorphism at positions 86 and 384 in the putative COI1 binding pocket may provide a basis for accommodating related ligands of distinct structural features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, mutations at these amino acid positions may have a higher chance of producing differential effects on different ligands compared with more highly conserved residues, which are expected to affect different ligands similarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we noted that, in the JA-Ile/COR-binding pocket, A86 and A384 make direct contacts with the ligand (Fig S3A) and are situated close to the cyclohexene ring and the ethyl-cyclopropane group of COR or the equivalent parts of JA-Ile, the pentenyl side-chain, and the isoleucine side-chain, respectively (Fig 1 A and B and Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C atom of A86 is 3.6 Å from the nearest C-atom in the pentenyl side-chain of JA-Ile and 3.7 Å from the ethyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring of COR in their respective crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C atom of A384 is 4.0 Å from the nearest C-atom of the isoleucine side chain of JA-Ile and 3.6 Å from the ethyl-cyclopropane group of COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico mutagenesis followed by energy minimization revealed that the A384V substitution, in particular, would create steric clash with the isoleucine side-chain of JA-Ile or the ethyl group attached to the cyclopropane moiety of COR (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the flexibility of the isoleucine side-chain of JA-Ile would likely allow for its readjustment to fit the mutated ligand-binding pocket, whereas the rigidity of the ethyl-cyclopropane group of COR would not (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our in silico and structural modeling analyses suggest the possibility that mutating alanine to valine at position 384 may result in a ligand-binding pocket that is more unfavorable to the chemical structure of COR than that of JA-Ile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_Amino_Acid_Substitutions_at_Positions_86_and_384_on_JA-Ile_CORDependent_Formation_of_the_COI1-JAZ9_Coreceptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that mutating A384 or A86 may create a ligand-binding pocket that is more unfavorable to COR than to that of JA-Ile, we first substituted these two alanine residues with the corresponding residues found in lower plant species P. patens and S. moellendorffii (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the following COI1 mutants were generated: COI1A86I, COI1A86V, COI1A384I, COI1A384S, and COI1A384V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative liquid Y2H assays revealed that both COI1A86I and COI1A86V abolished JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction, and reduced COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated that A86 is critical for the action of both JA-Ile and COR, albeit more critical for JA-Ile than COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Substitutions at position 384 exhibited more diverse effects than those at position 86 on JA-Ile/CORdependent COI1JAZ9 interaction (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COI1A384I disrupted both JA-Ile and COR-dependent interaction, whereas COI1A384S only reduced JA-Iledependent interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most interestingly, COI1A384V greatly reduced COR-dependent interaction, but had less effect on JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that 10 M JA-Ile, which contains a mixture of active and inactive isomers of JA-Ile, was equivalent to 0.1 M pure COR in promoting the COI1JAZ9 interaction in yeast (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We made seven additional substitutions at A384 to determine whether these substitutions would have an effect similar to that of COI1A384V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these seven substitutions (representing different types of side-chains), A384C reduced, and A384D, A384G, A384L, A384N, A384P, and A384T completely disrupted JA-Ile and COR-dependent interaction (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, no additional substitutions affected COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction more than JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, through extensive mutagenesis efforts we succeeded in identifying a specific amino acid substitution, A384V, in the JA-Ile binding pocket that preferably affects COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction, compared with JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transgenic_Arabidopsis_Plants_Expressing_COI1A384V_Are_Fertile_but_Exhibit_Differential_Sensitivities_to_Methyl_Jasmonate_and_COR_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the physiological relevance of the results from Y2H assays, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants (in coi1-30null mutant background) that express COI1A384V from the COI1 native promoter (pCOI1:COI1A384V-4xc-Myc; COI1A384V hereafter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, we also generated transgenic lines that express wild-type COI1 in the coi1-30 background (pCOI1:COI1WT-4xc-Myc; COI1WT hereafter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we determined whether COI1A384V complements the male sterile phenotype in coi1-30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JA is essential for male fertility and coi1 mutants are male sterile (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Y2H results showing that COI1A384V maintained substantial JA-Ile interaction, 83% of COI1A384V lines (10 of 12 lines analyzed) were fertile (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four fertile COI1A384V lines were randomly chosen for protein expression analysis and all were found to produce the c-Myctagged COI1A384V protein (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No fertility penalty was detected in COI1A384V plants, as judged by the number of developed siliques and the number of seeds per silique, which are similar to wild-type plants (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we performed COI1JAZ9 pull-down experiments to compare the responsiveness of plant-expressed COI1WT and COI1A384V proteins to serial concentrations of JA-Ile and COR using Escherichia coli-expressed JAZ9 protein, following the procedure reported previously (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments confirmed that a much higher (100-fold) concentration of COR was required for robust formation of the COI1A384VJAZ9 coreceptor than for the COI1WTJAZ9 coreceptor, whereas similar concentrations of JA-Ile were needed to promote the formation of the COI1A384VJAZ9 and COI1WTJAZ9 coreceptors (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we conducted further analyses with two representative COI1A384V lines, L1 and L2, to determine their responses to JA- or COR-induced root growth inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doseresponse experiments showed that the effect of 10 M methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is converted to the active form JA-Ile in planta, was equivalent to that of 0.2 M COR in wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig 3C and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike wild-type Col-0 plants, the root growth inhibition of COI1A384V plants was significantly less sensitive to 0.2 M COR than to 10 M MeJA (Fig 3C and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potency of 0.2 M COR in inhibiting root growth in COI1A384V plants was comparable to 0.1 M MeJA, indicating 100-fold less effectiveness of 0.2 M COR in COI1A384V than in Col-0 and COI1WT (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were consistent with the differential effects of the A384V substitution on JA-Ile vs. COR-dependent formation of the COI1JAZ9 coreceptor observed in both Y2H and COI1JAZ9 coreceptor pull-down assays, and confirmed that COI1A384V transgenic plants are differentially sensitive to MeJA vs. COR in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transgenic_Arabidopsis_Plants_Expressing_COI1A384V_Exhibit_Differential_Expression_of_JA_Response_Marker_Genes_in_Response_to_MeJA_vs_COR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined JA response gene expression in COI1A384V transgenic plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, the expression of the JA-responsive marker gene JAZ9 was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, JAZ9 gene expression was induced in Col-0 and COI1WT plants after MeJA or COR application (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In COI1A384V lines, however, JAZ9 gene expression in response to COR treatment was significantly reduced compared with Col-0 or COI1WT plants, whereas JAZ9 expressions in response to MeJA treatment was less affected in this same comparison (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in COI1A384V L1, MeJA treatment induced the expression of JAZ9 by 38-fold compared with that in coi1-30 plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, induction of JAZ9 gene expression in COI1A384V L1 was only eightfold higher than that in coi1-30 plants after COR treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the conclusion that the A384V substitution greatly affects the action of COR, while maintaining JA signaling required for substantial JA response gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the expression of SA-responsive genes PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1 (PR1) and SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (SID2) in COI1A384V plants and found that PR1 and SID2 gene expression were similarly low in Col-0, COI1WT and COI1A384V plants (Fig S5), indicating that the SA signaling pathway remained quiescent in COI1A384V plants, as in Col-0 and COI1WT plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

COI1A384V_Transgenic_Plants_Gained_Resistance_to_Pst_DC3000_and_Psm_ES4326__While_Maintaining_High-Level_Defense_Against_Chewing_Insects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analyses so far suggested that we might have succeeded in engineering a modified JA receptor that substantially uncouples endogenous hormone signaling from pathogen hijacking via COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, we expected that the COI1A384V transgenic plants would gain resistance to COR-producing bacterial pathogens, while retaining substantial defense against chewing insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we conducted bioassays using Pst DC3000 and Psm ES4326, two well-known COR-producing hemibiotrophic pathogens that infect Arabidopsis (41, 42), and Spodoptera exigua, a generalist chewing insect that is susceptible to COI1-dependent defenses in Arabidopsis (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, Col-0 and COI1WT plants were highly susceptible to Pst DC3000 (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COI1A384V plants, however, exhibited significantly increased resistance to Pst DC3000, as evidenced by greatly reduced bacterial growth and disease symptoms (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitatively, Pst DC3000 populations in COI1A384V lines were 254- to 42-fold lower than those in Col-0 plants and 189- to 31-fold lower than those in COI1WT transgenic plants (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, COI1A384V plants exhibited significantly increased resistance to Psm ES4326 compared with wild-type Col-0 or COI1WT plants (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments showed that coi1-30 plants were highly resistant to both pathogens in these assays (Fig 4 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we conducted disease assays using Pst DC3118 and DB29, which are mutants of Pst DC3000 defective in COR production (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar levels of bacterial growth were observed in Col-0, COI1WT, and COI1A384V plants, suggesting that the gained resistance in COI1A384V plants to Pst DC3000 was largely COR-dependent (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we performed insect feeding assays using S. exigua neonate larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, S. exigua grew much more slowly on Col-0 plants than on coi1-30 mutant plants (Fig 5), consistent with previous reports (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average weight of larvae feeding on coi1-30 plants was sixfold higher than larvae reared on COI1WT plants and fivefold higher than those grown on COI1A384V plants (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, COI1A384V plants maintained an almost wild-type level of defense against S. exigua.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Supplemental_Description_of_Results_of_Alanine_Scanning_Mutagenesis_of_the_COI1_Protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted targeted alanine substitution mutagenesis of the COI1 protein to identify amino acid residues that might differentially affect the actions of JA-Ile vs. COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the onset of this study, the crystal structure of the COI1JAZ coreceptor was not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the crystal structure of the TIR1-AUX/IAA [for TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)-AUXIN/INDOLE 3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA)] coreceptor involved in the perception of the plant hormone auxin was available (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Auxin and JA signaling pathways are highly analogous in hormone sensing and response (17, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, comparative genomic analysis suggested that auxin and JA signaling pathways may have originated from a common ancestor that duplicated and diverged into TIR1 and COI1 for different hormone signaling pathways (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized at the time that the ligand-binding surfaces in COI1 would be similarly positioned as those in TIR1, and that key differences in these conserved residues might confer specificity to the differential recognition of the respective ligands (i.e., JA-Ile/COR vs. auxin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this initial criterion, 32 amino acids were selected for site-direct mutagenesis to alanine (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y2H assays showed that 56% (18 of 32) of the alanine substitution mutants abolished COR-dependent interaction between COI1 and JAZ9 (Fig S1A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the 18 residues were mapped to the crystal structure of the COI1JAZ1 coreceptor, which became available later (36), 12 were found to make contacts with ligand, Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 (InsP5) or JAZ1 in the ligand-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of COI1JAZ1 coreceptor also shows several additional amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket, which could contribute to the interactions between COI1-ligand, COI1JAZ, and COI1 interaction with InsP5 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore selected 10 additional amino acids for site-directed mutagenesis to alanine (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y2H assays showed that three alanine substitutions, Y302A, R326A, and Y444A, disrupted the COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a total of 21 COI1 residues were identified to be important for COR-induced formation of the COI1JAZ coreceptor complex in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether substitutions that affected COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction differentially affect JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction, we conducted quantitative liquid Y2H assays with 10 alanine substitutions for the amino acids contacting directly with JA-Ile (36) (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that: (i) seven alanine substitutions disrupted both JA-Ile and COR-dependent COI1JAZ9 interaction, (ii) R409A substitution exhibited reduced COI1JAZ9 interaction in the presence of JA-Ile or COR, and (iii) the R85A and R496A substitutions affect JA-Iledependent interaction more than COR-dependent interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No substitution was found to disrupt only COR-dependent interaction and still maintain JA-Iledependent COI1JAZ9 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore strengthen the notion that COR is a remarkable mimic of JA-Ile and that most, if not all, of COI1 residues that are important for the action of JA-Ile are also important for COR action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the past decade, numerous host targets of bacterial, fungal, oomycete, and nematode virulence factors have been identified, representing major advances in our understanding of plantmicrobe interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this fundamental knowledge has largely not yet been exploited to inhibit disease development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COR was one of the first bacterial virulence factors of which the host target was clearly identified (7, 13, 15) and its molecular action on the host target (the JA receptor) was elucidated at the crystal structural level (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, guided by the crystal structure of the JA receptor, we identified a single amino acid substitution (A384V) in the JA-binding pocket of the COI1 protein that greatly reduces Arabidopsis sensitivity to COR and confers substantial resistance of Arabidopsis to COR-producing Pst DC3000 and Psm ES4326.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration for the feasibility of making a simple modification to a host target as a promising new approach to counter pathogen virulence, thus expanding the range of pathogens that a plant can defend against.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The COR toxin is produced not only by P. syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tomato and P. syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  maculicola, but also P. syringae pvs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  atropurpurea, glycinea, morsprunorum, and porri, which collectively infect a wide range of plants, including ryegrass, soybean, crucifers, cherry, plum, leeks, and tomato (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, production of COR/COR-like compounds has been reported beyond the P. syringae species, including Pseudomonas cannabina pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  alisalensis, Streptomyces scabies, and Xanthomonas campestris pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  phormiicola (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, gene clusters for COR biosynthesis have been found in Pseudomonas savastanoi pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  glycinea and Pectobacterium atrosepticum (syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erwinia carotovora subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  atroseptica) (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, transposon insertion mutants of coronafacic acid-like polyketide phytotoxin gene clusters in P. atrosepticum were shown to have reduced pathogen virulence (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains to be determined whether these COR-like toxins target the COI1JAZ coreceptor for their virulence activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, modification of COI1 at A384 or other residues in the JA binding pocket could represent a broadly applicable approach to improve plant resistance to diverse pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because of the simplicity of constructing amino acid substitutions, generation of COI1A384V plants seems particularly amenable through CRISPR-mediated genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our study is focused on uncoupling JA signaling from COR toxin action, recent studies have shown that the JA receptor is also a host target of proteinaceous effectors delivered into the host cell by bacterial pathogens and fungal symbionts (3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, P. syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  syringae, which is not known to produce COR or COR-like toxins, delivers the effector protein HopZ1a to acetylate and induce JAZ protein degradation, thereby activating JA signaling (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. syringae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tabaci, which also does not produce COR or COR-like toxins, delivers the effector protein HopX1 into the host cell to interact with and degrade JAZ via its cysteine protease activity (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Laccaria bicolor fungal effector protein MiSSP7 (mycorrhiza-induced small secreted protein 7) interacts with the host Populus PtJAZ6 protein and inhibits JA-induced degradation of PtJAZ6 to promote symbiosis (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the COI1JAZ coreceptor has emerged as a common host target for diverse effector proteins of pathogens and symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study to elucidate how these effector proteins modify JAZ proteins could guide future efforts to develop JAZ-based modifications to counter pathogen virulence and enhance beneficial symbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, innovative methods may be developed to disrupt the interaction between JAZs and HopZ1a/HopX1 or to block proteolytic degradation of JAZ proteins by HopZ1a/HopX1 as means of protecting plants from pathogen hijacking of the JA receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together with a recent demonstration of ABA receptor engineering against abiotic stress (50), our study illustrates that fundamental insights into the plant hormone receptors could indeed lead to innovative methods to manipulate plant hormone receptor signaling with the ultimate goal of improving plant growth and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments reported in this work were performed three or more times with similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For computer modeling, coordinates for JA-Ile or COR were obtained from the crystal structures of COI1JA-Ile/CORJAZ degron peptide complex (PDB ID codes 3OGL and 3OGK, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Y2H and in planta assays, we standardize the relative potencies of different ligands used (COR, MeJA, and JA-Ile) before a new set of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the limited amounts of JA-Ile available for this study, we used other forms of JA if the use of JA-Ile was not absolutely needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, MeJA can be converted to JA-Ile in planta and is commonly used in the study of JA signaling (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used MeJA, instead of JA-Ile, for in planta assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for Y2H experiments we used JA-Ile, because JA or MeJA are not active in yeast (12, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed procedures for gene cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, protein and RNA analyses, production of transgenic Arabidopsis, and assays for root inhibition, proteinprotein interaction, disease susceptibility, and insect resistance can be found in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S3 for gene identifiers of the COI1 genes in seven plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Coordinates for JA-Ile or COR were obtained from the crystal structures of COI1JA-Ile/CORJAZ degron peptide complex (PDB ID codes 3OGL and 3OGK, respectively) and the hydrogen atoms were added using xleap module in the Ambertools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force field parameters and charges were derived using Antechamber module and GAFF in Ambertools (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force field ff99SB was used to represent the molecular mechanical potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system consisting of COR or JA-Ile along with COI1 and part of the JAZ degron peptide were minimized in two stages using a combination of steepest descent (15,000 steps) and conjugated gradient (5,000 steps) methods (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong positional restraint (20 kcal/mole) was applied on all protein and ligand heavy atoms during the first stage of minimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteinligand complex was minimized again in the second stage, without any positional restraint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico mutations for A86 and A384 were introduced in COI1 using Pymol (DeLano Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The coding sequences of AtCOI1 and AtJAZ9 were amplified from total mRNA extract of Arabidopsis Col-0 leaf tissue and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid or pENTR-D TOPO Gateway entry vector (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific mutations were introduced into the AtCOI1 coding sequence directly through the QuickChangeII site directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Y2H assays, we first converted the bait and prey vectors pGILDA and pB42AD (Clontech) Gateway cloning-compatible pGILDAattR and pB42ADattR by inserting an attR cassette (Life Technologies) into their multiple cloning sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the wild-type and mutated COI1 coding sequences in the entry vector were recombined into pGILDAattR using LR ClonaseII (Life Technologies) to generate C-terminal fusions to the LexA DNA binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JAZ9 coding sequences were recombined into pB42ADattR to generate C-terminal fusions to the B42 transcriptional activation domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For plant transformation, the AtCOI1 without stop codon was first cloned into pENTR4A to create pENCOI1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the native promoter of AtCOI1 (pCOI1; a genomic DNA fragment 1,807 bp upstream of the COI1 start codon) was cloned into pENCOI1C to create a pENpCOI1:COI1 entry vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COI1A384V was introduced into this vector to create pENpCOI1:COI1A384V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pCOI1:COI1WT and pCOI1:COI1A384V were recombined into pGWB516 vector (containing a hygromycin resistance gene and a C-terminal 4× c-Myc epitope tag) (55) using LR ClonaseII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirmed constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) by electroporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Y2H_for_ProteinProtein_Interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast EGY48 strain carrying the p8Op:LacZ reporter plasmid was cotransformed with pGilda:COI1 (or COI1 mutants) and pB42AD:JAZ9 (or other JAZs) (Clontech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies were selected on SD minimal plates (BD Biosciences) supplemented with the -uracil (U)/-tryptophan (W)/-histidine (H) amino acid drop out solution (Clontech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast colonies were cultured overnight in liquid SD-UWH medium, harvested, washed twice in sterile water, and adjusted OD600 to 0.2 in liquid SD galactose/raffinose-UWH medium (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Y2H on plates, 10-L culture was spotted onto SD galactose/raffinose-UWH plates with 80 g/mL X-gal and 10 M COR (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue color indicated proteinprotein interactions after 57 d 30 °C incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For liquid Y2H assay, cultures were supplemented with designated concentrations of JA-Ile (10 or 30 M), COR (1 M), or DMSO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 16-h incubation with ligands, the liquid cultures were processed through the Beta-Glo Assay system (Promega) for detecting the -galactosidase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JA-Ile stock consists of cis- and trans-isomers, the cis-form being more active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial chemical analysis showed 6.8% of the cis-form after synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein expression in yeast was detected using anti-LexA antibody (1:5,000; Upstate Biotechnology) for detection of COI1 expression from pGilda vector and anti-HA (1:5,000; Roche Life Science) antibody for detection of JAZ9 expression in pB42AD vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arabidopsis_Transformation_and_Screening  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
pCOI1:COI1WT/A384V-4xc-Myc constructs were transformed into coi1-30 mutant Arabidopsis plants (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because homozygous coi1-30 plants are male-sterile, heterozygous plants were identified through genotyping and used for A. tumefaciens-mediated Arabidopsis transformation (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 50 g/mL hygromycin were used to select transgenic T1 seedlings containing pCOI1:COI1WT/A384V-4xc-Myc transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hygromycin-resistant seedlings were transplanted and genotyping was carried out to determine transgenic plants with the homozygous coi1-30 background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further screening of T2 or T3 plants were performed for homozygous transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers used were: SALK035548_LP1, CGAATAAATCACACAGCTTATTGG, SALK035548_RP1, GATATGGTTCTTTGTACAACGACG, LBb1.3, ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC, SALK035548_RP, CTGCAGTGTGTAACGATGCTC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Root_Growth_Inhibition_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Col-0, segregating coi1-30, transgenic COI1WT, and COI1A384V seeds were surface-sterilized, cold-stratified, and germinated on half-strength MS agar media containing MeJA, COR, or DMSO with indicated concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedlings were grown under long-day light conditions (16-h light, 100 µEm2s and 8-h dark) for 1012 d before scanning images of roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root lengths were measured using ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Infection_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Pseudomonas syringae infection assays in Arabidopsis were performed as described previously (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, 4- to 5-wk-old (12-h light/12-h dark) Arabidopsis plants were dip-inoculated with bacterial suspension (1 × 108 cfu/mL Pst DC3000 or Psm ES4326 in 0.25 mM MgCl2 solution with 0.025% Silwet-77) or syringe-infiltrated with bacterial suspension (1 × 106 cfu/mL Pst DC3118 or DB29 in 0.25 mM MgCl2 solution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial growth was determined by serial dilutions of plant extracts 3 or 4 d after inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous coi1-30 plants were selected by genotyping before bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insect_Feeding_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insect bioassays were performed as described previously (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, four neonate Spodoptera exigua larvae were transferred to the center of each 6-wk-old Arabidopsis host plant, grown under 8-h light (100 Em2s) and 16-h dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggs of S. exigua were obtained from Benzon Research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were covered with cup cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larval weights were determined after 912 d of feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
