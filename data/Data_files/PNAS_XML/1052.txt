ATM and ATR play complementary roles in the behavior of excitatory and inhibitory vesicle populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The symptoms of neurological diseases such as autism and schizophrenia are often attributed to a loss of excitatory/inhibitory balance of neural network function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By showing that ATR and ATM impact inhibitory and excitatory vesicle trafficking differently, our work expands the known repertoire of cytoplasmic functions for the two kinases and provides a new perspective on the origins of the symptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Seckel syndrome (ATM and ATR deficiency, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these findings have their most immediate implications for the neurologic and cognitive symptoms of A-T and Seckel syndrome, they have potential relevance to a much broader range of neurologic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) are large PI3 kinases whose human mutations result in complex syndromes that include a compromised DNA damage response (DDR) and prominent nervous system phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both proteins are nuclear-localized in keeping with their DDR functions, yet both are also found in cytoplasm, including on neuronal synaptic vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ATM- or ATR-deficient neurons, spontaneous vesicle release is reduced, but a drop in ATM or ATR level also slows FM4-64 dye uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this, both proteins bind to AP-2 complex components as well as to clathrin, suggesting roles in endocytosis and vesicle recycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two proteins play complementary roles in the DDR; ATM is engaged in the repair of double-strand breaks, while ATR deals mainly with single-strand damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, this complementarity extends to these proteins synaptic function as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superresolution microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation reveal that ATM associates exclusively with excitatory (VGLUT1+) vesicles, while ATR associates only with inhibitory (VGAT+) vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of ATM and ATR respond to each other; when ATM is deficient, ATR levels rise, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, blocking NMDA, but not GABA, receptors causes ATM levels to rise while ATR levels respond to GABA, but not NMDA, receptor blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data suggest that ATM and ATR are part of the cellular infrastructure that maintains the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea has important implications for the human diseases resulting from their genetic deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ATM_or_ATR_Loss_Causes_Synaptic_Deficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured synaptic density by analyzing the number of immunostained puncta of the presynaptic protein Bassoon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the density of synapses in Atm/ neuronal cultures was 3040% less than that found in wild type (WT) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined the rate of spontaneous FM4-64 dye release from individual puncta along the fine processes of the neuronal dendrites (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dye release was significantly slower from puncta on Atm/ cultured neurons (Fig 1C), confirming and extending previous observations that examined only release from the cell body (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we normalized our dye release data to the initial levels of dye loading (Fig 1C), the slower release was likely not caused solely by the reduced synaptic density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ATM is necessary for the maintenance of normal synaptic density and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next showed that the loss of ATR had similar effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATR also colocalized with VAMP2 (Fig 1D), and after Atr knockdown with Atr-shRNA, spontaneous release of FM4-64 dye was significantly reduced (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found only a nonsignificant decrease of synaptic density in Atr knockdown neurons, however, perhaps because shRNA did not totally eliminate ATR protein (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATM_and_ATR_Protein_Levels_Show_a_Reciprocal_Relationship  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since ATR and ATM are closely related kinases, we asked whether each could compensate for a deficiency of the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated ATR protein levels by immunohistochemistry (Fig 2A) and Western blot analysis (Fig 2C) in the cortex of two different Atm mutants (Awb or Bal homozygotes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both genotypes, we found a nearly threefold increase in ATR protein levels (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse experiment is difficult, since Atr KO mice are embryonic-lethal; thus, we used HEK293T cells transfected with Atm-shRNA or Atr-shRNA as our assay system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 48 h after transfection, ATR levels increased following Atm knockdown (Fig 2 D and E) and ATM protein increased after Atr knockdown, thus identifying a reciprocal feedback relationship (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked whether the activity of the neuronal network itself might dynamically regulate ATM or ATR levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated WT neuronal cultures with l-glutamate and found a significant decrease of ATM protein after 4 h, along with a corresponding increase in ATR (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, neurons treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist D-CPP-ene showed higher ATM and VGLUT1 protein levels (Fig 2 F and G), while treatment with the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline led to higher neuronal ATR and VGAT protein levels (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ATM responds primarily to changes in the activity of excitatory neurons, while ATR responds mostly to changes in the activity of inhibitory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATM_or_ATR_Deficiency_Leads_to_E_I_Imbalance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We immunostained cortical neuronal cultures established from WT (Atm+/+) and Bal mice (both Atm+/ and Atm/) using VGLUT1 or VGAT antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of VGLUT1+ neuronal cell bodies was significantly smaller in the homozygous mutant cultures and trended lower in the heterozygote cultures (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend these observations in the cell soma, we quantified VGLUT1 and VGAT puncta in the dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 50% fewer VGLUT1+ puncta in the neuropil of Atm/ cultures (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in Atm/ cultures, while VGLUT1 puncta were seen along the main dendritic branches, the finer dendritic branches were nearly blank (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although VGLUT1+ was decreased in Atm/ cultures, VGAT+ cell bodies and synaptic puncta were both increased in heterozygous cultures and even more so in homozygous cultures (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly identical results were achieved with the independent GABAergic neuron marker GAD65 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these percentages, we estimated E/I ratios of approximately 1.5 in WT, 1.0 in heterozygote, and 0.67 in Atm/ cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether the reduced E/I balance was due to an intrinsic shift in the identity of the ATM-deficient neurons, or whether E/I regulation by ATM was more dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Atm shRNA-transfected neurons had higher VGAT (green) and lower VGLUT1 (red) expression levels compared with scrambled shRNA controls (Fig 3E and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification revealed an almost 1:1 ratio of VGLUT1 to VGAT staining in WT neuronal soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ratio decreased to 0.5:1 by just 48 h after Atm knockdown (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ATM helps maintain the E/I balance of a culture, and does so in a dynamic fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With ATR, the findings were reversed, with an increase in the E/I ratio after ATR knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT neurons transfected with Atr shRNA showed decreased VGAT signals in both cell bodies (Fig 3I and Fig S3C) and at synapses (Fig 3G), but increased VGLUT1, compared with control shRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the excitatory (VGLUT1) or inhibitory (VGAT) signals from both cell bodies (Fig 3J) and synapses (Fig 3H) clearly showed that loss of ATM protein decreases, while loss of ATR protein increases, the E/I ratio in cultured cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

E_I_Balance_Is_Independent_of_ATM_and_ATR_Kinase_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We treated cultured cortical neurons with the ATM inhibitor KU-60019 (1 M) or the ATR inhibitor VE-822 (0.5 M) for 48 h, then fixed and immunostained the cultures (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the inhibition of kinase activity, we found no significant difference in the VGLUT1/VGAT ratio (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, kinase inhibition did not alter synaptic density or cause individual synapses to assume dual functionality (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy revealed the same nonoverlapping pattern of VGLUT1 and VGAT immunostaining in treated and untreated cultures (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The densities of VGLUT1+ and VGAT+ synapses (puncta) were also comparable (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it appears that the E/I balance of a cell is independent of ATM and ATR kinase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synaptic_Vesicle_Endocytosis__but_Not_Release__Depends_on_ATM_ATR_Kinase_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the vesicle content of the synapses did not seem to be affected by ATM or ATR kinase activity, we asked whether synaptic function was altered in the presence of their kinase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that neither KU-60019 nor VE-822 had any effect on spontaneous dye release kinetics (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was in contrast to our earlier findings with Atm/ cells and with Atr shRNA-mediated protein knockdown (Fig 1 C and E), and suggests that the altered vesicle release properties might be a secondary consequence of a defect in vesicle recycling by endocytosis and an altered releasable pool of vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we measured the uptake of FM4-64 dye into synaptic regions of cultures treated with KU-60019 or VE-822.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of either inhibitor, we observed reduced dye uptake capacity (Fig 4B and Fig S4E), consistent with a deficiency in the endocytic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recycling occurs in PI-rich membrane regions, we also measured phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] levels with the GFP-C1-PLCdelta-PH fluorescent biosensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atm/ neurons showed reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, especially in synaptic regions (Fig 4C), which would be expected to impair vesicle endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither KU-60019 nor VE-822 decreased the overall intensity of signal from the GFP-C1-PLCdelta-PH reporter (Fig 4 D and E), but the intensity of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in synaptic regions was significantly decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The picture that emerges from these data is that ATM/ATR kinase activities regulate synaptic endocytosis by regulating PtdIns(4,5)P2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the first ATM-interacting proteins identified was -adaptin (18, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with -adaptin and other subunits of the AP-2 complex, -adaptin plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that both ATM and ATR colocalized with -adaptin on vesicular structures (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined the role of clathrin, a major vesicular coat protein involved in endocytosis, and found that it also colocalized with both ATM and ATR (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using superresolution microscopy to increase our resolving power to 20 nm, it became clear that both -adaptin and clathrin colocalized with both ATM and ATR on vesicular structures with diameters of 60 nm (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a final confirmation, we performed immunoprecipitation from adult mouse brain cortical lysates using anti-ATM and anti-ATR antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots of these immunoprecipitates probed with antibodies against -adaptin confirmed the direct physical interaction between both ATM and ATR in the mouse brain (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We probed replicate blots with -adaptin as well as clathrin, and found that both of these endocytosis-related proteins were also strongly associated with ATR and ATM (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, ATM protein associations have been studied mostly in peripheral tissues (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the situation in the nervous system, we analyzed ATM immunoprecipitates from whole mouse brain by mass spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found several known ATM-interacting synaptic vesicle proteins, such as VAMP2, as well as several new candidates, including syntaxin, synaptojanin, and synaptotagmin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the  and  subunits of the AP-2 complex, the  subunit was also identified as an ATM-interacting protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control for antibody specificity, none of the foregoing proteins were found in the control pulldowns from Atm/ brain lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ATM and ATR are physically associated with many of the proteins involved in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATR_Associates_with_a_Wider_Range_of_Vesicles_than_ATM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown previously (19, 20), ATM colocalizes with VAMP2+ vesicles in both conventional (Fig 1D) and superresolution microscopy (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second anti-ATM antibody (Y170) showed a similar colocalization pattern with VAMP2 (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used immunoelectron microscopy to validate these findings and found clear labeling of synaptic vesicles in WT mice (Fig 6B, Upper), but not in Atm/ mice (Fig 6B, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our EM study, we noticed that the synaptic vesicles in the EM images of Atm KO synapses appeared larger than those seen in the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of vesicular size in the two genotypes confirmed this difference (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implications of this finding are discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with ATM, we found that ATR also closely associated with VAMP2+ 60-nm vesicular structures in superresolution localization microscopy (SRLM) images (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike ATM (Fig S5B), however, ATR immunostaining was also found associated with larger vesicular structures surrounding chromogranin A (CgA), a cargo protein typically found in large dense-core vesicles (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps because of this dual localization, we found that, unlike ATM, ATR was located in close proximity to presynaptic proteins, such as VAMP2 (Fig 6A) and Bassoon (Fig S5D), as well as to postsynaptic proteins, such as PSD95 (Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified these observations using two-color SRLM (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no substantial presynaptic/postsynaptic difference in ATR localization (Fig 6E), in contrast to ATM, which was located significantly closer to Piccolo (presynaptic)- than to Homer1 (postsynaptic)-labeled vesicular structures (Fig 6 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that while ATM is predominately presynaptic, the distribution of ATR is broader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that CgA is highly expressed in GABAergic neurons (31), and that dense-core CgA-containing vesicles are usually located away from the synaptic active zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This predicts that some fraction of the vesicle-bound ATR protein would be located at a distance from the synaptic active zone, and perhaps explains the lack of ATR-Bassoon association (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATM_and_ATR_Associate_with_Different_Synaptic_Vesicle_Populations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ATM is expressed in neuron cultures in which both excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be found (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In glutamate-containing excitatory synapses, synaptic vesicles load their neurotransmitter with the transporter protein, VGLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GABA-containing inhibitory synapses, synaptic vesicles are loaded with GABA using VGAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, SRLM imaging of the synaptic regions of neuronal culture revealed that both VGLUT1 and VGAT stained vesicular structures (Fig S6A) and were never found colocalized on a single vesicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, ATM and VGLUT1 regularly double-immunostained vesicles (Fig 7A, Lower), but surprisingly, ATM never colocalized with VGAT+ vesicles (Fig 7A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more surprisingly, SRLM imaging revealed that ATR stained in an exactly complementary pattern; it was localized with VGAT+, but not VGLUT1+, vesicles (Fig 7B, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SRLM images of ATM, VAMP2, and ATR triple-staining showed that ATM-VAMP2 double-positive vesicles were not colocalized with vesicular ATR-VAMP2 structures (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we immunoprecipitated ATM or ATR from WT mouse cortical lysates and analyzed the precipitates by Western blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATM antibody was able to pull down VGLUT1, but not VGAT, from the lysates (Fig 7C), In contrast, the ATR immunoprecipitates labeled robustly with VGAT, but not with VGLUT1 (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blotting with anti-VAMP2 antibody showed positive signals from both ATM and ATR immunoprecipitates (Fig 7C), consistent with previously reported data (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ATM is located in association with excitatory vesicles, while ATR is associated with inhibitory vesicles, consistent with their differential effects on the E/I balance in our cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore whether these associations required kinase activity, 19 days in vitro (DIV) cortical neurons were treated with KU-60019 or VE-822 for 48 h, then fixed and double-immunolabeled with either ATM-VGLUT1 or ATR-VGAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed no significant change in either the colocalization of ATM with VGLUT1 (Fig 7D) or the colocalization of ATR with VGAT in the presence of either inhibitor (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinase inhibitors did alter the quantitative aspects of these physical associations, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both KU-60019 and VE-822 led to a decrease in the total levels of VGLUT1 protein and an increase in the levels of VGAT (Fig 7F, input panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, both KU-60019 and VE-822 enhanced the interaction between ATM with VGLUT1 but decreased the interaction between ATR and VGAT (Fig 7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the specificity of the interaction appears unaltered, the strength of the VGLUT1 and VGAT associations appears to be negatively regulated by the inhibition of ATM and ATR kinase activity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results reported here deepen the appreciation of the role of ATM and ATR in CNS function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both kinases play a role in synaptic vesicle recycling and have complementary roles in excitatory and inhibitory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ATR is specifically localized to inhibitory, but not excitatory, neuronal vesicles, while ATM has the reverse pattern, present on excitatory vesicles but absent on inhibitory vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complementarity of ATM and ATR in the synapse is reminiscent of their relationship in the DNA damage response, where ATM responds primarily to double-strand breaks while ATR is mostly responsive to single-strand breaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in both nucleus and cytoplasm, ATM and ATR support each other in the service of an important cellular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the synapse, the ATM-ATR complementarity is made even more meaningful by our finding that the levels of the two proteins appear to be in a dynamic balance with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deficiency of either ATM or ATR leads to a compensatory increase in the level of the other protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other laboratories have examined the interplay of ATR and ATM, but almost always from the standpoint of activity (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), not protein levels as we have done here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compensation in the brain that we describe occurs rapidly and thus can quickly influence the E/I balance of neuronal networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E/I balance then feeds back into the ATM-ATR relationship, as demonstrated by our finding that altering neuronal activity can also affect the levels of both ATM and ATR proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggestion of a dynamic interplay between the ATM/ATR ratio and neuronal activity is in full agreement with a recent report showing that reduced levels of ATM in mouse hippocampus, both in vivo and in vitro, shift the E/I balance toward a more inhibitory tone (33), which we believe was due to a complementary increase in ATR levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, through their differential involvement with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic vesicles, ATM and ATR may form a part of their identity and guide their differential trafficking dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence suggests that E/I imbalance is highly related to neural network dysfunctions, such as epilepsy, anxiety, disorders and memory impairment (2123, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to cerebellar degeneration, some patients with A-T also show degeneration in brain regions, such as the motor cortex (35), and suffer from both cerebellar and noncerebellar cognitive deficits (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings thus provide a valuable new perspective on the multivalent neurologic phenotype of A-T. Our work also predicts that ATR deficiency should cause an opposite response in the brain, namely an increased E/I ratio (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are rudimentary in this regard, as complete ATR deficiency leads to embryonic lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, patients with Seckel syndrome (10, 13, 14) have reduced ATR levels, and in addition to developmental problems such as microcephaly, some individuals reportedly experience epileptic seizures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased E/I ratio has been reported in epilepsy (34, 38), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the epilepsy observed in patients with Seckel syndrome may be due in part to an increased E/I balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The association of ATM and ATR with subunits of the AP-2 complex as well as with clathrin indicates their possible roles in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies (18, 27) had hinted at this type of relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -adaptin is a member of the AP-2 complex that plays a major role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Atm/ neurons show decreased FM4-64 dye release rates in vitro, we found that inhibition of ATM kinase activity in WT neurons had no effect, even while kinase inhibition significantly compromised dye uptake (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings imply that impaired dye release may reflect a more primary defect in vesicle endocytosis and a smaller ready-release pool of vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of reduced numbers of presynaptic puncta in Atm/ neurons supports this suggestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This situation of reduced vesicle recycling causing problems in vesicle release is reminiscent of the deficiency of Tweek (39), a large Drosophila neuromuscular junction protein that was identified in a screen for mutants that could not maintain synaptic function during intense stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tweek is a large, evolutionarily conserved protein with little obvious domain structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, given that ATM and ATR are members of the PIKK family, Tweek was found to regulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 availability and levels at synapses, thereby regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atm KO neurons also showed reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane, especially at synapses (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deepening the analogy, synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminals of tweek flies are larger than those in WT flies, the same phenotype that we found in the neocortex of Atm KO mice (Fig 6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are many differences in the three proteins, these analogies open the possibility that ATM and ATR, perhaps through phosphoinositide, regulate synaptic vesicle recycling as their primary synaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, our work reveals roles of ATM and ATR beyond their function as DNA damage repair-related kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model (Fig 8), both proteins have important functions in synaptic vesicle trafficking, most likely in vesicle endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, their complementary roles in excitatory and inhibitory vesicles may provide important insights into the symptoms of A-T and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

After overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 30% sucrose in PBS for cryoprotection, each brain was embedded in Shandon Cryomatrix Frozen Embedding Medium (6769006; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then quickly frozen on dry ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then 10-m cryostat sections (CryoStar NX70; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were individually mounted on glass slides and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before immunostaining, brain slices were washed in PBS, placed in citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid/0.05% Tween20, pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 10 min, then cooled to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then incubated in 10% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature, followed by antibody staining and mounting procedures as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SRLM_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superresolution images were acquired with an SRLM system specially designed for the three-channel imaging of Alexa Fluor 561-, Alexa Fluor 647-, and Alexa Fluor 750-labeled samples (4446).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each superresolution image was reconstructed from a file containing 30,000 frames recorded at 33 Hz, during which time the dye molecules alternated between dark and bright states in TCEP-containing imaging buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting winking was used to calculate a 2D Gaussian distribution assumed to be centered on the location of a single dye molecule (sampled an average of 4,000 times).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moderate excitation laser intensities (4 kW/cm2 at 656 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 and 4.5 kW/cm2 at 750 nm for Alexa Fluor 750) were applied to minimize photo bleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final resolution was determined to be less_than20 nm in both channels based on average fitting error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active sample locking (44) was used to stabilize the sample with 1 nm-accuracy during imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transmission_Electron_Microscopy_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The procedures for sample preparation, thin sectioning, immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging were performed as described previously (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For high-pressure freezing, small pieces of dissected mouse brain were rapidly frozen in a high-pressure freezing machine (EM HPM100; Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin sections (70 nm) of the samples were cut on a UC7 Ultramicrotome (Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling was performed with primary antibodies against ATM (100 mg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding gold-coupled secondary antibodies were used at 1:50 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After immunogold labeling, the samples were poststained with aqueous uranyl acetate/lead citrate, and TEM images were captured on a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293T cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS plus penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary neurons were isolated as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA constructs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary neurons were transfected at 10 DIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 46 h after transfection, fresh culture medium was added, and the cells were incubated for another 48 h (HEK293T) or longer (primary neurons; 510 d) to allow recovery and construct expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For siRNA treatments, Atr-siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h, then harvested in RIPA buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoprecipitation__SDS_PAGE__and_Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured cells or isolated brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (EMD Millipore) with 1× PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then centrifuged for 20 min at 21,000 × g. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of total protein was incubated for 30 min with control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), precleared with 50 L of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen), then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were collected with DynaMag-2 magnets (Life Technologies) and washed three times, followed by elution in 50 L of 4× bromophenol blue dye with  mercaptoethanol as well as 150 L of RIPA buffer containing 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1× PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eluted proteins were subjected to 512% SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Western blot analysis, 40 g of protein was run on SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immuno-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, membranes were probed with primary antibodies and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico, Dura, or Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mass_Spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After immunoprecipitation, eluted proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lanes containing immunoprecipitated proteins were cut into four segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each segment was digested with trypsin and analyzed with an LTQ Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled to an Accela liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a nanoelectrospray ionization source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides and proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant version 13.0.5 with the Andromeda search engine, along with proteome discovery with Mascot and SEQUEST search engines (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS/MS spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot/National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and the taxonomy was set as mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search criteria were set as follows: trypsin digestion with two allowed missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation on cysteines as a fixed modification, and oxidation on methionine as a variable modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data were obtained from at least three independent preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantifications were performed in a blinded manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between groups were analyzed using the unpaired t test, one-way ANOVA, or multiple t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the difference of two predicted variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P value 0.05 was considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are reported as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
