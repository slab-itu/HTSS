Decoupling local mechanics from large-scale structure in modular metamaterials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The forward-design approach to mechanical metamaterials determines a structures properties after it is designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the inverse-design approach specifies parameter domains then optimizes a cost function to achieve a desired property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former approach guarantees a structure will exist but lacks the ability to prescribe function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter approach has prescribed function, but existence is not guaranteed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we trivialize these design challenges for metamaterials by decoupling local mechanical properties from the bulk structure, allowing both to be specified independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work introduces a design strategy that substantially advances the capacity to engineer mechanical metamaterials by specifically using modular units with more free design parameters than constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental strategy is explicitly demonstrated with an origami- and kirigami-inspired structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A defining feature of mechanical metamaterials is that their properties are determined by the organization of internal structure instead of the raw fabrication materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift of attention to engineering internal degrees of freedom has coaxed relatively simple materials into exhibiting a wide range of remarkable mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For practical applications to be realized, however, this nascent understanding of metamaterial design must be translated into a capacity for engineering large-scale structures with prescribed mechanical functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the challenge is to systematically map desired functionality of large-scale structures backward into a design scheme while using finite parameter domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such inverse design is often complicated by the deep coupling between large-scale structure and local mechanical function, which limits the available design space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce a design strategy for constructing 1D, 2D, and 3D mechanical metamaterials inspired by modular origami and kirigami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is to assemble a number of modules into a voxelized large-scale structure, where the modules design has a greater number of mechanical design parameters than the number of constraints imposed by bulk assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inequality allows each voxel in the bulk structure to be uniquely assigned mechanical properties independent from its ability to connect and deform with its neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studying specific examples of large-scale metamaterial structures we show that a decoupling of global structure from local mechanical function allows for a variety of mechanically and topologically complex designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is possible to conceive innumerable structures for metamaterial assembly that illustrate the general NpNc0 design strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To focus our efforts on a specific example, we designed a kirigami-inspired lantern-like pattern formed by cutting a thin sheet (Fig 1A, black outline), folding along the prescribed lines to form hinge-like creases (Fig 1A, pink dashed and solid lines), and bonding adjacent edges to form crease-like hinges (Fig 1A, e.g., BCD bonds BCD; 3D rendering shows the modules assembled form, SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutting and folding geometry is determined by angles ,, and lengths m,n, and q so that Np=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each assembled module has only a single kinematic DOF represented here by the dihedral angle  measured between planes BCFG and BCFG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this choice for the DOF is not unique,  conveniently varies from 0° to 360° when the module is designed with parameters that avoid self-intersection during folding (Fig 1B and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When constructed from rigid sheets that neither bend nor stretch the kirigami modules kinematics are fully determined by geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As  varies the structure simultaneously undergoes longitudinal and transverse deformations in its dimensions X(),Y(), and Z() (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these quantities we can calculate the Poisson ratios ZX and ZY, which are essentially the ratios of strain (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to taking values well beyond the 0 to 0.5 range found in most common materials, we found wide regions of parameter space for  and  as well as wide regions in configuration space  that supports two simultaneously negative Poisson ratios (Fig 1 CF and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the kinematic equations with a linear elastic energy expression reveals further useful properties for bulk metamaterial design (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we find the kirigami module can exhibit monostability or bistability depending on the parameter values for  and  (Fig 1 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig S4), which were experimentally confirmed in hand-folded models (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having shown the basic lantern-like kirigami module has a wide range of mechanical features, we shift to the more acute challenge of designing large-scale metamaterials with prescribed mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insights from modular origami art suggest large-scale metamaterials can be assembled by voxelizing the desired large-scale shape into cuboids and assembling the voxelized geometry from a collection of kirigami-inspired modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mechanical building blocks, we require each module to be geometrically compatible with its neighbors within design tolerances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the general case, this condition means voxels are able to freely deform without (i) colliding into their neighbors, (ii) separating from their neighbors, or (iii) experiencing geometric frustration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the specific example of the lantern-like kirigami module studied here, these conditions impose Nc=4 constraints for all  in the prescribed folding domain [a,b]: The dimensions X(),Y(), Z(), and the angle EDE must match for all voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first three constraints ensure voxels do not intersect during folding, and the fourth constraint ensures structures can be rigidly connected along the z^-axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the basic module has five independent design parameters, these four constraints imposed by bulk assembly leave NpNc=54=1 free parameter to choose mechanical properties of each voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, we picked a set of parameters for a target module (Fig 2 AC, gray module) and constructed two additional geometrically compatible modules with independently prescribed  (Fig 2 AC, orange and red modules).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining parameter values for these additional modules were found by calculating an error function () between the target and candidate geometries (Materials and Methods) and searching for optimal parameter values that minimize the integrated error s=abd over the design interval, which in this case was chosen to be [300°,360°].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subspace projection of the parameter landscape helps visualize the optimization and shows a local minimum representing optimal values for the dimensionless lengths m/q and n/q (Fig 2D, red star).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varying  to other prescribed values shifts this local minimum within the subspace, leading to different values for the optimized parameters (Fig 2E, points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, we found our method reliably produced geometric compatibility satisfying tight error tolerances within the prescribed folding domain (Fig 2E, Inset,  for 300360°) but that these same designs become incompatible outside the prescribed bounds (Fig 2E, Inset,  for less_than300°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach for designing geometrically compatible and mechanically distinct building blocks we now focus on voxelizing and assembling 1D, 2D, and 3D large-scale metamaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A simple metamaterial for experimentally validating geometric and mechanical predictions is a 1D chain of voxels aligned on the z^-axis (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fabricated these structures with one, two, and three voxels from thin sheets and measured their forcedisplacement relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data compared favorably with the simple energetic model predictions (Materials and Methods), and we generally found the results to be reproducible up to material-specific plastic deformations arising from multiple cycles of testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A notable exception between the model and data was observed when one voxel with large m, which was predicted to undergo a bistable transition, instead underwent two bistable transitions (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these data, we found the lower portion of the voxel hopped between bistable states as the strain increased, while the upper portion hopped between bistable states as further strain was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the energetic model is symmetric with respect to inversion along z^, the transitions of a voxels upper and lower sections between states 1 and 2 are predicted to occur simultaneously (Fig 1 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real materials and practical fabrication methods, however, introduce heterogeneities that break this symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a whole, these experiments generally show mechanical properties in voxelized 1D metamaterials can be predicted, prescribed, and designed, but nevertheless, experimental validation is still important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we use the NpNc0 design strategy to construct 2D bulk metamaterials, which by scaling up in dimension allows for greater mechanical and topological complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two examples we study mask bulk deformations of a large-scale structure using a target module with prescribed properties (Fig 3A) and geometrically compatible modules optimized to (i) neutralize bulk strain in the x^ direction (Fig 3B) and (ii) cloak a structural hole (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our first example, the 2D structure is voxelized into a series of 1D stripes alternating target and geometrically compatible modules (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When compressed along the z^-axis, the target modules -dependent Poisson ratio ZX is compensated for by the compatible module, whose Poisson ratio is optimized to be equal and opposite (Fig 3E, pink and gray lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collective effect is to allow for deformations along the z^-axis while neutralizing bulk strain along the x^-axis (Fig 3E, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the zero bulk Poisson ratio engineered into this structure is what makes cork useful as a bottle stopper; cork stoppers provide a tight transverse seal while still allowing for longitudinal motion in or out of the bottles opening (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our second example, a homogeneous 2D structure composed from the target module (Fig 3F) is structurally weakened with a hole (Fig 3G) and then reinforced with geometrically compatible modules (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the bulk properties, the original and reinforced structures have Youngs moduli of 8.1 kPa, whereas the weakened structure has a Youngs modulus 53% lower at 3.8 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this example, we optimized the free parameter of the reinforcing module to restore the initially prescribed bulk forcedisplacement relation to its original form (Fig 3I and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When probed with external loads, this new heterogeneous structure can function as a mechanical cloak by obscuring any contents placed in the hole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topological complexity can be greatly increased in large-scale 3D metamaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct such structures, we voxelize the x^y^-plane (Fig 4A) and stack along the z^-axis to create a cuboidal structure with all modules in the same orientation (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the 1D and 2D structures, this 3D voxelization of space is independent from the prescribed mechanical properties of the modules as long as geometric compatibility and NpNc0 are satisfied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a demonstrative example of what can be achieved with the same 4×7×4 cuboidal volume (Fig 4B), we chose three sets of parameters and calculated the respective Poisson ratios (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data illustrate how the same large-scale structure can have distinct mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For practical purposes, it is important to note the accuracy between a target 3D structure and a structure fabricated from finite-size voxels will be tunable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences, quantified by an error metric such as 3D (Methods and Materials), can be reduced by scaling down the voxel size relative to the target structure (Fig 4D, Inset), which produces a practical trade-off between structural accuracy and the total number of voxels needed for an application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully demonstrate the potential of the NpNc0 design strategy, we chose five large-scale 3D target structures including a sphere, three triply periodic minimal surfaces, and a micro-CT volumetric scan of mouse femur bone (Fig 4E, first row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We voxelized these structures, arbitrarily prescribed one set of mechanical properties on all modules involved, and calculated the various configurations as a function of  (Fig 4E, second and third rows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all of these 3D structures have identical kinematics, we see the decoupling of large-scale structure from local mechanical properties trivializes the design challenge of simultaneously achieving prescribed mechanical and topological complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The design principle for decoupling local mechanics and bulk structure in 1D, 2D, and 3D metamaterials introduced here broadly applies to all classes of metamaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, by working with a specific example of the lantern-like kirigami module we found a number of insights useful for any practical realization of the NpNc0 design strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if the fabrication material is brittle, it may be advantageous to design structures using a homogeneous set of modules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By ensuring all voxels in the metamaterial are identical the compressive behavior is always geometrically compatible and the risk of failure reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the fabrication material is pliable, then heterogeneous structures can activate additional bending or stretching DOF, offering greater design flexibility with less restrictive design tolerances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another consideration is what manufacturing approaches are practical for the structures introduced here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hand-crafted devices have an obviously limited throughput, but technologies such as 3D-printed self-folding polymers seem viable in light of recent demonstrations (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At much smaller scales, DNA self-assembly has been used to create folding structures where oligo hybridization is a means to form both thin sheets and hinge-like crease patterns (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at the nanoscale, there are opportunities to mass-produce self-assembled biocompatible mechanical metamaterials with these uniquely addressable building blocks (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Throughput aside, the strategy of decoupling large-scale structure from mechanical function by modular design reduces cooperative and collective effects, greatly simplifying the inverse-design problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By taking a tolerance-defined approach with finite parameter domains, we are able to generate geometric diagrams for bulk metamaterial structures using the lantern-like module (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These designs can be optimized to minimize failure, cost, or complexity while still faithfully reproducing the desired function in specific applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the future for this design strategy where the number of parameters for each module is greater than the number of constraints imposed by bulk assembly seems well-suited for a variety of applications in next-generation smart materials, tissue engineering scaffolds, or even deployable architectural elements (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Geometry_and_Mechanics_of_Kirigami_Lantern-Like_Module  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given a cutting and folding pattern (Fig 1A), where by definition =0, the kirigami module fits into a cuboidal volume of size X()×Y()×Z(), where X=2[qcos(/2)+msin()],Y=2qsin(/2) and Z=2[2nmcos()+qcot()].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we express all angles in radians and have used =2arcsin[sin(/2)sin()/sin()], which can be interpreted as the angle EDE, and , which can be interpreted as the angle BCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To express  in terms of the geometrys defining parameters, we assume  to arrive at the piecewise expression =1+2 for /2 and =1+2 for /2, where 1=arcsin[sin()cos(/2)(cos()2+(sin()cos(/2))2)1/2] and 2=arcsin[sin()cos(/2)(cos()2+(sin()cos(/2))2)1/2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous expressions can be written for less_than.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prevent self-intersection, the kirigami module must obey nmcos()0 and nmcos()+qcot()0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first condition can be interpreted as avoiding collisions between the points F and F with their symmetric points on the upper half of the module, and the second condition avoids collisions between C and C with their symmetric points on the upper half of the module (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For parameters ,,m,n, and q, which violate these inequalities, the geometrically permitted values of  that avoid self-intersection are bounded by a hypersurface in the five-dimensional parameter space that can be directly calculated from the structures kinematics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the definitions of X(), Y(), and Z() we calculated the Poisson ratios ZY=(Z/Y)(dY/dZ) and ZX=(Z/X)(dX/dZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these calculations, increasing  corresponds to macroscopic deformations under compression along z^, whereas decreasing  corresponds to macroscopic deformations under tension along z^.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical properties of the kirigami module were calculated by modeling creases as torsional springs with spring constant k1 that rest at a preferred angle 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Joined edges, such as BCD and BCD, are similarly treated as torsional springs with the same rest angle but with a different spring constant k2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a common rest angle for creases and crease-like joined edges while assigning two different spring constants reflects the details of how experimental samples were fabricated (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These choices can be easily modified according to the context of how modules are assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the case considered here, the energy function takes the form U=12[4k1AB¯(0)2+2k1EF¯(0)2+16k1BG¯(ABGH,CBGF0)2+2k2EF¯(0)2+4k2CD¯(0)2+4k2BC¯(0)2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use overlines to denote length between two points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, AB¯=EF¯=EF¯=n+qcot(), BG¯=q/sin(), CD¯=n, and BC¯=m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dividing U by qk1 leads to the normalized energy U=U/qk1 (Fig 1G), which we find exhibits parameter domains with monostability and bistability (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this stability landscape is not driven by the competition between creasing and bending DOF, as has been shown with other origami structures (11), nor is it driven by a topological discontinuity in configuration space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the stability landscape found here arises strictly from geometry, which forces some creases to move away from their rest angle (e.g., BG¯,BC¯, and CF¯) while allowing others to return to their rest angle (e.g., AB¯,CD¯, and EF¯).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this idealized model, the transition between bistable states is a symmetric process where the top and bottom portions of the kirigmi module simultaneously hop between stable configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In real materials, small heterogeneities can lead to sequential hopping (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, a 1D structure with N voxels is capable of supporting up to 4N distinct stable configurations (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimizing_Voxels_for_Geometric_Compatibility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in the text, geometrically compatible metamaterials are constructed in a two-step process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step one is to analyze the number of available design parameters Np and pick a set of values that produces the desired properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the specific example of the lantern-like module, these chosen parameters are denoted 0,0,m0,n0, and q0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step two is to assemble the bulk metamaterial either from (i) identical voxels, which are by definition geometrically compatible for all folding configurations, or from (ii) dissimilar voxels, which are designed to be geometrically compatible by optimizing parameters to satisfy the design tolerances over the folding interval [a,b].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For geometric compatibility, there are Nc constraints imposed on each voxel in the bulk structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the specific example discussed in the text of the lantern-like module, Nc=4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constraint on EDE, which is the angle (;,) (Fig 1A), ensures voxels have matching () over [a,b] and sin()sin().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of these observations, the constraint that Y() also match between voxels implies qq0 for every voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our error function used to match a candidate voxel to a target voxel is then simply defined as ()=[X(;,,m,n,)X(;0,0,m0,n0,0)q0]2+[Z(;,,m,n,)Z(;0,0,m0,n0,0)q0]2, where  is a function of  parametrized by  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters ,,m, and n, along with the already set value of q=q0, define the geometry of the voxel being optimized for compatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find the optimal set of parameters, we calculate the integrated error s=ab()d and seek a set of parameters that satisfy [(a),(b)]less_than, where  is our design tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the solution that minimizes s satisfies this condition, but pathological situations can be constructed where near-minimum values of s can satisfy the overall design tolerances with more desirable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When constructing the large-scale 2D metamaterial with zero Poisson ratio (Fig 3 D and E) our error function used for calculating geometrically compatible design patterns was adapted to penalize nonzero ZX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we used 2D()=[ZO(2;,,m,n,)ZT(;0,0,m0,n0,0)q0]2+[[XO(2;,,m,n,)+XT(;0,0,m0,n0,0)]/ZT(;0,0,m0,n0,0)/]2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term penalizes differences between the target modules height ZT and the optimized modules height ZO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second term penalizes Poisson effects, which are calculated using the sum of target and optimized module widths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more easily find a set of parameters that satisfy the zero bulk Poisson ratio along the x^-direction, we set the optimized functions to depend on 2 whereas the target function depends on .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ensures solutions are symmetric about = and is similar in principle to an expression of the form sin()+sin(2)=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In calculating the bulk strain (Fig 3E, Inset) we defined X0=X(=0) and X=X()X0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the mechanical cloak (Fig 3 FI) we performed a similar optimization with structures that consist of a 15×15 lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original structure contains 225 voxels (Fig 3F), the structure with the hole contains 104 voxels (Fig 3G), and the cloaking structure contains 60 gray voxels and 44 orange voxels (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force-extension relations were calculated with Foriginal()=[225U(;0,0,m0,n0)]/[15Z(;0,0,m0,n0)]/,Fhole()=[104U(;0,0,m0,n0)]/[15Z(;0,0,m0,n0)]/, Fcloak(;,,m,n)=[60U(;0,0,m0,n0)+44U(;,,m,n)]/[4Z(;0,0,m0,n0)+11Z(;,,m,n)]/, where U and Z denote the energy and height of a voxel, 0,0,m0,n0, and q0 are the geometric parameters of the gray target voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters for the orange reinforcing voxels were obtained by minimizing the integrated error s over the design interval with the error function cloak()=[Fcloak(;,,m,n)Foriginal()Foriginal(=)]2+[Z(;,,m,n)Z(;0,0,m0,n0)q0]2, where we set sin()sin() to ensure the constraints imposed on (;,) were obeyed throughout the structures heterogeneous columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we obtain values for ,,m, and n for the orange voxels that allow us to reconstitute the mechanical properties of the original structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the force-extension calculations, we chose 0=10°, k1=0.02 N/mm, k2=0, and q=1 cm, then calculated F()=dU/d(Z/q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were chosen to approximate our experimental materials (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that for this structure the error function being optimized only generates geometric compatibility along Z and allows for gaps along X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this particular application, the extra constraint on X is unnecessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify differences between large-scale target 3D metamaterial structures, and approximate voxelized structures, we define 3D=1Vvoxel/Vtarget.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Vtarget is the volume of the desired 3D shape and Vvoxel=N(xX)(yY)(zZ) is the volume of the structure assembled from metamaterial voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this expression, N is the total number of voxels, X,Y,Z are dimensions of a single module, and the scaling factors x,y,z control how small the voxels are in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, xX=Xvoxel, yY=Yvoxel, and zZ=Zvoxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, smaller values for x,y, and z lead to a greater number N of smaller voxels, which, in turn, better approximates the target structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit where the x,y,z0, we have N in such a way that VvoxelVtarget and 3D vanishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design_Patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Design patterns for 1D and 2D metamaterials are typically straightforward to generate from a voxelized structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, folding diagrams for the 1D and both 2D metamaterials are essentially the structure split into a front and back connected along one edge (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Folding patterns for 3D metamaterials, however, can be substantially more difficult to generate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, methods for continuously transforming 3D objects is an active field of research in computational geometry, and the existing body of work offers potential solutions (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, multisheet assembly methods are also possible and have been described in detail elsewhere (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
