Oral activity of a nature-derived cyclic peptide for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) imposes substantial economic burdens on patients, their families, and society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, there are few therapies available, but often unattractive parenteral application or severe side effects are serious issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study highlights the use of circular peptides as orally active T-cell-specific immunosuppressive therapeutics against the MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, without inducing major adverse effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides a proof of principle that nature-derived cyclic peptides serve as oral active therapeutics, utilizing their intrinsic bioactivity and stable three-dimensional structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclotides are considered a combinatorial peptide library and they can be anticipated to complement the existing collections of natural products that are used in drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is characterized by auto-reactive T cells that induce demyelination and neuronal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment options are still limited and several MS medications need to be administered by parenteral application but are modestly effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral active drugs such as fingolimod have been weighed down by safety concerns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is a demand for novel, especially orally active therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nature offers an abundance of compounds for drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the circular plant peptide kalata B1 was shown to silence T-cell proliferation in vitro in an IL-2dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to this promising effect, we aimed to determine in vivo activity of the cyclotide [T20K]kalata B1 using the MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of mice with the cyclotide resulted in a significant delay and diminished symptoms of EAE by oral administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclotide application substantially impeded disease progression and did not exhibit adverse effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-2, distinguish the cyclotide from other marketed drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering their stable structural topology and oral activity, cyclotides are candidates as peptide therapeutics for pharmaceutical drug development for treatment of T-cell-mediated disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Extensive screening efforts for the discovery of novel nature-derived drugs has led to the identification of antiproliferative properties of the cyclotide kB1 toward human activated lymphocytes in vitro (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, structure-activity screening of cyclotides isolated from the plant Oldenlandia affinis (Rubiaceae) established [T20K]kB1 as an active lead compound to inhibit T-cell proliferation and, interestingly, replacement of valine to the positively charged lysine in loop 2 resulted in a loss of activity in vitro (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current work, [T20K]kB1 was synthesized following a modified protocol for the generation of thioester peptides and subsequent cyclization by native chemical ligation (Fig 1 and Fig S1) (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the immunosuppressive effects of cyclotides in vivo, the murine T-cell autoimmune-specific EAE was investigated as a model for human MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EAE, autoreactive CD4+ T cells of the subtype TH17 are the major cause initiating and provoking demyelination of the CNS that leads to the typical appearance of paralysis symptoms (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a preliminary experiment, [T20K]kB1 and [V10K]kB1 were incubated at different concentrations with mouse immune cells ex vivo, which were isolated from spleens of EAE-induced, viz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG3555; MOG)-immunized mice, to confirm the immunosuppressive effects previously observed in human T cells (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proliferation of T cells, measured by flow cytometry, as well as the autocrine acting proliferation-supporting cytokine IL-2 and the TH1 and TH17 signature cytokines IFN- and IL-17A in the supernatant of MOG-restimulated cells (Fig S2 AC), were down-regulated by [T20K]kB1 in a concentration-dependent fashion; the inactive control cyclotide [V10K]kB1 had significantly less effect in reduction of cytokine secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclosporine A, which leads to IL-2 suppression by modulating calcineurin activity (29), was used as a positive control to confirm the antiproliferative properties of the cyclotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-regulation of cytokine-related mRNAs caused by [T20K]kB1 was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, significant antiproliferative effects and a reduction of inflammatory cytokine release of IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17A has been demonstrated by restimulation of splenic T cells isolated from 2D2 MOGspecific TCR transgenic mice following cyclotide [T20K]kB1 treatment (Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activity_and_Therapeutic_Effects_of_Cyclotides_to_Treat_EAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cyclotide [T20K]kB1 exhibits concentration-dependent immunosuppressive activity in vitro, which encouraged the investigation of the in vivo activity of the circular plant peptide using the T-cell-specific EAE model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG and treated in advance (day 7) i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with [T20K]kB1 (10 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant delay of the onset and only minor symptoms of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas the inactive mutant or the untreated control group exhibited no significant effects in disease reduction; these mice experienced severe bilateral paralysis and weight loss (Fig 2A, Fig S3A, Table S1, and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival analysis of EAE experiments, including moribund mice (clinical score 4, see SI Materials and Methods), further supported the observation that treatment of EAE mice with the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 exerts long-lasting and protective T-cell antiproliferative properties (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using IVIS, a lower chemiluminescent signal based on the release of myeloperoxidase by inflammatory cells was detected in the appropriate regions in cyclotide-treated EAE-induced mice, compared with the untreated control group (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splenic T cells of EAE-induced mice enhance inflammatory cytokine expression when incubated with the antigen MOG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation and MOG restimulation of splenocytes from cyclotide-pretreated mice exhibited a significant reduction of IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17A levels compared with both the [V10K]kB1-treated and untreated control group (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no significant perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells and an intact myelin sheath of the spinal cord of cyclotide-treated mice were observed using H&E and Kl√ºver Barrera Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) stains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the significant reduction of inflammation and lower grade of demyelination in the CNS (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, [T20K]kB1 cyclotide treatment not only leads to halt of disease progression, but also induces long-lasting effects supporting survival and hindering restimulation of splenic T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we evaluated the effects of a therapeutic treatment for reversion of autoimmune disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10 mg/kg [T20K]kB1 1 wk before (day 7), at the day of immunization (day 0), and 1 wk after (day 7) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice treated with the cyclotide revealed an inhibition or a delay in the progression of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis reliant on the time point of the treatment (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4A and S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed by histological H&E and LFB stains, which showed increased inflammation and advanced demyelination induced by mononuclear cells infiltrating the spinal cord the later the cyclotide injection was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the highest degree of reduction of inflammation and the lowest grade of demyelination of axons was observed in [T20K]kB1- (day 7) treated mice (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation-inducing IL-2 and other TH1- and TH17-related inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in MOG-restimulated isolated splenic T lymphocytes, influenced by the time point of cyclotide treatment (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following these promising protective properties of the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 against autoimmunity, EAE-induced mice were treated therapeutically at a score of 2, meaning at a disease stage of partial paraparesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pilot experiment with a single injection of cyclotide (10 mg/kg) resulted in a significant reduction in the clinical score (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4B and S3C), but effects on cytokine secretion were moderate (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, treatment with three injections (10 mg/kg) administered every third day (Table S1) seemed to be more promising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progression of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis was not only substantially blunted, but also the health status of the cyclotide-treated mice was slightly improved (Fig 2F and Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, autoimmune-related cytokine levels were reduced, suggesting a therapeutic potential of the nature-derived peptide [T20K]kB1 (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have been further verified by histological experiments that depicted an amelioration of the encephalomyelitis due to a lower grade of axonal demyelination in cyclotide-treated animals and decreased numbers of inflammatory cells in the CNS (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, cyclotide treatment resulted in a reduced number of CD3+ (P less_than 0.001) and CD4+ (P less_than 0.01) cells in the CNS and in decreased IL-2 release (P = 0.07) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oral_EAE_Treatment_Using_the_Cyclotide_[T20K]kalata_B1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because cyclotides are resistant against enzymatic and chemical degradation, due to their unique 3D structure, [T20K]kB1 was tested in an oral treatment experiment for its T-cell antiproliferative properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with two different doses: one group of mice was given 10 mg/kg, the same dose as was used for the i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injections, and a second group was treated with 20 mg/kg (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, [T20K]kB1 applied orally improved the EAE clinical score in a dose-dependent manner in comparison with the control group (Fig 3A and Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative clinical score for the [T20K]kB1-treated mice (20 mg/kg) after oral administration (mean ¬± SEM: 21.5 ¬± 9.7) was significantly lower compared with the control group (64.1 ¬± 17.5), whereas treatment with a lower dose of [T20K]kB1 (10 mg/kg) was not significantly different (52.0 ¬± 24.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cytokine release of the 20 mg/kg [T20K]kB1 treatment was analyzed postrestimulation of splenic T cells after 4872 h with their natural antigen MOG (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were substantiated with histology analysis, which revealed a minor inflammatory index and reduced areas of axonal demyelination in orally cyclotide-treated mice, compared with the EAE-induced control mice (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following up on those results, [T20K]kB1 was evaluated for its therapeutic application (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant amelioration of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis regarding the clinical score and histological analysis has been demonstrated by oral treatment using MOG-immunized mice (Fig 3B and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3F and S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice treated three times with [T20K]kB1 at a score of 2 yielded a cumulative clinical score of 43.5 ¬± 12.3 compared with the control group, which exhibited 78.5 ¬± 10.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the biodistribution of cyclotides, [T20K]kB1 was labeled with the NIR-fluorescent VivoTag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After oral administration of the derivatized cyclotide, an uptake into the gastrointestinal tract, systemic distribution and excretion mainly via the renal/urinary tract was monitored, using the IVIS (Fig 4A and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the VivoTag label alone applied at the same concentrations exhibited less fluorescent intensity and a faster excretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 72 h mice were euthanized and the organs were screened for fluorescence signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labeled cyclotide exhibited a strong signal in the kidneys, compared with the label alone and control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver and spleen lacked any label-specific signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, animals treated with label alone showed a low degree of signal in kidneys and liver (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic uptake of the cyclotide was determined by mass spectrometry analysis of serum samples at 1 and 2 h postadministration, respectively (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Owing to the stable body weight of treated mice, administration of up to three doses of 10 (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or 20 mg/kg (oral) of [T20K]kB1, respectively, seems to be safe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm lack of adverse effects, liver toxicity was determined by measuring liver enzymes [i.e., aspartate (AST or GOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or GPT)], which are markers for cellular integrity, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GT) as an indicator for disorders linked to the biliary tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After oral application of 20 mg/kg of [T20K]kB1 in healthy mice, body weight and temperature as well as the liver parameters mentioned above were monitored and confirmed its safety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the concentration of the lipid parameters triglycerides and cholesterol indicated no difference between [T20K]kB1-treated mice and the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histology of the gastrointestinal tract further confirmed that cyclotides do not cause cellular lesions or noticeable adverse effects after oral administration (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of the circular plant peptide and the oral bioavailable drug fingolimod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is being used in the clinic to treat MS and is therefore the appropriate reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single administration of 20 mg/kg fingolimod a week before (day 7) MOG immunization with 20 mg/kg did not mitigate the course of the disease: Clinical scores of fingolimod-treated and control animals were comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cyclotide ameliorated the subsequent course of the disease in a statistically significant manner (P less_than 0.001) (Fig S9A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of 20 mg/kg three times in 3-d intervals resulted in a reduction in EAE disease progression; the effect was comparable in magnitude for both fingolimod and the cyclotide (Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily administration (starting at day 0) of fingolimod at an established dose of 1 mg/kg (30) seemed to be the most effective treatment to halt progression of EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 achieved comparable efficacy if animals were treated with a daily dose of 1 mg/kg (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, daily cyclotide treatment leads to a substantially reduced level of cytokine secretion (IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17A), as well as a significantly lower degree of demyelination and a minor inflammatory index (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences in adverse effects between the cyclotide (20 mg/kg) and fingolimod (20 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg daily) after oral administration can be observed using this animal study as determined by the same rigorous level of tolerability evaluation as described above (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 to other immunosuppressant drugs revealed that morbidity and mortality (moribund mice) was significantly reduced in [T20K]kB1-, prednisolone-, azathioprine- and cyclosporine A-treated mice (Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although preliminary studies have shown that the cyclotide kalata B1 can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in vitro (12) the effectiveness of nature-derived cyclotides to prevent or treat autoimmune disorders in vivo after oral administration has hitherto not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that the peptide [T20K]kB1 is an orally active therapeutic for treatment of the T-cell-mediated MS model EAE (22) in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antiproliferative effects of the cyclotide kalata B1 and the mutant [T20K]kB1 have been investigated on human mononuclear cells and purified T cells, highlighting the IL-2specific inhibitory mechanism in vitro (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Release of TH1 and TH17 signature cytokines were not only inhibited in vitro when incubated with the cyclotide, but also after ex vivo restimulation of EAE-induced [T20K]kB1-pretreated splenocytes with their natural antigen MOG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the reduction in the disease-relevant T-cell cytokine IL-17A supports the observed clinical and histological reversion of disease progression upon cyclotide treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially various treatment regimens confirmed in vivo activity to reduce EAE-associated symptoms of [T20K]kB1 by parenteral application (i.p.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in vivo activity of [T20K]kB1 was sequence-specific because the cyclotide [V10K]kB1 (or the untreated control group) exhibited neither significant effects in disease reduction nor any significant reduction of inflammation or demyelination in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effective way to prevent an episode of EAE was administration of cyclotide to healthy mice 1 wk before disease induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be an advantage in the relapsingremitting form of MS, one of the most common types (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the decline of the first symptoms, cyclotide treatment could potentially interfere with the recurrence of more profound disabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, daily treatment with lower doses seemed to be very efficient to prevent disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, [T20K]kB1 was also effective to treat mice at a disease stage of paraparesis, which impeded progression of EAE substantially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To take advantage of the structural stability of cyclotides, the oral treatment experiments describe for the first time to our knowledge cyclotides used as oral active therapeutics for EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of cyclotides at therapeutic doses did not induce adverse effects; it not only elicited a short-lived effect on the secretion of signature cytokines (IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17A) but also maintained the health status of the cyclotide-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of cyclotide leads to reversion of disease progression and induces long-lasting effects supporting survival and hindering restimulation of splenic T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed inhibition on proliferation of splenocytes isolated from the genetically modified 2D2 mouse model further supports a strong beneficial effect on disease development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oral treatment required a higher dose compared with parenteral administration likely due to low bioavailability of [T20K]kB1, as commonly observed for peptide therapeutics (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, grafted cystine-knot peptides are thought to have limited bioavailability of less than 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it was possible to detect traces of [T20K]kB1 in serum by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry up to 2 h following oral administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gastrointestinal uptake and systemic biodistribution of a derivatized cyclotide ([T20K-VivoTag]kB1) has been confirmed by IVIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the VivoTag-labeled cyclotide may exhibit different physicochemical properties, IVIS seemed to be a valid model system to monitor the trajectory of the cyclotide following oral administration based on the known stability of cyclotides in proteolytic environment and at acidic conditions (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The long-term effect induced by the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 was comparable to known immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine A, prednisolone, and azathioprine, but their clinical use in MS therapy is limited due to low activity, lack of oral bioavailability, or high incidence of systemic side effects (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a head-to-head comparison of [T20K]kB1 and fingolimod, a recently approved orally bioavailable drug to prevent MS progression, the cyclotide seemed to be an advantageous therapeutic option when administered at a single dose; fingolimod was only effective with multiple administrations, and best at daily administration of its therapeutic dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, cyclotides exhibiting oral activity are very promising acquisitions in drug discovery, not only regarding the treatment of MS but as a potential option for oral treatment of other autoimmune-related diseases (25, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful advances in chemical and recombinant synthesis (37, 38) as well as enzymatic folding (39) and cyclization (40) may yield affordable production of cyclotides at clinical scale in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the more general level, our work provides a proof of principle for the concept that nature-derived cyclic peptides serve as oral active therapeutics using their intrinsic bioactivity and stable 3D structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, cyclotides have been recently used as scaffolds to improve the stability of peptides that have interesting pharmaceutical activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This grafting introduced peptide sequences into cyclotide loops and resulted in a chimeric molecule that was orally active as bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclotides represent a natural combinatorial peptide library and they probe a chemical space that is difficult to target by using small organic molecules (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at the very least, they can be anticipated to complement the existing collections of natural products or synthetic molecules that are used in drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, building on the unique topology of cyclotides (16) may complement efforts in rational design of bioavailable cyclic peptide therapeutics (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that documents that a ribosomally synthesized, plant-derived cyclic peptide is effective after oral administration to prevent and to treat EAE in mice, the gold-standard animal model of human multiple sclerosis (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incidentally, cyclosporine A produced by the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum is also a cyclic (undeca)peptide and it is considered the prototype of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, cyclosporine A was instrumental to the development of modern immunopharmacology and it is still in clinical use today (29, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the limitations of such comparisons, we believe that the rich diversity of cyclotides (17, 43) justifies their position as a treasure trove for drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Synthesis followed a recent protocol for the generation of thioesterpeptides using Fmoc-SPPS and their use in native chemical ligation, and its adaptation to synthesize cyclotides assisted by microwave heating (according to references used in the main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rink type 3-(Fmoc-amino)-4-aminobenzoyl AM resin (Dawsons DBz resin), 100200 mesh, from Novabiochem (Merck-Millipore) with a substitution value of 0.49 mmol/g was used as starting point for the synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resin was allowed to swell in DMF for 2 h. The Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% (vol/vol) piperidine solution in DMF two times for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two equivalents of amino acid were dissolved in five equivalents of 0.5 M HBTU solution and activation was achieved by adding 10 equivalents of DIPEA base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was rigorously shaken for 1 min before added to the deprotected resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The manual coupling of the first amino acid was repeated once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward elongation of all other residues was performed on a Liberty1 microwave peptide synthesizer (CEM Corp.) applying an optimized microwave assisted Fmoc/HBTU SPPS protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Nbz formation was performed using 4-nitrophenylchloroformate in DCM (16 equivalents based on the net weight gain after peptide synthesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acylation reaction was carried out at 23 ¬∞C for 1 h. Activation was achieved using 195 equivalents of DIPEA in DMF for 25 min at 23 ¬∞C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Nbz-peptide was cleaved off the resin using TFA/TIPS/ddH2O 99.5/0.25/0.25% (vol/vol/vol) for 3 h at 23 ¬∞C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The released Nbz-peptide was precipitated with diethylether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide precipitate was dissolved in 50% CH3CN/0.05% TFA in double-distilled H2O and lyophilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thioesterification was performed in a ligation buffer containing 200 mM mercapto-phenyl acetic acid, 20 mM TCEP, and 6 M guanidine-HCl in 200 mM phosphate solution adjusted to pH 7.07.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nbz-peptide was dissolved in the ligation buffer in 1 mM and the solution was stirred for 24 h. The cyclic peptide was purified from the ligation reagents using Sephadex G25 gel filtration columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide fractions were then lyophilized, before final purification of native cyclotide was achieved using preparative HPLC on a diChrom Kromasil C18 (250 √ó 20 mm, 10 ¬µm) column (dichrom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear gradients from 5 to 80% solvent B [double-distilled H2O/CH3CN/TFA, 10/90/0.1% (vol/vol/vol), solvent A 0.1% TFA aqueous] was applied to achieve peptide separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quality control was judged upon A215 and A280 UV traces from an analytical C18 separation using a Phenomenex Kinetex (150 √ó 3 mm, 2.1 ¬µm) column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide purity 90% was accepted or otherwise submitted to another purification cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice used for experiments and ethics permission for animal care have been described in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were earmarked 3 to 4 wk after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA from lysed (proteinase K lysis buffer) ear tissue was subjected to direct PCR using GoTaq Polymerase (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the following 2D2 and control primers (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) specific PCRs were performed: 2D2 forward: 5-CCCGGGCAAGGCTCAGCCATGCTCCTG-3, 2D2 reverse: 5-GCGGCCGCAATTCCCAGAGACATCCCTCC-3 and internal control primer forward: 5-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT-3, reverse: 5-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6 mice of both sexes were used due to the fact that no sex-specific differences were registered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were immunized at day 0 with 75 ¬µL of equal amounts of MOG (MOG3555, 1 mg/mL; Charite Berlin) and incomplete Freuds adjuvants (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco) s.c. into the left and right flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally mice received i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  200 ng pertussis toxin (Millipore,) solubilized in 100 ¬µL PBS at day 0 and day 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were observed daily for clinical signs as described in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6 mice were immunized at day 0 according to the protocol described recently in Sahin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progression of EAE was divided into five clinical stages: score 0, no signs; score 1, complete tail paralysis; score 2, partial paraparesis; score 3, severe paraparesis; score 4, tetraparesis; and score 5, moribund condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a mouse meets exclusion criteria (score  greater than 4, loss of weight  greater than 20%, no water and food uptake, no grooming) then it is considered moribund.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were euthanized by deeply anesthetizing them with ketamine reaching a score of 34 due to ethical guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Records were kept of animal numbers and treatment details; while scoring the operator was blinded to the treatment records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent assistant operators performed random spot checks in a blinded manner to confirm the assessment of the main operator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in a blinded scoring procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For optimized effects in T-cell detection, histological assessments, and cytokine analysis following ex vivo restimulation it is critical to finalize the experiment at the disease peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival analysis, including moribund mice, was performed using a KaplanMeier plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Euthanized mice were perfused intracardiacally with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spinal cords were then isolated, fixed in 4% (vol/vol) buffered formalin, and processed for histological evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained with H&E and LFB using standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore sections were analyzed for CD3 surface expression using immunohistochemistry with rat-anti-CD3 (AbD Serotech) and goat-anti-rat (Vector Laboratories) antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of three cross-sections of each animal were evaluated histologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory index was calculated as follows: The number of perivascular infiltrates in spinal cord cross-sections was divided by the number of used cross-sections for each animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a higher inflammatory index indicates more inflammatory infiltrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the extent of demyelinated area, total and demyelinated area of each cross section was measured in the KLB staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demyelinated area was then calculated and plotted as percent of total cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image J (NIH) was used for all histological evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomach and intestine of euthanized mice were perfused with 10 mL PBS before fixation in 4% (vol/vol) buffered formalin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gastrointestinal sections were stained with H&E and evaluated as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EAE-induced [T20K]kB1-treated (10 mg/kg i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on day 7) and untreated control EAE mice received RediJect D-Luciferin bioluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer) i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on day 12 after MOG immunization according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring with the IVIS (PerkinElmer) was performed on day 13 by measuring chemiluminescence signal, induced by the RediJect substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher chemiluminescence levels represent enhanced inflammation in the appropriate regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification was performed with Living Image software (PerkinElmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VivoTag 680 XL (PerkinElmer) peptide was dissolved in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 20-fold molar excess of labeling reagent was prepared in anhydrous DMSO and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 23 ¬∞C for 4 h. Reaction was stopped with 0.1% TFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of labeled peptide from excess of reagent was achieved by semipreparative HPLC using a diChrom Kromasil C18 column (250 √ó 10 mm, 5 ¬µm) and linear gradients as indicated above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPLC fractions were analyzed via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the negative reflector mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purity of peptide samples was determined to be 95% based on analytical HPLC and detection of VivoTag label in the A280 UV trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled [T20K]kB1 was injected intravenously, intraperitoneally, and per oral gavage into na√Øve mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence signal (excitation: 665 ¬± 5 nm, emission: 688 ¬± 5 nm) was monitored after 5 min, 20 min, 40 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 h. Organs (spleen, liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine) of euthanized mice were screened for the fluorescence and quantified by using IVIS Living Image software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Serum_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood sampling was performed for indicated experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sera were analyzed using the Reflotron Plus System (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Serum_Uptake_Analysis_of_Cyclotides_After_Oral_Administration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57B1/6 mice were treated orally with 20 mg/kg [T20K]kB1 peptide and fresh blood was used for analysis of peptide in blood after 1 and 2 h postadministration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total citrated blood (1.5 mL) was submitted to homogenization and cell lysis using the Precellyser 24 (Bertin Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were removed using TCA precipitation with a final concentration of 10% (wt/vol) TCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance peptide recovery 45% (vol/vol) CH3CN (final) was added to the solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitation was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at 4 ¬∞C and afterward proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 √ó g for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was lyophilized and then dissolved in 100 ¬µL 0.1% TFA (aqueous) and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 √ó g before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were desalted and concentrated using ZipTips (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mass spectrometry analysis a MALDI-TOF/TOF 4800 Analyzer was used (AB Sciex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The desalted samples (0.5 ¬µL) were mixed with 6 ¬µL of -cyano-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix, saturated in double-distilled H2O/CH3CN/TFA 50/50/0.1% (vol/vol/vol) and 0.5 ¬µL were spotted onto a target plate and allowed to air-dry in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External calibration was performed on a daily basis applying calibration mix 1 (Laserbiolabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectra were recorded in the range of 2,5003,500 Da with optimized settings for laser intensity number of shots per average spectrum and digitizer adjustment to obtain acceptable spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control measurement, the corresponding amount of 1% [T20K]kB1 of the total dose of 20 mg/kg was spiked into fresh blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h of settling time at 4 ¬∞C the samples were processed accordingly as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Spleens of euthanized mice were prepared in RPMI media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin (100 U/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and streptomycin (100 g/mL; Sigma) on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To receive a homogeneous cell suspension, spleens were meshed through 40-¬µm nylon sieves and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 √ó g. The cell pellet was incubated for 1 min with 1 mL erythrocyte lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.27.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 mL full media and centrifugation for 5 min at 300 √ó g. Splenic cells (3 √ó 106/mL) were stimulated ex vivo with or without 30 ¬µg/mL MOG for 4872 h at 37 ¬∞C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of splenocytes was performed according to the appropriate experiments, described in figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
