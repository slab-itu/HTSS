Dual-activity PI3KBRD4 inhibitor for the orthogonal inhibition of MYC to block tumor growth and metastasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we describe a dual-action inhibitor that simultaneously disrupts functions of two key MYC-mediating factorsPI3K and BRD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the concomitant inhibition of PI3K and BRD4 blocks MYC expression and activation, promotes MYC degradation, and markedly inhibits cancer cell growth and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that the dual-activity inhibitor represents a highly promising lead compound for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYC is a major cancer driver but is documented to be a difficult therapeutic target itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report on the biological activity, the structural basis, and therapeutic effects of the family of multitargeted compounds that simultaneously disrupt functions of two critical MYC-mediating factors through inhibiting the acetyllysine binding of BRD4 and the kinase activity of PI3K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the dual-action inhibitor impairs PI3K/BRD4 signaling in vitro and in vivo and affords maximal MYC down-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concomitant inhibition of PI3K and BRD4 blocks MYC expression and activation, promotes MYC degradation, and markedly inhibits cancer cell growth and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our findings suggest that the dual-activity inhibitor represents a highly promising lead compound for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Morpholinothienopyrane_Is_a_Dual_Inhibitor_of_PI3K_and_BRD4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that 5-morpholino-7H-thieno[3,2-b]pyran-7-one (TP-scaffold) represents a promising class of PI3K inhibitors: Screening a panel of 200 kinases, we found that SF2523 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of PI3K, particularly of the  isoform of PI3K (PI3K) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess SF2523 activity in the cellular context, we examined the effect of this compound on the PI3K signaling pathway in a neuroblastoma SKNBE2 cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the major established downstream effectors of the PI3K pathwayAKT and MYCN (one of the MYC family genes amplified in this cell line)and evaluated levels and activation of these effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SKNBE2 cells were treated first with IGF and then with either SF2523 or known PI3K inhibitors, including SF1126, BKM120, BEZ235, and CAL101, and MYCN mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas all PI3K inhibitors tested significantly decreased MYCN expression, SF2523 had the most profound effect, reducing the MYCN mRNA level by sevenfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of the SKNBE2 cell lysate revealed that SF2523 treatment decreases protein levels of MYCN and Cyclin D1, the MYCN target, and inhibits AKT activation by blocking phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, other commonly used PI3K inhibitors, such as BKM120, BEZ235, and CAL101, blocked phosphorylation of AKT and slightly reduced MYCN levels but did not affect Cyclin D1 levels, implying that besides the PI3K signaling cascade, additional targets of SF2523 likely exist that could also regulate MYCN expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because MYC transcription has been linked to the activity of the transcriptional coactivator BRD4 and several kinase inhibitors have been found to act on BRD4 (28, 29), we tested whether SF2523 targets BRD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, treatment of SKNBE2 cells with JQ1, a commonly used inhibitor of BRD4 that has no PI3K inhibitory activity, resulted in a decrease of MYCN expression and reduced MYCN and Cyclin D1 levels but had no effect on pAKT, indicating that JQ1 appears to not alter the PI3KAKT signaling (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that JQ1 displaces BRD4 from MYCN promoter sites (regions 1 and 2 within the MYCN promoter), and similarly to JQ1, SF2523 treatment led to the displacement of BRD4 from both MYCN promoter sites (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike JQ1 and SF2523, the PI3K selective inhibitor CAL101 was unable to displace BRD4 from the MYCN promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BDs_Are_Targets_of_TP-Scaffold_Inhibitors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether SF2523 is capable of binding to BDs of BRD4, SF2523 was tested against a panel of BDs derived from 28 proteins in a BROMOscan binding assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1D, SF2523 interacts robustly with the full-length BRD4 (Kd = 140 nM) and exhibits comparable affinity to the BRD4 first BD (BD1) (Kd = 150 nM), however it binds more weakly to the second BD (BD2) of BRD4 (Kd = 710 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of binding affinities of SF2523 for BDs of other proteins revealed that it binds equally well to BDs of BRD4, BRD2, and BRD3; shows moderate binding to BDs of CECR2 and BRDT; but associates much weaker with other BDs (Fig 1D and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding affinities of SF2523 to BD1 and BD2 of BRD4 were corroborated by Kd values measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such strong and selective binding of the PI3K-specific inhibitor to BRD2/3/4 appears to be unique, as none of the known PI3K inhibitors tested noticeably disrupted the interaction of BRD4 with its ligand, polyacetylated histone H4 peptide (H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac), in a kinase screening assay, whereas SF2523 had an IC50 of 16 nM (Fig 2A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, displacement binding assays with H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac peptide showed that SF2523 is a robust inhibitor of acetyllysine binding activity of BRD4 BD1 (IC50, 241 nM) and a moderate inhibitor of BD2 (IC50, 1.5 M) (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The direct binding of SF2523 to BRD4 BD1 was substantiated by NMR 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) titration experiments (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradual addition of SF2523 to the 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 NMR sample caused large chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) that are indicative of direct binding (Fig 2D, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slow exchange regime on the NMR time scalethat is, disappearance of a set of cross-peaks corresponding to the free state of the protein and appearance of another set of cross-peaks corresponding to the bound staterevealed a tight interaction, corroborating the nanomolar values of Kd and IC50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an attempt to increase inhibition potency, a second generation of the TP-scaffold compounds was tested in displacement binding assays (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the five compounds tested, SF2558HA was found to be a slightly stronger inhibitor of BRD4 than SF2523, and unlike SF2523, which exhibits fivefold higher selectivity for BRD4 BD1, SF2558HA disrupted acetyllysine-binding function of both BD1 and BD2 almost equally well (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SF2535 demonstrated an increase of inhibition toward BRD4 BD2 and was also a potent inhibitor of another PI3K isoform, PI3K (IC50, 41 nM) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further agreement with the displacement assay findings, titration of SF2558HA and SF2535 into the 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 NMR samples resulted in similar patterns of CSPs in BD1, with the exception of a pair of side-chain amide cross-peaks, which are in the slow exchange regime upon binding of SF2523 but are in the fast exchange regime upon binding of SF2558HA and SF2535 (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that the overall binding mode of the TP-scaffold compounds to BD1 is conserved; however, characterization of these interactions at the atomic resolution is necessary to better understand the differences in selectivity and potency of these inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Mechanism_for_BRD4_BD1_Inhibition_by_TP_Compounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the molecular mechanism for inhibition of BRD4 BDs by the TP-scaffold compounds, we cocrystallized BRD4 BD1 with SF2523, SF2535, and SF2558HA and obtained crystal structures of the complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the BRD4 BD1SF2523 complex reveals a characteristic four-helix bundle fold of BD1, with SF2523 occupying a deep hydrophobic pocket at one of the open ends of the bundle (Fig 3A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morpholino and thienopyrano rings of SF2523 are inserted deeply in the pocket and lay parallel to the -helices of BD1, whereas the benzodioxane moiety of SF2523 is positioned perpendicular to the -helices and oriented toward the ZA loop of BD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbonyl oxygen in the thienopyrano group of SF2523 forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Asn140 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr97 of BD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dioxane ring of SF2523 is restrained through a set of hydrogen bonds involving Trp81, Gln85, and Asp88 in the ZA loop of BD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Side chains of Trp81, Pro82, and Leu92 create a hydrophobic cage around the benzodioxane group of SF2523, whereas the side chains of Val87 and Ile146 provide additional stabilization to the thiophene portion of SF2523 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The base of the binding pocket is lined with a well-defined and constrained shell of water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the BRD4 BD1 complexes with SF2523 or with H4K5acK8ac reveals that SF2523 acts as an acetyllysine mimetic: It forms the hydrogen bond with Asn140, which is conserved in acetyllysineBD complexes, and does not disturb the signature water shell in BD1 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural overlay of the BD1SF2535, BD1SF2558HA, and BD1SF2523 complexes shows a high degree similarity of the water-lined binding sites (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much like in the BD1SF2523 complex, the thienopyrano group in SF2535 and SF2558HA is restrained via a conserved pair of hydrogen bonds (to Asn140 and Tyr97 of BD1); however, unlike the dioxane group in SF2523, the ethylcarboxyl group in SF2535 and the hydroxylamino group in SF2558HA do not form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Gln85 and Asp88.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the Trp81 residue in the BD1SF2558HA complex (but not in BD1SF2535) adopts a distinctive conformation, allowing for its indole nitrogen to make a transient hydrogen bonding contact with the hydroxylamino group of SF2558HA (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the differences in coordination of the thiophene substituent, the displacement and NMR titration experiments showed that the three compounds bind to BRD4 BD1 to a similar extent, suggesting that the morpholinothienopyrano core of these inhibitors plays a key role in the interaction with BD1, whereas the thiophene substituent can be varied to provide fine-tuned selectivity toward BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intermolecular_Contacts_of_the_Thienopyranone_Substituents_Provide_Selectivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain insight into the binding mode of BD2, we determined the crystal structure of BRD4 BD2 in complex with SF2558HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the complex, the SF2558HA molecule occupies the acetyllysine-binding pocket with the carbonyl group in the thienopyrano moiety positioned in close proximity to the side chains of Asn433 and Tyr390 and the morpholino oxygen being within a hydrogen-bonding distance to the imidazole nitrogen atom of His437 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 18 residues within 5 Å of the bound SF2558HA compound, 15 are spatially conserved in BD2 and BD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Gln85 in BD1, which forms a hydrogen bond with the dioxane ring of SF2523 in the BD1SF2523 complex, is not conserved in BD2 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of BD2 to form this stabilizing substituent contact could explain a sixfold decrease in SF2523 activity toward BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, Trp81 in BD1, which forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxylamino group of SF2558HA but not with SF2523, is spatially conserved in BD2 (Trp374).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the resolution of the BD2SF2558HA structure precluded us to define the orientation of the Trp374 side chain, the capability of either BD to restrain the hydroxylamino group of SF2558HA through contact with tryptophan could explain a comparable activity of SF2558HA toward BD1 and BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, analysis of chemical shift changes in BD2 upon binding of the three inhibitors showed that although the majority of BD2 amide resonances, including resonances of residues that contribute to the stabilization of the TP-scaffold, were perturbed in a similar way, residues in the ZA loop of BD2 where Trp374 is located were perturbed differently (Fig 4C and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TP_Inhibitor_Blocks_Tumor_Growth__Metastasis__and_PI3K_BRD4_Signaling_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent reports have shown that JQ1 suppresses growth of neuroblastoma in a set of in vivo models, including orthotopic transplantation of patient-derived xenografts and the TH-MYC mouse model (19, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the therapeutic effects of the TP-scaffold inhibitors in aggressive neuroblastoma, we established an s.c. xenograft model of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in immunocompromised mice using the SKNBE2 cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were randomized into two groups when tumors reached 100 mm3 after 30 d of tumor implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group was treated with vehicle (DMSO) and another with SF2523 (50 mg/kg, three times a week), until tumors were harvested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5A, SF2523 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of tumor volume compared with tumor volume observed in the vehicle-treated group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SF2523 showed no gross toxicity to the treated mice, as there was no notable change in body weight (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that SF2523 is highly efficacious in a high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the ability of SF2523 to block PI3K activation and down-regulate MYCN and Cyclin D1 in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis of MYCN and Cyclin D1 expression in tumors harvested from mice treated with SF2523 and from untreated animals revealed a significant decrease in both transcripts (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed that tumors from SF2523-treated mice have markedly reduced MYCN, pAKT, and Cyclin D1 levels compared with levels of these proteins in vehicle-treated mice tumors (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results indicate that SF2523 targets PI3K-driven and BRD4-driven oncogenic pathways in vivo and in vitro (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 A and B and 5 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering the role of PI3K and BRD4 signaling pathways in stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis (3234), we examined the effects of SF2523 in the orthotopic pancreatic Panc02 carcinoma using a model for spontaneous lymph node metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we compared the antitumor activities of SF2523 and two individual inhibitors combined, JQ1 and BKM120, to underscore the therapeutic benefit of the dual inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the spontaneous metastasis model, orthotopic pancreatic tumors were initiated by implanting Panc02 cells into the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 20 d after tumor implantation, mice were randomized into four groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group (n = 8) was treated with 30 mg/kg of SF2523 formulated in 15% N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and 30% captisol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second group (n = 8) was treated with 30 mg/kg of JQ1 formulated in 30% captisol and 30 mg/kg of BKM120 formulated in 15% ethanol and 15% cremaphore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two groups (n = 4 for both) were used as controls and treated with either formulation of 15% DMA and 30% captisol, or 15% ethanol and 15% cremaphore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vehicles or inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally, five times a week, until tumors were harvested on day 35 after tumor implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 6 A and B, there was a drastic weight loss in animals treated with JQ1+BKM120, followed by death of four mice in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, JQ1+BKM120-treated mice exhibited symptoms of hair loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the SF2523-treated group showed a very mild reduction in body weight with no mortality, and vehicle-treated mice showed neither weight loss nor mortality (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we observed a significant reduction of tumor growth in the Panc02 carcinoma model in mice treated with both SF2523 and JQ1+BKM120 (P less_than 0.05; Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the Panc02 model is known to promote metastasis in lymph nodes, we investigated whether SF2523 treatment blocks metastasis in treated animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, mice orthotopically implanted with Panc02 cells in pancreas and treated with SF2523 displayed a marked reduction in regional colonic lymph node metastasis, and this effect was comparable to the effect of treatment with JQ1+BKM120 (Fig 6 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results suggest a high efficacy of SF2523 in controlling spontaneous lymph node metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An overwhelming amount of experimental data point to the direct link between cancer and deregulated PI3KAKT signaling, rendering this signaling pathway into one of the most studied anticancer targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of PI3K has particularly become a highly desirable avenue for pharmacological intervention, with dozens of PI3K inhibitors, including taselisib, copanlisib, pictilisib, buparlisib, and others, being in clinical trials and idelasib being approved for a set of leukemias and lymphomas (4, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although initially very promising, targeted inhibition of PI3K often suffers from the development of resistance to drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been noticed that such resistance is associated with MYC up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation clearly illustrates that targeting a single protein/pathway may not provide a long-lasting therapeutic effect because of the highly heterogeneous nature of cancer, in which multiple signaling cascades are impaired, and that alternative approaches with the focus on synergistic inhibition of more than one deregulated or compensating pathway have to be developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, a number of clinical trials are ongoing to apply PI3K inhibitors in combination with other drugs (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we report on multitargeted small-molecule compounds that bind to a pair of distinctive cancer-specific targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a highly potent dual-activity inhibitor of PI3K and BRD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compound provides maximal inhibition of the major cancer driverMYCbecause inhibition of PI3K promotes MYC degradation, and simultaneously, inhibition of BRD4 blocks MYC transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual-activity inhibitor is characterized by improved efficacy and toxicity: SF2523 is less toxic to the host organism in vivo than a combination of an equipotent PI3K inhibitor and BRD4 inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that the dual-activity inhibitor blocks PI3K/BRD4 signaling in vitro and in vivo and is highly potent in controlling tumor growth and spontaneous lymph node metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structural analysis provides atomic-resolution guidance on further optimization of the TP-scaffold with the goal to increase anticancer efficacy of the compounds toward these two key oncogenic signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BRD4 BD1 (amino acids 43180) and BD2 (amino acids 342460) were concentrated to 915 mg/mL in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP and incubated with two molar equivalence of SF2523, SF2535, or SF2558HA on ice for 1 h before crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All crystals were grown via sitting drop diffusion method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals of BD1 in complex with SF2523 were grown at 4 °C by mixing 800 nL of protein/inhibitor solution with 800 nL of well solution composed of 40% PEG3350 (w/v) and 0.2 M potassium thiocyanate (pH 7.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals of BD1 SF2558HA and SF2535 complexes were obtained at 18 °C by combining 800 nL of protein/inhibitor solution with 800 nL of well solution comprised of 25% PEG3350 (w/v), 0.2 M ammonium chloride, and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallization of the BD2 SF2558HA complex was achieved by mixing 800 nL of protein/ligand solution with 800 nL of well buffer composed of 2.5 M ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All BD1 datasets were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku Micromax 007 high-frequency microfocus X-ray generator on a Pilatus 200K 2D area detector, and diffraction data for the BD2 SF2558HA complex were collected at 100 K on a NOIR-1 detector system at the Molecular Biology Consortium Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advance Light Source (ALS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HKL3000 was used for indexing, scaling, and data reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solution was found via molecular replacement with Phaser using BRD4 BD1 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3MXF] or BRD4 BD2 (PDB ID code 2YEM) as search models with waters and ligands removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenix was used for refinement of structures, and waters were manually placed using Coot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer outfitted with a cryogenic probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSP analysis was performed using uniformly 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 or BRD4 BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1H,15N HSQC spectra of the BRD4 BD1 and BD2 were collected in the presence of increasing concentrations of either SF2523, SF2535, or SF2558HA in PBS buffer, pH 6.8, 8% D2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Tumor_Growth_and_Metastasis_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vivo efficacy studies, SKNBE2 cells (2 × 106) were inoculated s.c. into nude mice (8 wk old, female, NSG) in the flank area, and tumor growth was monitored regularly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: volume = (length × width2)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tumors reached a tumor volume of 100 mm3 after 30 d of tumor implantation, mice were randomized in two groups (n = 6 animals per group) and were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (DMSO) or SF2523 (50 mg/kg, three times a week) until tumors were harvested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For spontaneous metastasis, orthotopic pancreatic tumors were initiated by implanting 1 × 106 Panc02 into the pancreas of syngeneic mice as described before (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 d of tumor implantation, mice were treated with either (i) 30 mg/kg of SF2523 formulated in 15% DMA + 30% captisol, (ii) 30 mg/kg of JQ1 formulated in 30% captisol in combination with 30 mg/kg of BKM120 formulated in 15% ethanol + 15% cremaphore, (iii) vehicle (15% ethanol + 15% cremaphore, as control), or (iv) another vehicle (15% DMA + 30% captisol, as control) five times a week, until tumors were removed on day 35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures involving animals were approved by the University of California San Diego Animal Care Committee, which serves to ensure that all federal guidelines concerning animal experimentation were met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
