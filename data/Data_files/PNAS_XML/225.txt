Identification of tissue-specific cell death using methylation patterns of circulating DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe a blood test for detection of cell death in specific tissues based on two principles: (i) dying cells release fragmented DNA to the circulation, and (ii) each cell type has a unique DNA methylation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified tissue-specific DNA methylation markers and developed a method for sensitive detection of these markers in plasma or serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the utility of the method for identification of pancreatic -cell death in type 1 diabetes, oligodendrocyte death in relapsing multiple sclerosis, brain cell death in patients after traumatic or ischemic brain damage, and exocrine pancreas cell death in pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach allows minimally invasive monitoring of tissue dynamics in humans in multiple physiological and pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Minimally invasive detection of cell death could prove an invaluable resource in many physiologic and pathologic situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) released from dying cells is emerging as a diagnostic tool for monitoring cancer dynamics and graft failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, existing methods rely on differences in DNA sequences in source tissues, so that cell death cannot be identified in tissues with a normal genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a method of detecting tissue-specific cell death in humans based on tissue-specific methylation patterns in cfDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interrogated tissue-specific methylome databases to identify cell type-specific DNA methylation signatures and developed a method to detect these signatures in mixed DNA samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated cfDNA from plasma or serum of donors, treated the cfDNA with bisulfite, PCR-amplified the cfDNA, and sequenced it to quantify cfDNA carrying the methylation markers of the cell type of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pancreatic -cell DNA was identified in the circulation of patients with recently diagnosed type-1 diabetes and islet-graft recipients; oligodendrocyte DNA was identified in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis; neuronal/glial DNA was identified in patients after traumatic brain injury or cardiac arrest; and exocrine pancreas DNA was identified in patients with pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the tissue origins of cfDNA and thus the rate of death of specific cell types can be determined in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach can be adapted to identify cfDNA derived from any cell type in the body, offering a minimally invasive window for diagnosing and monitoring a broad spectrum of human pathologies as well as providing a better understanding of normal tissue dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_Tissue-Specific_Methylation_Markers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We started by identifying tissue-specific DNA methylation markers distinguishing individual tissues or cell types from other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular attention was given to markers that differ between the tissue of interest and hematopoietic cells, which contribute the majority of cfDNA in healthy individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed publicly available (The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus) and locally generated methylomes to identify individual CpG dinucleotides with differential methylation patterns, i.e., unmethylated in the tissue of interest but methylated elsewhere (SI Materials and Methods and the schematic of the procedure in Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array provides information on the methylation status of individual CpG dinucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discriminatory power of any single CpG is limited, because it can be randomly methylated or unmethylated in a small fraction of molecules from tissues where it typically is unmethylated or methylated, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the assay, we exploited the regional nature of DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined an expanded window of four to nine CpG sites adjacent to the original CpG marker site, reasoning that accidental methylation or demethylation of multiple adjacent cytosines in the same molecule is unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained DNA from different human tissues and treated it with bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then PCR-amplified short fragments containing the signature CpG site and multiple adjacent CpGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplicons were designed to maximize the number of potentially informative CpG sites (to improve specificity in the detection of tissue-specific patterns) while minimizing overall fragment size (to improve the sensitivity of the assay, given that the average size of cfDNA fragments is 165 bp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced multiple molecules from the PCR product using Illumina MiSeq to assess the fraction of molecules with tissue-specific methylation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, as an alternative approach to the comparisons between Illumina methylome arrays, we selected and validated tissue-specific markers based on promoters of known tissue-specific genes (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the examples below, scoring for DNA molecules in which multiple adjacent CpG sites share the same tissue-specific methylation pattern gave a much greater discriminatory power between the tissue of interest and other tissues compared with the information content of individual CpG sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, we have defined short sequences of DNA containing four to nine CpG sites whose combined methylation status constitutes an epigenetic signature unique to a tissue of interest relative to blood cells and other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Presence_of_Unmethylated_INS_Promoter_in_the_Circulation_of_T1D_Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To detect cfDNA derived from  cells, we used the INS promoter as a -cellspecific methylation marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies seeking to identify DNA derived from  cells in peripheral blood samples have used methylation-specific PCR based on the methylation status of two or three CpG dinucleotides in the INS promoter (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the INS promoter contains additional CpG sites in close proximity, which can be used to improve the distinction between DNA of  cells and other tissues (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this concept, we amplified a 160-bp fragment of the INS promoter from bisulfite-treated DNA obtained from multiple tissues and sequenced the product to determine the methylation status of each CpG in each tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1B, each individual CpG was unmethylated in 9095% of the DNA molecules from human  cells and in 515% of the DNA molecules from other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we assessed six sites in combination, we found that six fully unmethylated sites were present in roughly 80% of the DNA molecules from  cells but in less than 0.01% of the molecules from any other tissue, thus giving an extremely high specificity for  cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the sensitivity and linearity of the assay, we spiked human -cell DNA into human lymphocyte DNA in different proportions and determined the frequency of unmethylated INS promoter DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured methylation signal was in excellent correlation with the input material, and -cell DNA could be detected even when diluted 1:1,000 in lymphocyte DNA (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then used this information to look for -cellderived cfDNA in the circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma DNA from healthy volunteers and T1D patients was treated with bisulfite, PCR amplified, and sequenced to determine the fraction of molecules containing fully unmethylated INS promoter DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction obtained was multiplied by the concentration of cfDNA measured in each sample to obtain the concentration of -cellderived DNA circulating in the blood of each patient (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cfDNA of healthy volunteers (n = 31) had an extremely low frequency of fully unmethylated INS promoter molecules (i.e., with all six CpGs unmethylated); less than 0.12% of circulating fragments had this sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When multiplied by the total amount of cfDNA in each individual, we found that less than 0.06 ng cfDNA/mL plasma was derived from  cells (equivalent to 10 genomes/mL), consistent with a very low rate of -cell turnover in healthy adults (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma from all T1D patients sampled 216 wk after diagnosis (n = 11) showed a clear signal of unmethylated INS promoter DNA in cfDNA, (3502,900 copies of unmethylated INS promoter DNA/mL of plasma, equivalent to 1751,450 -cell genomes/mL), indicating ongoing -cell death (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of cfDNA derived from -cells ranged from 0 to 0.1% in controls and from 1.95.5% in patients (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the combined methylation pattern of multiple CpG sites at the INS promoter was necessary to detect -cellderived DNA in the circulation, we examined the methylation status of each individual CpG in the plasma of healthy individuals and of persons with recently diagnosed T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each individual CpG did not have a different pattern in the plasma of healthy controls or of T1D patients (unmethylated in 15% of cfDNA molecules), but collectively the six CpG sites yielded a clear signal in the plasma of T1D patients that was absent in healthy controls (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also studied plasma samples taken from patients with long-standing T1D who had been transplanted with cadaveric allogeneic islets and treated with immune suppressants (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1F, the plasma of all patients (n = 10) had a high signal (unmethylated INS promoter DNA) 12 h after transplantation, which declined dramatically in the hours and days that followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extensive loss of grafted  cells immediately after transplantation is consistent with a previous imaging study of a transplanted patient (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of -cell cfDNA shortly after transplantation were in good correlation with the amount of transplanted islets, presumably because transplanted islets contained a fraction of dead or dying cells (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most patients, signals above background were clearly detected at 7 d and even 1 mo after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the short half-life of cfDNA (2), the observed signals (up to 200 copies/mL plasma) may reflect significant ongoing loss of  cells despite immune suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work will be required to determine if cfDNA levels predict long-term transplant outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current standard assay to assess -cell damage in the transplant setting is plasma c-peptide, which reflects both physiologic insulin secretion and insulin released from damaged or dead  cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hours immediately after transplantation, when patients are maintained in normoglycemic status by exogenous insulin, circulating c-peptide reflects -cell damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, c-peptide levels and unmethylated INS promoter cfDNA were in excellent correlation in the plasma of patients 12 h after transplantation (Fig 1H), supporting the validity of -cell cfDNA as a marker of acute -cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that our NGS-based method represents a highly sensitive and specific assay for the detection of cfDNA derived from specific tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to T1D, signal analysis achieved complete separation between healthy controls and recently diagnosed patients; this result contrasts favorably with previous reports, which demonstrated a significant signal overlap between healthy controls and diabetic patients (2124).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it may be possible to use this assay to reliably identify -cell death before clinical diagnosis (24) as well as in additional settings of interest, such as monitoring the efficacy of immune suppression used to prevent rejection of transplanted  cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Oligodendrocyte-Derived_cfDNA_in_Multiple_Sclerosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noninvasive detection of brain-cell death is particularly challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis that brain-specific methylation patterns can be used to identify brain-derived cfDNA, we looked for evidence of oligodendrocyte DNA circulating in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are autoimmune diseases in which oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cell death occurs and in which the bloodbrain barrier is disrupted (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the published methylome of normal human white matter (30) and identified clusters of adjacent CpG sites in the 3 UTR of myelin basic protein (termed here MBP3) and around an unannotated locus (CG10809560 in the Illumina array, herein WM1 for white matter 1) that were unmethylated selectively in sorted human oligodendrocytes (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the INS promoter, individual CpGs in these clusters had a moderate signal-to-noise ratio, but combining all CpGs at the MBP3 and WM1 loci greatly increased the discrimination between oligodendrocyte DNA and DNA from other sources, including lymphocytes (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DNA fragments from the MBP3 or WM1 loci, when unmethylated in all CpG sites, can serve as an exclusive marker of oligodendrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then spiked human brain DNA into human lymphocyte DNA in different proportions and found excellent correlation between measured methylation signal and the input material, so that oligodendrocyte DNA was detected even when diluted 1:1,000 in lymphocyte DNA (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested if these oligodendrocyte-derived fragments can be found in plasma or serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy individuals (n = 47) had negligible levels of unmethylated MBP3 or WM1 in their circulation, suggesting minimal basal turnover of oligodendrocytes (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, during disease exacerbation (a relapse documented both clinically and using brain MRI close to the time of sampling), most MS patients (14/19) had unmethylated cfDNA of MBP3, WM1, or both in their serum (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable MS patients (n = 30) had a minimal or absent signal in serum (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the notion that short-lived unmethylated MBP3 or WM1 cfDNA reflects acute oligodendrocyte cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial analysis did not reveal clinical correlates to the lack of signal in some relapsing patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No correlation was observed between the signal and age, sex, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or disease duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results indicate that acute oligodendrocyte death can be detected by increased levels of fully unmethylated cfDNA fragments from the MBP3 or WM1 loci, presenting an opportunity for diagnosis and monitoring of demyelinating diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Brain-Derived_cfDNA_After_Acute_Brain_Damage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a more generally applicable marker of brain injury, we scanned the Illumina arrays for loci whose methylation status distinguished brain DNA from other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cluster of nine CpG sites around locus CG09787504 (here termed Brain1) was fully unmethylated in 70% of DNA from various sources of brain tissue (enriched for either neurons or glia) and in less_than5% of DNA molecules from other tissues (likely reflecting DNA from peripheral neurons present in these tissues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, less_than0.03% of molecules in lymphocytes were unmethylated, giving a 2,000-fold difference in methylation of this locus between brain and lymphocytes (Fig 3A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spike-in experiments showed that human cortex DNA can be detected even when diluted 1:1,000 into human lymphocyte DNA and that the signal recorded correlates perfectly with the level of input material (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Healthy individuals (n = 47) had extremely low levels of fully unmethylated Brain1 in serum or plasma (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low baseline signal may reflect minimal physiological neuronal turnover or an alternative mechanism for the clearance of DNA from dying brain cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined serum samples from patients in two scenarios, cardiac arrest and TBI; both situations involve neuronal injury in combination with disruption of the bloodbrain barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following cardiac arrest, patients with documented ischemic brain damage sampled at multiple time points (n = 10 patients, 60 samples) (31) all had high levels of unmethylated Brain1 in serum (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit after severe TBI (n = 15 patients, 102 samples) had elevated unmethylated Brain1 in serum (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sets of results are consistent with cfDNA fragments derived from dead brain cells (neurons or glia) in these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount and temporal patterns of brain-derived cfDNA varied between patients with cardiac arrest and those with TBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the group of patients with cardiac arrest, the strongest signals were observed at the first time point, shortly after resuscitation, with a decline in subsequent days in most patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the group of patients with TBI, a more delayed rise in brain-derived cfDNA was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial analysis did not reveal a correlation between brain cfDNA and levels of the brain damage biomarker NFL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger studies may be required to identify correlations between brain cfDNA and clinical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings indicate that, based on unique methylation markers, brain-specific DNA as well as oligodendrocyte-specific DNA can be identified in the circulation of patients with neuroinflammatory, traumatic, and ischemic brain pathologies and used to report quantitatively on the rate of brain cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Exocrine_Pancreas-Derived_cfDNA_in_Pancreatic_Cancer_and_Pancreatitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we tested whether the approach can be used to detect cfDNA in the context of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tumors have extensive methylation changes compared with normal tissue, the majority of tissue-specific methylation sites remain intact in tumors (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cell death in tumors should release cfDNA carrying the normal methylation pattern of the source tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is thought to originate from either acinar or duct cells in the exocrine pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used antibodies to FACS-purify duct and acinar cells from cadaveric human material and obtained their methylomes using Illumina 450k arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of these data revealed multiple CpGs that were unmethylated in the exocrine pancreas and methylated in most other tissues, including the endocrine pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected two sites for further analysis and identified clusters of adjacent CpGs that could be used as markers for the exocrine pancreas, distinguishing acinar and ductal cells from other cell types (Fig 4A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spike-in experiments showed that human pancreas DNA can be detected even when diluted 1:1,000 into human lymphocyte DNA and that the signal recorded correlates perfectly with the level of input material (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy subjects (n = 47) had very low levels of unmethylated exocrine pancreas markers in their cfDNA (both plasma and serum), consistent with a low turnover of this tissue (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly half the patients with pancreatic cancer (20/42) displayed exocrine pancreas-derived cfDNA above background level in plasma or serum (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a trend toward a stronger signal in patients with advanced disease, and these patients were more likely to show a signal above background level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, some patients (11/29) with stage 1 and 2 (localized) disease had a clear signal, suggesting this method has the potential to identify cell death in pancreatic cancer at a resectable stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The majority of pancreatic cancers carry somatic mutations in the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma) gene, and these mutations can be detected in blood to monitor tumor cell death (although the presence of mutant KRAS per se does not reveal the tissue origin of mutant DNA) (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the performance of our methylation-based assay with the detection of mutant KRAS, we used sequencing to quantify codon 12/13 KRAS mutations in cfDNA of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected mutant KRAS in 22% of the samples examined (n = 27), all among patients with stage 4 disease; by contrast, 48% of samples showed a methylation signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, there was 59% agreement between the two tests (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work will be needed to compare the sensitivity of KRAS mutation detection in cfDNA and pancreas-derived cfDNA by methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test further the hypothesis that cell death leads to increases in tissue-specific cfDNA irrespective of etiology, we examined the serum of patients with chronic pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, 7 of 10 patients had elevated pancreas-derived cfDNA levels (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No mutant KRAS was found in the serum of patients with pancreatitis (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that patients with pancreatitis had a clearer signal with a marker that was unmethylated in both acinar and ductal cells (regenerating islet-derived 1 alpha; REG1A), whereas patients with pancreatic cancer had a stronger signal with a marker that was preferentially unmethylated in ductal cells (cut-like homeobox 2; CUX2), perhaps reflecting the different epigenetic identities of dying cells in the two pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, cfDNA carrying the methylation patterns of the exocrine pancreas is present in the blood of patients with pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis, reflecting death of exocrine cells in these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Patient_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Locally_Generated_Methylome_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain pure pancreatic  and  cells, we dissociated cadaveric human islets by Trypsin-EDTA solution B (EDTA 0.05%, Trypsin 0.25%, with Phenol Red) into a single-cell suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell pellets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min at room temperature; then a 1% saponin (Sigma)/PBS solution was added to a final saponin concentration of 0.1% for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, cells were washed once in Detergent Wash Buffer (WBd) (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin in PBS×1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For staining, guinea pig anti-insulin (1:500; Abcam) and mouse anti-glucagon (1:800; Abcam) were added for 90 min at room temperature; then cells were washed once in WBd, and CY5 anti-guinea pig (1:500) or CY2 anti-mouse (1:200) secondary antibodies were added to the cell pellet for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed twice in WBd and once in wash buffer without saponin (1% BSA in PBSx1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the cells were filtered using a 5-mL polystyrene round-bottomed test tube with a cell-strainer cap (40-m nylon mesh) designed for flow cytometry applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used BD FACSAria III for sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Duct and acinar cells were isolated from dissociated cadaveric human pancreata as described previously (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cells were stained with cell-surface markers and sorted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform and was processed for Illumina 450k arrays according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_of_Methylation_Biomarkers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue-specific DNA methylation markers were selected by comparing genome-wide methylation data from 35 human tissues generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k BeadChip kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Publically available datasets used for comparison included The Cancer Genome Atlas (bladder, brain, breast, cervix, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, mesenchyme, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, stomach, thyroid, uterus), and Gene Expression Omnibus repositories GSE48472 (blood, liver, muscle, omentum, pancreas, spleen, s.c. fat, buccal swab, hair, saliva), GSE40360 (frontal lobe white matter), GSE53162 (prefrontal cortex, cerebellum), GSE62727 (heart), and GSE40279 (whole blood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we locally generated methylome data for human pancreatic  cells (two replicates), pancreatic  cells (three replicates), pancreatic duct cells, and pancreatic acinar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean beta values for each tissue underwent quantile normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate marker loci were defined as CpG sites with an average methylation beta value less_than0.5 in the tissue of interest, 0.9 in leukocytes, and 0.8 in 90% of tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific CpG sites that were selected for further validation by PCR and sequencing of adjacent CpG sites were as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Methylation_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequenced reads were separated by barcode, aligned to the target sequence, and analyzed using custom scripts written and implemented in Matlab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were quality filtered based on Illumina quality scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were identified by having at least 80% similarity to the target sequences after alignment and containing all the expected CpGs in the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpGs were considered methylated if CG was read and were considered unmethylated if TG was read.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful bisulfite conversion was assessed by analyzing the methylation of non-CpG cytosines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Matlab script used for data processing of amplicon bisulfite sequencing reads is provided in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Defining_the_Sensitivity_of_the_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the linearity and sensitivity limits of our assay, we diluted DNA from specific tissues into lymphocyte DNA (representing the major source of DNA in plasma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated the mixed DNA with bisulfite and PCR amplified markers of the specific tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sequencing the PCR products on MiSeq, we determined the fraction of reads with tissue-specific methylation patterns and used this information to assess the frequency of DNA from the specific tissue in the mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the analysis for different tissue-specific methylation markers used in this study are shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C, 2B, 3B, and 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggest that tissue-specific signals can be detected at dilutions as low as 1:1,000 and that the observed frequency matches well the input frequency of tissue-specific DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Demonstrating_the_Advantage_of_Using_Multiple_Adjacent_CpGs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed above, the methylation pattern of a single CpG usually discriminates poorly between tissues; therefore we defined multiple adjacent unmethylated CpG sites as markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rational for the use of multiple CpGs is that each cytosine might undergo accidental demethylation in an irrelevant tissue, but it is unlikely that multiple adjacent cytosines will all be demethylated accidentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the more adjacent unmethylated cytosines present in a molecule, the less likely the molecule is to derive from irrelevant tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this assumption experimentally, we examined all possible methylation patterns of the INS promoter in the circulation of healthy individuals described in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in detail in Fig S8, the more unmethylated CpG sites in the INS promoter are taken into account, the lower is the background in plasma of healthy people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenomenon was observed in all other markers tested in the paper, namely, that longer stretches of unmethylated CpG sites are less likely to exist in the plasma of healthy individuals (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the use of the methylation status of multiple adjacent CpGs as a way to increase specificity for the tissue of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue-Specific_cfDNA_Versus_Absolute_Levels_of_cfDNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate the concentration of cfDNA derived from a specific tissue, we multiplied the fraction of cfDNA derived from a specific tissue (as determined from the frequency of molecules carrying a tissue-specific methylation pattern) by the concentration of cfDNA measured in each particular patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collective data on the concentration of cfDNA are shown in Fig S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the total levels of cfDNA are elevated in some patients, with a trend toward elevation in particular pathologies, this information alone is not sufficient to make conclusions about cell death in specific tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in some cases (e.g., in many T1D patients), the general level of cfDNA is not changed significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the concentration of total cfDNA is influenced by technical issues related to sample preparation, particularly white cell lysis before plasma/serum separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these issues underscore the necessity of using tissue-specific methylation markers to detect cell death in particular tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The dynamics of cell death in vivo remain largely inaccessible to noninvasive investigation and diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assays presented herein rely on two well-established principles in biology, namely, that dying cells release cfDNA and that each tissue has a unique DNA methylation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these principles allowed us to identify the tissue origins of cfDNA and hence to assess the rate of cell death in tissues of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unique feature of the method is the ability to detect cfDNA derived from tissues with normal genomes that are not accessible to mutation-based or genomic variant-based cfDNA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of principle we assessed six tissue-specific methylation markers in 600 plasma/serum samples from 200 individuals and demonstrated the presence of tissue-specific cfDNA in patients with T1D (-cell DNA), MS (oligodendrocyte DNA), brain damage caused by TBI or cardiac arrest (neuron or glia DNA), and pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis (exocrine pancreas DNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, a considerable proportion of patients had tissue-specific cfDNA at levels far above baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proof-of-principle study did not allow a full assessment of the diagnostic performance of our assay, but there is a reason to believe that measurements of cfDNA methylation-based cell death can contribute to clinical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In islet-graft recipients, -cell cfDNA correlated well with acute levels of c-peptide, the standard assay to assess acute graft cell loss; in a chronic setting, cfDNA is expected to be more informative than c-peptide as a measure of -cell death because c-peptide reflects a combination of legitimate insulin secretion and pathologic -cell damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MS, currently available biomarkers include MRI to detect brain lesions and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, indicative of nonspecific neuroinflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be required to compare glial cfDNA and these markers in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and ability to determine disease relapse or activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of brain damage, there is an unmet clinical need for biomarkers to diagnose concussions and to predict outcome in all forms of TBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our study encourage larger studies to determine the utility of this biomarker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pancreatic cancer, there currently are no clinically validated biomarkers for early diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the detection of circulating tumor DNA can provide important information, it does not reveal the tissue of origin of the cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach offers the ability to identify cell death and track tumor dynamics using universal tissue-specific markers without prior knowledge of patient-specific somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability provides a tremendous advantage over existing methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our method does not provide information about the pathology that led to cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision the combination of a screen for oncogenic mutations in cfDNA (which suggests the presence of a growing tumor but does not reveal its tissue of origin) with a search for the tissue origins of cfDNA in the same patients to detect the tissue source of mutant cfDNA and infer the presence of a tumor in a specific organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously published cfDNA assays that detect -cell death in T1D were limited by high background signal in healthy control subjects (21, 22, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpreted this signal as being caused by chance demethylation of CpGs in cfDNA from non-cell tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, we turned to another well-described biologic principle: that in many situations, relevant methylation changes are regional, with the general pattern demonstrated by a number of adjacent CpGs providing a more robust biologic effect than any single CpG alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By interrogating four to nine adjacent CpGs simultaneously (while keeping amplicons as short as possible, to allow amplification from cfDNA fragments), we showed that background signal can be reduced to nearly zero, thus greatly enhancing specificity (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, this strategy retains sufficient sensitivity to detect the presence of as little as 0.10.5% of DNA from the tissue of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For -cells the known uniqueness of insulin expression directed us and others to study the insulin-regulatory regions, but the selection of target loci for other cell types was not trivial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took a genome-wide approach to identify marker genomic loci, and these provided excellent discrimination between the methylation patterns in white matter, brain cells, or exocrine pancreas as opposed to all other tissues tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the resolution of the assay should increase with the use of more methylation markers for each tissue tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our current protocol searches for cfDNA derived from a specific tissue of interest based on one or more unique methylation marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present data on six markers in four different cell types, but the method can be used to identify cell-typespecific makers in any tissue of the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this paper was being prepared for submission, Sun et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) reported a different approach for mapping the tissue origins of plasma DNA using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both approaches rely on tissue-specific methylation patterns, they differ substantially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sun study requires deep and expensive sequencing (currently $1,000 per sample), which may not be practical for routine diagnostics; our approach is based on targeted sequencing of specific markers ($10 per sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Sun study demonstrated the tissue origins of cfDNA in conditions in which the source tissue differs genetically from the host (pregnancy, transplantation, and cancer), whereas we show the origins of cfDNAand infer cell deathin pathologies in which no alternative to methylation exists, e.g., -cell death in diabetes and brain cell death in MS and head trauma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we present a method for the detection of cell death in specific tissues, based on tissue-specific methylation patterns in circulating DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach may have multiple applications, including assessment of tissue damage after injury, evaluation of both targeted and off-target (toxicity) cell death in response to therapy, and early diagnosis of diseases such as T1D, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its use will require a deeper understanding of the rules that govern cfDNA dynamics and of the baseline distribution of tissue-specific cfDNA in different individuals across a variety of physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the long run, we envision a new type of blood test aimed at the sensitive detection of tissue damage without a priori suspicion of disease in a specific organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that such a tool will have broad utility in diagnostic medicine and in the study of human biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All clinical studies were approved by the relevant local ethics committees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study in cardiac arrest patients was approved by the Ethics Committee at Uppsala University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study in patients with TBI was approved by the Ethics Committee at University of Gothenburg, Sweden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in patients with pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis were approved by the Ethics Committees of the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center of Jerusalem, Sheba Medical Center, Israel; and the Department of Surgery, Philipps University of Marburg, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study in patients with T1D was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Florida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study with islet-graft recipients was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Alberta, Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study with MS and NMO patients was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was obtained from all subjects or from their legal guardians before blood sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fully de-identified samples were shipped to the Hebrew University Medical School for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Materials and Methods for detailed information about patient selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biomarkers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue-specific methylation biomarkers were selected after a comparison of extensive genome-wide DNA methylation datasets generated using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k BeadChip array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Materials and Methods for a detailed explanation of the datasets used and the method for selecting tissue-specific methylation markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect mutant KRAS in plasma, bisulfite-treated cfDNA was PCR amplified using primers flanking codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene and specific for bisulfite-treated DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Preparation_and_DNA_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood samples were collected in plasma-preparation tubes or serum-separator tubes and were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,320 × g within 2 h after collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments with T1D patients were performed using plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS, TBI, cardiac arrest, and pancreatitis studies were performed using serum because of the limited availability of archived material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pancreatic ductal adenoma carcinoma samples were both serum and plasma, with no consistent differences detected between the sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control samples were matched to patient samples in volume and method of preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, we found that both plasma and serum allowed effective detection of methylation patterns in cfDNA; however we prefer the use of plasma given the reduced levels of DNA derived from lysed blood cells (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-free DNA was extracted from 0.21 mL of serum or plasma using the QIAquick kit (Qiagen) and was treated with bisulfite (Zymo Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA concentration was measured using Qbit single-strand molecular probes (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bisulfite-treated DNA was PCR amplified, using primers (SI Materials and Methods) specific for bisulfite-treated DNA but independent of methylation status at monitored CpG sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were bar-coded, allowing the mixing of samples from different individuals when sequencing products using MiSeq (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing was performed on PCR products using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (MiSeq, Illumina method).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequenced reads were separated by barcode, aligned to the target sequence, and analyzed using custom scripts written and implemented in Matlab (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were quality filtered based on Illumina quality scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were identified by having at least 80% similarity to target sequences and containing all the expected CpGs in the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpGs were considered methylated if CG was read and were considered unmethylated if TG was read.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficiency of bisulfite conversion was assessed by analyzing the methylation of non-CpG cytosines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the significance of differences between groups, we used a two-tailed MannWhitney test based on values of unmethylated tissue-specific DNA in each patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
