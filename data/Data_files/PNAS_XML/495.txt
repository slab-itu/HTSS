Perspectives on the role of mobility, behavior, and time scales in the spread of diseases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamics, control, and evolution of communicable and vector-borne diseases are intimately connected to the joint dynamics of epidemiological, behavioral, and mobility processes that operate across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that accounts for the pattern regularity exhibited by a large number of hostparasite systems, including those sustained by hostvector epidemiological dynamics, is but one of the challenges facing the coevolving fields of computational, evolutionary, and theoretical epidemiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hostparasite epidemiological patterns, including epidemic outbreaks and endemic recurrent dynamics, are characteristic to well-identified regions of the world; the result of processes and constraints such as strain competition, host and vector mobility, and population structure operating over multiple scales in response to recurrent disturbances (like El Niño) and climatological and environmental perturbations over thousands of years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore important to identify and quantify the processes responsible for observed epidemiological macroscopic patterns: the result of individual interactions in changing social and ecological landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this perspective, we touch on some of the issues calling for the identification of an encompassing theoretical explanatory framework by identifying some of the limitations of existing theory, in the context of particular epidemiological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fostering the reenergizing of research that aims at disentangling the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics, better understood as complex adaptive systems, is a key aim of this perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Lagrangian_Approach_of_Modeling_Mobility_and_Infectious_Disease_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in disease risk exist between countries as a function of localized poverty, sanitary/phytosanitary conditions, access to healthcare, levels of education, cultural practices, and norms with travel and trade overcoming the natural boundaries provided by these factors in limiting the spread of pests and pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative impact of the use of cordons sanitaires to limit the spread of Ebola in West Africa highlight the importance of developing and implementing novel approaches aimed at ameliorating the impact of disease outbreaks in areas of the world that cannot respond in a timely manner to novel disease outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that systematically disentangles the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic perspectives on disease dynamics becomes not only evident but necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Classical mathematical epidemiology uses per capita contact rates (who mixes with whom or who interacts with whom) as the social dynamics currency responsible for the transmission dynamics of communicable diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision disease transmission as the result of the collisions between individuals or as a consequence of the movement/relocation of individuals, never identified by placed of residence, from patch to patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has had great practical and theoretical successes; the scholarly and extensive review in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45 addresses this view within homogenous and (heterogeneous mixing) age-structure populations (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have also addressed the issue of homogeneity of contacts in epidemiology through network-based analyses that identify host contact patterns and clusters (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4749 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An extensive relatively recent review paper is ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach by focusing on how each individual is connected within the population has been able to address the effects of host behavioral response on disease prevalence (see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, 57, and 58 for a review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other approaches included the effect behavioral changes triggered by fear and/or awareness of disease (5254, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this stress-induced behavior may be of benefit to public health efforts in some cases, it can also cause somewhat unpredictable outcomes (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the fact remains that our ability to determine (hence define) what an effective contact is in the context of communicable diseases, that is, our ability to measure the average number of contacts that a typical patch resident has per unit of time and where, has been hampered by high levels of uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, when we ask, what is the average number of contacts that an individual has while riding a packed subway in Japan or Mexico City, or what is the average number of contacts that an individual has at a religious event involving hundreds of thousands of people, including pilgrimages, one quickly arrives at the conclusion that different observers are extremely likely to arrive at a highly distinct understanding and quantification of the frequency, intensity, and levels of heterogeneity involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, this perspective puts emphasis on the use of a different currency (residency times) because measuring contacts at the places where the risk of infection is the highest, pilgrimages, massive religious ceremonies, Woodstock time events, packed subways, and other forms of mass gathering or transportation have not been done to the satisfaction of most researchers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk of acquiring an infectious disease within a flight can be measured at least in principle as a function of the time that each individual of x-type spends flying, the number of passengers, and the likelihood that an infectious individual is on board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, measuring the risk of acquiring tuberculosis, an airborne disease that may spread by air circulation in a flight, may be more a function of the duration of the flight and the seating arrangement than the average number contacts per passenger within the flight (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, replication studies that measure risk of infection in a given environment may indeed be possible under a residency times model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, the risks of acquiring an infection can be quantified as a function of the time spent (residency time) within each particular environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lagrangian modeling approach builds (epidemiological) models by tracking individuals patch-residence times or by budgeting their contacts according to the time spent on each environment (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of these models increase when we have the ability to assess risk as a patch-specific characteristic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, the lack of preference on the use of contacts is not tied to their proven intellectual value or the use of a Lagrangian modeling perspective but rather to the difficulties that must be faced when the goal is to measure the average number of contacts per type-x individual in the environments that facilitate transmission the most.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lagrangian approach is highlighted here via the formulation of a disease model involving the joint dynamics of an n-patch geographically structured population with individuals moving back and forth from their place of residence to other patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these patches (or environments) is defined by its associated risk of residency-time infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patch risk measurements account for environmental, health, and socioeconomic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lagrangian approach (6163) keeps track of the identity of the host regardless of their geographical/spatial position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of Lagrangian modeling in living systems was, to the best of our knowledge, pioneered and popularized by Okubo and Levin (62, 63) in the context of animal aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Lagrangian approaches have also been used to model human crowd movement and behavior (6467) and in the context of bioterrorism (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here host-residence status and mobility across patches is monitored with the help of a residence times matrix =(pij)1i,jn, where pij is the proportion of time residents of Patch i spend in Patch j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Letting Ni denote the population of Patch i predispersal, that is, when patches are isolated, we conclude that effective population size in Patch i, at time t, is given by j=1npijNj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the effective population within each patch must account for the residents and visitors to Patch i at time t. A typical susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model captures this Lagrangian approach in an n Patch setting via the following system of nonlinear differential equations:{Si=bidiSi+iIij=1n(Siinfected in Patchj)Ii=j=1n(Siinfected in Patchj)iIidiIi,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where bi, di, and i denote the constant recruitment, the per capita natural death, and recovery rates, respectively, in Patch i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective population j=1npijNj in each Patch i,i=1,,n includes j=1npijIj infected individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the infection term is modeled as follows:[Siinfected in Patchj]=jj×pijSiij×k=1npkjIkk=1npkjNkj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The likelihood of infection in each patch is tied in to the environmental risks, defined by the transmission/risk vector B=(1,2,,n)t and the proportion of time spent in particular area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Letting I=(I1,I2,,In)t, N¯=(b1d1,b2d2,,bndn)t, N=tN¯, d=(d1,d2,,dn)t, and =(1,2,,n)t allows to rewrite System 1 in the following single vectorial formI=diag(N¯I)diag(B)diag(N)1tIdiag(d+)I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamics of the disease in all of the patches depends on the patch connectivity structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if the residence time matrix  is irreducible, patches are strongly connected, then System 2 supports a sharp threshold property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the disease dies out or persists (in all patches) whenever the basic reproduction number R0 is less than or greater than unity (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R0 is given byR0=(diag(N¯)diag(B)diag(N)1tV1),where  denotes the spectral radius and V=diag(d+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of the system when the matrix  is not irreducible can be characterized using the following patch-specific basic reproduction numbers:R0i()=ii+di×j=1n(ji)pij((pijbidi)k=1npkjbkdk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The disease persists in Patch i whenever R0i()1, whereas the disease dies out in Patch i if pkj=0for allk=1,..,n,andki,providedpij0 and R0i()less_than1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patch-specific disease persistence can be established using the average Lyapunov theorem (68) (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Model 2, human behavior is crudely incorporated through the use of a constant mobility matrix .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role that adaptive human behavior may play in response to disease dynamics is captured, also rather crudely, via a phenomenological approach that assumes that individuals avoid or spend less time in areas of high prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is captured by placing natural restrictions on the entries of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inequalities pij(Ii,Ij)Ij0 and pij(Ii,Ij)Ii0, for (i,j){1,2}, guarantee the expected behavioral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of such dependency could be captured by the following functions: pii(Ii,Ij)=ii+iiIi+Ij1+Ii+Ij and pij(I1,Ij)=ij1+Ii1+Ii+Ij, for (i,j){1,2} and ij=pij(0,0), are such that j=12ij=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation below shows how a crude, density-dependent modeling mobility approach can alter the expected disease dynamics from those generated under constant  (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the special case, where there is no movement between patches (p12=p21=12=21=0), that is, there is no behavioral change, the two populations support, as expected, the same dynamics (see the blue curves in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The speed at which the vector-borne Zika virus disease has spread throughout Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean (now hitting Mexico and the United States) is strongly linked to human mobility patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Travelers transport the disease and infect native mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, it is assumed that vector mobility is negligible and proceeds to incorporate the life history and epidemiology of mosquitoes (6974), which can be effectively captured by decoupling hostvector mobility (71, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 and System 3 illustrate the approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Lagrangian model based on residence times has been proposed recently for vector-borne diseases like Dengue, malaria, and Zika (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appropriateness of the Lagrangian approach for the study of the dynamics of vector-borne diseases lies also in its assessment of the life-history specifics of the vector involved (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lagrangian approaches have been used to model vector-borne diseases (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7680 and other references contained therein), albeit these researchers have not considered the impact that the residencytime matrix  may have on patch effective population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  76 and 78, the effects of movement on patch population size at time t are ignored, namely, the population size in each patch j is fixed at Nj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  77, it is assumed that human mobility across patches does not produce any net change on the patch population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in Model 3 the relationship between each patch population and mobility are dynamic and explicitly formulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the limited (vector mobility is ignored) Lagrangian approach used here to model the dynamics of vector borne diseases captures some unique features because the spatial structure of mosquitoes is not the same as that of humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes are stratified into m patches (that may represent, for example, oviposition or breeding sites or forests) with infection taking place still within each patch j, characterized by its particular risk vhaj for j=1,,m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, vh represents the infectiousness of human to mosquitoes bite with aj denoting the per capita biting rate in Patch j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hosts, on the other hand, are structured by social groups or age classes (n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residency habitat division can be particularly useful in the study of the impact of target control strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23 describes the interactions of n host groups in m patches via System 3, where Ih=[Ih,1,Ih,2,,Ih,n]t, Iv=[Iv,1,Iv,2,,Iv,m]t, Nh=[Nh,1,Nh,2,,Nh,n]t, N¯v=[N¯v,1,N¯v,2,,N¯v,m]t, =[1,2,,m]t, a=[a1,a2,,am]t, and =[1,2,,n]t. The infected hosts are denoted by the vector Ih and the host population by Nh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infected vectors are denoted by Iv and the mosquito population by Nv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters ai, i, and v denote the biting, death rate of control, and natural death rate of mosquitoes in Patch j, for j=1,,m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infectiousness of human to mosquitoes is vh, whereas the infectiousness of mosquitoes to humans is given by hv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host recovery and natural mortality rates are given, respectively, by  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the matrix  represents the proportion of time host of Group i, i=1,,n, spend in Patch j, j=1,,m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic reproduction number of Model 3, with m patches and n groups, is given by R02(m,n)=(MvhMhv), whereMhv=hvdiag(a)diag(tNh)1diag(Nv)tdiag(+)1andMvh=vhdiag(Nh)diag(tNh)1diag(a)diag(v+)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the hostvector network configuration is irreducible, then System 3 is cooperative and strongly concave with an irreducible Jacobian, and so the theory of monotone systems, particularly Smiths results (81), guarantee the existence of a sharp threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R02(m,n) is less than unity and a unique globally asymptotic stable interior endemic equilibrium exists otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of various forms of heterogeneity on the basic reproduction number has been explored in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23, and we have found, for example, that the irreducibility of the residence time matrix  is no longer sufficient to ensure a sharp threshold property, albeit the irreducibility of the hostvector network configuration is necessary for such property (23).{Ih=vhdiag(NhIh)diag(a)diag(tNh)1Ivdiag(+)IhIv=hvdiag(a)diag(NvIv)diag(tNh)1tIhdiag(v+)Iv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lagrangian approach of disease modeling can use contacts (60) or residency times or both as its currency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we choose timespatial-dependent risk, that is, we choose to handle social heterogeneity by keeping track of individuals social or geographical membership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is possible to include adaptive responses, for example, via the inclusion of prevalence-dependent dispersal coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setting, the underlying hypothesis is that host behavioral responses to disease are automatic: either constant or following a predefined function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average residence time  incorporates the average behavior of all hosts in each patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is rather crude because it implicitly assumes that hosts have accurate information on health status and patch prevalence and respond to risk of infection accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of the role that human decisions, as a function of what individuals value and the cost that individuals place on these choices and tradeoffs, within systems that account for the overall population disease dynamics has been recently addressed (2, 25) and is discussed in Economic Epidemiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Economic_Epidemiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simple EEMs are built on classical compartmental epidemiological models that account for the orderly transition of individuals facing a communicable disease, through the susceptible, infected, and recovered disease stages: the result of social and environmental interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEMs assume that the amount of activity one participates in, with whom, and where may all be envisioned as the solutions to an individual decision problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further assumed that individual decision problems are generated by rational-value formulations based on (driven by) personal, real or perceived, cost of disease and disease avoidance: decisions constrained by underlying population-level disease dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, finding effective ways of modeling rational values connections to individualized costbenefit analyses of disease risk is central to the building of potentially useful EEMs and is quite challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EEM approaches have precursors in the epidemiological literature (8284).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEM construction has been strongly influenced by past and ongoing work on the exploitation of species (8587), a literature that addresses optimal harvesting questions in the context of wild species, or the control of invasive pests, or the management of forestry system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methodology for modeling behavior within an EEM rests on a proper specification of behavioral costs and a description of the payoffs linked to such behaviors; the stipulation of an appropriate objective function, congruent with the decision-makers goals; the coupling to the dynamics of the natural resource and/or infectious human capital; and the mechanisms available for a decision-maker to alter his or her behavior and the behaviors of those around him or her.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all motivations for mitigation against infection are not monetary in nature, we continue to call them economic, in keeping with previous published literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeling whether or not an individual undertakes infection causing behavior provides a classic starting point, because it is connected to the rate of generation of secondary cases of infection per unit of time, the so-called incidence rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple incidence function that captures the instantaneous expectation of the number of new infections at a given time is given byS(t)cPSI(t),where S(t) is the number of individuals susceptible to the disease, c is the average amount of activity they engage in, PSI(t) is the probability that a unit of such activity takes the susceptible individual in contact with infectious individuals/material, and  is the probability that such contact successfully infects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A decision to reduce the volume of activity one engages in (lowering c) has been shown in many cases to be phenomenologically identical to reducing ones chances of coming in contact with infection (lowering PSI(t)) by altering where the activity takes place and with whom one engages or by substituting a particular behavior for a riskier one (5, 88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeling assumes that individuals derive benefits from making contacts but may incur costs associated with an infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the modeling assumes that activity volume or contacts are chosen to maximize expected utility (rudimentarily, benefit less cost), balancing the marginal value of a contact against the increased risk of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The utility function is assumed to depend on the health status of the individual and the contacts that they make, that is, the utility of a representative individual of health status h is given, for example, by the functionUh=U(h,Ch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The utility function is assumed to be concave, decreasing in illness and increasing in contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the probability of transitioning from susceptible to infected health status depends on the number of contacts, the optimal choice of contacts is the solution to a dynamic programing problem:Vt(h)=maxCs{Ut(ht,Cth)+rjhjVt+1(j)},[5]where r is the discount rate and hj is the probability of transition from health state h to health state j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probability depends on the current state of the system, {S(t),I(t),R(t)}, the behavior of individuals in other health classes, Ch, and the behavior of individuals in the decision-makers own health class, C¯h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, we have a complex adaptive system where individuals within the model, in this example, impact disease outcomes (through changes in the incidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5 are both optimized from an individual perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this individual context, EEMs have shown that individual distancing, conditional on health status, plays an important role in the spread of infectious disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has also been shown that the provision of incentives for infectious individuals to self-quarantine is likely to be welfare-enhancing (25, 26, 89, 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, understanding how the individual responds to relative costs of disease and disease prevention is critical to the design of public policy that affects those costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the role of recovered individuals in protecting susceptible individuals has been generally overlooked in public health interventions, and yet it is known that their behavior is, in fact, critical to disease management due to the positive externality the individuals contacts generate once in an immune, nondisease-transmitting state (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits of herd immunity include the positive externality associated with acquired immunity but may, in turn, be nullified by nontargeted social-distancing policies that induce such immune individuals to reduce contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By incentivizing the maintenance of contacts by recovered individuals policy may lower the probability of susceptible individuals contacting infected individuals and/or allow susceptible and infected individuals to individually increase contacts without changing the probability of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Theoretical epidemiology aims to disentangle the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of behavior and individual decisions in response to a changing epidemic landscape has not been tackled systematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this rather succinct and biased perspective, we expand on alternative ways for modeling disease transmission that can use contacts as its currency or residency times or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the overwhelming use of contacts as the most common currency of transmission and its undeniable theoretical value, it seems evident to these researchers that contacts, in the context of influenza, Ebola, tuberculosis, or other communicable diseases (as opposed to sexually transmitted diseases), cannot be measured effectively in settings where the risk of acquiring such infections is the highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, when contact-based models are fitted to data, it has become clear that contact rates play primarily the role of fitting parameters; in other words, if the goal is connecting models to data that include transmission mechanisms, then the use of contacts has serious shortcomings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if we are to advance the role of theory, we need models that are informed by data, and the need to reinvest efforts to bring forth alternative modes of modeling becomes pressing (Lagrangian approaches that extends the functionality of classical models while requiring only functional contacts whenever infection takes place).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling approaches that require parameters like residence times and average time to infection for a given environment (risk), that is, parameters that can be measured, should be further investigated and their analyses contrasted to those that involve contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the use of Lagrangian models parametrized in this fashion are likely to increase the give and take necessary for theory and data to modify, expand, or even reinvent the way that we look and think about the dynamics and evolution of infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SARS, influenza, and Ebola epidemics have shown the dramatic role that individual decisions play on the dynamics of infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have revisited recent work that equates behavior with cost-benefit decisions, which, in turn, are linked, within our framework, to health status and population-level dynamics, the components of a complex adaptive system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Connecting the Lagrangian movement-modeling approach with what we have described here as EEMs seems promising, albeit computationally and mathematically challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  91, the perception that the benefits of disease control are limited by the capacity of the weakest link in the chain to respond effectively is not a basic result of EEM models, which actually show that it may not be in within the individual in a poor community/country to do actually more risk mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the need for richer communities or nations to find ways to incentivize greater levels of disease-risk mitigation in poor countries may be, in fact, the best approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
