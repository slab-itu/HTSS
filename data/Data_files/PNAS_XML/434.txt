Using seafaring simulations and shortest-hop trajectories to model the prehistoric colonization of Remote Oceania  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The colonization of Remote Oceania between 3400 and 800 B.P.from multiple origin points and across hundreds or thousands of kilometers of open oceanrepresents some of the most impressive population dispersals on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For decades, scholars have sought to explain when and how these occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that seafaring simulation techniques coupled with sophisticated analyses of climatic data, including the role of El Niño Southern Oscillation events and island distribution on ancient voyaging, are critical comparative tools for understanding the variablesculturally, technologically, and environmentallythat structured movement across the worlds largest ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also pinpoint likely departure points for ancient Pacific Islanders that in some cases support or negate current archaeological and other lines of evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The prehistoric colonization of islands in Remote Oceania that began 3400 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  represents what was arguably the most expansive and ambitious maritime dispersal of humans across any of the worlds seas or oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though archaeological evidence has provided a relatively clear picture of when many of the major island groups were colonized, there is still considerable debate as to where these settlers originated from and their strategies/trajectories used to reach habitable land that other datasets (genetic, linguistic) are also still trying to resolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these issues, we have harnessed the power of high-resolution climatic and oceanographic datasets in multiple seafaring simulation platforms to examine major pulses of colonization in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis, which takes into consideration currents, land distribution, wind periodicity, the influence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and shortest-hop trajectories, demonstrate that (i) seasonal and semiannual climatic changes were highly influential in structuring ancient Pacific voyaging; (ii) western Micronesia was likely settled from somewhere around the Maluku (Molucca) Islands; (iii) Samoa was the most probable staging area for the colonization of East Polynesia; and (iv) although there are major differences in success rates depending on time of year and the occurrence of ENSO events, settlement of Hawaii and New Zealand is possible from the Marquesas or Society Islands, the same being the case for settlement of Easter Island from Mangareva or the Marquesas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For western Micronesia (Tables S1 and S2), simulations of downwind sailing are conducted from nine origin points: Taiwan; Luzon (northern Philippines); Samar (central Philippines); southeast of Mindanao (southern Philippines); Halmahera (Maluku Islands); western, central, and eastern New Guinea; and the Bismarck Archipelago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downwind simulations are also conducted between Palau and the Marianas in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For origins from central and eastern Micronesia (Table S3), the four departure points used in downwind sailing simulations include the western and eastern Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following voyages were evaluated by both downwind and directed sailing experiments: (i) from Samoa to the Marquesas and to the Society Islands; (ii) from the Marquesas and Society Islands to Hawaii and to Easter Island; and (iii) from the Society Islands to New Zealand (Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Land_Distribution_and_Shortest-Hop_Trajectories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The change in spatial resolution of the land distribution data are performed to facilitate processing and done via linear interpolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make sure the procedure did not generate spurious results, we compare the courser (1.8 km) set against coastlines from the version 2.3.4 of the Global Self-Consistent, Hierarchical, High-Resolution Geography Database (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis indicates no land areas are lost or created during the interpolation of the original GEBCO data from 900 to 1,800-m resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are indications that between 3000 and 1500 B.P., relative sea level in at least some areas within the region of interest was 1 m higher than today (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the effect of sea level change on our results, short-hop trajectories are also determined, in addition to the current state, for conditions in which sea level is raised by 1 and 2 m relative to present day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the assumption that small islands are harder to locate and reach, additional paths are generated based on maps from which islands smaller than 1.8 × 1.8 km and then 3.6 × 3.6 km are removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectories are also generated for maps that combine the effects of sea level change and minimum island size cutoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to test trajectory robustness, short-hop paths based on the second and third closest islands to the east are calculated for all sea level and land distribution configurations described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selection of three sea levels; three island-size cutoff maps; and closest, second closest, and third closest paths results in 27 shortest-hop trajectories being generated for each departure point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many trajectories started from the same point, but established under different controlling parameters, overlap, which we take as an indication of the methods robustness (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If no restrictions are applied, shortest-hop paths initiated at the Philippines and Maluku Islands result in trajectories that move southeast to New Guinea, the Solomons, and then into islands in East Polynesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate crossings into Micronesia from starting points in the Philippines and Maluku Islands, the New Guinea and the Solomon groups are removed from the analysis by setting their land bins to ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Mindanao and the Malukus are removed for the central Philippine departures, and the Maluku Islands removed for the southern Philippines departures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the potential path from the central portion of the northern New Guinea coast to the Marianas, we generate a directed shortest-hop trajectory, which contains a destination point in addition to the initial departure one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual hops along this type of trajectory are given by the shortest crossing from the present position that at the same time decreases the distance to the destination point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wind_and_Precipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis focuses on seasonal as well as the interannual variability associated with ENSO cycles that have a periodicity ranging from 27 y and are comprised of an El Niño, or warm phase, and a La Niña, or cold phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the temporal scales of interests, wind data are averaged into daily, monthly seasonal, and annual values with precipitation averaged into seasonal and annual values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wind and precipitation analysis are conducted at the original spatial resolution of the datasets: 1 × 1° for wind and 2.5 × 2.5° for precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The adopted present-day data provide significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution than available proxies, and very likely, a better representation of variability than paleo models do for the period of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, there are many indications that the present-day atmospheric patterns over the low-latitude Pacific, including the variability associated with ENSO, had been established by 3000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Data_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The analysis is conducted with the Seascape model and based on monthly current and wind data from the US Navy Marine Climatic Atlas of the World Version 1.1 (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model randomly selects frequency-weighted wind and current data from the Marine Climatic Atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wind and current forces are allowed to operate on vessels for a period of 24 h and then a new selection is made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the precise vessel type used in the region at the time is unknown, generalized speeds for small vessels under various wind and current forces are used (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels are either sailed before the wind (downwind sailing) or given a heading toward target islands (directed sailing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the directed-sailing simulations, vessels are provided with minimum headway from 1.852 to 5.556 km/h [13 knots (kn)]in other words, approaching the target island by a minimum of 44.5133.3 km (2472 nautical miles) a day regardless of wind direction (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum voyage duration is set to 200 d, reflecting survival limits of known drift voyages (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred voyages are simulated from each point of origin beginning in all 12 months of the year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Success is achieved after coming within detection distance of 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) from the islands (16) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The necessary minimum headway speed is likely unrealistic given average conditions, particularly for crossings from the Marquesas Islands to Hawaii, the Society Islands to Hawaii, and the Society Islands to New Zealand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossings from Samoa to the Marquesas and Societies are likely feasible given sufficient windward sailing efficiency, although this would be greater than the generalized speeds for the vessels used in the downwind sailing simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that there is some debate as to whether windward sailing capabilities were limited or absent during the era of colonization (17, 18); this would apply to the directed simulations to Easter Island from the Marquesas and Society Islands, but there is also the problem of the target being very small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining a consistent heading over the distance would be extremely difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Environmental_Data_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Land distribution comes from a global gridded bathymetry data set (19) with a resolution of 0.0083° (900 m at the equator) interpolated to 0.017° (1.8 km at the equator) before our analysis (SI Data and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are used to determine shortest-hop trajectories, defined as trajectories that would be formed if eastward displacement took place by a sequence of crossings in which each individual crossing always reaches the closest island to the east of the departure island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze trajectories starting from the easternmost limits of the central and southern Philippines, Maluku Islands, and Solomon Islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for uncertainties in the methodology and potential changes in sea level, 27 shortest-hop trajectories are generated for each departure point (SI Data and Methods and Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce trajectories into Micronesia, some landmasses to the south of departure points in the Philippines and Maluku Islands are removed from these experiments (SI Data and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wind data come from the ERA-Interim Reanalysis (20) with 1 × 1° spatial resolution and one estimate every 6 h. Monthly gridded precipitation values based on satellite and rain gauge measurements with 2.5 × 2.5° resolution come from the GPC Project (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wind and precipitation are analyzed from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of a present-day wind and rain data are based on the assumption that current, observation-based values offer the best available representation of atmospheric conditions in the area at 3000 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (SI Data and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assuming periods of constant westerly (toward the east) winds could play a role in voyaging strategy, we determine duration and location of westerly spells, defined as periods during which daily averaged winds flow continuously to the east.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spells are used to generate potential spell eastward displacement P, given byP=Ude,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where d is spell duration, U is average westerly wind speed during spells of duration d and e, and a downwind sailing efficiency of 0.5, based on published values (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our choice of e results in vessel speeds from 2.25 to 4 kn (4.69 km/h), well within the speed range of traditional Pacific watercraft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Colonization_of_Micronesia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Though easterly (toward the west) winds dominate the annually averaged flow over the southern and central Philippines and most of Micronesia, the area in the vicinity of the Maluku Islands exhibits mean annual westerly winds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large portions of Micronesia exhibit average westerly winds during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer and fall, and this area of seasonal westerlies expands significantly during El Niño (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strategy of downwind sailing during the relatively common 3- and 5-d westerly spellswhich are more frequent under El Niño conditionswould be capable of providing the easting distance required by all shortest-hop crossings in Micronesia (Fig 2 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  La Niña is associated with easterly wind anomalies that hinder eastward displacement (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Colonization_of_Polynesia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Easterly flow dominates the annually averaged mean wind over West Polynesia, but during the southern hemisphere (SH) summer (December to February), westerly winds are found over a significant area within the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of mean westerlies expands during El Niño summers, reaching as far east as the northern Cook Islands (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Areas with longer westerly spells also expand eastward during El Niño conditions (Fig 1 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the westerly anomalies around the equator, El Niño conditions are also characterized by southerly wind anomalies further south (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of West Polynesia becomes drier during El Niño years, with some increase in precipitation observed over the western portions of East Polynesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  La Niña causes a decrease in precipitation over most of Polynesia in addition to easterly wind anomalies near the equator and northerly anomalies at higher southern latitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wind/distance and shortest-hop analyses coupled with the Seascape simulations demonstrate the significance that seasonal and interannual climatic variability would have had on choices made by ancient voyagers in Remote Oceania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes to precipitation could have acted as motivation for migration and knowledge of how winds change with the seasons and events like ENSO would significantly increase the probability of successful trips (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general El Niño pattern of drier conditions over western portions of Micronesia and Polynesia associated with winds that favor eastward displacement appears to be particularly relevant to the colonization process (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier efforts have recognized downwind sailing as a viable voyaging/island discovery strategy in the Lapita region (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that this is also the case for Micronesia and go on to show that over a large expanse of Oceania, despite average easterly wind conditions, downwind sailing during frequent westerly wind spells is a viable way to travel east (Fig 2 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identified discontinuities in both land distribution and westerly wind occurrence to the east of Samoa are in agreement with models that point to environmental factors as influential in preventing eastward movement of Lapita settlers into Central and East Polynesia for nearly 2000 y (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of successful simulated downwind crossings from Samoa into East Polynesia offer support to the suggestion that this pause in the colonization process was related to the development of technological advances that would allow more efficient windward voyaging (24), though the degree to which this was a viable strategy has been debated (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is considerable debate as to when and how the Mariana Islands were settled prehistorically, with some scholars suggesting that this occurred 3500 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the northern Philippines (1) and others arguing for a more southerly origin (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results point to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea as the more likely sources of voyages to the Mariana Islands, supporting the latter hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present analysis also suggests a strong likelihood that other areas in West Micronesia were settled from the Maluku Islands or somewhere in the near vicinity and not from the northern Philippines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yap remains an enigma archaeologically and linguistically, although it has been suggested that the original colonists may have come from the Bismarck Archipelago (27); our simulations do not discount this scenario, with northwestward movements to and near the Marianas quite possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, in terms of specific islands and crossings, Palau and Samoa appear to have been central nodes for movement into Micronesia and East Polynesia, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity of several artifact types (Conus shell ornaments, Tridacna shell adzes) between late Lapita forms and those found in Central Micronesia, along with the settlement of Kapingamarangi and Nukuoro (Polynesian outliers) further south (13), also suggest a movement from somewhere in island Melanesia, perhaps the Solomons, as evidenced by simulated voyages that are successful, particularly between July and October (1124%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terms of settlement models, our analysis suggests that the Voyaging Corridor Triple I may have some merit given the nearly contemporaneous settlement of West Micronesia and Island Melanesia/West Polynesia between 3400 and 3100 B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that would have likely required the refining of sailing skills through widespread interaction networks and increased recognition of climatic variations shared between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is also supported by human genetic diversity observed in Near Oceania (28), genetic data on rats that suggest Rattus exulans was an intrusive aspect of Lapita colonization (29), and a high degree of linguistic heterogeneity (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mobile Founding Migrant models (5) that proposed a rapid movement into Remote Oceania also seems reasonable given the timing of dispersal and supporting genetic data (29), though it seems clear that the late expansion into East Polynesia was also the result of factors such as land distribution, technological advances in seafaring, and climate (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are indications that post-AD 1000, more favorable winds (22) and changes to long-term mean precipitation, with drier conditions in the west in the increase rainfall over East Polynesia (30) could have promoted eastward colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been suggested that the punctuated temporal pattern of Pacific colonization could be associated to millennial variability of ENSO frequency and intensity and the changes to ease of eastward movement these generate (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, these results provide critical comparative data for examining how Pacific Islanders structured voyaging ventures and the role that environmental variables likely played in decision-making in their efforts to settle the worlds most expansive ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence, from a multitude of perspectives, points to the need for cultural recognition of seasonal and interannual climatic fluctuations and the development of new technologies and seafaring strategies to ensure successful voyages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence also helps to target new areas of research (e.g., the Solomons and Yap) focused on determining how and when these ancient seafarers reached some of the most remote places on earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
