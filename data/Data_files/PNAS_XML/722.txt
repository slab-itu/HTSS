New perspective on spring vegetation phenology and global climate change based on Tibetan Plateau tree-ring data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inconsistent results regarding the rate of change in spring phenology and its relation to climatic drivers on the Tibetan Plateau have been obtained in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce and describe here an innovative approach based on tree-ring data, which converts daily weather data into indices of the start (and end) of the growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method provides a unique long-term record of vegetation phenological variability over the period 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach could further be extended to other forested regions of the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling up the analysis would provide additional information on phenological responses of terrestrial ecosystems to the ongoing climate change across the Northern Hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenological responses of vegetation to climate, in particular to the ongoing warming trend, have received much attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, divergent results from the analyses of remote sensing data have been obtained for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the worlds largest high-elevation region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a perspective on vegetation phenology shifts during 19602014, gained using an innovative approach based on a well-validated, process-based, tree-ring growth model that is independent of temporal changes in technical properties and image quality of remote sensing products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty composite site chronologies were analyzed, comprising about 3,000 trees from forested areas across the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) has advanced, on average, by 0.28 d/y over the period 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The end of the growing season (EOS) has been delayed, by an estimated 0.33 d/y during 19822014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant changes in SOS or EOS were observed during 19601981.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AprilJune and AugustSeptember minimum temperatures are the main climatic drivers for SOS and EOS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase of 1 °C in AprilJune minimum temperature shifted the dates of xylem phenology by 6 to 7 d, lengthening the period of tree-ring formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study extends the chronology of TP phenology farther back in time and reconciles the disparate views on SOS derived from remote sensing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling up this analysis may improve understanding of climate change effects and related phenological and plant productivity on a global scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characteristics_of_Tree-Ring_Phenology_over_the_Period_19602014  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A clear, advancing trend in SOS was observed across the TP during 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaged SOS ranged from the middle of May to the middle of June with a site-specific SD () ranging from 8.8 d to 24.9 d (19602014) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SOS advanced over time at each of the 20 combined sites (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend in 60% of the analyzed series was significant at P  0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an additional 15% of all series, the trend was significant at P  0.05, resulting in a total of 75% of series passing the significance level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the advancing trend of SOS was not significant during the period 19601981 in any of the four subregions (SI Appendix, Table S3), or over the entire study region (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, during the subperiod 19822014, clear (P less_than 0.01) advancing trends were observed in the semihumid and humid subregions (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continued but statistically insignificant (P  greater than  0.01) SOS advance was seen in each of the four subregions from 2000 to 2014, probably due to the short calibration period (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the full study period (19602014), significant (P less_than 0.01) advancing trends were observed in all four subregions (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of advance was 0.28 d/y for the entire study region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 2000 to 2011, we also found a continued but insignificant advancing trend of all of the averaged SOS (slope = 0.41, P = 0.17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the advancing trend (slope = 0.80, P = 0.05) was significant during 20002009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EOS mainly occurred in the middle of September during the period 19602014 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 1960 to 2014, 80% of the combined sites showed significant (P less_than 0.10) delays (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the values for all sites were averaged, we noted clear delaying trends for 19602014 (0.16 d/y) and 19822014 (0.33 d/y) (both P less_than 0.01); whereas the trend for the subperiod 19601981 (0.01 d/y) was not significant (P = 0.95) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the period 19602014, the length of the growing season (LOS) increased significantly (P less_than 0.01) across all subregions, as well as over the entire TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 1982 to 2014, significantly (P less_than 0.05) extended LOSs were identified in all four subregions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, the advancing SOS (0.28 d/y) contributed 64% of the significantly (P less_than 0.01) extended LOSs during the period 19602014, whereas 43% of the extension was contributed during the period 19822014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, due to earlier SOS and delayed EOS, the growing season length increased by 24.2 d during 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tree-Ring_Phenology_Response_to_Climate_Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The correlation (SI Appendix, Fig S8) between climate factors and SOS from 1960 to 1981 showed that pregrowing season temperatures, especially April through June temperatures, significantly affected SOS at 16 of the tree-ring combined sites (P less_than 0.05; henceforth, all significant correlations refer to P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar temperature factors appeared to drive SOS during 19822014 (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen out of 20 combined sites were significantly influenced by April through June mean, minimum, or maximum temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an intensified climatic signal was consistent with a significant (P less_than 0.01) and recognizable spring warming trend since 1982 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the full study period (19602014; SI Appendix, Fig S11), April through June minimum temperatures significantly affected SOS at 18 (90%) of the combined sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative effects of April through June precipitation on SOS were also significant at most of the sampled sites (80% of sites in the arid and semiarid subregions; 60% of sites in the semihumid and humid subregions during the two periods 19822014 and 19602014) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such correlations indicate that higher preseason precipitation generally results in earlier SOS in the study region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also checked correlations for SOS and monthly mean and maximum snow depth (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no detectable trend or pattern in the snow depth data, suggesting that the influence of snow depth on SOS was, at best, ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that, on the regional scale, there was a strong correlation with temperature and precipitation from April to June.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation was stable during 19822014 and throughout the entire study period 19602014 (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial correlation analyses further revealed that, when controlling for April through June precipitation, the correlation between SOS and April through June minimum temperature was 0.69; when controlling for temperature, the correlation with precipitation was 0.35 during the full period 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus suggest that the April through June mean minimum temperature has the strongest influence on TP SOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EOS for all our study subregions was mainly determined by temperatures in the late summer or early autumn (August through September), whereas the effects of precipitation on EOS were statistically insignificant (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At most sites, the temperature influence in the subperiod 19601981 was lower than that during 19822014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the September mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures positively (P less_than 0.05) affected TP EOS during all investigated periods (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest correlation (r = 0.78, P less_than 0.01) was detected between August through September minimum temperatures and EOS during the full 19602014 period (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase of 1 °C in August through September minimum temperatures resulted in a delay of 6.20 d in EOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study developed an innovative approach that combines long-term phenology from remote sensing measurements and tree-ring formation for detecting land surface components in earth system models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the validation of our modeling results with the available monitoring data (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods), our long-term (19602014) tree-ring phenology series is the longest and most robust yet available for the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison_with_Remote_Sensing_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to our modeling results, all averaged tree-ring xylem phenology series showed significant (P less_than 0.01) advancing trends from 1982 to 2014, although different rates were detected within the four subregions of the TP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting and inconsistent results derived from remote sensing data are mainly explainable by different investigation periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the period 19982011, a continuous advancing trend (slope = 0.32 d/y, P = 0.16) of our averaged SOS was identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an advance was also detected by different remote sensing data from AVHRR, SPOT, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (9) over the same period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for the different periods of 19982014 (slope = 0.24 d/y, P = 0.18), 20002009 (0.80 d/y, P = 0.05), 20002011 (slope = 0.41 d/y, P = 0.16), and 20002014 (slope = 0.28 d/y, P = 0.22), consistent advancing trends of SOS were found by our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore argue that analysis of a short time series is not sufficient for reliable trend detection, and, instead, a much longer phenological period is critical in resolving current inconsistencies in results derived from remote sensing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach to establish the longest record of vegetation phenological variability that is also independent of changes in the technical properties of satellite sensors, data coverage, and image quality (e.g., cloudiness) is thus appropriate for addressing such issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The methods in determining phenological dates from the remote sensing datasets may also impart some bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend toward earlier vegetation green-up dates (1.9 d per 10 y) detected by the Gaussian-Midpoint and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS)-Maximum methods was almost 5 times greater than that detected by the Timesat-SavitzkyGolay (SG) method (0.4 d per 10 y) (19), indicating the uncertainty inherent in such remote sensing methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latest vegetation phenological data are based on integrated results by applying multiple methods to remote sensing data (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green-up onset dates represent the consolidated annual mean of the plateau-scale green-up date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the period 20002011, the phenological data were derived from four vegetation indices: three NDVIs from AVHRR, SPOT, and MODIS, and one Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the period 19821999, the data were determined from AVHRR NDVI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five methods were used to derive each vegetation index (for details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared our tree-ring-based phenological series with the remote sensing results of green-up onset dates (20) over the period 19822011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They showed similar decreasing trends, confirming that a marked advance of spring phenology has occurred during the past 30 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Good year-by-year similarity between our modeled SOS and the remote sensing results (20) was also achieved during the common period 19822011 (Fig 3A), as indicated by their significant correlation of 0.63 (P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also found a significant correlation (r = 0.70, P less_than 0.01) with the data of regionally averaged green-up dates (9) for meadow and steppe vegetation types throughout the TP during the period 19822011 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was noted that the remote sensing-retrieved green-up dates were validated by in situ phenological observations from 18 agrometeorological stations on the TP during 20032011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when comparing our modeled SOS with the AVHRR SOS of meadow vegetation derived using White et al.s (22) method (12), we found no significant correlation (r = 0.15, P = 0.58, 19821997), probably due to the SOS retrieval method used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found significant correlations (Fig 3B) with the end date of the growing season for all vegetation types throughout the TP extracted from AVHRR Leaf Area Index (LAI) data (23) during the period 19822011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a correlation (Fig 3B) (r = 0.41, P = 0.11) close to the significant level was found between our modeled EOS and the end date of the growing season for vegetation (meadow) on the TP between 19821997 (12), compared with weak negative correlation (r = 0.15) between our modeled SOS with the AVHRR SOS of vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is understandable because the signal at vegetation green-up times is much weaker and consequently more easily contaminated than at withering times (13, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our models predictions and the vegetation green-up series derived from remote sensing data are closely matched for the period 19822011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model-based tree-ring phenological results reconcile the inconsistency in remote sensing results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that results combining different vegetation indices and methods may be more accurate than those derived from a single index or method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It should be noted that tree-ring-based results provide phenological data for the secondary growth of conifers, whereas remote sensing detects the primary growth of vegetation, including the phenology of shrubs and nonwoody species such as grasses or forbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conifers are evergreen, and their stem cambium activity may start at any time, as soon as a certain thermal threshold (24) or heat sum (25) is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of cambium activity to temperature gradually increases from winter to spring (26), suggesting that either an accumulation of chilling or an increase in day length interact with temperature to initiate the process of cell division in the cambium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NDVI data include greening of herbs and grasses during spring resprouting, or annual plants germinating from seed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process may need a longer time interval or can cause heterogeneities in NDVI response over different vegetation types or regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, species-specific or life-form-specific responses of phenology to climate change can be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant correlation found between remote sensing-derived SOS and our modeling results highlighted that their connection is not casual but robust, although grasses and herbs have more-shallow root systems than trees and therefore might respond differently (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 4-y experiment monitoring the growth of spruce and fir on a weekly basis detected synchronism of primary growth (bud and leaf) and secondary (cambium) growth after budburst over the growing season in boreal conifers in eastern Canada (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar synchronism between primary and secondary meristems was identified by direct observations across spruce ecotypes growing in an ordinary garden (29), and this was confirmed on a wider geographical scale by comparing remote sensing chronologies with intraannual data of xylem formation (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological explanation of the phenological synchronicity between primary and secondary growth remains an issue that is only partially resolved (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, this study identified links in the dynamic of meristems across taxa for a longer time interval than previously obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide an independent reference with which to compare results from previous studies based on remote sensing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationships_Between_Tree-Ring_Phenology_and_Climate_Factors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The April through June minimum temperature appears to have had the highest influence on SOS on the TP during the period 19602014, as also demonstrated for other temperate, boreal, and timberline ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our study region is characterized by high altitudes, it is reasonable that temperature has a significant effect on the starting date of the growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, significant correlations between temperature and SOS were obtained by the principle of limiting factor, i.e., that just one factor can have an impact on a biosystem at any particular moment of time in the VS model simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the period 19601981, the 19822014 phenological data showed a stronger temperature signal, consistent with the observed significant (P less_than 0.01) spring warming after 1982 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, increases in April through June minimum temperatures were correlated with the earlier SOS across the whole region (Fig 2) (see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3133 for supporting evidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase of 1 °C in April through June minimum temperature caused an advance of 6.94 d in the SOS of our study region (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results predicted by our model (7 d per 1 °C) closely matched in situ observations of SOS derived from dendrometer data of Qilian juniper [from an elevational gradient in the northeastern TP (33)] and from microcoring data of European larch from two elevational transects in Switzerland (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both studies were based on the so-called space-for-time/warming experiments approach (34), whereby long-term changes in the timing and duration of tree growth per shift in degree Celsius (i.e., time) are substituted by changes along altitudinal transects (i.e., space).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring results from 1,321 trees belonging to 10 conifer species located at 39 sites in North America, Europe, and Asia (29.62°N to 66.2°N, 72.87°W to 94.7°E, 60 m a.s.l.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to 3,850 m a.s.l.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  also revealed that the length of the wood formation period increased linearly at a rate of 6.5 d per 1 °C (24), which is consistent with our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During winter, the cambium is dormant (35), and growth inactivity of the meristem is maintained even if the environmental requirements (i.e., temperature, water, or day length) are met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In late winter, a change from dormancy to a new state occurs, called quiescence, when growth cannot occur unless the environmentally favorable conditions required are present (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Favorable thermal conditions speed up cell production rates once dormancy has been broken (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warmer spring temperatures also allow cambial cells more time to divide and produce new tracheids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, localized heating experiments have been carried out on tree stems at the end of winter and in early spring, which induced a localized reactivation of the cambium (34, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parts of Europe, a warm spring in 2003 resulted in an earlier onset of cambial activity of around 20 d compared with the succeeding year, 2004 (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these observations were limited to short time periods and small sample sizes, we nonetheless believe that they support our broader argument that spring phenology is mainly driven by temperature variability across large parts of the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some studies (3941) emphasized that snow depth and total precipitation also play an important role in regulating spring vegetation phenology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a study based on 3 y of wood anatomical data (20092011) from five sampled trees in the arid subregion of the northeastern TP (42) indicated that late spring and early summer precipitation played a critical role in the onset of xylogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this finding were true, we could expect a strong correlation between SOS and moisture variability in the arid or semiarid subregions, a somewhat weaker correlation in the semihumid or humid subregions and so on, with the limiting role of precipitation decreasing as the subregion becomes more humid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we see such a pattern in our results (SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a stronger influence of May through June precipitation on SOS in the arid and semiarid subregions compared with that in the semihumid and humid subregions during both subperiods 19601981 and 19822014, as well as in the full study period 19602014 (SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remote sensing based results also confirmed that SOS was more sensitive to interannual variations in preseason precipitation in the more arid areas than in the wetter areas of the TP (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, this study presents an independent series of vegetation phenological records for the TP, covering the period 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an example of an effective, robust approach to the study of phenological variability in a long-term perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach, converting daily weather data into the SOS and EOS dates over the growing season based on a well-validated, process-based tree-ring VS model, represents a major advance in the emerging field of phenoclimatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated phenological series serve as a baseline against which to assess previous results based on other methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular studies using this approach should be conducted to cross-validate observational, remote sensing, and in situ (phenocam) estimates of climate-driven trends in phenological patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling up this analysis would provide additional information on phenological responses of terrestrial ecosystems to ongoing climate change across the Northern Hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Area  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study area covers the TP, which extends from 27°N to 40°N and from 90°E to 101°E, with an average altitude of more than 4,000 m a.s.l.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant vegetation types from southeast to northwest include forest (broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest, and coniferous forest), shrub, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and desert, as well as some intrazonal vegetation types, such as alpine vegetation and cultivated vegetation (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattered tree stands (mostly of juniper trees, Juniperus tibetica) occur as relict forests, growing mainly on south-facing slopes up to 4,700 m a.s.l (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate comparisons, we sorted the locations of all available single-site records into one of four defined climatic subregions (44) (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chronology_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used 50 single-site tree-ring width series covering the period 19602014, in whole or in part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-one series comprised raw measurement data; the others were published standardized tree-ring width chronologies: one from Yikeshu (45) and eight from sites at Zhongtie, Jiangqun, Ningmute, Gongjue, Basu, Mangkang, Bianbamx, and Luolong taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, data from 3,006 trees were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We grouped them into 20 composite sites based on the concordance between chronologies (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matches were required to be significantly correlated at P less_than 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean tree-ring series intercorrelation, signal-to-noise ratio, and expressed population signal of the composite chronologies listed in SI Appendix, Table S2 further justified combining the single-site series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raw measurement data were processed following standard dendrochronological practice (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standardized chronologies were used for successive analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were found when detrending was carried out using a smoothing spline or a negative exponential function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tree-Ring_Growth_Process_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used an updated tree-ring physiological VS procedure (VS-oscilloscope, vs-genn.ru/downloads/) to model the tree-ring growth process and associated climatic drivers (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation can be improved by a priori adjustments of its parameters to reflect local tree growth conditions more accurately (18, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The daily time resolution is one of the strengths of the process model; it is therefore superior to satellite remote sensing data, which have a resolution that can range between 10 d and half a month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process model is thus capable of accurately simulating the response of tree-ring growth to rapidly changing climatic variations (18, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details and validation of the models, see SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trends in tree-ring phenological series were calculated using linear least-squares regression; the statistical significance levels were estimated with two-tailed significance tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlations with climate data were analyzed using the software DendroClim2002 (50) during their common periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty adjoining climate stations close to the tree-ring sampling sites were selected for analysis, starting with the earliest in 1955 and all ending in 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also obtained data for monthly mean and monthly maximum snow depth (51) to explore their relationship with tree-ring phenology variability for the years 19792014, i.e., the period for which comparable datasets were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial correlation analyses were performed to determine the most important factors influencing tree-ring phenological variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
