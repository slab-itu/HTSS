ASTN2 modulates synaptic strength by trafficking and degradation of surface proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurogenetic studies demonstrate that copy number variations (CNVs) in the ASTN2 gene occur in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that ASTN2 associates with recycling and degradative vesicles in cerebellar neurons, and binds to and promotes the endocytic trafficking and degradation of synaptic proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of ASTN2 in neurons increases synaptic activity and reduces the levels of ASTN2 binding partners, an effect dependent on its FNIII domain, which is recurrently perturbed by CNVs in patients with NDDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that ASTN2 is a key regulator of dynamic trafficking of synaptic proteins and lend support to the idea that aberrant regulation of protein homeostasis in neurons is a contributing cause of complex NDDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface protein dynamics dictate synaptic connectivity and function in neuronal circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASTN2, a gene disrupted by copy number variations (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum, was previously shown to regulate the surface expression of ASTN1 in glial-guided neuronal migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that ASTN2 binds to and regulates the surface expression of multiple synaptic proteins in postmigratory neurons by endocytosis, resulting in modulation of synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), by immunogold electron microscopy, ASTN2 localizes primarily to endocytic and autophagocytic vesicles in the cell soma and in subsets of dendritic spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of ASTN2 in PCs, but not of ASTN2 lacking the FNIII domain, recurrently disrupted by CNVs in patients, including in a family presented here, increases inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic activity and reduces levels of ASTN2 binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest a fundamental role for ASTN2 in dynamic regulation of surface proteins by endocytic trafficking and protein degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paternally_Inherited_ASTN2_CNVs_in_a_Family_with_ASD__ID__and_Speech_and_Language_Delay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNP array genetic testing of a child presented at 19 months of age identified a 171-kb duplication at 9q33.1, affecting exons 1720 of ASTN2 (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CNV was present in the father and in three of five children, indicating a paternally inherited heterozygous duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The children displayed a range of NDDs (Dataset S1), including ID and ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two features in particular stood out in the affected children, namely, learning difficulty and speech and language delay regardless of other diagnoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate how the duplication of exons 1720, which code for part of the MACPF domain and part of the FNIII domain of ASTN2, affects ASTN2 expression, we obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from this patient family, where ASTN2 expression was detected in the CD4+ T cell fraction (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duplication was predicted to result in either an mRNA encoding an intact MACPF domain but a truncated FNIII domain due to the creation of a frameshift stop codon (termed JDUP; SI Appendix, Fig S2) or nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CD4+ T cells isolated from two of the three boys with the ASTN2 CNV as well as the father, ASTN2 was reduced by 3050% compared with controls, including the mother (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected two protein bands, one of which is absent in the mouse, both of which were 50% lower in patients compared with controls, by Western blot (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the duplication causes loss of half of the ASTN2 transcripts and protein due to a frameshift stop codon in one allele and subsequent mRNA decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the mRNA quantification (Fig 1B) suggests that the majority of the duplicated mRNA undergoes nonsense-mediated decay, we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of the truncated protein (termed JDUP) is expressed in patients, as the antibody used does not recognize JDUP (verified with a deletion construct).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the DECIPHER database (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk), which currently contains clinical and genetic information on 11,887 patients with NDD, ID is reported in 11 of 18 (61%) patients with ASTN2 CNVs (both deletions and duplications), which is a slightly higher rate of occurrence than in the overall NDD population [6,735 of 11,887 patients (57%)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speech and language delay was reported in five of 18 patients (28%) with ASTN2 CNVs, which is also above the rate observed in the overall NDD population [2,505 of 11887 patients (21%)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In relation to other genes that are highly associated with either ID or ASD/ID, patients with ASTN2 CNVs fell above the median for ID among the investigated genes (above six of eight ASD-associated genes and within the range of the ID genes) and on the median among these genes for speech and language delay (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ID is the single most commonly occurring feature in patients with ASTN2 CNVs (both deletions and duplications), followed by speech and language delay, including in patients diagnosed with ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASTN2_Protein_Localization_in_the_Brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the function of ASTN2, we first analyzed its subcellular localization in the mouse cerebellum, which is the strongest site of expression in the brain (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry (antibody validation is discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and B) in the postnatal mouse cerebellum [postnatal day 15 (P15) and P28] showed ASTN2 in granule cells (GCs), in the molecular layer, and at higher levels in PCs (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PCs, punctate labeling was detected in the PC body, in the dendritic stalk, and in dendrites (Fig 2 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immuno-EM labeling revealed that ASTN2 localized to membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in small, round trafficking vesicles near the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane of PCs (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASTN2 also localized to endocytic vesicles (Fig 2 GI) and autophagosomes (Fig 2 G and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of dendritic spines, mostly in proximal regions of PCs, was positive for ASTN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In labeled spines, ASTN2 localized to membranes near, but not directly at, the postsynaptic density (Fig 2 LO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colabeling of ASTN2 with recycling (Rab4), early (Rab5), and late (Rab7) endosomal markers revealed that a small subset of ASTN2 puncta localizes to all these fractions of the endocytic pathway in the cerebellum (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The punctate expression pattern of ASTN2 and its localization to membranes of endocytic and autophagocytic vesicles suggests involvement in trafficking, and its presence proximal to synapses in postmigratory neurons raised the possibility that ASTN2 is involved in synaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASTN2_Binds_to_and_Reduces_the_Surface_Expression_of_Synaptic_Proteins_by_Endocytosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether ASTN2 has a synaptic role, we first examined if it binds to key adhesion proteins known to regulate PC synaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-IP experiments revealed that ASTN2 interacts with members of the Neuroligin family, as does the truncated JDUP version (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By Western blot, NLGN1/2 interacted more strongly with ASTN2 than with JDUP, while NLGN3/4 interacted more strongly with JDUP than with ASTN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ASTN2 binds to Neuroligins, and the presence of the FNIII domain differentially impacts the affinity of ASTN2 for different binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether ASTN2 regulates the surface expression of Neuroligins, we quantified the surface expression of NLGN1-YFP by live immunolabeling and flow cytometry in the presence and absence of ASTN2 in HEK 293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a reduction in surface NLGN1 in cells cotransfected with ASTN2 compared with cells without (Fig 3B, 49% versus 67%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction was even more marked for NLGN3 in the presence of ASTN2 (Fig 3B, 23% versus 5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ASTN2 did not reduce the surface expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored surface EGFP (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence ASTN2 specifically removes Neuroligins from the surface of HEK cells due to proteinprotein interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then examined whether ASTN2 expression also reduced surface NLGN1 in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, we chose to target GCs, which are far more numerous than PCs; also express ASTN2; and, together with PCs, are the main neuronal subtype in the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used overexpression to disrupt the stoichiometry of ASTN2 protein complexes, as knockdown of ASTN2 protein was not possible in neurons (SI Appendix, Fig S3) possibly due to the extremely long half-life of ASTNs in the brain (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in HEK 293T cells, GCs grown in culture for 14 days and cotransfected with Nlgn1 and Astn2 had reduced surface expression of NLGN1 compared with controls by live immunolabeling of surface NLGN1-YFP (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether the reduction in surface expression is due to endocytosis versus potential changes in surface insertion of NLGN1 upon expression from plasmids, we carried out pulsechase labeling of surface NLGN1-YFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCs that coexpressed NLGN1 and ASTN2 had higher levels of internalized NLGN1 after a 20-min chase than GCs that expressed NLGN1 and a control plasmid (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ASTN2 interacts with several key synaptic adhesion proteins and can reduce their surface expression in neurons and HEK cells by endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASTN2_Binds_a_Number_of_Proteins_Suggestive_of_Trafficking_of_Multiple_Protein_Complexes_in_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify additional ASTN2 binding partners in an unbiased manner, we carried out IP of ASTN2 from the P22P28 mouse cerebellum, followed by MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial round of experiments with duplicate samples was followed by a second experiment with more stringent washes and the inclusion of a further negative control in which the ASTN2 antibody was affinity-removed from the antisera (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined experiments identified 466 proteins enriched in the ASTN2 IP compared with IgG or the depleted ASTN2 sera samples (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further refinement of the list to only include proteins with at least three peptide hits that were 1.5-fold enriched in the ASTN2 IP versus the IgG or depleted anti-ASTN2 sera yielded 57 proteins (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified AP-2, an adaptor protein in Clathrin-mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane, and VPS36, found on sorting endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified multiple proteins involved in synaptic form and function, such as C1q, which has been shown to mediate synaptic pruning (18); OLFM1/3, which form complexes with AMPA receptors (19) and were recently identified as ASD candidates (20); ROCK2, a Rho-kinase that regulates spine morphology and synaptic activity through regulation of the cytoskeleton (21); and SLC12a5 (KCC2), a potassium/chloride cotransporter that regulates the intracellular chloride ion gradient as well as dendritic spine morphogenesis (22, 23) and is also implicated in ASD (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ASTN2 interacts with multiple proteins that regulate synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed these interactions by co-IP and Western blot in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with AP-2, SLC12a5, C1q, or OLFM1 and either ASTN2 or JDUP or EGFP/MYC (control) constructs (Fig 4C and SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we detected co-IP of ASTN2/ROCK2/AP-2 (Fig 4D) and ASTN2/NGLN2/AP-2 (SI Appendix, Fig S6C) in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional enrichment analysis of the proteins identified categories (Fig 4B) such as phagosome, endocytosis, synapse, microtubule-associated processes, and tRNA splicing ligase complex (not investigated further here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of the interacting proteins identified are, like ASTN2, implicated in ASD pathogenesis (Fig 4B, asterisks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our IP/MS experiments show that ASTN2 binds to proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and synaptic function, including synaptic pruning proteins, ion transporters, accessory proteins to ligand-gated ion channels, and proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, suggesting that ASTN2 possibly promotes the trafficking of multiple surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASTN2__but_Not_the_FNIII_Truncation__Induces_Degradation_of_Surface_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our flow cytometry analyses (Fig 3B), where HEK 293T cells transfected with NLGN1/3-YFP, with and without ASTN2, were analyzed for surface and internal YFP expression, an increase in the percentage of cells that did not express NLGN1 or NLGN3 in the presence of ASTN2 was observed (bottom left quadrants of graphs), as opposed to an increase in cells that expressed NLGN1/3 internally but not on the cell surface (bottom right quadrants of graphs), suggesting that ASTN2 not only internalizes proteins but also induces degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we detected reduced expression of the identified synaptic binding partners (Fig 5 A and B, NLGN1-4, SLC12a5, and OLFM1) but no change in the levels of the adaptor protein AP-2 or GAPDH (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and 5 A and B) upon ASTN2 overexpression compared with controls in HEK 293T cells by Western blot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, while coexpression of NLGN1 or SLC12a5 with ASTN2 resulted in reduced levels of both, this reduction was much less marked upon coexpression with JDUP (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, coexpression of ASTN2, but not the JDUP truncation, markedly reduced protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ASTN2 resulted in similar levels of NLGN1 and SLC12a5 to cells without ASTN2 protein or cells with JDUP, suggesting that the reduction in the levels of ASTN2 binding partners only occurs in the presence of intact ASTN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data suggest that ASTN2 promotes the internalization and degradation of surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine the idea that ASTN2 promotes protein degradation, we searched the top 57 protein hits identified by MS to see if any membrane proteins identified were also found in CD4+ patient T cells, where ASTN2 levels are reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 57 hits, only ROCK2 is expressed in neurons as well as in T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although like ASTN2, ROCK2 levels were variable among patients, they were, on average, higher in patients compared with controls (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression level of the lower ASTN2 band (Fig 1C, Bottom Right graph) inversely correlated with ROCK2 levels among patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data suggest that ASTN2 plays a fundamental role in modulating the dynamic localization and degradation of several protein complexes in multiple cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASTN2_Modulates_Synaptic_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether manipulation of ASTN2 levels impacts synaptic function in the cerebellum, we generated conditional lentiviruses expressing either the full-length EGFP-tagged ASTN2 (pFU-cASTN2-EGFP) or a truncated version (pFU-cJDUP-EGFP) lacking the FNIII domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression approaches have generally been reported to be more sensitive in revealing roles for adhesion molecules (27) and proteins in multimeric complexes during synaptogenesis, due to the disruption of the stoichiometry of complexes and unmasking of functions otherwise compensated for by homologous proteins in loss-of-function approaches (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viruses were stereotactically injected in vivo into Pcp2-Cre+ cerebella at P0P2 (Fig 6A) to target PCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP expression, restricted by Pcp2-Cre to PCs only, was observed 34 wk after viral injection (Fig 6B), allowing analysis of synaptic activity approximately at the stage when the IP/MS and the immuno-EM analyses were carried out (P22P28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ASTN2-EGFP expression, but not JDUP-EGFP expression, resulted in mislocalization of some PCs to ectopic locations within the internal GC layer and in the white matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ectopic PCs had developed dendritic trees despite being mislocalized (Fig 6B and SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the properties of intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission onto PCs that expressed either ASTN2-EGFP or JDUP-EGFP, we performed whole-cell electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices from injected Pcp2-Cre+ animals 34 wk after viral injections (P21P35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control recordings were performed on EGFP-negative PCs from Pcp2-Cre/ littermates injected with the same conditional viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs/mIPSCs) were recorded to assess nonevoked, quantal synaptic input, primarily from the parallel fibers (mEPSCs) and the inhibitory stellate and basket cells (mIPSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PCs expressing ASTN2-EGFP, we found a significant increase in both mIPSC amplitude [maximum difference (max) = 25.2%] and frequency (max = 13.8%) and an increase in mEPSC amplitude (max = 21.5%) in the same PCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no change in the frequency of mEPSCs (max = 5.9%; Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PCs expressing JDUP-EGFP, there was a much less marked increase in mIPSC amplitudes (max = 11.4%; Fig 6 C and D) and no change in frequency (max = 2.3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed a less marked increase in mEPSC amplitudes (max = 11.9%) but a significant decrease in mEPSC frequency (max = 13.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate changes in the synaptic strength of PCs, with the strongest effect on mIPSCs upon ASTN2-EGFP expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested evoked excitation from parallel fibers and found that the paired-pulse ratio was unchanged, suggesting no difference in presynaptic release probability (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we did not observe any differences in the spontaneous spiking of either ASTN2-EGFP or JDUP-EGFPexpressing cells as measured by noninvasive cell-attached recordings (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that ASTN2 overexpression increases synaptic strength primarily by altering the postsynaptic response to neurotransmitters, rather than the intrinsic excitability of PCs or presynaptic release dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we did not observe the same degree of changes with expression of JDUP-EGFP as we did with ASTN2-EGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, comparison of NLGN2 expression, which is the most highly expressed of the Neuroligins in the cerebellum (29), in the soma of targeted PCs revealed a significant decrease in ASTN2-EGFP PCs compared with JDUP-EGFP or control PCs from Pcp2-Cre/ cerebella injected with the same conditional viruses (Fig 5D), further corroborating our earlier findings that ASTN2 overexpression induces degradation of synaptic binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using immunogold EM, biochemical, electrophysiological, and functional assays, we demonstrate a role for ASTN2 in controlling protein trafficking and homeostasis in synaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detect ASTN2 in dendritic spines of neurons and in trafficking vesicles, and identify binding to several synaptic and trafficking proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this interpretation, ASTN2 binds the Clathrin adapter AP-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In postmitotic PCs, the sole output neuron of the cerebellar cortex and a cell type with documented loss in patients with ASD (14), overexpression of ASTN2 increased synaptic strength and decreased protein levels of synaptic binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses suggest a role for ASTN2 in controlling surface membrane protein dynamics and underscore the contribution of impairment in protein trafficking to NDDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results reported here compared the effect of ASTN2 overexpression with that of a truncated form lacking the FNIII domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments were informative in showing that removal of the FNIII domain interfered with the ability of ASTN2 to promote protein degradation, but not its ability to interact with binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression in cell types that normally express ASTN2 provided a powerful means to study the consequences of disrupting the stoichiometry of ASTN2 in its native protein complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that knockdown of ASTN2 protein was achieved in HEK cells, but not in neurons (SI Appendix, Fig S3), possibly due to the formation of protein complexes in neurons, which promote the perdurance of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, two pulsechase studies examining protein turnover in the mouse brain found that ASTN1, the homolog of ASTN2, is present even after 1 month following in vivo isotopic labeling (17, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore likely that ASTN2 is also an extremely long-lived protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interpretation that ASTN2 is a long-lived protein is also consistent with the reported stability of ASTN2 protein at pH 4.0 (31), which would allow it to traffic binding partners through the lower pH endosomal compartments of the endosomal/lysosomal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with a trafficking role, the ASTN2 protein sequence (SI Appendix, Fig S2) contains tyrosine-based sorting signals recognized by the adaptor proteins AP-1AP-4 and a dileucine-based signal recognized by Golgi-localized gamma-adaptin ear containing ARF-binding (GGA) proteins (localized to endosomes), which are also involved in endosomal trafficking (32), as well as lysosomal sorting signals like those found in lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP1/LAMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These signals are recognized not only at the plasma membrane but also at sorting stations, such as the endosomes (32), suggesting that ASTN2 is likely involved in multiple steps of endosomal/lysosomal trafficking and not just at the surface membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our EM data, which showed that ASTN2 localizes to membranes and vesicles throughout the cell soma (Fig 2D), and with our colocalization experiment with endosomal markers, where ASTN2 was found in a small fraction of early as well as late endosomes (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our MS and biochemical data show that ASTN2 binds various endosomal trafficking and sorting proteins, including AP-2 and VPS36 [part of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport II (ESCRTII) complex], and controls the surface removal and degradation of a number of synaptic proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our EM analysis showed ASTN2 also on autophagosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a large body of work shows that autophagic vesicles fuse with endosomes and lysosomes (33, 34), it will be interesting to further examine the involvement of ASTN2 in the interplay between autophagy and endosomal/lysosomal trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that our findings do not exclude a role for ASTN2 in protein degradation pathways other than the endosomal/lysosomal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to components of vesicle trafficking, the identification of interactions with multiple proteins involved in synaptic pruning [C1q (18)], AMPA receptor accessory proteins [OLFM1/3 (19)], ion transport [SLC12a5 (22)], and proteins regulating synaptic adhesion and activity [ROCK2 (21) and NLGN1-4 (29)] suggests that ASTN2 may modulate the composition of multiple protein complexes that impact synaptic form and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PCs, the sum of these interactions is increased postsynaptic activity upon ASTN2 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the ability of ASTN2 to remove surface proteins also caused the mislocalization of PCs in vivo (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that keep PCs in place are not fully understood, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of note, a previous proteomic study of synaptosomal fractions prepared from mouse and human brains detected ASTN2 (35), corroborating our finding that ASTN2 is indeed present near synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest synaptic activity changes observed upon ASTN2 overexpression were increased mIPSC frequency and amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in mini-frequency are commonly associated with increased numbers of synapses, while increases in mini-amplitude often reflect increased numbers of postsynaptic receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other mechanisms could also contribute, such as alterations in single-channel conductance, receptor desensitization, changes in intracellular ion concentrations due to alterations in plasma membrane ion transporters, or fine-scale structural changes (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the finding that ASTN2 internalizes synaptic and cell surface proteins, we favor the second set of scenarios whereby removal of proteins accessory to channels, such as OLFM1/3 and NLGN2 or the ion transporter SLC12a5, changes ligand-gated, channel-mediated responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive removal and degradation of accessory proteins could also leave receptors stranded on the cell surface, with their normal activity disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, reduced levels of SLC12a5 could result in an increase in both mEPSCs and mIPSCs, as reported by a study in the hippocampus of SLC12a5-deficient mice (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that although NLGNs were not identified by IP/MS, which samples the most abundant and stable interactions, two NLGN1/3 peptides were identified with a targeted MS approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that other transient interactions were not detected by our method and would need to be investigated in a candidate protein approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data suggest that as the primary role of ASTN2 appears to be in trafficking of an array of synaptic proteins, manipulations of ASTN2 can result in diverse synaptic modifications, including changes in postsynaptic receptor expression and synaptic strength depending on context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies on the effect of loss of ASTN2 await development of a genetic mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, the JDUP truncation did not abolish, but rather altered, the interaction of ASTN2 with its binding partners, increasing its affinity for some (NLGN3/4) while decreasing it for others (NLGN1/2; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in affinities could underlie the differing effects on mIPSC and mEPSC events induced by ASTN2 versus JDUP (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ASTN2 clearly interacts with and regulates the availability of a number of proteins, a systems level analysis using advanced live cell imaging combined with single-molecule tracking of multiple proteins in action is needed to understand the combined effects of manipulation of an ASTN2-mediated trafficking pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As reported here and elsewhere, patients with ASTN2 CNVs can manifest a spectrum of NDD phenotypes, even within the same family (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the association of ASTN2 CNVs with specific features commonly reported in such patients revealed a high level of association with ID and delayed speech and language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings that an ASTN2-mediated protein trafficking pathway modulates synaptic strength, we propose that ASTN2 CNVs (truncating duplications and deletions) in patients with NDDs cause an accumulation of surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears critical for neurons to respond to inputs and modify their surface proteome in a rapid fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity-dependent changes in gene expression have been well documented, but more rapid changes in the composition of the synaptic proteome, through protein trafficking and degradation, would indeed offer quicker means to adjust to such inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Astn2 levels have been reported to change in response to stress in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in mice (38), suggesting the possibility that ASTN2 may modulate the surface proteome in response to activity in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ASTN2 is most abundantly expressed in the cerebellum, with far lower levels in the cortex, the olfactory bulb, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the contribution of the cerebellum to ASD, ID, or speech and language development is poorly understood, neuroimaging studies show both functional and neuroanatomical evidence for the critical importance of the cerebellum (3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational studies mapping the spatiotemporal coexpression of ASD-associated genes, including ASTN2, show that cortical projection neurons (layer 5/6) and the cerebellar cortex are the two most prevalent sites of ASD gene coexpression (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, long-term depression, which is thought to be essential for many forms of cerebellar learning, is altered at parallel fiber/PC synapses in mice with targeted disruptions of several ASD-associated genes (16, 4447).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present findings suggest that ASTN2 is a key regulator of dynamic trafficking of synaptic proteins in the cerebellum and lend support to the idea that aberrant regulation of protein homeostasis is a contributing cause of complex NDDs such as ASD and ID (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

P28 mice were perfusion-fixed with 4% PFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Midsagittal vibratome sections (50 m) were prepared and incubated in blocking solution [3% BSA, 0.1% saponin in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4)] for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation in anti-ASTN2 antibody in blocking solution for 48 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing (four times for 1 h each time in sodium cacodylate buffer), the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (1:100, Nanogold-IgG anti-rabbit 2003; Nanoprobes), washed four times for 1 h each time in 0.1% saponin in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections underwent silver enhancement (HQ Silver Enhancement 2012; Nanoprobes) and gold toning using a 0.1% solution of gold chloride (HT1004; Sigma) according to the manufacturers description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections underwent en bloc staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min, were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, were incubated for 10 min in acetone, were infiltrated with an Eponate 12 Embedding Kit (Ted Pella), and were polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin sections (70 nm) prepared from three to four midsagittal sections per mouse were imaged on a JEOL JEM-100CX microscope at 80 kV and a digital imaging system (XR41-C; Advanced Microscopy Technology Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For negative controls, sections were processed as described but with omission of the primary antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 224 images were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IP__Intracellular_Cross-Linking_of_Proteins__Depletion_of_ASTN2_Antisera__and_Western_Blot  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For in vitro IPs, proteins from transfected HEK 293T cells were extracted in either radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Scientific) or a customized IP buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaF, 1.5% octyl -d-glucopyranoside (Abcam), 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 10 units of Benzonase Nuclease (Sigma)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For in vivo IPs, proteins were extracted from P22P28 cerebella using the customized IP buffer (as described above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overnight IPs with 1.8-mg (in vivo) or 0.5-mg (in vitro) protein inputs were carried out according to standard protocols using Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) cross-linked with antibodies using Bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) cross-linking according to the manufacturers description (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, either normal IgG from the same species as the antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-ASTN2 depleted antisera were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-ASTN2 depleted antisera were prepared by incubating the anti-ASTN2 antibody with N-terminal biotinylated peptide against which the antibody had been raised (KITCEEKMVSMARNTYGETKGR) in the customized IP buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody/peptide mix was then pulled out with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen), and the volume containing the antisera depleted of ASTN2 antibody was cross-linked to Dynabeads Protein G for use as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of anti-ASTN2 antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis on cerebellar lysates (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular cross-linking of proteins was carried out before in vivo IPs with disuccinimidyl suberate (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturers descriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots were carried out according to standard protocols using SDS/PAGE gels (Fisher) and Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blots were developed using an ECL Western Blotting Kit (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignal West Pico kit (Thermo Scientific) and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IPs were prepared as described earlier using 1.8 mg protein from whole cerebellar lysates (P22P28) with antibody cross-linked beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 8 M urea (GE Healthcare) in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma) and 10 mM DTT (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cysteines were alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then diluted below 4 M urea before digesting with LysC (Waco Chemicals) for 6 h, after which urea was diluted below 2 M for overnight trypsin (Promega) digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides were desalted by StaGE tips and processed for nano liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem MS (MS/MS) in data-dependent mode (Dionex U3000 coupled to a QExactive or QExactive Plus mass spectrometer; ThermoFisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generated LC-MS/MS data were queried against UniProts complete mouse proteome (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000589, downloaded July 2014) concatenated with common contaminants, and peptides were identified and quantified using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (ThermoScientific) and Mascot 2.5.1 (Matrix Sciences) with fully tryptic restraints (Trypsin/P) and up to three missed cleavages with protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation as a stable modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide matches required 5 ppm accuracy in MS1 and 20 millimass units in MS2, with a 1% false discovery rate filter using Percolator (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create the list of 466 identified proteins, all proteins that were only present in IgG samples were filtered out, as were proteins that showed enrichment in the IgG control over the ASTN2 IP in the most stringently washed experiment (III).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stringent list of 57 proteins (Fig 4) was created by including only proteins with at least three peptide hits that were 1.5-fold enriched in the combined ASTN2 I + II IPs/I + II IgG IPs or in ASTN2 III IP/depleted anti-ASTN2 sera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional enrichment analysis was carried out using STRING (v10.0, https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Surface_and_PulseChase_Labeling_in_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 14 days in vitro (DIV14), mixed cerebellar cultures (prepared as described earlier) were transfected with either Nlgn1-HA-YFP + Astn2-EGFP or Nlgn1-HA-YFP + EGFP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On DIV17, cells were incubated with anti-GFP (1:500) diluted in culture medium containing 10 mM Hepes (Sigma) at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by two washes with medium plus 10 mM Hepes on ice to prevent endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For surface-labeling experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S5), cells were fixed and processed as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pulsechase experiments (Fig 3), cells were incubated in fresh medium for a 20-min chase period at 35 °C/5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa-633 (1:300) for 30 min at 4 °C to label all pulsed NLGN1-HA-YFP left on the cell surface, followed by two washes in medium on ice to wash away unbound antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then fixed and processed as described earlier to detect internalized (anti-rabbit Alexa-555 secondary) and total (mouse anti-HA primary, followed by anti-mouse Alexa-405 secondary) protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments were carried out to ensure that surface labeling did not occur with the GFP antibody on cells that expressed EGFP or ASTN2-EGFP only, as neither protein is exposed on the surface membrane, while the YFP tag of NLGN1-HA-YFP is positioned outside the plasma membrane, and hence detected by live labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Virus_Production_and_in_Vivo_Viral_Injections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced with the pFU-cASTN2-EGFP and pfU-cJDUP-EGFP plasmids as previously reported (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viruses were collected and concentrated 45 h after transfection, and the pH of the media was kept between 7 and 7.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neonatal (2430 h old) first generations from hemizygous PCP2-Cre breeding pairs [B6.Cg-Tg(Pcp2-cre)3555Jdhu/J; The Jackson Laboratory] were cryoanesthetized and injected using a modified protocol of Kim et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52), utilizing a 10-L Hamilton syringe (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1701-RN; Hamilton) fitted with a custom 32-gauge needle (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 point style, 12° angle, 9.52-mm length; catalog no 7803-04; Hamilton).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The needle was inserted perpendicular to the occipital plate at a depth of 2.5 mm, centering the tip in-line with the anterior/posterior axis and between the ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acute sagittal slices (250 m thick) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis of 3- to 4-wk-old injected mice (PCP2-Cre+) and control littermates (PCP2-Cre/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were cut in an ice-cold potassium cutting solution (53) consisting of 130 mM K-gluconate, 15 mM KCl, 0.05 mM EGTA, 20 mM Hepes, and 25 mM glucose (pH 7.4) with KOH, and were transferred to an incubation chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) composed of 125 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 25 glucose (pH 7.3, 310 Osm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrophysiological recordings were performed at 3233 °C using a MultiClamp 700B Amplifier (Axon Instruments), with signals digitized at 50 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All whole-cell recordings were performed using a cesium-based internal solution containing 140 mM Cs-gluconate, 15 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, and 10 mM phosphocreatine-Tris2, 2 mM QX 314-Cl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For parallel fiber stimulation experiments, glass monopolar electrodes (23 M) were filled with aCSF and current was generated using a stimulus isolation unit (ISO-Flex Stimulus Isolator; A.M.P.I.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous miniature synaptic currents were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 M; Tocris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPSCs were recorded at the empirically determined EPSC reversal potential ( +10 mV), and EPSCs were recorded at the IPSC reversal potential ( 75 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane potentials were not corrected for the liquid junction potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Series resistance was monitored with a 5-mV hyperpolarizing pulse, and only recordings that remained stable over the period of data collection were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mIPSCs and mEPSCs were analyzed using MiniAnalysis software (v6.0.3; Synaptosoft, Inc.), using a 1-kHz low-pass Butterworth filter and a detection threshold set to 5× (for IPSCs) or 10× (for EPSCs) higher than baseline noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So that no individual recording biased our distributions, 400 mIPSCs and 120 mEPSCs from each cell were randomly selected to establish the amplitude and frequency distributions of events across conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the paired-pulse ratio, parallel fibers were stimulated at 20 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_and_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observations were replicated in at least three independent experiments (technical replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data represented in graphs are both biological (pooled or individual animals/starting material) and technical (repeated multiple times) replicates, except for Fig 1C, where individual data points are shown for human samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pixel intensities of Western blots and immunolabeling were quantified using ImageJ (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface and internal labeling of NLG1-HA-YFP, as well as NLGN2 labeling in PCs in vivo, was quantified as follows: Each cell and its processes, including dendritic spines in the case of GCs and the cell soma only in the case of PCs in vivo, were outlined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated density was measured (sum of all pixel intensities per square micrometer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean fluorescence background of each channel was also measured by selecting an area containing no cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corrected fluorescence was then calculated per cell as follows: integrated density  (area of selected cell * mean fluorescence intensity of image).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GCs, 20 cells per coverslip and two coverslips per condition were imaged from three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were plotted as mean ± 1 SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total in Fig 5D represents the sum of the total pulse (internal labeling + surface labeling values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were checked for normality with the ShapiroWilk test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outliers, identified in box plots, were removed, and nonnormal data were natural log-transformed to obtain the normal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, four outliers were removed out of 164 data points in Fig 5D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, data were analyzed by ANOVA, but if a covariate was present (e.g., area or total pulse), then analysis of covariance was used, taking these covariates into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where applicable, P values were calculated assuming equal variances among groups (tested with Levenes test) and were two-sided unless stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between groups when more than two were present were identified by Bonferronis post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of cells per condition (n) analyzed is stated on each bar, and the total number of experiments is given as N. All electrophysiology data were analyzed with the MannWhitney U test using GraphPad Prism software and Clampfit (Molecular Devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The max describes the percentage of maximum difference between each pair of distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant statistical difference between distributions of mEPSC and mIPSC amplitudes and frequencies is defined by P less_than 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
