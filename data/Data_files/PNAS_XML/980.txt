Efficient synthesis of phycocyanobilin in mammalian cells for optogenetic control of cell signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Optical control of cell signaling has attracted much attention in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most optogenetic systems exploit blue light, as do fluorescent indicators such as FRET-based biosensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phytochrome B (PhyB)phytochrome-interacting factor (PIF) is a red/far-red light-switchable heterodimerization system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PhyB requires phytochromobilin or phycocyanobilin (PCB) as a chromophore, which must be externally added to mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this difficulty, we developed a system for an efficient synthesis of PCB in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, we found that PCB was synthesized by introducing all PcyA, HO1, Fd, and Fnr genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockout or knockdown of biliverdin reductase A further enhanced PCB synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetically encoded PCB synthesis system allowed us to manipulate cell signaling by red/far-red light without exogenous PCB addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Optogenetics is a powerful tool to precisely manipulate cell signaling in space and time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, protein activity can be regulated by several light-induced dimerization (LID) systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, the phytochrome B (PhyB)phytochrome-interacting factor (PIF) system is the only available LID system controlled by red and far-red lights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the PhyBPIF system requires phycocyanobilin (PCB) or phytochromobilin as a chromophore, which must be artificially added to mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report an expression vector that coexpresses HO1 and PcyA with Ferredoxin and Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase for the efficient synthesis of PCB in the mitochondria of mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An even higher intracellular PCB concentration was achieved by the depletion of biliverdin reductase A, which degrades PCB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCB synthesis and PhyBPIF systems allowed us to optogenetically regulate intracellular signaling without any external supply of chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have provided a practical method for developing a fully genetically encoded PhyBPIF system, which paves the way for its application to a living animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reconstitution_of_the_PCB_Synthesis_Pathway_in_Mammalian_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two enzymes, heme oxygenase (25) and ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase (26, 27), are committed to phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis from heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, PCB is produced from heme through HO1-mediated degradation, followed by PcyA-mediated biliverdin reduction (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both reactions are coupled with a reduction by reduced Fd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidized Fd (Fdox) is then recycled by Fnr to regenerate reduced Fd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our preliminary experiments, expression of HO1 and PcyA derived from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 was not sufficient for operation of the PhyBPIF system in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the failure might have been due to the lack of Fd and Fnr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because heme exists primarily at mitochondria in mammalian cells (28, 29), we attempted to coexpress Fd and Fnr derived from Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC6803 with HO1 and PcyA to reconstitute the PCB synthetic pathway in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the amount of PCB in a living cell, we employed the Tyr-276His mutant of PhyB (PhyB-Y276H), which emits red fluorescence upon binding to PCB (30) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PhyB-Y276H protein was fused with mCherry, which was used as an internal standard, and the H-Ras C terminus (HRasCT) was used for plasma membrane localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells expressing PhyB-Y276H-mCherry-HRasCT emanated 680 nm red fluorescence in the presence of exogenous PCB (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MÃ¼ller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) realized PCB synthesis in mammalian cells by using a pKM087 expression vector that encodes mitochondria-targeting sequence (MTS) fused with PcyA and MTS-HO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fluorescence from PhyB-Y276H was below the detectable level in pKM087-expressing HeLa cells (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our surprise, when MTS-Fd and MTS-Fnr were coexpressed with MTS-PcyA and MTS-HO1, the red fluorescence of PhyB-Y276H from HeLa cells became almost comparable to that observed in the presence of 2.5 M PCB (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exclusion of any one of these four genes abolished the fluorescence from the cells (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human homolog of HO1, Fd, or Fnr was unable to substitute for HO1, Fd, or Fnr in PCB synthesis (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that PcyA, HO1, Fd, and Fnr, which are derived from T. elongatus BP-1 or Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC6803, were required for the efficient PCB production in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate gene delivery, these four genes were connected with the cDNA of the self-cleaved P2A peptide, generating a synthetic gene PHFF (Fig 1E and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HeLa cells transfected with the pPHFF expression vector for PHFF emanated red fluorescence from PhyB-Y276H at a level comparable to that of cells expressing the four genes independently (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCB is known to be covalently attached to PhyB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The covalent attachment of PCB to the PhyB was confirmed by SDS PAGE followed by zinc blot analysis (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PHFF-expressing Schizosaccharomyces pombe produced intracellular PCB to the level evoked by the addition of a saturating amount of extracellular PCB (Fig S4 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LID_by_the_PHFFPhyBPIF_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we examined whether expression of pPHFF is sufficient for PhyB binding to PIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, PhyB-mCherry-HRasCT and PIF-mEGFP were coexpressed at the plasma membrane and cytosol, respectively, with pPHFF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were reciprocally illuminated with red and far-red lights to turn on and off, respectively, the binding of PIF-mEGFP to PhyB-mCherry-HRasCT at the plasma membrane (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined four pairs of PhyB and PIFthat is, PhyB (1908 aa) and PhyB621 (1621 aa) for the PhyBs (Fig 2B), and PIF3 and PIF6 for the PIFs (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PhyB621 was comprised of the minimal photosensory corenamely, the PAS-like, GAF, and Phy domains (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pair of PhyB and PIF3 resulted in a clear change in PIF3 distribution upon red and far-red light exposure, whereas the pair of PhyB621 and PIF3 showed a limited subcellular relocalization (Fig 2 C and D, Upper and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIF6 was also associated with PhyB and PhyB621 under the red light exposure, while it was not completely dissociated from PhyB and PhyB621 by the far-red light (Fig 2 C and D, Lower and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reductions of cytoplasmic PIF-mEGFP intensities compared with the far-red light condition were quantified for each of these four combinations (Fig 2 DG), indicating fast and reversible membrane translocation of PIF by red and far-red light exposure on the second time scale (Fig 2 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PIF3 reproducibly showed faster association and dissociation rate constants than PIF6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enhancement_of_PhyBPIF_LID_by_the_Depletion_of_BVRA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further enhance PhyBPIF LID, we depleted BVRA, which metabolizes biliverdin and PCB into bilirubin and phycocyanorubin, respectively (32) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we established BVRA KO HeLa cells by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the KO of BVRA reduced intracellular bilirubin, as visualized by UnaG, a bilirubin sensor (33) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BVRA KO HeLa cells, PhyB-Y276H fluorescence was increased to approximately threefold the level in control HeLa cells (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi-mediated KD of BVRA also increased PhyB-Y276H fluorescence (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement of PhyB-Y276H fluorescence may have been due to the decrease in degradation of PCB, because BVRA KO HeLa cells demonstrated higher PCB fluorescence by the addition of purified PCB than control HeLa cells did (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, it is reported that supplementation of Heme precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and iron(ii) sulfate increases Biliverdin biosynthesis up to threefold (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to our expectation, these treatments did not significantly increase PCB synthesis in either control HeLa or BVRA KO HeLa cells that expressed PHFF (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, neither the expression of PHFF nor the depletion of BVRA affected cell growth rates in HeLa cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we evaluated the effect of BVRA KO on LID in the same PhyB and PIF pairs as in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BVRA KO HeLa cells expressing PHFF, both the PIF3 and PhyB pair and PIF3 and PhyB621 pair showed distinct translocation of PIF3-mEGFP upon red light and far-red light exposure (Fig 3E, Upper and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIF6 also demonstrated clear association with PhyB and PhyB621 by red-light exposure, but a substantial amount of PIF6-mEGFP remained at the plasma membrane even under a far-red light condition in both the combinations with PhyB and that with PhyB621 in BVRA KO HeLa cells (Fig 3E, Lower and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification showed a much better response of PIF-mEGFP translocation in BVRA KO cells (Fig 3 FI) than control cells (Fig 2D) under all conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PIF3 and PhyB pair exhibited rapid translocation almost comparable to that of the PIF3 and PhyB621 pair, with reversible PIF translocation (Fig 3 FI, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, slower and smaller translocations of PIF6-mEGFP were observed with the PIF6 and PhyB pair and PIF6 and PhyB621 pair, respectively (Fig 3 FI, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, we verified whether the PhyBPIF3 combination is effective in other types of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCB synthesis was also observed in mESCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that expressed PHFF and shRNA against mouse BVRA (mBVRA) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this condition, PhyBPIF3 LID was reproducibly observed in mESCs (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Application_of_the_PhyBPIF_System_to_Manipulating_Signal_Transduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we employed the genetically encoded PhyBPIF system to control intracellular signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that activation of Rac1, a small GTPase, leads to actin reorganization and lamellipodia formation (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To optogenetically activate the endogenous Rac1 protein Tiam1, a Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (36) was fused with PIF3 and mEGFP, and this chimeric protein was recruited to the plasma membrane through binding to PhyB-mCherry-HRasCT upon exposure to red light (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, red light exposure induced rapid formation of thin lamellipodia along the cell periphery in HEK-293 cells expressing sh-hBVRA (Fig 4 B and C and Movie S3), indicating the activation of Rac1 by light illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One advantage of the PhyBPIF system is that it enables both the manipulation of cell signaling and detection of the output signals with a GFP reporter or CFP/YFP-based FRET biosensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ERK MAP kinase pathway was activated by the recruitment of CRaf-PIF3 to the plasma membrane by red light, and the subsequent activation of ERK was monitored by EKAREV-NLS, an ERK FRET biosensor (37) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the excitation light for the FRET biosensor caused slight PhyB activation, and therefore, the nonspecific activation was prevented by global illumination with far-red light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FRET/CFP ratio, which correlated with ERK activity (11), was increased upon red light illumination (Fig 4E and Movie S4), and this increase was suppressed by far-red light illumination (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We induced PCB synthesis in mammalian cells through the expression of a synthetic gene, PHFF, that was made up of the four genes PcyA, HO1, Fd, and Fnr, which are derived from T. elongatus BP-1 or Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC6803.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, BVRA KO or BVRA KD was shown to increase the level of cellular PCB by reducing the metabolism of biliverdin and PCB (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of synthesized PCB was sufficient for use in a genetically encoded PhyBPIF system for the modulation of intracellular signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MÃ¼ller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) have reported PCB synthesis by the expression of HO1 and PcyA in mammalian cells, but we found that the amount of PCB synthesized by this method was not sufficient for operation of the PhyBPIF system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, mammalian cells endogenously express Fd-1, an Fd-like protein (also known as adrenodoxin) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the amino acid sequence homology between human Fd-1 and Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC 6803 Fd was limited to 26%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, sequence and structure studies of mammalian Fnr/adrenodoxin reductase suggested no functional overlap with Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC 6803 Fnr (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust increase in PhyB-Y276H fluorescence observed in the present study (Fig 1 C and D) strongly suggests that mammalian ferrodoxin-1/adrenodixin and Fnr/adrenodoxin reductase cannot support the PCB synthesis by cyanobacterial HO1 and PcyA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Faster association and dissociation kinetics were observed in the PIF3PhyB bindings in comparison with the PIF6PhyB bindings (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIF6 was originally reported to show fast and reversible bindings to PhyB in the LID system (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, under our experimental conditions, PIF6 tended to be retained at the plasma membrane even after far-red light exposure (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise mechanisms underlying this retention are still unclear, the sustained binding of PIF6 to PhyB may leak signals of the LID system even under far-red light illumination and eventually decrease ON and OFF responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, PIF3 would be more suitable than PIF6 as a binding partner of PhyB in the PhyBPIF system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depletion of BVRA by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene KO or shRNA resulted in an enhancement of PCB synthesis and thereby an increase in the efficiency of PhyBPIF LID (Fig 3 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heme and its metabolites, biliverdin and bilirubin, are known to have diverse physiological functions including electron transfer and antioxidant and cell signaling, respectively (28, 41, 42), though their cellular functions remain controversial (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, we did not observe any detectable effects of PHFF expression and/or BVRA KD on cell growth rates in HeLa cells and mESCs (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be because biliverdin and bilirubin are delivered from the serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, it should be noted the possible alteration of insulin signaling by depletion of the BVRA gene (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, new strategies are needed to improve PCB synthesis without affecting BVRA function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genetically encoded system of PCB synthesis will provide a potential advantage for establishing transgenic animals that stably synthesize PCB endogenously, thereby enabling the optogenetic manipulation of cell signaling in deeper tissues without injecting PCB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biliverdin-bound PhyB mutants or other phytochromes should also be explored in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
