Disassembly of the Staphylococcus aureus hibernating 100S ribosome by an evolutionarily conserved GTPase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial protein synthesis requires the assembly of the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits on mRNA to form the translationally competent 70S complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nontranslating 70S ribosomes homodimerize into a translationally inactive 100S ribosome to promote bacterial survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion between the 70S and 100S complexes is reversible, but the disassembly pathway of the 100S ribosome is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that an evolutionarily conserved GTPase (HflX) splits the Staphylococcus aureus 100S ribosome in a GTP-dependent fashion; the abundance of 100S is influenced by the opposing functions of the dimerizing factor (HPF) and HflX, whose actions are coregulated by the heat stress response and (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between the 100S ribosome biogenesis and stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bacterial hibernating 100S ribosome is a poorly understood form of the dimeric 70S particle that has been linked to pathogenesis, translational repression, starvation responses, and ribosome turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and most other bacteria, hibernation-promoting factor (HPF) homodimerizes the 70S ribosomes to form a translationally silent 100S complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the 100S ribosomes dissociate into subunits and are presumably recycled for new rounds of translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulation and disassembly of the 100S ribosome are largely unknown because the temporal abundance of the 100S ribosome varies considerably among different bacterial phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify a universally conserved GTPase (HflX) as a bona fide dissociation factor of the S. aureus 100S ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression levels hpf and hflX are coregulated by general stress and stringent responses in a temperature-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all tested guanosine analogs stimulate the splitting activity of HflX on the 70S ribosome, only GTP can completely dissociate the 100S ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal the antagonistic relationship of HPF and HflX and uncover the key regulators of 70S and 100S ribosome homeostasis that are intimately associated with bacterial survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A model summarizing the coregulation and opposing roles of HPF and HflX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp in S. aureus is synthesized from the substrates GT(D)P and ATP primarily by the Rsh (RelA/SpoT homolog) enzyme and, to a lesser extent, by two alternative synthetases, RelP and RelQ (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal domain of HPF binds to the decoding center of the 30S subunit and inhibits translation, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) tethers the two 70S monomers via direct interaction of the HPF-CTD dimer to form the 100S complex (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of (p)ppGpp strongly inhibits the synthesis of hpf and hflX under heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ppGpp also binds to HflX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflXppGpp is unable to split the 100S complex but is sufficient for 70S dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX binds to the peptidyltransferase center in the 50S subunit and stimulates subunit dissociation by disrupting intersubunit bridges (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective stoichiometry of HflXGTP-100S remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GTP hydrolysis presumably promotes the release of HPF and HflX simultaneously with 100S breakdown, possibly by way of a 70S intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general stress response sigma-factor B (SigB) activates the expression of hpf at 37 °C and moderately up-regulates the HflX level at 47 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red arrows indicate a positive regulatory role, bar-headed lines denote repression, and a dashed arrow indicates a loss of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A simplified model depicting possible relationships of RRF, IF3, and HflX during ribosome recycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initiation of bacterial protein synthesis involves the recruitment of initiation factor 2 (IF2), IF3, mRNA, and the initiator fMet-tRNAfMet to the 30S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IF2 and IF3 eventually dissociate, and the 50S subunit binds to form the initiation complex with the initiator tRNA position at the P site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent elongation steps are facilitated by the actions of EF-Tu, GTP, and aminoacylated tRNAs with the aid of EF-G to promote translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a termination codon enters the decoding center, it is recognized by the cognate release factor 1 (RF1) or RF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RF1 and RF2 catalyze the hydrolysis of the peptidyltRNA bond, thus liberating the newly synthesized protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RF3 promotes the dissociation of RF1 and RF2 from the ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the recycling phase, ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and GTPase EF-G concertedly stimulate the dissociation of the 70S ribosome from the mRNA, followed by tRNA release and in most cases dissociation of the 30S and 50S subunits (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of IF3 to the 30S subunit prevents 30S50S rejoining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without IF3, the subunits may reassociate to form the silent 70S complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX disassembles the 70S complexes released from mRNA and from subunit rejoining in the presence of guanosine binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPF dimerizes the 70S complexes into translationally inactive 100S ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under specific conditions, GTP-bound HflX dissociates the 100S ribosome into subunits with the possibility of a 70S intermediate during disassembly and with the dislodging of HPF and HflX upon GTP hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free subunits can be recycled for new rounds of translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sequence alignment of HflX homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX homologs are universally conserved from bacteria and plants to humans (3350% homology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank with the following accession numbers: Arabidopsis thaliana, AED96978.1; Staphylococcus aureus, ABD21413; Escherichia coli, AAC77130; Chlamydia trachomatis, AAC67975; Sulfolobus solfataricus, AAK40607; and Homo sapiens, O43824 (also known as GTPBP6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain structures of P loop, G domains, and Switch III regions are color coded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red asterisks indicate GTP and Mg2+ binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues S219 and T239 of S. aureus HflX are labeled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The conversion of the posttermination complex (PoTc) into the vacant 70S complex or free 30S and 50S subunits is required for translational reinitiation (3841).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the disassembly of the 100S ribosome may involve known inhibitors of 30S50S subunit joining {IF3, ObgE (42), RatA (43), RsgA (44), RsfS (45), 70S splitter [HflX, IF3 (46)] or PoTc recycling factors [RRF+EF-G (35)]}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of RatA, homologs of these factors are present in S. aureus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Null mutations of IF3, ObgE, RRF, and EF-G are deleterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the production of 100S ribosome in the rsfS and rsgA mutants during the log and stationary phase is indistinguishable from 100S ribosome production in wild-type S. aureus (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombinant GTPase ObgE protein also failed to dissociate the 100S ribosome in vitro (Fig S2B), even at 10-fold molar excess and 2 mM GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that the GTPase HflX could dissociate both S. aureus 70S and 100S ribosomes in vitro (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in vitro experiments involve the dimerization of salt-washed 70S ribosomes with purified HPF at a molar ratio of 1:1 (3), followed by the addition of HflX and guanosine analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of ribosomal particles was analyzed by sucrose gradient density ultracentrifugation and immunoblotting with antibodies against HPF, His-tag, and ribosomal protein S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous findings in E. coli (46, 47), S. aureus HflX exhibited very weak or no splitting activity toward the 70S ribosome either by itself (Fig 2A, Left) or in the presence of ATP or GDP (Fig S3 B and C), but 70S splitting was significantly enhanced in the presence of GTP, with the maximal activity achieved using nonhydrolyzable guanosine 5-[,-imido]triphosphate (GMP-PNP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. aureus HflX is also a target of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that HflXppGpp dissociates the 70S ribosome as effectively as HflXGMP-PNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stark contrast, only HflXGTP could completely dissociate the 100S ribosome (Fig 2A, Right), whereas HflXppGpp or HflXGMP-PNP remained 100S bound but were unable to dissociate the complex (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that the disassembly of the 100S ribosome strictly requires GTP hydrolysis, whereas the disassembly of the 70S ribosome is nonselectively stimulated by all of the tested guanosines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Importance_of_HflX_GTP_Hydrolysis_in_100S_Ribosome_Disassembly  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key regions accounting for the catalytic activity of HflX include the P loop, switches I and II, and the G1G5 domains (48, 49) (Fig 3A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli HflX also binds and hydrolyzes ATP (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test how the GTPase activity of HflX influences the dissociation of the 100S ribosome, we introduced S219N and T239A substitutions located in the P-loop/G1 and switch I/G2 regions that correspond to T193 and T213 of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (hereafter referred as Ss_T193 and Ss_T213).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ss_T193N mutation perturbs the magnesium site and prevents proper loading of GTP (48), and the equivalent S243N mutation of Chlamydophila pneumoniae loses GTP hydrolysis activity (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Threonine-239 of S. aureus HflX (Ss_T213, C. pneumoniae T263) is invariant across all bacterial and eukaryotic HflX homologs (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It resides in an unstructured switch I/G2 region, and mutation in this residue impairs GTP binding and hydrolysis (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the HflXS219N and HflXT239A mutants both had GTP hydrolysis and binding activities reduced by 75% (Fig 3 B and C) and ATP hydrolysis by 80% (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the HflXS219N mutant showed a more severe defect in 100S dissociation than the HflXT239A variant regardless of GTP concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1 mM GTP, the wild-type HflX fully dissociated the 100S ribosome, but under the same conditions, a residual 100S peak was observed in the HflXT239A mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher GTP concentration could partially offset the mutation, as the HflXT239A mutant efficiently split the 100S complex (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GTP concentrations we used are physiologically relevant because bacterial intracellular GTP levels usually range from 0.9 to 1.7 mM (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight differences in the degree of 70S dissociation between Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2A and 3D occurred because the proteins in Fig 3 were purified from Hepes buffer instead of the routinely used phosphate buffer to avoid a high background of free phosphate in Fig 3 B and C. The reason for the strong 100S dissociation activity of HflXT239A despite its diminished GTP binding and hydrolysis activities remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results confirmed that GTP hydrolysis is absolutely required for 100S disassembly, whereas ATP hydrolysis is dispensable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermoresponsive_Phenotypes_of_the_hflX_Mutant  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expression of E. coli HflX is induced by heat through 32 regulation (54) and is thought to rescue stalled ribosomes under heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli HflX binds to the peptidyltransferase center in the 50S subunit and stimulates subunit dissociation by disrupting intersubunit bridges (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hflX knockout strains of E. coli and S. aureus exhibit no detectable growth defects under standard laboratory conditions (3037 °C in rich medium) (44, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, no growth defect was observed in S. aureus hflX cultured at 3745 °C (Fig 4A and Fig S4A), and no observable difference in ribosome profiles was seen in the hflX mutant relative to the wild-type during various growth phases at 37 °C (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paradoxically, and in contrast to the E. coli hflX mutant phenotype, we found that S. aureus hflX was more viable at 47 °C than the wild type (Fig 4A) and more resistant to acute heat killing (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotype could be partially rescued by expressing hflX in trans on a plasmid under the control of its native promoter (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overproduction of plasmid-borne HflX (10-fold greater than the wild type, Fig 4B) may interfere with the proper stoichiometry of the HflX ribosome, which explains the lack of a full rescue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth arrest of the WT and the complementing strains grown at 47 °C were reversed to the hflX level upon a temperature downshift to nonstress 37 °C conditions (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that a transposon insertion mutant of hflX (strain NE1325) also phenocopied the in-frame hflX deletion under the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The S. aureus 100S ribosome is constitutively produced at 37 °C throughout all growth phases (3, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflXGTP antagonizes the stability of the 100S ribosome (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We posit that the abundance of the 100S ribosome is due to a high level of HPF concomitant with low cellular HflX or GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the counterbalance between HPF and HflX by examining their expression at different growth temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HflX antibody that we raised also recognizes a recalcitrant background protein that is 12 kDa away from HflX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite intensive efforts toward antibody purification and optimizing electrophoresis conditions, we were unable to completely eliminate the background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the cross-reaction, we preadsorbed antibody with the hflX lysate, and to probe higher levels of HflX, we performed ultracentrifugation to separate the high molecular weight fraction (ribosome-/complex-bound background) from the free proteins in the supernatant (Fig 4B, Right, compare lanes 2 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of growth temperatures, the null mutation of hpf did not affect the expression of hflX compared with the wild type, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 37 °C, HflX was barely detectable, and HPF was abundant (Fig 4B, Left and Fig S6), explaining the constitutive generation of the 100S ribosome at 37 °C (36) (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 47 °C, the HPF level was not significantly altered (Fig S6), but HflX was heat induced (Fig 4B, Left), thereby reducing the amount of 100S ribosome (Fig 5A, WT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, a hflX mutant generated more 70S and 100S complexes (Fig 5A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulse-chase analysis suggested that the growth advantage of the hflX mutant at 47 °C might be in part due to better translational efficiency (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were pulse labeled with [35S]-methionine for 3 min, and the synthesis of radiolabeled nascent proteins was monitored by chasing with cold casamino acids after 15 min and 40 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both time points, hflX synthesized more proteins (or slower protein turnover) than the wild-type and the complementing strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_General_Stress_and_Stringent_Response_Pathways_Control_hpf_and_hflX_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate how the expression levels of hpf and hflX affect 100S ribosome production, we turned to potential regulators of hpf and hflX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflXGTP dissociates the 100S ribosome, but HflXppGpp does not (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In S. aureus, (p)ppGpp is produced from GT(D)P and ATP by the major synthetase Rsh (RelA/SpoT homolog) and two alternative proteins RelP and RelQ (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close inspection of the 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) of comF-hpf operon revealed an alternative sigma factor (SigB or B) binding motif (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. aureus SigB regulates an arsenal of virulence and general stress response genes (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the levels of HPF and HflX by Western blotting using cell lysates harvested at the late log phase (37 °C) and after maximal growth at 47 °C (23 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we found that a sigB null was attenuated in HPF synthesis and growth at 37 °C; HflX expression was slightly, or not at all, increased (Fig 4B, Middle and Fig S4A), which was consistent with the dramatic reduction in the 100S ribosome (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 47 °C, no significant changes in HPF level were found in the sigB mutant, but HflX was reduced by approximately twofold (Fig 4B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 37 °C, an rsh mutant did not significantly affect both cell growth and 100S abundance (Fig S4 A and C), presumably due to functional redundancies of RelP and RelQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 47 °C, however, both HPF and HflX were derepressed upon rsh knockout (Fig 4B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear how (p)ppGpp negatively integrated transcriptional regulation and splitting activity on HflX in response to thermal stress, given that S. aureus HflX binds better to ppGpp (kd = 0.87 ± 0.15 M) than to GTP (kd = 19.39 ± 5.11 M) (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the expression profiles, we concluded that SigB and (p)ppGpp exert positive and negative regulatory roles on hpf and hflX expression that are strongly influenced by the temperature (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The molecular mechanisms of 70S dimerization and the importance of the 100S ribosome in bacterial resuscitation from nutrient deprivation have been well defined in several bacterial species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four common themes emerged from these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the 100S ribosomes are inactive in translation due to the occlusion of ribosomal decoding sites by HPF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 100S ribosome-mediated down-regulation of translation is one of the survival strategies in slow-growing and dormant cells to reduce energy consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the 100S ribosomes in Firmicutes are tethered by direct HPF contact as opposed to allosteric control of dimerization by RMF in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the formation of the 100S ribosome extends the bacterial life span, which is correlated with the prolonged ribosome integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise role of dimerization is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the masked 30S30S interfaces in the dimer are more resistant to nucleolytic attack, although these regions are not known to be the targets of RNases (5860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the conformational changes in the 30S subunits (19) reduce the accessibility to RNases, and moreover, translational attenuation may alter the expression of specific factors involved in the ribosome decay pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, dimerization may simply avoid spurious interactions of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the inactive 70S ribosome because the dimerization interface, e.g., uS2, overlaps with the RNAPribosome contact sites (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, nutrient replenishment promotes the conversion of 100S ribosomes to 70S concomitantly with an increase in translation and bacterial regrowth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The factor participating in the active dissociation of the 100S ribosome is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrate that the GTPase HflX is an antagonizing factor of HPF-induced 70S dimerization in the human pathogen S. aureus (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counterbalances between HPF and HflX and GTP-ppGpp homeostasis contribute to 100S ribosome abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX dissociates both 70S and 100S ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GTP hydrolysis stimulates 100S disassembly, whereas ppGpp binding inhibits it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether a 70S intermediate is necessary for the final conversion into subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HflX is less selective about guanosines, and the binding of GTP, GMP-PNP, or ppGpp efficiently dissociates the 70S complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future kinetic studies are needed to delineate the precise sequence of 100S disassembly and the fates of HflX and HPF upon dissociation as well as the hierarchical order of IF3 and RRF/EF-G with respect to 100S dissociation during ribosome recycling (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike the -proteobacterial 100S ribosome, which is formed only under stress, S. aureus 100S ribosomes are produced from lag-log growth throughout the stationary phase partly because the expression of S. aureus HPF appears to be less tightly controlled (3, 36), and multiple transcriptional pathways may orchestrate hpf expression (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the production of the S. aureus 100S ribosome during the logarithmic phase does not reduce growth and global translation in rich medium and only moderately reduces growth in minimal medium (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that posttermination vacant 70S complexes are the precursors of 100S ribosomes (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that 70S ribosomes do not always undergo subunit dissociation during termination; instead reinitiation could occur in a 70S-scanning mode (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cells exclusively carrying covalently linked 70S ribosomes are viable (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30S and 50S subunits released from mRNA may also reassociate to form 70S ribosomes when the 30S subunit is not bound to the antiassociation factor IF3, given that the in vivo concentration of IF3 is at least 100-fold less than is required to prevent all subunit joining (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPF also dimerizes 30S monomers in vivo in chemically defined minimal medium (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although unlikely, it is possible that HPF assembles the 100S ribosome by a stepwise 30S:30S  50S  100S sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective stoichiometry of HflXGTP-100S is unclear, but low levels of HflX under nonstress conditions (37 °C, Fig 4) appear to be sufficient to avoid the buildup of 100S ribosome to a threshold that compromises translation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, one interpretation is that the accumulation of 100S ribosomes over time with the highest-level peaks during the stationary phase may be due to the inhibition of HflX splitting activity by (p)ppGpp, a global regulator induced during the stationary phase when nutrients are limited (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A sigB knockout does not completely abolish hpf synthesis (Fig 4B, Middle), which suggests that the transcription of hpf is regulated by multiple pathways, in addition to SigB and (p)ppGpp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the comF-hpf 5-UTR carries a putative binding motif of housekeeping SigA (or 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B. subtilis hpf is positively controlled by B and H (2), and thus, it is possible that other alternative sigma-factors, e.g., SigH and SigS, whose binding sites are not yet defined (57), also activate the expression of S. aureus hpf upon sensing disparate environmental stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. aureus hpf is regulated by the global transcriptional repressor CodY (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63 and 64, hpf locus annotated as SA0815 or SACOL0815).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to GTP and binding to branched-chain amino acids promote CodY repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because intracellular GTP concentration drops as a result of (p)ppGpp synthesis, a potential crosstalk of the CodYSigBRsh pathways in shaping the 100S ribosome output may be envisioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impact of HflX appears to be highly condition dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that an hflX knockout exhibits no obvious phenotype under standard laboratory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of phenotype may be due to compensation by other functionally redundant factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, E. coli RRF, in conjunction with EF-G, is able to partially complement the growth defect of an E. coli hflX mutant upon heat exposure (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since E. coli HflX is thought to rescue translational stalling under heat stress because HflX splits both vacant 70S and elongation-arrested 70S with an empty A site (46), the negative impact that S. aureus HflX exerts on cell growth and translation at 47 °C seems counterintuitive (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4A and 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that HflX dissociates 100S ribosomes and heat-induced stalled 70S ribosomes, which leads to an increase in translational restart and in turn exacerbates the accumulation of stalled ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, an hflX mutant undergoes the translational restart-stalling cycle at a slower rate, which explains why the hflX mutant is more viable than the wild type at 47 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by preserving a subpool of 100S ribosomes, the hflX mutant becomes more resistant to acute thermal killing (Fig S5A), which is consistent with our recent observation that a loss of HPF dimerization function sensitizes cells to heat killing (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work is certainly needed to better integrate the opposing actions of HPF and HflX into the complex heat stress and stringent response network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heterologous expression of a metagenomics isolated hflX homolog in E. coli confers macrolide resistance through an unknown pathway (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX homologs are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of HflX in higher eukaryotes has not been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant HflX is localized in the chloroplast (37), and 100S dimerization in photosynthetic cyanobacteria is induced by darkness (9); thus, HflX may exert a similar splitting activity on the hibernating 70S chlororibosome (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of the human homolog (GTPBP6) is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, and many somatic mutations in human cancer have been mapped to GTPBP6 (6668).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings will offer general principles of HflX function in the ribosome metabolism and in translational regulation across all biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The in-frame hflX deletion mutant (strain MNY102) was constructed as follows: A 2-kb flanking region of the hflX was PCR amplified with the primer pairs P1054 (SacI, 5-GAC AGA GCT CTA GAG AAT TTT AAA GCA AAC CAA-3)/P1055 (SmaI, 5-TGC CGC GTA CTC TGC GCC CGG GAT AGC CAT GTT ATA CAT CTC CTT AAT AAA ATC-3) and P1056 (SmaI, 5-ATC CCG GGC GCA GAG TAC GCG GCA TAA TAA AAG GAC GAA ATT CAA ATG-3)/P1057 (SalI, 5-ATT TAA TCT ATT ATA TAA GTC CTT GTT CTG TCG ACT GAT-3) via two-step PCR using S. aureus JE2 genomic DNA as the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The product was digested with SacI and SalI and cloned into the same sites of pBT2 (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting pBT2hflX was digested with SmaI, dephosphorylated, and ligated to the blunt-ended 1.3-kb erythromycin (Erm) resistance cassette that was released from pBTE (70) by KpnI and HindIII digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting construct pBT2hflX::Erm was passaged through S. aureus RN4200, and the plasmid was reisolated, electroporated into S. aureus JE2, and selected at 30 °C on tryptic soy broth agar (TSA) plates supplemented with 10 g/mL chloramphenicol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrant was further selected by a 43 °C temperature upshift on chloramphenicol-containing TSA plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homologous recombinant was resolved by 30 °C passages and cycloserine enrichment following the published procedures (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 5 g/mL of erythromycin was used for recombinant selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complementing plasmid of hflX was constructed by cloning the 1.5-kb hflX region into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pLI50 (71) under the control of its native promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hflX DNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification using primers P1060 (EcoRI, 5-CAC CTG AAT TCG TTT CTA CTA CAA AAT CAT AAA TT-3) and P1061 (BamHI, 5-GAA TTG GAT CCT TTT ATT ATT TTT TAA ATC C-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To overexpress the HflX recombinant protein, an 1.3-kb coding region of hflX was PCR amplified with primers P998 (NdeI, 5-GTA TCA TAT GGC TCA GCA ACA AAT TCA TGA TAC-3) and P999 (XhoI, 5-TTC CTC GAG TTA TTA TTT TTT AAA TCC TTT TAT ACG ATA AAC A-3) and the genomic DNA of JE2 as the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR product was ligated to an IPTG-inducible pET28a (Novagen), resulting in plasmid pET28::hflX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HflX GTP hydrolysis mutants S219N and T239A were made with the Quik-Change site-direct mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloning and overproduction of the ribosomal protein S11 and ObgE were performed using the same strategy, except that primers P996 (NdeI, 5-ATG CCA TAT GGC ACG TAA ACA AGT ATC TCG T-3) and P977 (XhoI, 5-ATG CCT CGA GAT CCG CTT ATA CAC GAC GAC GTT TTG GTG G-3) were used to amplify the rpsK region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To amplify obgE, primers P1000 (NcoI, 5-ATC CAT GG TTG TCG ATC AAG TCA AAA TAT CT-3) and P1001 (HindIII, 5-TCA AGC TTC TAA TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGA TGA TGT TCA ACG AAT TCA AAT TCT CCG CC-3) were used and ligated to the NcoI and HindIII sites of pET28a, yielding a C-terminal 8His-tagged ObgE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying pET28a derivatives were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 g/mL kanamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. aureus strains were routinely grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Difco) or chemically defined minimal medium (72) supplemented with 10 g/mL chloramphenicol when maintenance of the pLI50 and pBT2 derivatives was necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains were cultured at 37 °C unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All chemicals and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except ppGpp (TriLink Biotechnologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Overexpression__Purification__and_Antibody_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The purification of the HPF recombinant protein had been described previously (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal His6-tag was removed from HPF by the thrombin CleanCleve Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyclonal anti-HPF had been generated previously (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexahistidine-tagged S11 was purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturers manual [Molecular Cloning Laboratories (MCLAB)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein bands of S11 were excised from SDS/PAGE gels and used to raise antibody in rabbits (Josman).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexahistidine-tagged HflX proteins were purified under phosphate buffer-based native conditions as previously described (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type and mutant HflX recombinant proteins became insoluble during 37 °C growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase solubility, E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the overexpression plasmid was grown at 37 °C until OD600 0.40.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cultures were then moved to a 16 °C shaker incubator and induced by 0.5 mM IPTG (IBI Scientific) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case when HflX proteins were used for GTPase/ATPase assays, phosphate buffer was substituted with 20 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5) in all purification buffers to eliminate free phosphate contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyclonal anti-HflX was raised in rabbits (Josman).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_100S_Formation_and_Dissociation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro 70S dimerization was performed as described previously (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, a 1:1 molar ratio of salt-washed 70S ribosomes (final 0.2 M, calculated using 1 Abs260 = 23 pmol/mL 70S) (74) and purified HPF were mixed in a 100 L reaction containing 1× binding buffer [10×: 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5)/500 mM KOAc/100 mM NH4Cl/100 mM Mg(OAc)2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dimerization was stimulated by 37 °C incubation for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 100S dissociation, a total of 30 L of HflX or one of its mutant proteins was preincubated with various guanosine analogs at different concentrations at room temperature (23 °C) for 15 min, followed by mixing with the dimerization reaction in a total of 130 L containing final concentrations of 2 M of HflX and 02 mM of guanosine analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and finally the samples were layered on a 525% sucrose density gradient made in buffer C [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5)/10 mM MgCl2/100 mM NH4Cl] that was equilibrated with a BioComp Gradient Master.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradients were centrifuged at 210,000 × g at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor for 2.5 h. Fractionation was performed using a Brandel fractionation system equipped with a UA-6 UV/Vis detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sucrose fractions (250 L/fraction) were precipitated with a final concentration 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were washed once with acetone, neutralized with 50 mM Tris base containing Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by 420% TGX SDS/PAGE (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the distribution of HPF, S11, HflX, or 6His-HflX in each sucrose fraction, monoclonal anti-His5 (Qiagen) and polyclonal anti-HPF, anti-S11, and anti-HflX were used for Western blotting at dilution rates of 1/1,000, 1/4,000, 1/4,000, and 1/1,000, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-HflX was preadsorbed with 1 Abs280 unit of hflX lysate at 4 °C overnight before immunoblotting to reduce a background band that closely comigrates with HflX on SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GTP_ATP_Hydrolysis_and_GTP_Binding_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PiColorLock Gold kit (Innova Biosciences) was used to determine the GTPase and ATPase activity of HflX by measuring the amount of free inorganic phosphate (Pi) that binds to the malachite green dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were carried out in a 96-well microplate containing final concentrations of 4 M HflX proteins and 400 M GTP or ATP substrate in a total volume of 200 L in 1× binding buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixtures were incubated on a 37 °C shaker (500 rpm) for 30 min followed by the addition of 1/4× volumes of dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 min, the reactions were stopped by adding 0.1× volumes of stabilizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pi release was measured calorimetrically at 620 nm and quantitated with a phosphate standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final Pi values correspond to micromolar-free Pi after subtraction of a background that contains the same amount of nucleotide substrate and protein elution buffer in 1× binding buffer (HflX omitted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A filter binding assay was used to measure GTP binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five micromolar HflX proteins were mixed with final 0.2 M of nonhydrolyzable [35S]-GTPS (12.5 mCi/mL, 1,250 Ci/mmol; Perkin-Elmer) in a 50-L reaction containing 1× binding buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A background control was prepared with the same components without any protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amounts of BSA, which does not bind GTP, were used in place of HflX to serve as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 25× volumes of precipitation buffer [20%(wt/vol) PEG-6000 in 1× binding buffer].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were applied to a Millipore model 1224 vacuum filtration manifold that was preassembled with a prewetted nitrocellulose BA85 disk (25 mm, 0.45 m; Sigma) and two layers of 25-mm filter paper discs (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disk sandwiches were washed three times with 8 mL of 1× binding buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the air-dried nitrocellulose discs were placed in scintillation vials containing 3 mL of Scintisafe Econo F (Fisher Scientific) mixtures, and radioactivity was measured on a Perkin-Elmer Tri-Carb 2910 instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of GTP binding was expressed in counts per million (cpm) after background subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ribosome_Profiles_and_Cell_Lysate_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crude ribosomes were isolated from S. aureus hpf knockout grown in TSB cultures and prepared by the cryomilling method (3, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-and-a-half Abs260 units of lysate were loaded on a 525% sucrose gradient and fractionated as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Western blotting, S. aureus cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A [20 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5)/14 mM Mg(OAc)2/100 mM KCl/1 mM DTT/0.5 mM PMSF] and homogenized with Lysing Matrix B (100 mg beads/mL cells; MP Biomedicals) on a Retsch MM400 mixer mill at 15 Hz in five 3-min cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clarified lysates were recovered by spinning at 20,817× g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove cell debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 0.10.2 Abs280 units of cell lysate were analyzed on 420% TGX SDS/PAGE gels (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To separate ribosome-bound and unbound fractions, 0.2 Abs280 units of cell lysates were spun through a 1.1 M sucrose cushion made of buffer A in a Beckman TLA-120 rotor at 4 °C, 100,000× g for 2.5 h. The pellet was directly resuspended in Laemmli buffer, whereas the supernatant was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both fractions were resolved on 420% TGX SDS/PAGE (Bio-Rad) and subjected to immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pulse-Chase_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pulse-chase analyses were performed as described with minor modifications (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, overnight TSB cultures were washed three times with defined minimal medium 4 (M4), diluted into fresh M4, and adjusted to OD600 0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After growing in a 47 °C water bath shaker until OD600 0.25 (135 min), cells were pulse labeled with 30 Ci/mL of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals) for 3 min and chased with an excess amount of unlabeled methionine/casamino acid mix at various time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each time point, 1 mL of culture was poured over 0.5 mL of ice in a prechilled microtube containing a final concentration of 15 g/mL lysostaphin (AMBI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysis was achieved by incubation on ice for 20 min, followed by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total proteins were analyzed by 420% TGX SDS/PAGE (Bio-Rad), and radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
