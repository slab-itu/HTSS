Grad-seq guides the discovery of ProQ as a major small RNA-binding protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the functions of cellular transcripts based on their sequence is challenging, in particular for noncoding RNAs, which tend to lack easily recognizable motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more functionally relevant criterion is the association of RNAs with cognate RNA-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) approach to draft global RNA landscapes through partitioning all cellular transcripts into diverse coding and noncoding groups based on their shared RNAprotein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grad-seq has enabled us to define a large class of structured small RNAs that commonly associate with the conserved RNA-binding protein ProQ and appears to constitute a new branch of posttranscriptional control in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generic nature of the Grad-seq approach will help to rapidly describe functional RNA landscapes in numerous understudied microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The functional annotation of transcriptomes and identification of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) classes has been greatly facilitated by the advent of next-generation RNA sequencing which, by reading the nucleotide order of transcripts, theoretically allows the rapid profiling of all transcripts in a cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, primary sequence per se is a poor predictor of function, as ncRNAs dramatically vary in length and structure and often lack identifiable motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to visualize an informative RNA landscape of organisms with potentially new RNA biology that are emerging from microbiome and environmental studies requires the use of more functionally relevant criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such criterion is the association of RNAs with functionally important cognate RNA-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we analyze the full ensemble of cellular RNAs using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica, partitioning its coding and noncoding transcripts based on their network of RNAprotein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to capturing established RNA classes based on their biochemical profiles, the Grad-seq approach enabled the discovery of an overlooked large collective of structured small RNAs that form stable complexes with the conserved protein ProQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ProQ is an abundant RNA-binding protein with a wide range of ligands and a global influence on Salmonella gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its generic ability to chart a functional RNA landscape irrespective of transcript length and sequence diversity, Grad-seq promises to define functional RNA classes and major RNA-binding proteins in both model species and genetically intractable organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Global_Partitioning_of_Cellular_RNAs_by_Grad-Seq  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To describe the RNP landscape in the model enteric bacterium S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (henceforth Salmonella), we applied a high-throughput biochemical profiling approach (Grad-seq) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grad-seq relies on the sedimentation of cellular RNAs and proteins in a glycerol gradient, which sorts complexes by size and shape and offers a means to assess their involvement in various macromolecular assemblies (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this biochemical partitioning step, we analyzed the RNA content of each of the 20 gradient fractions by Illumina cDNA sequencing and visualized the sedimentation profiles of 3,969 individual Salmonella transcripts (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These profiles readily matched the expected distributions of housekeeping RNAs in glycerol gradients, including the 16S and 23S rRNAs, which cosediment with the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits, respectively, tmRNA and the SRP and RNase P RNA components (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfer RNAs primarily exist in small RNPs (average s020,w 5S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the tRNA sedimentation profiles (SI Appendix, Fig S1) correspond to those of their main protein partners, namely aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA modification enzymes and elongation factor Tu, based on liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) detection of 1,326 proteins in total from the same gradient fractions (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Likewise, 6S RNA associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP) to modulate the activity of the transcription machinery (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained almost congruent profiles of 6S RNA reads and RNAP-derived peptides (Spearmans 0.62 less_than r less_than 0.91, P less_than 0.0034), which matched in-gradient profiles determined by standard techniques (Fig 1C): both indicated the formation of a 16S complex, corresponding to a previously reported particle of 500600 kDa (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulatory ncRNAs were more heterogeneously distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Hfq-associated sRNAs (11) sedimented broadly in fractions 37 (average s020,w 11S, or 350 kDa) with additional peaks in the 30S or 70S ribosome fractions (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representatives of other functional RNA classes (attenuators, antisense RNAs, Hfq-independent sRNAs) displayed even more disparate distributions, suggesting that they are associated with several distinct RBPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, mRNAs abundantly populate both the 30S and 70S ribosome fractions (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA reads in lower molecular weight fractions likely represent untranslated mRNAs in complex with regulatory proteins or stable decay intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the profile of the dual-function tmRNA, which rescues stalled ribosomes (28), combined profile features of both coding and noncoding RNAs with pronounced peaks in both low molecular weight and 70S fractions (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Topology_of_a_Bacterial_RNA_Interactome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the 3,969 RNA profiles obtained (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Dataset S1), we observed that transcripts with similar biochemical behavior cosegregated, based on the first two principal components that correlate with the profile complexity, i.e., the number of individual peaks in a profile (PC1), and the sedimentation coefficient of complexes (PC2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bacterial RNA universe exhibits two major branches: the upper protein-coding branch is dominated by mRNAs whose behavior is determined by ribosomal components, whereas the noncoding branch toward the bottom is enriched in ncRNAs that are associated with a variety of low molecular weight complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ncRNAs found in the upper branch of the map mostly consisted of mRNA-derived sRNAs (overlapping and often processed from UTRs or coding regions of messengers) (16, 29) or misidentified short mRNAs, which explains their association with ribosomal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this simple and logical structure reveals the fundamental dichotomy of coding and noncoding RNA functions within the cell, reflected at the level of RNAprotein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Cluster_of_Noncoding_RNAs_That_Interact_with_Protein_ProQ  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focusing the PCA on sRNAs revealed several distinct transcript clusters (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most well-characterized Hfq-dependent sRNAs (11) form a dense group on this map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, even Hfq-associated sRNAs that differ fourfold in length, such as ArcZ (57 nt) and GcvB (206 nt) clustered together (SI Appendix, Fig S4), indicating that biochemical properties rather than sequence determined their in-gradient distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the CsrA-binding sRNAs (19) CsrB and CsrC (360 and 240 nt, respectively) almost overlapped on the map (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, there are many annotated Salmonella sRNAs, including attenuators, cis-antisense RNAs and uncharacterized species, that populated the map outside the Hfq- or CsrA-related clusters (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raised the possibility that some of these ncRNAs interact with an unknown global RBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the associated RBP(s) we tagged 12 sRNAs from outside the Hfq and CsrA clusters with the MS2 aptamer (30) and pulled down interacting proteins from Salmonella cell lysates (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, we detected several candidate protein binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of sedimentation profiles from our reference proteomics dataset (SI Appendix, Fig S3) with those of the bait sRNAs identified the ProQ protein as the most common and highly correlated partner (Spearmans 0.48 less_than r less_than 0.7, P less_than 0.033, Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed the enrichment of ProQ in sRNA pull-down samples compared with control RNA pull downs (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ProQ is a FinO-like osmoregulatory protein required for optimal expression of proline channel ProP (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ProQ homologs can be predicted in the chromosomes, plasmids, and bacteriophages of -, - and -proteobacteria (SI Appendix, Fig S6), many of which lack a proP gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the high abundance and constitutive expression of ProQ (33, 34) are also inconsistent with a specialized function: in a semiquantitative Western blot analysis, ProQ levels compare with those of the highly expressed general RBPs, CsrA, Hfq, or ribosomal protein S1 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we find that deletion of proQ affects the levels of hundreds of transcripts with no known function in osmoprotection (SI Appendix, Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations suggest a much broader cellular role for ProQ than fine-tuning ProP expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ProQ-Associated_sRNAs_Form_a_Distinct_Group_of_Riboregulators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a better understanding of the target suite of ProQ in Salmonella, we used RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis suggested that ProQ associates with 400 cellular transcripts from diverse cellular pathways (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8 and Dataset S3), with small RNAs being significantly overrepresented (98/422, or 23.2%, compared with the annotated 547/5,205 or 10.5%, P less_than 0.0001, Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding these noncoding targets (SI Appendix, Table S1), ProQ preferentially bound to Hfq-independent sRNAs (P less_than 0.0007, MannWhitney test, P less_than 0.003, KolmogorovSmirnov test; only two ProQ-bound sRNAs, SraC and STnc520, are known to be Hfq dependent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the existence of a distinct class of noncoding transcripts, which comprised 18% of all currently known Salmonella sRNAs, most (80%) of which are currently uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The few ProQ-enriched sRNAs of known function included attenuators (SraF), trans-acting base-pairing sRNAs (SraL) (35), sRNA-sequestering sponges (STnc2180) (36), and type I antitoxins (Sib, Rdl, IstR) (24, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diverse types of antisense RNAs (antitoxins, chromosomal, phage and transposon associated), which typically operate in a Hfq-independent manner (24), are particularly overrepresented among ProQ ligands (53/98, or 54%, compared with the annotated 216/547, or 39%, P = 0.008, Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the group of sRNAs used as bait in MS2 aptamer pull-down assays (Fig 3) showed significantly higher median enrichment in ProQ coimmunoprecipitation compared with all sRNAs (P less_than 0.003, MannWhitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ProQ-bound sRNAs formed relatively small RNPs (average s020,w 7S, corresponding to 100150 kDa, Fig 4B), and clearly segregated from Hfq- and CsrA-bound transcripts within the sRNA PCA plot (Fig 4C and SI Appendix, Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This separation illustrates the discriminatory power of Grad-seq in identifying collectives of biochemically similar RNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMSAs with purified Salmonella ProQ confirmed the high affinity and specific binding of several enriched sRNAs in vitro, supporting their involvement in stable ProQ-containing RNP particles (SI Appendix, Fig S9 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Top-enriched ProQ sRNA ligands, such as SibA and STnc2090, formed complexes with apparent dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range, similar to the affinities typically observed in interactions of Hfq and CsrA with cognate RNAs (7, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of note, most ProQ-associated sRNAs form extensively base-paired structures, in some cases resembling eukaryotic miRNA precursors (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant positive relationship was observed between the predicted folding energy of Salmonella sRNAs and ProQ binding (SI Appendix, Fig S9E), suggesting that, similar to the RNA chaperone FinO (32, 38), interactions between ProQ and RNAs are at least partially structure driven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These binding preferences contrast with the typical modes of Hfq (12) or CsrA (39) binding, which use single-stranded regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Hfq-dependent sRNAs, whose only recurrent structured region is the intrinsic terminator stem loop (12), appear to be significantly less folded than ProQ-associated ones (SI Appendix, Fig S9F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ProQ-interacting sRNAs form a structurally distinct class of ncRNAs, and ProQ may fill the niche of a global RBP that associates specifically with highly structured transcripts in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_ProQ_on_Associated_RNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Association of an RNA with a cellular protein may not necessarily impact its function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that ProQ affected the abundance of many of its sRNA ligands (Fig 5), as their cellular levels decreased upon proQ deletion (proQ); conversely, overexpressing the protein (proQ+) increased the levels of most ProQ-associated sRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using the drug rifampicin to arrest bacterial transcription, we observed that in the absence of ProQ the half-lives of several selected ProQ-bound sRNAs were reduced, whereas increased levels of ProQ generally resulted in sRNA overstabilization (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ProQ likely protects some of its ligands from degradation and thus may extend the time window for their cellular activity, similar to the FinO protein with its sole known RNA substrate, FinP (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected from the large suite of ProQ-bound RNAs, proQ deletion dramatically affects gene expression in Salmonella, changing the levels of 800 transcripts (16% of genome, SI Appendix, Fig S10A and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathways significantly overrepresented in the group of differentially regulated genes include energy production, amino acid metabolism, and translation (SI Appendix, Fig S10B), indicating that ProQ pervasively impacts bacterial physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ProQ seemed to exert both direct and indirect effects on its ligands as 36% of ProQ-associated RNAs showed significant changes in expression levels (of which 28% are up-regulated and 72% are down-regulated upon proQ deletion, P less_than 0.0001, Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, mRNA targets of the few ProQ-dependent sRNAs whose functions are known, such as cis-acting Sib antitoxin RNAs (37), were derepressed in response to proQ deletion and overrepressed in the proQ+ strain (SI Appendix, Fig S10C and Dataset S4), suggesting that some of the observed gene expression changes are sRNA mediated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data reveal the existence of a large ProQ-dependent regulon and position ProQ as the third global posttranscriptional gene expression modulator in bacteria besides Hfq and CsrA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Grad-seq approach provides an experimental and analytical framework to rapidly visualize the major RNA collectives of an organism of interest, which will be particularly useful in drafting initial functional RNA landscapes for many understudied microbes with unexplored RNA biology (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With rapidly improving sequencing technologies and decreasing cost, Grad-seq will be able to partition major RNA classes susceptible to therapeutic intervention in medically important microbial communities such as the gut microbiota, the vast majority of whose species remain unculturable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Grad-seq has conceptual parallels with other methods that have been used to describe the RNP landscape of a cell and efficiently combines their individual strengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, ribosome profiling (43) employs a similar approach to partition and sequence cellular transcripts but focuses exclusively on those associated with translating ribosomes, whereas Grad-seq also describes smaller RNPs associated with noncoding RNA functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, RNPomics (26) aims to enrich and sequence functionally relevant cellular RNA species by separating them from unbound RNA by glycerol gradient centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resulting RNPs are subsequently studied in bulk, without fractionation, decreasing the resolution of the biochemical information obtained on transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA interactome capture (44, 45) is an extremely powerful approach that aims to globally characterize cellular RBPs by deep mass-spectrometric analysis of proteins cross-linked to cellular RNA, but it also operates in bulk, without distinguishing individual RNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key advantage of Grad-seq is the biochemical grouping of cellular transcripts into RNA collectives of likely similar function, to subsequently identify common protein partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although currently a two-step technique, improving the resolution of Grad-seq through finer fractionation, more comprehensive protein detection, and the decreasing costs for RNA-seq may soon permit a more direct approach to match RNAprotein profiles, enabling the analysis of complex eukaryotic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The power of Grad-seq is here illustrated by unveiling ProQ as a global RNA-binding hub in addition to Hfq and CsrA, which is remarkable in light of the extensive previous work on E. coli and Salmonella as the current workhorses of bacterial RNA research (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our discovery of a large class of ProQ-associated sRNAs opens the door for further studies of this potential domain of posttranscriptional control, which will likely reveal molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of RNA in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent study in Legionella identified a ProQ-like protein as a matchmaker of sRNAmRNA interactions in the regulation of bacterial competence (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Grad-Seq  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salmonella cells grown to OD600 = 2 were lysed in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 units/mL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 200 units/mL SUPERase-IN (Life Technologies) with 0.1-mm glass beads (BioSpec Products) on a Retsch MM400 machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleared lysates were centrifuged through linear 1040% (wt/vol) glycerol gradients in the same buffer formed in Beckman SW40Ti tubes at 100,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C and fractionated in 20 equal fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractions were deproteinized with 1% SDS and 1 volume of hot phenol by shaking at 55 °C for 5 min, centrifuged, and RNA was precipitated with isopropanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For Grad-seq, two biological replicates have been analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty-five picograms per microliter of the spike-in RNA [5 P-CUCGUCCGACGUCACCUAGA (IBM GmbH)] had been added to each fraction prior to the library preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq libraries were prepared by Vertis Biotechnologie and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads were mapped to the Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 genome with the use of the READemption pipeline version 0.3.4 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractionwise gene-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) read counts were normalized by corresponding spike-in counts and any remaining uniformly distorting biases were manually removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All profiles with 30 reads in at least one fraction were power transformed to improve linearity and standardized to the range from 0 to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To derive averaged distributions for RNA classes, profiles of individual RNAs were summed up and averaged fractionwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA was performed in R and visualized in R and Python.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sRNAs, PC1 mostly reflects the influence of mRNA-derived and overlapping sRNAs (following, like mRNAs, strong ribosomal components) and is uninformative for our purpose of revealing groups of ncRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We opted for PC2 and PC3 analysis instead, which allowed a better resolution and clustering of typical sRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both PC1 vs. PC2 and PC2 vs. PC3 plots are available on SI Appendix, Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE62988).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The workflow implemented as Shell script and the analysis-specific tools are deposited at Zenodo at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.35176.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All molecular weight estimates provided in this work were made assuming a most frequently encountered moderately elongated shape of particles (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
