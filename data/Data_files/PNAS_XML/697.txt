String method solution of the gating pathways for a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution structures of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels have created an opportunity to discover the mechanisms of rapid synaptic transduction in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study describes the mechanisms of allosteric channel gating using string method simulations, applied to a complete atomistic ion channel, combined with a transition analysis approach to extract free-energy surfaces from swarms of trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reproduce pH-modulated activity of the channel, identify the molecular interactions associated with interdomain communication, and quantify the energetics of the gating process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide general mechanistic understanding of the function of pentameric ligand-gated channels, with potential applications in the design of improved anesthetics, neuromodulatory drugs, antiparasitics, and pesticides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels control synaptic neurotransmission by converting chemical signals into electrical signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agonist binding leads to rapid signal transduction via an allosteric mechanism, where global protein conformational changes open a pore across the nerve cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use all-atom molecular dynamics with a swarm-based string method to solve for the minimum free-energy gating pathways of the proton-activated bacterial GLIC channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe stable wetted/open and dewetted/closed states, and uncover conformational changes in the agonist-binding extracellular domain, ion-conducting transmembrane domain, and gating interface that control communication between these domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition analysis is used to compute free-energy surfaces that suggest allosteric pathways; stabilization with pH; and intermediates, including states that facilitate channel closing in the presence of an agonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a switching mechanism that senses proton binding by marked reorganization of subunit interface, altering the packing of -sheets to induce changes that lead to asynchronous pore-lining M2 helix movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide molecular details of GLIC gating and insight into the allosteric mechanisms for the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conformational_Changes_Along_the_Activation_String  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have carried out a swarm-based string method calculation that exploits large numbers of short simulations to explore configurational space and converge on the minimum free-energy pathways of activation (2325) (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure requires selection of a small set of collective variables that account for the dominant protein conformational changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallographic C and O GLIC states have previously revealed a marked radial spreading (also called blooming) and tangential twisting of the ECD, leading to a structurally diverse C state (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ECD -sandwich is composed of inner and outer sheets, with connecting loops (Fig 1A) that are thought to contribute to signal communication (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered packing against these -sheets is thought to lead to expansion of the lower -sandwich, evidenced in GLIC by the breaking of the D32-R192 salt bridge (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although D32 is not strictly conserved (SI Appendix, Fig S1), this bridge is part of a largely conserved triplet, D32-R192-D122, of which R192-D122 is highly conserved and essential for function (27, 28), and mutation of D32 in GLIC causes loss of function (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breaking of D32-R192 and -sandwich expansion likely cause changes that influence interdomain communication via deflection of the pre-M1 R192 residue (2931), or through noncovalent interactions, as indicated in Fig 1B (observed in string simulations and described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the TMD pore is narrowed in the C state associated with M2 helix movement inward and away from its partner M1 helix in the neighboring [complementary or ()] subunit (4), leading to pore constriction via hydrophobic residues (32) and expelling of water (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations have guided our selection of variables, as outlined in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following targeted MD simulations between O and C states at low (pH 4.6) and high (pH 7) pH to provide initial guess pathways, string optimization in the full dihedral space of the protein was first carried out, allowing statistics to guide reduction of correlated variables (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final choice of 35 variables (seven per subunit), as defined in Methods, is illustrated in Fig 2 AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimizations in this 35D space were carried out to convergence, with two independent strings for each pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin here by reporting the approximate order of conformational changes along these strings, each consisting of a set of 42 images distributed between the O and C states (40 images plus two fixed end points), as summarized in Fig 2D for pH 4.6 (independent strings are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and C, results for pH 7 provided in SI Appendix, Fig S3 B and D, and raw data are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These image-image trends only provide a guide to the sequence of changes, subject to fluctuations in a broad energy well (described below), in contrast to the quantitative statistical analyses to follow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At low pH, following the initial rapid progress in ECD changes from O (Fig 2D, image numbers to the left) to C (Fig 2D, image numbers to the right), we see changes in TMD variables (M2 collapse and dehydration), lower -sandwich (-expansion), M2-M1() distance, and M1 kink (with all variables normalized).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus appears that ECD expansion and twisting are required before other changes can occur to close the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contracted ECD can be considered as a stabilizing cap on the O state that needs to be released for channel closing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse process (C to O) does not experience the same order, because the C-state ECD is already expanded and twisted, with the dynamic ECD allowing for multiple concurrent changes during opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the high ECD twist at image 40 is due to holding the string end at the initial C structure, whereas the optimized C state, spanning a range of images, has a reduced level of twist, such that the majority of ECD changes occur late (to the left) in the opening process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, -contraction is the initial step, preceding TMD transitions, and the last (or slowest) change then involves the ECD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high pH, the process is similar (SI Appendix, Fig S3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest ECD change is the trigger for global change during closing, whereas -contraction is the trigger in channel opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimates of the reversible work to change a string variable from the O to C state (SI Appendix, Fig S4, Right) were obtained from forces during constrained trajectories (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These profiles reveal that several kilocalories per mole are required to move from the O state to the C state at low pH, but that changes become more favorable at high pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This equilibrium shift is seen in each profile, yet it is the ECD that contains the protonating sites that drive gating, as we now examine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quaternary_ECD_Changes_Driven_by_Protonation_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the protein changes from O to C at pH 4.6, ECD spreading and twisting occur steeply (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twist increases from 12.7° to 16.7° midway along the coordinate, overtwisting before dropping to 15.2° in the C state, with similar changes at high pH (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small overspread can also be seen in two of four independent strings in SI Appendix, Fig S4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may suggest an unlocking and alignment of the ECD before interactions can be formed that stabilize the C state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GLIC has a number of titratable residues expected to change protonation states between pH 4.6 and pH 7 (Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the only histidine determined to change state was H277, this residue, at the base of the TMD, is not expected to drive ECD changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue H127 was found to be protonated at both pH values, whereas H235 was always deprotonated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No basic residues or aspartates were determined to change state, with pH sensitivity coming exclusively from glutamates at the ECD subunit interface, including E26, E35, E75, and E82 (and E243 at the top of M2 in the TMD; Fig 1A); E177 on loop C, which forms the usual agonist binding lid; and two other loops (E67 and E69) exposed to solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The net subunit charge changing from +4e to 5e with pH results in a long-ranged Coulombic expansion force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although changing interaction energies have been observed within and across subunits as a function of pH (SI Appendix, Fig S5A), such analysis is limited in its ability to explain the influence of particular residues on conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the contributions to ECD spreading directly, we have computed a residue decomposition of electrostatic reversible work in Fig 3A (summarized in Fig 3B for pH 7pH 4.6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the approximate treatment of electrolyte screening (SI Appendix, Supporting Analysis), these results provide a guide to whether residues assist or oppose gating with pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues E35 and E75 (as well as E69, despite screening) assist ECD spreading, with increased pH driving the channel to the C state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue E243, although in the TMD, also assists in ECD spreading through repulsive forces on the neighboring subunit (including with E243 itself).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular note is that E75 reverses its effect with pH (contracting at low pH and expanding at high pH), owing to repulsive partners on the complementary subunit (notably D88 and D91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E75 is part of the largely conserved WXPD/E motif on loop A, important for loop A/B interactions that create an orthosteric site in other pLGICs (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than leading to an intersubunit pocket, E75 deprotonation appears to control ECD spread through its exposure to the complementary subunit face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue E82 is well screened and has little effect, whereas E177 and E26 oppose ECD spreading and help keep the channel open at high pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of E177 was unexpected, because it sits at the periphery, but it lies on loop C, which caps agonists in eukaryotic neurotransmitter pLGICs, with protonation potentially mimicking agonist binding through attractive intersubunit interactions, consistent with the role of loop C in proton activation (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rearrangements_at_the_ECDTMD_Interface_and_TMD_Pore  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ECD spreading and twisting alter the packing against the -sheets, which extend down to the gating interface, signified by lower -sandwich expansion [separation of -sheets in the vicinity of R192 (pre-M1) and D32 (loop 2) from 11.513 Å; SI Appendix, Fig S4D] and the breaking of the R192-D32 salt bridge upon channel closing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This movement deflects the pre-M1 main-chain linkage from ECD to M1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we observe M1 to kink at P204, increasing its value by 5° upon closing (SI Appendix, Fig S4G), likely influencing pore collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, M1() interacts favorably with M2 in the O state, through H-bonds N200-N239 and S196-E243, but not in the C state (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expansion of the lower -sandwich alters the proximity of D32 to key TMD residues (Fig 1B), influencing the M2-M3 loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of this loop is important for GLIC and other pLGICs (9, 10, 20, 28), and its crystal conformation may have been influenced by nearby lipid and detergent molecules (4, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on string simulations, we observe distinct molecular events, in addition to overall movement of the segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B (also Movie S1) shows flipping of a conserved LPX motif (246248; X = K in GLIC; SI Appendix, Fig S1) in M2-M3, rotating K248 upward, from interaction with mostly D32() (preceding subunit) and E243 in the TMD in the O state, to interaction with D32 (same subunit) in the C state [as well as Y119 (67/Cys loop), Y197 (M1) and E243].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this rotation is coincident with L246 movement downward via a rigid LPK wing nut structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L246 is bound in an aromatic cleft formed by the Cys loop (F116 and Y119) in the O state, but it detaches and binds to the TMD, behind M2, in the C state when the -sandwich no longer offers a defined pocket (or it is occluded by P247).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This movement apparently wedges closed the pore (Fig 1B, Right), and is consistent with L246s high conservation and loss-of-function mutations in pLGICs (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, L246 pushes into the allosteric intersubunit site for general anesthetics, suggesting a mechanism for receptor modulation from this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closure of the TMD pore is well represented by the M2 radius, which decreases from 12.1 Å to 11.3 Å upon closing at low pH (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S4F), with the number of water molecules in the pore dropping from 38 to 0 (SI Appendix, Fig S6A), as well as by M2-M1() distance, which undergoes a change from 13.5 Å to 17.5 Å (pH 7 is shown in SI Appendix, Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M2-M1() is a good subunit variable defining pore gating, undergoing a discrete change that involves loss of helical contacts between subunits (Fig 2 B and C), although it also contributes to ECD-TMD twist via its tangential component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TMD is slightly different in the optimized O state compared with PDB ID code 4HFI, being more open according to M2-M1() distance, which decreased from 14 Å to 13.5 Å, likely stabilizing M2-M1() packing, but similar or marginally reduced M2 radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes during optimization may help explain difficulties in maintaining a wetted pore in microsecond-order simulations based on 4HFI/3EAM (3436), whereas string simulations indefinitely maintain a wetted O state over 400 iterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have reported a string method optimization of the activation process for the GLIC ion channel, demonstrating modulated receptor function due to pH, revealing the pathways connecting stable O and C states via intermediates, and observing the communication mechanisms between agonist-binding ECD and ion-conducting TMD domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key stimulus for gating is the protonation/deprotonation of residues that control ECD intersubunit interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have made predictions for residues that generate force to spread or contract the ECD upon pH increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key titrated residues in our model are E35, E75, and E243, acting to close the channel at high pH (and thus, if mutated, would cause gain of function), with opposite effects from E26 and E177, acting to promote an O state at high pH (and thus, if mutated, would cause loss of function).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of E177 suggests an interesting parallel to pLGICs that gate via agonist binding under loop C, whereas E75, at a pLGIC orthosteric site, highlights the role of loop AB intersubunit interactions in gating and modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues close to the gating interface, such as E35 and E26, might play direct roles in -sheet expansion; for example, E35 sits on 1-2, packing against P247 on M2-M3 and contacting hydrophobic Cys loop and loop 9 residues from the adjacent subunit in the O state, which would be disfavored by protonation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The result of deprotonation at high pH is to spread and twist the ECD, which are the leading events in channel closure, but the final steps in channel opening (Fig 2D), consistent with the simulations of Cecchini and coworkers for GluCl (20) and analysis by Auerbach and coworkers for nAChR (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that high levels of ECD twist are required along the gating pathway, making it an important variable for gating (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Threshold levels of ECD spread alter the packing of subunits sufficiently to expand the lower -sandwich around D32 (loop 2) and R192 (pre-M1), representing a binary switch mechanism for signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One interpretation is that the -sandwich acts as an all-or-nothing switch that senses analog agonist signal to turn off or on the output electrical signal, as opposed to a gradual change that would be difficult to reconcile with the single conductance state seen experimentally (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Breaking of the D32-R192 salt bridge has consequences for the TMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ECDTMD coupling may occur via the pre-M1 linkage (30), where R192 movement can lead to M1 kinking, likely destabilizing its neighboring M2 in its O state (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have, however, identified interesting 1-2M2-M3 loop interactions with strong interdomain dependencies that were not seen in GLIC crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K248 on M2-M3 is bound mostly within the TMD in the O state, but flips up to make contact with D32 in the C state, enabled by the freeing of D32 from R192 and the lining up of same-subunit residues through tangential twist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although K248 has a corresponding R or K in the ELIC, GABAAR, and GlyR subunits, it is lacking in GluCl, 5HT3 receptor, and nAChR (SI Appendix, Fig S1), likely leading to variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K248 is part of a well-conserved LPX motif (X = K in GLIC; SI Appendix, Fig S1), with L246 stably bound in a hydrophobic cleft in the Cys loop in the O state, but driven into the TMD between M2 and M3 when the motif rotates, acting as a wedge to assist M2 collapse (Fig 1B and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments introducing unnatural cis-proline have shown increased open probability in nAChRs (41), likely rotating the L246 equivalent upward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in the C state, L246 sits adjacent to F14, which occupies the pLGIC ethanol binding site, offering insight into how ethanol and anesthetic bromoform modulate pLGICs (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our free-energy analysis has demonstrated strong connections between K248/L246 movements and both ECD and TMD changes, suggesting involvement in interdomain communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This communication thus centers on the changing availability of D32 during gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D32 is part of a conserved triplet of interactions, with R192 maintaining interaction with D122 along the path (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13G and S14G), and change involving only D32-R192 breakage (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13A and S14A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D32E and D32N mutation both lower the pH50 [by 0.71.5 (4)] and D32A leads to loss of activity (28), whereas in GlyR, the equivalent E53C reduces agonist sensitivity 10-fold (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D32 is conserved in GlyR, GABAAR, nAChR, and 5HT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In channels lacking a D32 equivalent (GluCl and ELIC in SI Appendix, Fig S1), we cannot rule out roles for neighboring 1-2 carboxylates, but postulate those channels might rely on pre-M1 communication, requiring the same -sandwich expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our free-energy surfaces revealed flickering between O and nonconducting intermediate I3, but that transfer to the C state requires -expansion, driven by ECD change via intermediate I2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the relationship between I2 and I3, it is important to realize that a minimum on one free-energy projection may correspond to diverse configurations in another; for example, a minimum based on -sandwich and pore variables could correspond to a whole distribution of ECD spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster analysis demonstrated related configurations for I2 (from ECD spread-sandwich projection; Fig 5A) and I3 [from M2-M1()-sandwich projection; Fig 5B] (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although I2s role is in maintaining a compact -sandwich while spreading the ECD, the I3 state exhibits a range of ECD change, yet with a common intact -sandwich that represents the key intermediate gating feature (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I2 and I3 together represent a preactivated state in the C-O transition, consistent with the pLGIC flip kinetic state (44, 45), supported by the relationship between 1-2 rearrangements and agonist efficacy in GlyR (46, 47), as well as by -analysis for the conformational wave of nAChR activation (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I2 and I3 states present a flipped LPK motif, associated with a closed pore, yet to be stabilized by interactions with the broken D32-R192 linkage (SI Appendix, Fig S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the I3 clusters have low rmsd to the proposed intermediate LC (C-like TMD, O-like ECD; SI Appendix, Table S2), suggesting that decoupling of ECD and TMD changes plays a role in gating, assisting closure in the presence of an agonist (26, 45, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high pH, there is evidence for additional nonconducting states with semicollapsed M2 helices, implying entropically driven closure; for example, state I1 (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S16) exhibits a semiclosed but nonconducting pore and transitional changes in the gating interface, indicated by L246 position, consistent with -analysis suggesting multistep M2 movements in nAChR (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During channel closure, M2 movements appear overall iris-like (37), yet exhibit a degree of asynchronous collapse, resembling a postulated domino mechanism (38, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-energy maps demonstrate that once the energy to collapse one subunit partially is paid, the neighboring subunit will fully collapse without further cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can understand this sequential nature from interactions between neighboring M2 and M1() and across the gating interface (involving M2-M3 and 1-2) between subunits, as well as from the fact that pore dewetting occurs as a result of initial M2 collapse, assisting subsequent M2 movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partial or complete M2 movement would lead to a nonconducting pore, consistent with the lack of GLIC subconductance states (16, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pLGICs with larger (e.g., GlyR 3JAE/F; SI Appendix, Fig S8E) or more hydrophilic pores, however, partial movements could result in a semiconducting pore, as seen for GlyRs (52), modulated by interactions between M2-M1() (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One might expect that these mechanisms would be largely shared within the pLGIC family, based on conservation of structures and residues, as well as the ability to form functional chimeras between GLIC and other members of the family (15, 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available O and C high-resolution structures for GluCl and GlyR share dominant ECD and TMD pore movements and features at the gating interface, including interaction between D122 and R192 and M2-M3 loop displacement (3, 10, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, comparisons shown in SI Appendix, Fig S8, overlaying available structures on GLIC free-energy maps, suggest differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GluCl, changes between O (3RIA) and C (4TNV) are similar in terms of ECD radius, ECD twist, -expansion, and M2 radius, although they exhibit reduced M2-M1() movement [previously noted (20)], perhaps due to the use of ivermectin to trap the GluCl O structure (3) or due to sequence differences in M2-M3 and 1-2 loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GlyR O (3JAE/F) and C (3JAD) structures reveal similar behavior for ECD twist and M2 radius (on an expanded scale), but with less -expansion and markedly reduced ECD spread and M2-M1() distance [although this finding appears inconsistent with evidence for the interactions between M2-M1() that stabilize the GlyR O state (53)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences are most prominent in the C state, for which GluCl and GlyR were stabilized by antibody fragments or the competitive inhibitor strychnine, although they may also be attributed to variability between cation- and anion-selective, or prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finding that the GLIC O-state structure is similarly open following optimization [with slight movement of M2 toward M1() to help stabilize the wetted pore], reinforces the fact that PDB ID code 4HFI (or PDB ID code 3EAM) corresponds to the O state, not artificially stabilized by detergent molecules, being absent in these simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbiased simulations confirm this stable state, with repeated rewetting transitions (not previously seen in simulations from crystal structures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We remark that optimization of the O state also leads to an E-2 (bottom of M2) radius increase by 0.3 Å, with a lower M2 (2 to 9) azimuthal rotation (10) away from 4HFI by 17°, acting to widen the lower pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 1.2 Å less wide than the most open GlyR structure, it is over 1 Å wider than the collapsed form of that channel (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences may be natural consequences of cation versus anion permeation, with Na+ passing the constriction with the help of direct E-2 coordination (as well as backbone) (14, 16), in contrast to Cl, which is expected to move as a hydrated ion past P-2 in GlyR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variations may suggest that although the current studies inform us of pLGIC allosteric mechanisms in general, detailed TMD changes may most directly relate to cationic members of the family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we set out to understand GLIC channel activation using string method simulations and have made predictions for pH sensitivity and the interactions governing allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used free-energy analysis of swarms of trajectories to demonstrate GLIC modulation quantitatively by protons, consistent with experimental pH dependence (4), and solved for a stable O state, verified with unbiased MD simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deprotonation of residues at the subunit interface drives ECD change during channel closure, consistent with observations for GluCl and nAChR (20, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated forces have revealed the titrated residues responsible, including glutamates close to the gating interface likely to control -sandwich change, on loop C [consistent with its role in pH sensitivity (33)] mimicking eukaryotic pLGICs, as well as at a conserved loop A ligand-binding site (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revealed a binary switch (-sandwich expansion, D32-R192 breaking) that responds to threshold ECD change and directly communicates movement to the TMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D32-R192 is part of a functionally important triplet (27, 28), with D32 mutation causing loss of function in GLIC and GlyR (4, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -sandwich switching influences the TMD via the M2-M3 loop, which is important for function (9, 10, 20, 28) and identified in nAChR activation (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A conserved LPX (L246, P247, and K248 in GLIC) motif flips to engage D32 in the expanded -sandwich, driving L246 [essential for pLGIC function (4)] down toward a general anesthetic site (42, 43) to force the pore closed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P247 is important in nAChRs (41), and our observations for K248 explain its experimental mutant phenotypes in GLIC (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our independently solved intermediate with a closed pore and compact -sandwich includes an LC-like form seen experimentally (5), and provides a low-energy path in the presence of agonist, consistent with the preactive (26) or flip (45, 49) pLGIC state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe iris-like M2 movements, consistent with studies of a TMD-only channel (37), but modulated by the gating interface, leading to asynchronous movements involving partial collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of a partially closed state is consistent with -analysis in nAChRs (50), and may explain subconductance states in channels such as GlyR (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see similarities to other pLGIC gating movements, with ECD change, -sandwich switching, and pore collapse conserved, yet warranting separate string method investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
pLGICs are primary targets for general anesthetics (56), as well as for drugs that treat acquired or inherited mutations responsible for diseases such as epilepsy (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study improve our knowledge of pLGIC function, revealing details of the molecular events during gating intimately involved with anesthetic and drug-binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The string method, with transition analysis, has been proven to capture receptor modulation by protons, in addition to stable O, C, and intermediate states that may be tested with experimental trapping or emerging time-resolved structural methods (58), providing potential new targets for therapeutic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GLIC protein in the O and C states [PDB ID codes 4HFI (16) and 4NPQ (4), respectively] were embedded in bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with explicit TIP3P water and 150 mM NaCl, totalling 150,235 atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems were built and preequilibrated with CHARMM (59), and simulated using NAMD (60) with the CHARMM36 force field (6164).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional unbiased/free-trajectory simulations using GROMACS 4.6.6 (13) with the CHARMM36 force field are also described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionization states for pH 4.6 (activated) and pH 7 (closed/resting) were based on pKa estimates, mutagenesis, and crystallographic data (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low pH, the sites of protonation were E26, E35, E67, E69, E75, E82, E177, E243, and H277, as indicated in Fig 1A, whereas standard states were used at pH 7, with the exception of H127, which was protonated at both pH values (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first ran rmsd-based targeted MD to generate guess paths between the O and C states at each pH (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent strings were initiated by exchanging structures between pH values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then carried out a string method approach, based on the swarms of trajectories method (2325), requiring definition of a lower dimensional space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the following variables for each of the five subunits (35 in total; definitions are provided in SI Appendix): ECD twist, ECD upper and lower spread (two variables; however, for analysis, we analyze one upper ECD radius; SI Appendix), lower -sandwich expansion (-expansion, distance between -sheets in the vicinity of D32 and R192), M2-M1() distance, upper M2 spread (reported as M2 radius), and M1 kink at conserved P204 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variables have been normalized to ensure equal weight in the optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other interesting coordinates, such as ECDTMD separation, subunit, and helical tilting, were well correlated with these variables (select correlations are illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig S2, based on initial optimizations described in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty image structures (plus two fixed end points) were sampled uniformly along the targeted MD trajectory for each pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refined these structures using a swarm of 20 short (10-ps) simulations launched from each image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were updated based on mean drift in each swarm, redistributing between end states and relaxing with 20-ps constrained simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 400 iterations were completed for each string.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that the degree and order of changes could be influenced by the initial trajectory in the event of a lack of convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S17 demonstrates convergence within 300 iterations (last 100 analyzed), with similar changes in all four independent strings (SI Appendix, Fig S3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We constructed free-energy maps in spaces defined by a selection of variables, X, using unbiased swarm trajectories after convergence via a transition analysis similar to Markov state modeling (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65) not previously applied to string method solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the probability that the system occupies point k in this space, k(X), we computed the dimensionless transition probability Pkl, from a transition count matrix, normalized by source to remove bias from image locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought a stationary solution for k(t) by iterating the discretized master equation:k(t+t)=k(t)+lk[l(t)Plkk(t)Pkl],  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
from which we computed the potential of mean force, Wk = kBT ln(k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wk corresponds to an equilibrium free-energy projection, where remaining coordinates are sampled within the broad basin around the string.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maps were calculated from analysis of different subunit variables (whole-pentamer results are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S18), revealing interdependencies related to channel gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other free-energy profiles were obtained by mean force or constraint force integration, solving the PoissonBoltzmann equation to estimate electrolyte screening, with full details provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
