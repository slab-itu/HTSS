Divergent and parallel routes of biochemical adaptation in high-altitude passerine birds from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mountain ranges and highland plateaus in different parts of the world provide an opportunity to investigate the extent to which native species have followed similar or different routes of adaptation to the challenges of life at high altitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that high-altitude songbirds from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau independently evolved derived increases in hemoglobinO2 affinity in comparison with their closest lowland relatives in East Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparisons that also included more distantly related high-altitude avian taxa, site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed two cases in which convergent increases in hemoglobinO2 affinity were caused by identical amino acid substitutions at the same sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most adaptive convergence in protein function was attributable to different amino acid substitutions in different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When different species experience similar selection pressures, the probability of evolving similar adaptive solutions may be influenced by legacies of evolutionary history, such as lineage-specific changes in genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we test for adaptive convergence in hemoglobin (Hb) function among high-altitude passerine birds that are native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and we examine whether convergent increases in HbO2 affinity have a similar molecular basis in different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We documented that high-altitude parid and aegithalid species from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have evolved derived increases in HbO2 affinity in comparison with their closest lowland relatives in East Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, convergent increases in HbO2 affinity and convergence in underlying functional mechanisms were seldom attributable to the same amino acid substitutions in different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ancestral protein resurrection and site-directed mutagenesis, we experimentally confirmed two cases in which parallel substitutions contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in codistributed high-altitude species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one case involving the ground tit (Parus humilis) and gray-crested tit (Lophophanes dichrous), parallel amino acid replacements with affinity-enhancing effects were attributable to nonsynonymous substitutions at a CpG dinucleotide, suggesting a possible role for mutation bias in promoting recurrent changes at the same site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, most altitude-related changes in Hb function were caused by divergent amino acid substitutions, and a select few were caused by parallel substitutions that produced similar phenotypic effects on the divergent genetic backgrounds of different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted a survey of sequence variation in the adult-expressed - and -type globin genes in a set of 162 bird specimens representing 13 tit species in the family Paridae (n = 135 specimens) and 4 long-tailed tit species in Aegithalidae (n = 27 specimens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected these specimens from localities spanning a broad range of elevations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the mountains of Southwest China, and in eastern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic relationships and elevational ranges of focal species are summarized in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a subset of six tit species, we experimentally examined functional properties of native Hbs purified from red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of species used in these experiments included extreme high alpine specialists such as the ground tit (Parus humilis, elevational range = 3,1005,500 m above sea level), which is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (6, 7), as well as predominantly highland species such as the rufous-vented tit (Periparus rubidiventris, 2,4004,300 m) and gray-crested tit (Lophophanes dichrous, 2,3004,600 m), and predominantly lowland species such as the oriental tit (Parus minor, sea level2,000 m) and the marsh tit (Poecile palustris, sea level2,100 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sampled multiple specimens from high- and low-altitude subspecies of the broadly distributed coal tit [Periparus ater aemodius (2,1004,600 m) and Periparus ater pekinensis (sea level1,800 m)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to analyzing the native Hbs of these seven taxa (six distinct species, including geographically distinct subspecies of Periparus ater), we also functionally tested recombinantly expressed Hbs (rHbs) from an additional pair of high- and low-altitude sister species in the family Aegithalidae: the black-browed bushtit (Aegithalos bonvaloti) and the sooty bushtit (Aegithalos fulginosus), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed experiments on rHbs for these two species because we did not have adequate quantities of blood from wild-caught birds to purify native Hbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hb_Isoform_Composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During adulthood, most bird species express two structurally distinct Hb isoforms that incorporate different -chain subunits but share identical -chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major HbA isoform (A2A2) incorporates products of the A-globin gene, and the minor HbD isoform (D2A2) incorporates products of the D-globin gene (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis to characterize Hb isoform composition in the red blood cells of each of the focal species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses revealed that the minor HbD isoform accounted for 2030% of total Hb (Table S1), consistent with data from the majority of other passerine taxa examined to date (15, 17, 1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oxygenation_Properties_of_HbA_and_HbD_Isoforms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We purified HbA and HbD isoforms from red cell lysates of select specimens with known A-, D-, and A-globin genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then measured the oxygenation properties of purified HbA and HbD solutions in the presence and absence of two main allosteric cofactors that regulate HbO2 affinity: Cl ions (added as 0.1 M KCl) and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP, a chemical analog of inositol pentaphosphate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental measurements on purified Hb samples from all species revealed that the HbD isoform exhibited a uniformly higher O2 affinity than HbA, both in the absence (stripped) and presence of allosteric cofactors (Fig 1 AC and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indicated by the lower values of P50 (the PO2 at which heme is 50% saturated) for HbD relative to HbA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consistent isoform differentiation in HbO2 affinity suggests that the up-regulation of HbD could provide a ready means of optimizing blood oxygenation properties in response to changes in O2 availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absence of altitude-related differences in the HbA/HbD ratio among species (Table S1) indicates that regulatory adjustments in red cell Hb isoform composition do not play an important role in hypoxia adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both HbA and HbD exhibited cooperative O2 binding, as indicated by Hill coefficients at half-saturation (n50)  greater than 2 in the presence of anions (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolved_Changes_in_HbO2_Affinity_and_Its_Structural_Basis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental results for the nine focal taxa revealed that highland species generally have higher HbO2 affinities in comparison with their close lowland relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the genus Parus, the high-altitude Parus humilis and the low-altitude Parus minor provide the basis for an especially informative comparison because the two closely related species have completely nonoverlapping elevational ranges (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments revealed that the HbA and HbD isoforms of Parus humilis exhibited significantly higher O2 affinities than the corresponding isoforms of Parus minor, both in the absence and presence of allosteric cofactors (Fig 1A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of Cl and IHP, P50 values for HbA and HbD of Parus humilis were lower than those of Parus minor by factors of 2.0-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in HbAO2 affinity is attributable to the independent or combined effects of 17 substitutions: 12 in A and 5 in A (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitatively similar species difference in HbDO2 affinity (Fig 1A) is associated with eight substitutions: three in D in addition to the above-mentioned A substitutions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the Poecile/Lophophanes clade, the high-altitude Lophophanes dichrous and the low-altitude Poecile palustris also have nonoverlapping elevational ranges (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments revealed that HbA and HbD of Lophophanes dichrous have significantly higher O2 affinities than the corresponding isoforms of the low-altitude Poecile palustris (Fig 1B and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species differences in HbAO2 affinity are attributable to the independent or combined effects of five substitutions (three in A, two in A) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar difference in HbDO2 affinity is associated with five substitutions (three in D in addition to the above-mentioned A substitutions) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the A substitutions, it is notable that Lophophanes dichrous shares the same AA34T substitution as Parus humilis (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This site is located at an intradimer 11/22 contact surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations at such sites are known to affect HbO2 affinity and quaternary structural stability (2226).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homology modeling analysis suggests that the replacement of Ala with Thr at A34 introduces four new hydrogen bonds between opposing - and -chain subunits of the oxygenated R conformation; the same intersubunit 11/22 interface is not altered appreciably in the deoxygenated T conformation (Fig 3 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allosteric equilibrium between the oxygenated (R) and deoxygenated (T) conformations of the Hb tetramer is a primary determinant of HbO2 affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential stabilization of oxygenated Hb therefore increases O2 affinity by shifting the TR allosteric equilibrium in favor of the high-affinity R state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the genus Periparus, experiments revealed no appreciable differentiation in overall HbO2 affinity between the high- and low-altitude subspecies of Periparus ater, as HbAO2 affinity was slightly higher in the lowland Periparus ater pekinensis, and HbDO2 affinity was higher in the highland Periparus ater aemodius (Fig 1C and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HbAO2 affinity of the high-altitude Periparus rubidiventris was virtually identical to that of Periparus ater pekinensis and therefore was slightly higher than that of Periparus ater aemodius; HbDO2 affinity of Periparus rubidiventris was significantly higher than that of both Periparus ater subspecies (Fig 1C and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to each of the other species-level comparisons, experiments on recombinantly expressed HbA isoforms from the high- and low-altitude pair of Aegithalos sister species revealed that the high-altitude Aegithalos bonvaloti had a significantly higher HbO2 affinity relative to the low-altitude Aegithalos fulginosus in the presence of Cl and IHP (Fig 1D and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 7 torr difference in HbO2 affinity is attributable to a single AP119A substitution in Aegithalos bonvaloti (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same substitution is responsible for an evolved increase in HbO2 affinity in the bar-headed goose, Anser indicus (2729), a high-altitude species renowned for its trans-Himalayan migratory flights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP119A substitution eliminates a van der Waals contact between the ancestral Pro A119 and Met A55 on opposing subunits of the same  dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of this intradimer contact destabilizes deoxygenated Hb and shifts the allosteric TR equilibrium in favor of the high-affinity R state, thereby increasing overall O2 affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the parallel AP119A substitutions in Aegithalos bonvaloti and Anser indicus and the parallel AA34T substitutions in Lophophanes dichrous and Parus humilis are both predicted to increase HbO2 affinity by shifting the allosteric equilibrium but via opposite mechanisms: destabilization of the T state in the former case and stabilization of the R state in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the comparison between high- and low-altitude subspecies of Periparus ater revealed no differentiation in overall HbO2 affinity, all species-level comparisons between close relatives were consistent in that the highland species always had higher HbO2 affinities than the lowland species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, the evolved changes were exclusively attributable to an increase in intrinsic O2 affinity (as revealed by P50 values for stripped Hbs), as there were no appreciable differences in sensitivity to allosteric cofactors (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, altitude-related changes in HbO2 affinity could be attributable to derived increases in HbO2 affinity in high-altitude species, derived reductions in low-altitude species, or a combination of both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alternatives can be distinguished by deciphering the character polarity of causative amino acid substitutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a given high-altitude species has evolved a derived increase in HbO2 affinity relative to its low-altitude sister species, then the evolved change in protein function must be attributable to one or more substitutions where the derived amino acid state is fixed in the high-altitude species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described below, we estimated globin gene trees to identify the phylogenetic intervals in which potentially causative amino acid substitutions occurred in the history of each high-altitude lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genealogical_Discordance_of_Globin_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To infer the polarity of character state change at substituted sites in HbA and HbD, we estimated DNA-based phylogenies of the A-, D-, and A-globin genes from all 17 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimated phylogenies revealed high levels of genealogical discordance among loci (Fig S2), likely reflecting a history of incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgressive hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Convergence_and_Parallelism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is critically important to account for genealogical discordance when testing for evidence of molecular parallelism and convergence (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If amino acid substitutions in the A- and D-globin genes were mapped onto the branches of the species tree (Fig S1) rather than the appropriate gene trees (Fig S2 A and B), it would create the false appearance that multiple substitutions had occurred independently in different lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimates of gene tree topologies for the A-, D-, and A-globin genes permit an assessment of the true prevalence of molecular convergence and parallelism in our set of focal taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some degree of homoplasy (due to convergence, parallelism, or mutational reversion) is expected due to chance alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key question concerns the number of convergent or parallel substitutions that actually contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in different high-altitude taxa; this applies to substitutions in HbA and HbD of both Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous, HbD of Periparus rubidiventris, and HbA of Aegithalos bonvaloti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence data revealed that few derived amino acid states are shared between high-altitude taxa to the exclusion of lowland taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the set of high-altitude parid and aegithalid taxa that we examined, it appears that there is only one true parallel substitution that is associated with convergent increases in HbO2 affinity: A34T in the A-globin orthologs of Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Test_of_Adaptive_Parallelism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The A-globin gene tree shown in Fig S2A indicates that the shared, derived Thr A34 variants in Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous must have had independent mutational origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the parallel AA34T substitutions contributed to derived increases in HbO2 affinity in each of these two high-altitude species, we reconstructed the A and A sequences of the most recent common ancestor of the family Paridae, AncParidae, which is also the most recent common ancestor of Parus and Lophophanes (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to test the effect of the AA34T mutation on an evolutionarily relevant genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ancestral amino acid states were estimated with a high level of statistical confidence, as site-specific posterior probabilities averaged 0.997 for the -chain and 1.000 for the -chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed ancestral Hb was estimated to possess Ala A34 with a posterior probability of 0.988.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the AncParidae Hb differed from the wild-type Hbs of Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous at 12 and 6 amino acid sites, respectively (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro functional tests on the purified rHbs confirmed that AncParidae Hb exhibited a significantly lower HbO2 affinity than the wild-type Hbs of both Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous, indicating that each of the two high-altitude species independently evolved derived increases in HbO2 affinity due to the effects of one or more lineage-specific substitutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that AA34T produced a significant increase in intrinsic HbO2 affinity on the AncParidae background, and this affinity difference persisted in the presence of Cl and IHP (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the parallel AA34T substitutions in Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in each of the two high-altitude species, but the effect of AA34T alone was not sufficient to completely recapitulate the evolved change in O2 affinity in either species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, additional amino acid substitutions in the - and/or -globins of both Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous must have contributed to the derived increases in HbO2 affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although AA34T produced a significant increase in O2 affinity on the AncParidae background, reversion of this mutation to the ancestral state (AT34A) did not produce significant reductions in HbO2 affinity on the wild-type backgrounds of either Parus humilis or Lophophanes dichrous (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymmetry in the effects of forward mutations on ancestral backgrounds and reverse mutations on derived backgrounds, a phenomenon documented in numerous protein-engineering studies, is attributable to epistatic interactions between the focal mutations and residues at other substituted sites that distinguish the two backgrounds (3136).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Possible_Role_of_Mutation_Bias_in_Promoting_Parallel_Substitutions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, the parallel AA34T substitutions in both Lophophanes dichrous and Parus humilis are attributable to nonsynonymous substitutions at a CpG dinucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both species, replacement of the ancestral Ala for Thr at A34 was caused by CpGCpA mutations in the first codon position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the methylation status of the cytosine, transition mutations at CpG sites are expected to occur at a much higher rate than non-CpG point mutations at the same nucleotide position (3740).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the hypothesis that the AA34T mutation may be especially likely to contribute to evolved increases in HbO2 affinity simply because the underlying CpGCpA transition mutation will occur at a higher rate than nonsynonymous mutations at non-CpG sites that produce similar affinity-enhancing effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If adaptation is mutation-limited, an increase in the rate of mutation to a beneficial allele results in a commensurate increase in the alleles probability of fixation (4144).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which evolution is mutation-limited in natural populations is not generally known, but a growing body of evidence suggests that mutation bias is an important cause of substitution bias and parallelism in adaptive protein evolution (15, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An examination of A-globin nucleotide sequences in a phylogenetically diverse set of passerines revealed that the CpG dinucleotide involving the third position of codon 33 and the first position of codon 34 is clearly the ancestral state (and, hence, Ala is the ancestral amino acid at A34) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if the parallel AA34T substitutions in Lophophanes dichrous and Parus humilis were partly attributable to mutation bias, it is a bias that is not unique to parid species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of mutational accessibility alone, there is no reason to think that AA34T substitutions were more likely to contribute to Hb adaptation in parid species than in other passerines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Broader_Patterns_of_Convergence_and_Parallelism_Involving_High-Altitude_Birds_from_the_Andes_and_the_Qinghai-Tibet_Plateau  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An expansion of the comparative analysis to include other high-altitude birds revealed several convergent and parallel substitutions shared with parid and aegithalid species from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of such substitutions is reduced significantly if we restrict our attention to shared, derived replacements that are associated with increases in HbO2 affinity in high-altitude lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Andean birds, convergent and parallel substitutions were not uncommon, but site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that a small fraction of such substitutions (i.e., N/G83S, A86S, D94E, and A116S in A-globin) actually contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in two or more high-altitude species (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These same sites were all invariant in our sample of parid and aegithalid species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We documented that high-altitude parid and aegithalid species from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have typically evolved increased HbO2 affinities in comparison with lowland relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is consistent with data from a large and phylogenetically diverse set of Andean birds (1417).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data for parid and aegithalid birds further bolster a remarkably strong empirical generalization and demonstrate that repeated increases in HbO2 affinity in high-altitude birds represent one of the most striking examples of convergent biochemical adaptation in vertebrates (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phylogenetically replicated changes in HbO2 affinity provide the opportunity to assess whether such changes consistently involve the same functional mechanisms and, if so, whether such changes are attributable to divergent, convergent, or parallel substitutions at the amino acid level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to functional mechanisms, the fact that interspecific variation in HbO2 affinity is exclusively attributable to evolved changes in intrinsic O2 affinity is consistent with comparative data from other high-altitude birds (1417, 21, 29) and demonstrates that there are multiple possible ways of evolving an increased HbO2 affinity without sacrificing allosteric regulatory capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, by contrast, evolutionary changes in HbO2 affinity often involve changes in responsiveness to Cl and/or organic phosphates (4752).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the pervasive convergence in HbO2 affinity (and convergence in the underlying functional mechanisms) among high-altitude avian taxa, the limited amount of convergence and parallelism at the amino acid level demonstrates that changes in HbO2 affinity can be produced by numerous possible amino acid substitutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of sequence variation in our set of parid and aegithalid species revealed several parallel amino acid substitutions, only one of which contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in different high-altitude tit species: AA34T in Parus humilis and Lophophanes dichrous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most parallel substitutions were not uniquely associated with convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in highland lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studies of genetic convergence and parallelism, experimental testing of individual substitutions is necessary to distinguish between signal (replicated substitutions that contribute to adaptive convergence in phenotype) and noise (replicated substitutions that have no effect on the selected phenotype).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In broader comparisons involving other avian taxa, we documented one additional example in which parallel substitutions contributed to convergent increases in HbO2 affinity in different high-altitude species: the AP119A substitution in Aegithalos bonvaloti (Aegithalidae: Passeriformes) and the distantly related bar-headed goose, Anser indicus (Anatidae: Anseriformes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirm that the parallel AP119A substitutions have significant affinity-enhancing effects in the Hbs of both species (Fig 1D and Table S2) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP119A mutation also produces a similar affinity-enhancing effect in human Hb (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All else being equal with respect to effect sizes and mutational pleiotropy, allelic variants that have additive effects across a wide range of genetic backgrounds can be expected to make more consistent contributions to convergent adaptation than those with context-dependent effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we did not observe any striking clade-specific patterns of parallelism that could be interpreted as evidence that the high-altitude parid or aegithalid species had hit upon adaptive solutions that were not equally accessible to other high-altitude avian taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
