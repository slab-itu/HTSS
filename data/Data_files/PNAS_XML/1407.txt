title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the origin of the elusive first intermediate of CO2 electroreduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The understanding of a catalytic reaction starts with understanding its first elementary step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, despite the large number of studies, it is unclear whether one common or two different first intermediates control the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to formate and CO. We settle this controversy for Cu, which is best known for its unique capacity to synthesize C1+ products but is just emerging as a superior earth-abundant catalyst for CO and formate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide solid experimental and theoretical support of the one common first-intermediate (Horis) model, the first intermediate being carboxylate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome is an essential milestone toward accurate specification of the reaction descriptors in the growing effort to accelerate the discovery of a viable CO2 electroreduction catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We resolve the long-standing controversy about the first step of the CO2 electroreduction to fuels in aqueous electrolytes by providing direct spectroscopic evidence that the first intermediate of the CO2 conversion to formate on copper is a carboxylate anion *CO2 coordinated to the surface through one of its CO bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify this intermediate and gain insight into its formation, its chemical and electronic properties, as well as its dependence on the electrode potential by taking advantage of a cutting-edge methodology that includes operando surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) empowered by isotope exchange and electrochemical Stark effects, reaction kinetics (Tafel) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SERS spectra are measured on an operating Cu surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results advance the mechanistic understanding of CO2 electroreduction and its selectivity to carbon monoxide and formate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible first intermediates of CO2 electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A roughened Cu electrode was prepared from a 0.5-mm-thick copper foil (99.9985% metals basis) by one oxidationreduction cycle as reported in SI Appendix, section S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface morphology was assessed using SEM (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roughness factor of 17 ± 3 of the surface was estimated using the dependence of the electric double-layer capacitance on the scan rate in cyclic voltammograms (CVs) (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface crystallographic composition, as inferred from the hydroxyl adsorption peaks in CVs, is dominated by the (100), (110), and (111) planes (SI Appendix, Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrocatalytic activity of the Cu surface was characterized using CVs (SI Appendix, Fig S7B) and preparative electrolysis (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrolysis products were measured using NMR and gas chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SERS spectra were acquired in a laboratory-made one-compartment three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell using a LABRAM-ARAMIS confocal Raman microscope with a HeNe (633-nm) laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations were performed using a plane wave DFT code (The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, VASP-5.3.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the experimental and theoretical methods are provided in SI Appendix, section S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catalytic_Activity_of_the_Roughened_Cu_Surface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All potentials are reported in the Ag/AgCl reference scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 reduction activity of the Cu surface was characterized using preparative electrolysis in CO2-saturated 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 6.8) at potentials from 1.05 to 1.27 V, where we detected synthesis of formate (43),CO2+2e+H+=HCOO,E0=0.63V(Ag/AgCl),[8]at a Faradaic efficiency from 1 to 1.7% (SI Appendix, Fig S8A), although traces of formate were found at 0.95 V. At the same time, only H2 (no CO) was detected in the gas phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tafel slope of reaction [8] is 130 ± 10 mV/decade (SI Appendix, Fig S8B), which suggests that its rate-determining step (RDS) is step [1] (SI Appendix in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), as in the case of the CO synthesis (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CVs show that the electrocatalytic current, which is dominated by HER, starts at approximately 0.8 V (SI Appendix, Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We deliberately selected this particular Cu surface and electrolyte for our study because more catalytically active surfaces and conditions coproduce more coadsorbed CO and other species, which complicate interpretation of the spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the pathway of CO2 to formate on Cu is much more uncertain than to CO (Introduction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Operando_SERS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate reproducibility, we measure the dependence of SERS spectra on potential four times, each time on a freshly prepared Cu surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure the spectra on an actual catalyst and report their replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the spectra measured in CO2-saturated 0.1 M NaHCO3 (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11, S13, and S15) with the reference spectra measured in Ar-saturated 0.1 M NaClO4 (SI Appendix, Fig S9) reveals that the CO2-saturated conditions give birth to a multifold of new peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we assign the main peaks to *CO, *CO32, and *CO2, specify structures of these species, and show that the effect of potential on *CO2 agrees with the status of this species as the first intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DFT_Model_of_CO2_Activation_on_Cu(111)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the SERS results and assist in their interpretation, we model the CO2 activation on Cu(111) using a plane wave DFT method (see SI Appendix for detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with prior theoretical (21, 69, 75) and experimental (46, 76) works, we find that clean Cu(111) does not activate CO2 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the relatively high work function of Cu and the low position of its d-band with respect to the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the next computational experiment, we place a relaxed Na+ cation hydrated by eight water molecules on the top of the linear CO2 molecule relaxed over Cu(111) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system is dubbed as (CO2+Na+8H2O)/Cu(111) hereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, CO2 is activated (Fig 5B), adopting the 2(C,O)-CO2 geometry, in unison with the SERS results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 activation makes both the CO bonds longer than in linear CO2, the effect being much more pronounced for the surface coordinated CO bond, while the OCO angle decreases to 119°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This species has a relatively large binding energy of 2.16 eV, which indicates that in the presence of the cation CO2 interacts with the Cu surface strongly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The promoting effect of alkali metals on the CO2 activation on metal surfaces has earlier been attributed to a decrease in the metal work function (46, 7578) and electric polarization of adsorbed carboxylate by the cation (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predicted vibrational frequencies of 2(C,O)-CO2 are in good agreement with the experimental values (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the theoretical asCO2 and CuC frequencies of 1,503 and 356 cm1 are close to the experimental values of 1,5151,525 and 345 cm1 in the electrocatalytic region, respectively (Fig 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12 C and D, S14 C and D, and S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only exception is the sCO2 vibration, which is predicted to be at 970 cm1 vs. 1,330 cm1 observed experimentally at anodic potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy can tentatively be attributed to limitations of DFT in general and our DFT methodology in particular in modeling stretching vibrations of a molecular bond that is strongly coordinated parallel to the surface (see SI Appendix for more detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2(C,O)-CO2 configuration is most popular in molecular complexes of CO2 (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also has earlier been predicted for CO2 activated on low-index Cu surfaces either by a bias force or alkali metal placed directly on the surface, on-side of CO2 (24, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our result is that 2(C,O)-CO2 forms an ionic pair with a hydrated alkali metal cation located above the adsorbed anion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the electrolyte cations coadsorbed on side, a cation coordinated on top is likely to constitute the local environment of the anion adsorbed at a negatively charged electrode surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the cation is important for a better understanding of the CO2 activation process, especially the promoting effects of cations and the role of hydrating water molecules (H-bonding) (7982).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Bader charge analysis (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Table S1) shows that activated CO2 gains a net charge of 1.12|e|, that is, close to one electron, while the C atom gains 1.65|e|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference is explained by the depletion of the negative charge on the O atoms, especially the O atom coordinated to the surface (it loses 0.38|e|).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is caused by donation of  electrons of CO2 to the surface (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, the Cu atoms in the CuC and CuO bonds acquire positive charges of +0.11|e| and +0.15|e|, respectively, which additionally stabilize the adsorbed anion electrostatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To interpret the Bader charges, we compare 2(C,O)-CO2 with free CO2 anion radical, which is simulated as a CO2+Na pair (without surface).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to 2(C,O)-CO2, all of the atoms in CO2gain negative charge (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that the O atoms in 2(C,O)-CO2 are less basic than in CO2, which makes them less susceptible to the electrophilic attack including protonation to *COOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, reaction [2] is very unlikely on Cu at neutral pH, given that COOH (protonated CO2) is rather acidic [its experimental pKa values are as low as 1.43.4 (83, 84)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result can explain the absence of carboxyls *COOH on the Cu surface in a SERS-detectable amount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower basicity of 2(C,O)-CO2 can also imply that, instead of previously proposed reaction [3], CO is produced on Cu through the direct dissociation of the carboxylate:*CO2=*CO+*O,[9]as observed in gas phase (46, 48) and proposed for CO2 electroreduction by Ikeda et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is that pathway [9] dynamically supplies adsorbed oxygen, which is known to promote both the CO2 activation and reduction (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, activation of CO2 on transition metals is described as an acidbase process where the molecule accepts electron density on its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and simultaneously donates electron from its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to an empty d orbital of the coordinating metal (16, 17, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The particular the d states involved depend on the metal and structure of the coordinating site(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frontier orbitals of bent CO2, which are represented by the corresponding molecular orbitals of CO2, are shown in Fig 6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LUMO presents the antibonding 6a1 (in-plane) orbital, which descends from the degenerate anti-bonding 2u* LUMO of linear CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is heavily centered on the carbon atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our density of states calculations, it presents a mix of 33% C 2p and 9% C 2s with 26% O 2p and 2% O 2s from each O atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HOMO is a nonbonding in-plane 4b2 orbital, which descends from the degenerate nonbonding O lone pair 1g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This orbital is 100% centered on the O atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even though 2(C,O)-CO2 has been predicted for CO2 activation on several metals (21, 22, 24, 75, 78, 86, 87), its electronic structure has not been studied in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we calculate spatial redistribution of the electronic charge density, , using two formulas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first one, we subtract the charge density of hydrated Na, Na+8H2O, CO2, and Cu(111) from that of the full system, Cu+CO2+(Na+8H2O):=Cu+CO2+(Na+8H2O)CO2CuNa+8H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10]This  visualizes the charge redistribution upon the formation of (CO2+Na+8H2O)/Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second formula, we subtract the charge density of hydrated Na, Na+8H2O, and the CO2/Cu(111) system, CO2+Cu, from that of the full system, Cu+CO2+(Na+8H2O):=Cu+CO2+(Na+8H2O)CO2+CuNa+8H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11]The resulting plot visualizes the charge rearrangement in the CO2/Cu(111) system upon its interaction with the hydrated Na (upon accepting its electron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a difference between  plots [10] and [11] can shed light onto the effect of negative potential on 2(C,O)-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate interpretation of the  plots, we also calculate  induced by Na in the CO2+Na pair (the CO2 surrogate) as follows:=CO2+NaCO2Na.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12]Fig 6B shows that the charge redistribution upon the CO2 formation corresponds to filling of the LUMO of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically,  features depletion of the  electron density between C and O atoms, consistent with the antibonding character of the 6a1 orbital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density loss indicates that the CO bonds become more ionic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, the electron density around the C atom is strongly polarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C atom loses electron density from its sides coordinated to the O atoms while accumulating it on the lobe, which creates a local dipole moment on the C atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The  plot of 2(C,O)-CO2 on Cu(111), which is calculated using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 (Fig 6C), reproduces within the CO2 moiety the main features associated with the CO2 formation (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the plot shows hybridization of the 6a1 orbital with the Cu dz2 and d (dxz and dyz) states, which reflects the formation of the covalent CuC and CuO bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bond covalency (electron pairing) follows from the accumulation of electron density around the bond centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more diffuse volume of the accumulated electron density within the CuC bond is consistent with the shorter length of this bond compared to the CuO bond (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the electron density in the CuC bond is closer to the C atom (Fig 6C), the CuC bond dipole is parallel to the negative electric field, which can explain the positive sign of the Stark tuning rate of the CuC peak of 2(C,O)-CO2 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The plot in Fig 6C also demonstrates that the d electron density on the coordinating Cu atoms is redistributed: Their dz2 electron density is depleted due to the back-donation to the LUMO, while d states acquire electron density from the HOMO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar charge redistribution has been obtained for 1(C)-CO2 and 2(C,O)-CO2 on Pt(110) (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the ionic pairing with alkali cation and the electrostatic stabilization by the positively charged Cu atoms, the covalency of the CuC and CuO bonds can explain the 2(C,O)-CO2 formation in the broad range of potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with  calculated using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 (Fig 6C),  calculated using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 (Fig 6D) shows a more massive electron depletion from the CO bonds, suggesting their stronger activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result agrees with the red shift of the asCO2 peak with a cathodic bias of electrode potential (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy is the electron distribution within the carboxylate-surface bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though electron density is accumulated between the Cu and C atoms of 2(C,O)-CO2, the negative charge lobe on the C atom is contracted toward the C atom, while the coordinating Cu atom loses d electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, the dz2 density on this Cu atom is polarized away from the CuC bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This charge redistribution indicates repulsive interactions, which make the CuC bond more ionic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar conclusion has been derived for CO2/Pt(110) based on the direct effect of the electric field (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased ionic character of the CuC bond of 2(C,O)-CO2 at a more negatively charged surface suggests that this bond is activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect can make feasible a nucleophilic attack at the C atom by hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, the Cu atom of the CuO bond accumulates dz2 electron density symmetrically, with the lobe expanding toward the O atom (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the CuO bond can be stabilized by a negative potential, which can drive the dissociation of 2(C,O)-CO2 [9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the CuC bond can be concomitantly destabilized, this feature makes the metaloxygen bond essential for the stabilization and function of 2(C,O)-CO2 as the first intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our SERS and DFT results on CO2 activation are summarized in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By applying a comprehensive suite of experimental and theoretical methods, we establish that the CO2 conversion to formate on Cu starts with the formation of a carboxylate intermediate with the 2(C,O)-CO2 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result can be generalized toward at least coinage metals (Cu, Au, and Ag), given their similarity in terms of the reaction kinetics and the electronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the formation of *COOH is unlikely on Cu at circumneutral and basic pH, which implies that 2(C,O)-CO2 is converted to CO through direct dissociation [9] as in gas phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
2(C,O)-CO2 is stabilized on a Cu surface due to the strong covalency of its two bonds with the surface, charge polarization in the system, as well as by the electrostatic interactions with a hydrated Na cation in the on-top position and the positively charged coordinating Cu atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed formation of 2(C,O)-CO2 at potentials much more anodic of the onset of the CO2 electroreduction suggests the critical role of additional cooperative effects such as surface defects, residual surface oxide, and coadsorbed electron donors, which are yet to be understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A negative potential activates the CuC and CO bonds of 2(C,O)-CO2 en route to HCOO (Fig 7), which is explained by the electrostatic and chemical effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the CuO bond can be stabilized, underscoring its important role in the selectivity of 2(C,O)-CO2 to CO and HCOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results indicate that the descriptors of the CO2 conversion to HCOO and CO are the chemical and structural properties of 2(C,O)-CO2, raising intriguing questions about the exact relationship of these properties to the selectivity, activity, and energy efficiency of the catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
