Targeted delivery of liquid microvolumes into the lung  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Systemic drug administrations suffer from inefficient delivery to a specific pathologic region of the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aerosolized drugs, when prepared to display desired transport behavior, can be delivered to selected lung regions by inhalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe an alternative method for delivering drugs directly to a specific lung region in the form of liquid microvolumes based on a mathematical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition of liquid film on lung epithelium in different target regions of the lung was confirmed in rat lungs using fluorescence imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that instilling microvolumes of liquid would enable predictable drug concentrations at the target site, reduce the amount of the drug required for treatment, and minimize systemic side effects for several lung diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to deliver drugs to specific sites in the lung could radically improve therapeutic outcomes of a variety of lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, severe bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using conventional methods for pulmonary drug administration, precise, localized delivery of exact doses of drugs to target regions remains challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a more controlled delivery of soluble reagents (e.g., drugs, enzymes, and radionuclides) in microvolume liquid plugs to targeted branches of the pulmonary airway tree: upper airways, small airways (bronchioles), or the most distal alveoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this approach, a soluble liquid plug of very small volume (less_than1 mL) is instilled into the upper airways, and with programmed air ventilation of the lungs, the plug is pushed into a specific desired (more distal) airway to achieve deposition of liquid film onto the lung epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plug volume and ventilation conditions were determined by mathematical modeling of plug transport in a tubular geometry, and targeted liquid film deposition was demonstrated in rat lungs by three different in vivo imaging modalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental and modeling data suggest that instillation of microvolumes of liquid into a ventilated pulmonary airway could be an effective strategy to deliver exact doses of drugs to targeted pathologic regions of the lung, especially those inaccessible by bronchoscopy, to increase in situ efficacy of the drug and minimize systemic side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For liquid plug instillation and pressure-induced advancement, the initial plug volume and ventilation airflow rate determine how deep into the lung a liquid plug will travel (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid film can be deposited on the specific airway surfaces according to the following series of steps: (i) A liquid plug introduced into an airway (rat trachea in this study; clinically, a bronchus of the human lung via catheter) is moved deeper into the lung by positive air pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the plug travels through the airway, it deposits a thin film on the airway surface and splits into smaller plugs at bifurcations in downstream airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) During inspiration, the instilled plug progresses, splitting into increasingly smaller plugs at bifurcations while leaving a thin liquid layer along the airway surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The plugs rupture before the end of the first inspiration, resulting in the generation of a liquid film in the target airway, which can be specified by selecting the plug volume and airflow rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) To deposit liquid into the deeper lung, liquid plugs are instilled such that they rupture in smaller airways, where airway diameters change significantly during ventilation, allowing plug reformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With repeated plug transport, rupture, and reformation, film deposits all of the way into the alveoli (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Liquid_Plug_Transport_and_Film_Deposition_in_a_Tube  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When a liquid plug travels at a velocity U under a pressure P0 in a tube with inner radius r, a liquid film with thickness b is generated on the tube surface at a distance  from the receding plug meniscus (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a liquid plug in the surface tension-dominated regime (i.e., Ca = U/P less_thanless_than 1, where Ca, , and P denote plug capillary number, viscosity, and surface tension, respectively), b can be determined from the forces acting on the plug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance of the viscous force FVis  U/b2 and the surface tension force FST  P/, where P = P0  P1= P/r is the Laplace pressure at the plug meniscus, leads to b2/r  Ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By matching the curvatures of the static meniscus 1/r in the hemispherical cap region and the dynamic meniscus b/2 in the transition region, the length of the transition region becomes  = (br)1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the dimensionless film thickness, a ratio of the film thickness to the tube radius (27, 28), is b* = b/r  Ca2/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By instilling plugs of deionized (DI) water into a glass tube, we experimentally verified the relationship b* = 1.6Ca2/3 (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mathematical_Model_for_Aqueous_Liquid_Film_Delivery_in_the_Rat_Airways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The architectural model for the rat airway was developed based on Weibels human airway morphometry, with 23 generations of dichotomous and symmetric branches from trachea (G0) to alveoli (G23+), and the number of airways GN = 2N (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because plug rupture and reformation are determined by the decreasing airway diameters in the bronchial tree, we computed the diameters in a dimensionless form dN=dN/d0=2N/Z, where dN and d0 are the diameters of GN and G0, respectively, and Z is a constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using rat airway diameters measured at total lung capacity (TLC  12 mL) (26), we determined Z = 4.3 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our approach, a liquid plug is instilled into the trachea of a rat lung maintained at residual volume (RV  2 mL) and advanced into the airway by filling the lung with air to functional residual capacity (FRC  6 mL) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated Z = 3.3 and 3.75 for rat lungs at RV and FRC, respectively (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensionless cross-sectional area of GN is ANtotal=ANtotal/A0=2NdN2, where A0 is the cross-sectional area of the trachea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dN decreases when N increases, ANtotal increases because the number of airways increases as 2N (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensionless plug velocity is UN=UN/U0=AN/2N, where UN and U0 are the velocity of a plug in GN and G0, respectively, and decreases rapidly with GN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a liquid plug will quickly slow down as it travels into more distal airways (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Film_Deposition_in_Target_Regions_of_the_Rat_Lung  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deposition of liquid film in the rat airway was experimentally verified using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye (excitation/emission: 785 nm/830 nm) in DI water visualized by near-infrared (NIR) imaging (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following instillation of a predefined liquid volume via a catheter in the rat trachea, the fluorescent signal was measured in situ through the ventral surface of the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid film deposition on alveolar surfaces was confirmed using fluorescent microbeads (1-m diameter, excitation/emission: 580 nm/605 nm) (Fig 4A and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The menisci of ICG plugs in the left main stem bronchus were visualized by NIR imaging, confirming the contact angle   30Â° used in our plug transport model (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that aqueous liquid containing soluble drugs can be delivered into targeted branches of the lung airway and deposited onto the lung epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is based on instilling a specific microvolume of liquid into the upper airways and moving the plug by programmed air ventilation into a desired area of the lung (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance a plug travels can be modulated by the plug volume, liquid viscosity, and ventilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To precisely define the plug volume and ventilation conditions necessary to reach a specific target area in the lung, we formulated and validated a mathematical model of plug transport in a tubular geometry (Fig 2) and then in a rat airway model (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three important model predictions are that (i) the thickness of the film depends on the capillary number of the plug, b*  Ca2/3; (ii) the liquid plug traveling through a ventilated airway ruptures when its volume decreases to VM  kr3; and (iii) a ruptured plug can reform into a new plug as airways recoil during exhalation such that VR  5.6r3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the complexities of the lung fluid mechanics, the volume and capillary number of the liquid plug at the point of instillation determined in capillary tube experiments can be applied to achieve targeted delivery into the proximal rat airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the time required for film delivery into the distal rat airways was determined from the studies of the viscosity and surface tension of liquid plugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the mathematical model, we demonstrated deposition of liquid film in three different target regions (i.e., G0G5, G0G15, and G0G23+) of the rat lung by three different imaging modalities (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The collected data suggest the need to further refine our approach, which was developed using simplified rat airway geometries adapted from Weibels model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex hierarchical structures and flow patterns in the rat airways affect the distribution of liquid film (23, 26) in a way not fully accounted for by our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of airway bifurcations on plug transport have not been considered, and it was assumed that liquid plugs split evenly at the airway branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, liquid plugs would split at bifurcations depending on their shape and surface properties (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, plug rupture and reformation at airway bifurcations could be different from those in the tubular sections of the airway (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction between plugs and the airway walls during air ventilation would also need to be carefully studied to enable more accurate liquid delivery in actual lungs (21, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it would be technically challenging, the contact angles of liquid plugs and collars would need to be more precisely determined in the airways, especially within distal airways and alveoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because human lungs are considerably different from rat lungs in their surface properties [i.e., surface tension and mucus consistency (25, 26)], further studies are needed to extend the current study to the human lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve drug delivery using this approach, diffusion of a given drug through the pulmonary liquid layer and into the epithelium (43) would also need to be characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical pulmonary drug delivery could be facilitated by refining procedures for plug instillation into the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, a multilumen balloon catheter could be inserted near a target region and used to deposit drug onto the isolated airway surfaces, while the patient is supported by gas exchange in other parts of the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, novel techniques would be needed to precisely monitor film deposition in the human lungs, in particular for submicrometer thick films within complex airway structures that are below the threshold of conventional imaging (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drugs contained in the liquid film could more effectively diffuse and absorb into the epithelium, improving therapeutic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal outcomes would result from the clearance of mucus before plug instillation (e.g., by the delivery of mucolytics or lung lavage) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The clinical utility of this liquid delivery approach could extend to treating lung cancer and a range of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, high concentrations of mucoactive agents instilled with liquid plugs could help dissolve the mucus layer formed in the airways by many lung diseases, reducing complications and providing long-term benefits (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For single cancer lesions, microvolume plugs containing high concentrations of chemotherapeutics can be delivered directly to the site of the tumor as a (neo)adjuvant therapy, especially for poorly vascularized tumors that are less accessible to systemically administered drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, micrometastases in different and distal regions of the lung could also be treated by precise instillation of chemotherapeutics in conjunction with drugs given systemically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bronchiectasispermanent enlargement of an airwaycaused by a number of acquired or infective diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia, and cystic fibrosis) can result in secluded regions of airway that harbor pathogens that are extremely difficult to clear with orally or systemically administered antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such cases, liquid plug instillation could be used to deliver high concentrations of antibiotics directly to infected sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that the theoretical and experimental studies presented here demonstrate that the instillation of liquid microvolumes could provide localized delivery of drugs at precisely known volumes and concentrations into targeted regions of the lung to treat a wide range of lung diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed methods can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, liquid film deposition in a glass capillary was achieved by moving introduced DI water plugs via air pressure applied using a syringe pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depositions of liquid in the rat airways and alveoli were verified using fluorescent imaging of water film containing ICG and fluorescently labeled microbeads, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid film deposition in target airways was further demonstrated by delivering liquid plugs containing CFSE, which was confirmed using fluorescent microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rats were maintained in accordance with the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards and review.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
