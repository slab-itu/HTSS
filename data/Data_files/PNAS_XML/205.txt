Focal expression of mutant huntingtin in the songbird basal ganglia disrupts cortico-basal ganglia networks and vocal sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic mutations that impair basal ganglia (BG) function affect sequential movements, but the link between genotype, BG circuit dysfunction, and altered behavior remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that viral expression of a genetic mutation that causes Huntingtons disease (HD) in a vocalization-related region of the songbird BG leads to the selective loss of striatal medium spiny neurons, abnormal temporal patterns of cortico-BG activity during vocalization, and highly unstable vocal sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, silencing activity in the cortical component of this circuit stabilized vocalizations, supporting the idea that the genetic mutation that causes HD affects complex motor sequences by altering temporal patterns of cortico-BG activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The basal ganglia (BG) promote complex sequential movements by helping to select elementary motor gestures appropriate to a given behavioral context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Huntingtons disease (HD), which causes striatal atrophy in the BG, is characterized by hyperkinesia and chorea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How striatal cell loss alters activity in the BG and downstream motor cortical regions to cause these disorganized movements remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that expressing the genetic mutation that causes HD in a song-related region of the songbird BG destabilizes syllable sequences and increases overall vocal activity, but leave the structure of individual syllables intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behavioral changes are paralleled by the selective loss of striatal neurons and reduction of inhibitory synapses on pallidal neurons that serve as the BG output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic recordings in singing birds revealed disrupted temporal patterns of activity in pallidal neurons and downstream cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, reversible inactivation of the cortical neurons rescued the disorganized vocal sequences in transfected birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings shed light on a key role of temporal patterns of cortico-BG activity in the regulation of complex motor sequences and show how a genetic mutation alters cortico-BG networks to cause disorganized movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Expression_of_mHTT_in_the_Songbird_BG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human HD is caused by expanded (34) Gln (CAG) repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (mHTT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transfected area X neurons in adult zebra finches (139 ± 19 d posthatch, mean ± SD; n = 9 birds) with lentivirus (LV) containing a mutant form of mHTT with either 94 or 20 CAG repeats (mHTT-Q94 or HTT-Q20) and a cleavable fluorescent reporter, AsRed, under the control of the human synapsin 1 promoter (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 20 and 30 d following LV injection into area X, a time course similar to other studies that have used LV to express transgenes in songbirds (1922), a subset of neurons expressed the AsRed reporter (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments indicate that LV-mediated gene transfer can be used to express mHTT in the songbird BG region area X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selective_Disruption_of_Syllable_Sequence_Organization_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used LV-mediated gene transfer to address how expression of mHTT affects previously learned songs in adult zebra finches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult male zebra finches typically sing stable stereotyped motifs, with one or more motifs sung in quick succession to form a song bout (Fig 2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before viral injections, we confirmed that all of the birds used in our study sang a stable sequence of stereotyped syllables (Fig S1; all songs were recorded in social isolation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty to sixty days following bilateral injection of mHTT-Q94 in area X, the singing behavior of all birds underwent marked changes (Fig 2 and Fig S2; all songs were recorded in social isolation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most notable change was that syllable sequences became highly unstable from one motif to the next, an effect that could be attributed to an increase in previously rare syllable transitions as well as the emergence of novel syllable transitions, some of which involved newly incorporated vocalizations (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some instances, this sequence instability made comparison of motifs with those motifs produced before viral injection difficult (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified these sequence-level effects using a variety of metrics, including sequence entropy, linearity, consistency, and stereotypy, all of which revealed significant changes (Fig 2E and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term recordings revealed that changes in sequence stability could persist for many months after viral injection (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sequence-level effects remained even if song bouts that included newly incorporated syllables were excluded from the analysis (Fig S2E), indicating that the original syllable sequences also became unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, calculating sequence entropy separately for each syllable revealed that transitions from most (72%) syllables became more variable, suggestive of a global sequencing defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted that some newly integrated syllables closely resembled calls (i.e., vocalizations produced outside song bouts) that the bird had produced before viral injections, whereas others had spectral features distinct from the birds calls (Fig S2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, expression of mHTT-Q94 in area X can lead to the inappropriate incorporation of calls and novel vocalizations into the song motif, and this newly integrated vocal material can also contribute to sequence instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to increased instability of syllable sequences, we noted increases in the daily amount of vocalization and in the duration of individual song bouts (Fig 2 F and G), the latter of which could be attributed to an increase in the number of syllables produced during each bout [mean syllables per bout; before: 15.2 ± 1.9, after: 18.1 ± 2.7; t(8) = 2.70, P = 0.030].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also an increased occurrence of song bouts containing repeated syllables [repetitions occurred in 8.4 ± 4.1% of bouts before injection and in 34.1 ± 8.8% of bouts after injection; t(7) = 4.205, P = 0.003] and a trend toward increased numbers of times that the affected syllable was repeated [before: 2.13 ± 0.10 syllables; after: 2.48 ± 0.22 syllables; t(6) = 2.045, P = 0.087].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we did not see changes in repetition of introductory notes, which are unlearned vocalizations produced before a motif [before: 2.10 ± 0.20 introductory notes, after: 2.11 ± 0.23 introductory notes; t(8) = 1.816, P = 0.923].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfecting area X neurons with HTT-Q20 did not produce sequence- or bout-level changes in song behavior (Fig S3), indicating that these vocal changes were caused by expanded CAG repeats in mHTT-Q94 rather than by nonspecific effects of viral injection or damage resulting from stereotaxic surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to these sequence- and bout-level changes, syllable features in mHTT-Q94 birds, such as duration, Wiener entropy, and variability [coefficient of variance (CV) entropy], remained unaffected (Fig 2 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in the presence of a female, mHTT-Q94 birds reduced the variability in the pitch of individual syllables (Fig S2H) and increased the number of introductory notes [no female: 4.89 ± 1.20, female: 8.31 ± 1.48; t(7) = 6.719, P = 0.001], two context-dependent features of vocal performance important to effective courtship in normal males (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted that mHTT-Q94 birds exhibited reduced sequence entropy in the presence of a female [no female: 3.34 ± 0.11, female: 3.13 ± 0.15; t(7) = 2.710, P = 0.030].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other gross behavioral changes, such as tremor or cervical dystonia, were detected in mHTT-Q94 birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X selectively impairs the birds ability to organize syllable sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preferential_Loss_of_Striatal_Neurons_and_Reduction_of_Inhibitory_Synapses_on_Pallidal_Neurons_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major feature of HD is striatal atrophy resulting from the death of striatal MSNs (4), raising the possibility that the behavioral changes we detected in mHTT-Q94 birds resulted from the loss of striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because smaller (i.e., soma area of less_than100 m2) striatal MSNs and larger pallidal neurons are intermingled in area X (10), injecting LV-mHTT-Q94 could potentially exert nonspecific cytotoxic effects on both striatal and pallidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the idea that mHTT-Q94 expression in area X selectively kills MSNs, Nissl staining of fixed tissue sections revealed that the density of smaller neurons (i.e., soma area of less_than100 m2) in area X was reduced in mHTT-Q94 birds [Fig 3 A and B; 42% loss; control: 4,147 ± 269 cells per square millimeter, mHTT-Q94: 2,389 ± 343 cells per square milliliter; t(6) = 3.932, P = 0.008], but not in HTT-Q20 birds [HTT-Q20: 3,595 ± 331 cells per square millimeter; t(6) = 1.288, P = 0.245].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the size distribution of cells that were lost following LV-mHTT-Q94 injection in area X was similar to the size distribution of MSN cell bodies, as measured by 32 kDa dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) immunofluorescence (Fig 3C), and did not overlap with the size distribution of pallidal cell bodies, which were labeled by injecting retrograde tracer into their axonal terminal field in the song motor thalamus [i.e., the medial nucleus of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the idea that expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X results in the loss of striatal MSNs, but spares the pallidal cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore cell death triggered in area X by expressing mHTT-Q94, we labeled area X cells using the TUNEL system, which detects cell death by labeling cleaved DNA (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected more TUNEL-positive cells in area X of birds injected with mHTT-Q94 [control: 1.2 ± 1.2 cells per square millimeter, mHTT-Q94: 36.3 ± 11.8 cells per square millimeter; t(9) = 2.688, P = 0.025].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, almost all (105 of 110 cells, n = 3 birds) of the TUNEL-positive cells in mHTT-Q94 birds were also positive for the MSN marker DARPP-32, whereas none (0 of 21 cells, n = 2 birds) of the TUNEL-positive cells were pallidal neurons, as identified via retrograde label from DLM (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In area X of birds injected with LV-mHTT-Q94, DARPP-32positive cells constituted a higher fraction in the TUNEL-positive cell populations (105 of 110 cells) than in the Nissl-stained neuron populations (53 of 78 neurons, n = 2 birds) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X preferentially induces cell death in striatal MSNs, because nonspecific cell death would result in a similar fraction of DARPP-32positive cells in the TUNEL-positive and Nissl-stained neuron populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to mammalian striatopallidal organization, MSNs make inhibitory synapses onto pallidal neurons in area X (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of MSNs following mHTT-Q94 expression in area X raises the possibility that inhibitory synapses on pallidal neurons are also reduced in number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of DLM-projecting pallidal neurons in mHTT-Q94 birds had half the number of inhibitory synapses, as measured by the immunocytochemical colocalization of inhibitory postsynaptic markers (gephyrin) and nonspecific presynaptic markers (bassoon) (Fig 3 F and G and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X reduces perisomatic inhibitory synapses on DLM-projecting pallidal neurons in parallel with reducing the numbers of MSNs, which are a major source of these inhibitory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because DLM-projecting pallidal neurons serve as the sole output of area X, MSN cell death followed by inhibitory synaptic reorganization on pallidal neurons could affect singing by altering the output of the BG network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporally_Disrupted_Cortico-BG_Network_Activity_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pallidal neurons in area X influence song indirectly through LMAN, a premotor cortical structure that serves as an output of the cortico-BG network (17, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine how expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X affects cortico-BG network activity, we used a multielectrode array and spike-sorting methods to record pallidal and LMAN neuron activity simultaneously in freely behaving adult male zebra finches (Fig S5A; all recordings were made from adult male zebra finches in social isolation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pallidal and LMAN neurons in mHTT-Q94 birds exhibited increased firing rates with singing, as was also observed in normal birds (Fig S5 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, abnormal activity patterns in both cell types became evident when they were aligned to a specific vocal sequence (the dominant motif: the most frequently produced motif) (Materials and Methods and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas pallidal neurons in normal birds exhibited substantial modulation of firing rates at specific times during the motif (Fig 4A), this temporal modulation was greatly reduced in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted a reduction of the within-cell, trial-to-trial correlation of pallidal activity in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig 4D), suggesting that expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X disrupts the temporal precision of pallidal activity during singing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate how changes in the temporal patterning of pallidal activity relate to syllable sequences, we calculated the mutual information between pallidal activity and consecutive time sequences in the motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this timing information was significantly decreased in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig 4E), indicating that pallidal activity conveys less information of moment-by-moment sequences in the song motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because pallidal neurons in area X can be divided into two distinct anatomical classes, only one of which projects to the thalamic nucleus DLM (28), a remaining issue is whether the firing properties of DLM-projecting pallidal cells are affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a Fano factor analysis, which has previously been used to distinguish the two pallidal cell types (29), to establish that the singing-related activity of putative DLM-projecting pallidal neurons was temporally disrupted in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that expressing mHTT-Q94 in area X disrupts the temporal precision of pallidothalamic activity, which may degrade timing information about specific vocal sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also detected changes in the temporal patterns of singing-related LMAN activity following expression of mHTT in area X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that singing-related burst firing of LMAN neurons, which is known to be regulated by BG circuitry (22, 30), was less frequent in mHTT-Q94 birds and that bursts were of shorter duration when they did occur (Fig 5 AC and Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the mean firing rate in LMAN was not altered in mHTT-Q94 birds [Fig S5D; t(12) = 1.027, P = 0.325], LMAN firing was more evenly distributed throughout different syllables in the motif, as reflected in the reduced CV in interspike intervals (ISIs; Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also noted reduced timing information in LMAN neurons of mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig 5E), indicating that the abnormally regular LMAN activity has less selectivity to specific syllables, as we observed with pallidal neuron activity in mHTT-Q94 birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike for pallidal neurons, the within-cell, trial-to-trial correlation of LMAN activity was preserved in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig S7C), and LMAN firing still exhibited substantial modulation during singing (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, LMAN neurons in mHTT-Q94 birds transmit abnormal timing information to downstream song motor structures on a background of normal trial-to-trial firing rate correlations and substantial firing rate modulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inactivating_LMAN_Activity_Reversibly_Rescues_Disrupted_Song_Behavior_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test directly the idea that the temporally disrupted LMAN activity is responsible for disorganized song in mHTT-Q94 birds, we reversibly inactivated LMAN by muscimol application through bilaterally implanted microdialysis probes (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LMAN inactivation reduced sequence entropy to nearly normal levels (Fig 6 BD and Fig S8A) and also reduced overall song bout duration in mHTT-Q94 birds (Fig 6E and Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shorter song bout duration was attributed to reduced syllable numbers in each song bout [before muscimol: 20.0 ± 2.7 syllables per bout, after muscimol: 16.7 ± 2.6 syllables per bout; t(3) = 3.590, P = 0.037].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted that there was a tendency toward less frequent syllable repetitions, but this difference was not significant [before muscimol: 35.1 ± 15.8%, after muscimol: 7.3 ± 2.7%; t(3) = 1.961, P = 0.145].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivating LMAN also reduced the variability in the fundamental frequency of individual syllables [CV of pitch; pre: 0.013 ± 0.003, post: 0.006 ± 0.001; t(5) = 2.571, P = 0.050], consistent with the known function of LMAN in modulating syllable variability (15, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings indicate that temporally disrupted LMAN activity is critical for driving disorganized song behavior in mHTT-Q94 birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we show that expressing mHTT in area X, a region of the songbird BG specialized for singing behavior, destabilizes syllable sequences and increases overall vocal activity, but leaves the structure of individual syllables intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cellular correlate of these behavioral changes includes the selective loss of striatal MSNs in area X paralleled by a marked reduction in inhibitory synapses on pallidal neurons that serve as the BG output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cellular and synaptic changes were sufficient to alter the activity across a larger expanse of the BG-cortical network, because pallidal neurons and downstream LMAN neurons in mHTT birds exhibited abnormal patterns of singing-related activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, reversibly inactivating LMAN rescued aberrant vocal behavior in mHTT birds, indicating that changes to the timing of activity in the cortico-BG network drive changes in vocal sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present findings that aberrant temporal patterns of cortico-BG activity disrupt complex motor sequences may inform strategies for ameliorating disorganized movements in BG diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parallels_to_HD_and_Selective_Impairment_of_Sequential_Movements_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BG circuits are implicated in the organization of motor sequences, in part, by selecting for elementary gestures appropriate to a given behavioral context (i.e., action selection) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that focally expressing mHTT in area X of the zebra finch affects syllable sequence organization by destabilizing syllable sequences and decreasing song termination, and also by increasing the tendency to repeat syllables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence destabilization could be attributed to an increase in previously rare syllable transitions as well as the expression of novel syllable transitions, some of which involved the incorporation of new syllables into a motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behavioral changes are reminiscent of disorganized movements in humans with HD, including increased spontaneous movements, disorganized sequences of elementary gestures, and insertion of inappropriate gestures into sequential movements (6, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results also extend the recent finding that a transgenic zebra finch model of HD exhibits various HD-like symptoms (23) by demonstrating that focal expression of mHTT in area X selectively affects motor sequences related to singing behavior, thus providing a more specific link between the genetic insult, circuit defects, and aberrant behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observed only syllable sequence destabilization following expression of mHTT in area X, whereas the transgenic HD songbird displays sequence and syllable instability, as well as body rigidity, tremor, and cervical dystonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, the additional behavioral symptoms that manifest in the transgenic finch result from the expression of mHTT in other song and motor regions of the brain outside of area X, many of which also express the mHTT gene at high levels (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another distinction is that the viral approach allowed for temporally restricted expression of mHTT in adult finches after they had already successfully learned and stabilized their songs, thus avoiding the potential confound in the transgenic finch that some of its song abnormalities are secondary consequences of impaired learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a useful aspect of the viral approach is that it establishes the sufficiency of spatially and developmentally restricted expression of mHTT in area X of the adult finch in driving sequence-specific changes to song.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies indicate that the ability to organize multiple movements temporally can be disrupted in humans with HD, leaving elementary movements relatively unaffected (5, 6, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, birds expressing mHTT in area X exhibited sequence-level changes to song, but the structure and variability of individual syllables remained unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of changes to previously learned syllables and the continued ability of mHTT birds to modulate variability as a function of social context further support a model in which the variability of individual syllables and of the sequences in which they occur are at least partly under independent control (16, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible clinical parallel is that humans with HD often exhibit grammatical errors and can struggle to produce complex sentences, even though simple phonemic generation can be preserved (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these various observations strengthen the notion that the BG play a critical role in organizing and terminating motor sequences and show that focally expressing mHTT in the BG results in elevated levels of aberrant sequential behavior, reminiscent of the hyperkinetic, disorganized movements characteristic of HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Circuit_Basis_for_Impaired_Motor_Sequences_in_mHTT_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The song-related effects of expressing mHTT in area X exert selective behavioral and anatomical effects that contrast with the behavioral and anatomical effects elicited by area X lesions, thus helping to illuminate how different components of the BG circuitry regulate sequential movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, sequence variability, vocal activity, and song bout duration increase in mHTT finches but are often unaffected following area X lesions in adult birds (36, 37; but see 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, variability and duration of individual syllables are unaffected in mHTT birds but are altered following area X lesions (30, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The song behavior of mHTT birds could not simply be attributed to nonspecific cytotoxic effects of viral injection, infection, or overexpression of mHTT, because expressing exon 1 with 20 CAG repeats [i.e., a quantity fivefold greater than the avian repeat number (23)] was without any discernible behavioral effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More fundamentally, chemical or electrolytic lesions placed in area X destroy both MSNs and pallidal neurons, whereas expressing mHTT in area X selectively kills MSNs without reducing the numbers of pallidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, chemical inactivation of the globus pallidus internus does not disrupt learned motor sequences in monkeys, suggesting that pallidal neuron activity may be unnecessary for the maintenance of previously learned behaviors (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mHTT birds, the intact population of pallidal neurons may exacerbate aberrant vocal behavior by transmitting temporally disrupted patterns of activity to downstream thalamic and cortical premotor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although pallidal neurons are preserved in mHTT birds, inhibitory cells and synapses in area X undergo extensive reconfiguration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of cell death- and cell type-specific markers indicates that expressing mHTT in area X selectively triggers cell death in MSNs, similar to the selective loss of striatal MSNs in HD (4, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One consequence of MSN cell death is the marked reduction of inhibitory puncta on DLM-projecting pallidal neuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites, which presumably reflects the loss of inhibitory input from MSNs, and perhaps from other inhibitory neurons in area X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although syllable repetitions in zebra finches with area X lesions have been speculated to arise from the replacement of MSNs through ongoing neurogenesis (38), the persistent reduction in inhibitory synapses on the DLM-projecting pallidal neurons we observed suggests that the primary factor driving abnormal vocal behavior is the massive loss of MSNs, which is a hallmark of HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, because pallidal neurons fire action potentials spontaneously and at high rates, and because MSN neurons generate precisely timed action potential bursts during singing (13), this loss of MSN input is likely to diminish or otherwise alter precisely timed singing-related activity in pallidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indeed, extracellular recordings made from pallidal neurons in mHTT finches revealed reduced temporal modulation during singing, consistent with the idea that diminished inhibition results in less precisely controlled pallidal neuron activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, although pallidal neuron firing rates increased during song, the normal patterns of sharp and transient decreases in firing rate were absent, which could be accounted for by diminished inhibitory input from MSN cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, transient decreases in pallidal neuron firing rate are sufficient to generate action potential bursts in their postsynaptic targets in the song motor thalamus (i.e., DLM) (42), which, in turn, excite the LMAN neurons that are an important source of vocal variability (14, 16, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, expressing mHTT in area X has the potential to alter activity not only in the BG but also in the cortical neurons that are indirect targets of pallidal neurons and that more directly affect vocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this view, LMAN neurons in mHTT birds exhibited reduced bursting activity and less variable spike timing, and ultimately conveyed less timing information during singing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, inactivating LMAN stabilized syllable sequences, but sharply reduced song bout duration and overall vocal activity, suggesting that abnormal patterns of LMAN activity drive abnormal vocal behavior in mHTT birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insights into how a spatially restricted genetic insult can ramify through the local BG circuitry and across a broader cortico-BG network to affect a complex sequential behavior and raise the possibility that precisely manipulating this network activity may help to restore normal motor function in HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible_Mechanisms_by_Which_Cortico-BG_Networks_Influence_Sequential_Movements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A remaining question is how abnormal LMAN activity patterns affect sequential vocal behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual LMAN axons bifurcate as they exit the caudal margin of the nucleus, with separate branches terminating in the song motor cortical region [the robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA)] and in area X (18, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LMAN-RA pathway is known to be an important source of syllable variability (15) and could also potentially affect sequence variability through recurrent pathways involving the thalamus and the song premotor nucleus HVC (46), which lies upstream of RA and is thought to regulate songs temporal features, including intersyllable transitions (4751).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, syllable variability was unaffected in mHTT birds, raising the question of how the propagation of altered LMAN activity through RA could affect sequence variability without also increasing the variability of individual syllables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that distinct features of LMAN activity differently affect syllable sequences and variability through the LMAN-RA pathway: Disrupted temporal patterns could destabilize syllable sequences without affecting syllable variability, whereas unaltered trial-to-trial correlations and persistent firing rate modulation may support normal levels of syllable variability regardless of reduced bursting activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, another intriguing possibility is that abnormal activity patterns in LMAN disrupt syllable sequences by interfering with HVC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent study revealed an indirect pathway from LMAN to HVC that includes area X, the ventral pallidum, and a midbrain cell group (A11) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this view, temporally abnormal activity patterns in LMAN can promote the production of certain syllables at wrong times in the sequence by acutely altering premotor commands at the level of HVC (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, altered LMAN activity patterns may also indirectly affect vocal sequences by inducing plastic changes in HVC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, LMAN lesions can prevent synaptic changes in HVC normally triggered by deafening (52), suggesting that LMAN activity can modulate synaptic organization in HVC through the BG and midbrain pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, striatal plasticity is known to induce dynamic changes in cortical signaling (53) and is required for the emergence of timing signals in the BG and midbrain during motor sequence learning (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mHTT-dependent loss of MSNs could engage both acute and long-term mechanisms that disrupt the precisely timed signals that normally flow through cortico-BG networks, resulting in disorganized motor sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For song analysis, days before and 30 d after injection were randomly chosen [mHTT-Q94: 7.2 ± 3.9 d before and 61.7 ± 45.8 d after injection; HTT-Q20: 5.8 ± 2.9 d before and 70.8 ± 23.6 d after injection (mean ± SD); n = 9], and all of the recorded files on the day were processed with a custom MATLAB program (MathWorks) to extract and classify song syllables as described previously (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare syllable features before and after mHTT injection, shared syllables (excluding introductory notes) from 100 randomly chosen renditions were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract song bouts, we first determined the most frequently observed syllable sequence on that day as the dominant motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, song bouts were defined as successive vocalizations with intersyllable intervals of less_than400 ms and that included at least three syllables from the dominant motif, allowing us to exclude call bouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare sequence features before and after mHTT injection, 100 randomly chosen song bouts were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence entropy S was calculated as follows based on the empirically estimated transition probability matrix:S=ipilog2pi,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where pi is the probability of observing each syllable transition type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linearity, consistency, and stereotypy were calculated with syllables, including introductory notes in individual song bouts, and averaged across the 100 randomly chosen bouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine spike activity aligned to the dominant motif, the first 30 recordings after implantation containing the dominant motif were identified, and analyses were confined to the first 500 ms after the motif onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instantaneous firing rate was calculated as the reciprocal of the ISI and smoothed with a band-pass filter (2575 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean firing rate was the average of binned firing rates in a 20-ms sliding bin with a sliding step of 1 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trial-to-trial correlation was the average of the peak between a ±10-ms time shift in cross-correlation values calculated between all of the possible combinations of the 30 iterations of smoothed instantaneous firing rate after mean subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timing information I(T;A) was calculated as mutual information between timing T in the motif and spike activity A based on binned firing rates:I(T;A)=tTp(t)log2p(t)+aAp(a)tTp(t|a)log2p(t|a),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where p(t) is the probability of observing a specific timing t in the motif, p(a) is the probability of observing the spike number a in the motif, and p(t|a) is the probability of observing the activity in a specific timing t in the motif given the spike number of a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because p(t) is a constant of 1/500, the first term on the right side is 8.966.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, low timing information means syllable timings cannot be decoded from the observed spike activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Error bars and values in the text indicate mean ± SEM unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired or unpaired t tests were used to assess the effects of mHTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the proportion of TUNEL-positive MSNs, a 2 test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated two-way ANOVA was performed in MATLAB to examine the effects of mHTT on social modulation of CV pitch and the effects of LMAN inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult male zebra finches (143 ± 39 d posthatch, mean ± SD; n = 38) were obtained from the Duke University Medical Center breeding facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experimental procedures were in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the Duke University Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult male zebra finches were isolated in a sound-attenuating chamber under a 14/10-h light/dark cycle, where their songs were automatically recorded with Sound Analysis Pro (Ofer Tchernichovski, Hunter College, New York) (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All songs were recorded in social isolation except in Fig S2H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Song_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare syllable features before and after mHTT injection, shared syllables (excluding introductory notes) from 100 randomly chosen renditions were analyzed to calculate mean duration, mean entropy (Wiener entropy), and mean CV entropy (entropy variance) based on a power spectrum generated from an 11.6-ms sliding window with a step size of 0.5 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CV entropy was calculated as the CV of Wiener entropy within each syllable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CV of pitch was calculated in Sound Analysis Pro as the CV of fundamental frequency across 10 randomly chosen iterations of a part of those syllables with clear harmonic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directed songs were recorded by presenting a female zebra finch to a previously isolated male for less_than3 min for each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the analyzed songs are undirected songs unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare sequence features before and after mHTT injection, 100 randomly chosen song bouts were analyzed to report sequence entropy, mean song bout duration, syllable repetition, linearity, consistency, and stereotypy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linearity was calculated as internal linearity [(no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of syllable types  1)/no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of transition types] (56) with syllables, including introductory notes, but repetition of introductory notes (ii) was excluded so that the syllable sequence iiiabcd gives the linearity score of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency score was calculated [no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of typical transitions/no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of transitions], where typical transitions were determined for each preceding syllable as the most frequently observed syllable transitions in the song.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stereotypy score was the average of linearity and consistency scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linearity, consistency, and stereotypy were calculated in each song bout and averaged across 100 randomly chosen bouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetition of a syllable, excluding introductory notes, was detected in 100 randomly chosen bouts to calculate the mean number of times that the affected syllable was repeated in each repetition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viral_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult male zebra finches were kept in a recording chamber for 7 d before the viral injection to allow sufficient habituation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection procedures are similar to the injection procedures described previously (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, birds were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation [2% (vol/vol) O2] and placed in a custom stereotaxic apparatus with a heat blanket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Area X was first mapped based on stereotaxic coordinates (5.3 mm rostral, 1.7 mm lateral, and 3.0 mm ventral; head angle of 40°; stereotaxic coordinates in this study were measured from the posterior edge of the bifurcation of the midsagittal sinus) and characteristic high-frequency units in multiunit recordings (Carbostar-1; Kation Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate extensive viral transfection in area X, viral aliquots of 161 nL were delivered to six different sites in each area X (966 nL per hemisphere in total) using a Nanoject-II (Drummond Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LV was obtained from the Duke Viral Vector Core at a concentration of 106 focus-forming units per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral and physiological changes were assessed 30 d after the bilateral injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds were deeply anesthetized with i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of 20 L Euthasol (Virbac) and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removed brain was postfixed with 4% (wt/vol) PFA in PBS for 2 h and cryoprotected with 30% (wt/vol) sucrose and 4% (wt/vol) PFA in PBS overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sagittal sections (thickness of 4050 m) were prepared with a sledge microtome (Reichert) and collected in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemistry, sections were washed twice in PBS, blocked with 1% (wt/vol) BSA and 2% (wt/vol) normal goat serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 1 h, and incubated with primary Abs in PBST at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary Abs in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following combinations of Abs were used: rabbit antiDARPP-32 Abs (1:500, ab40801; Abcam) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG Abs with DyLight 405 or Alexa 488 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch), rabbit anti-gephyrin Abs (1:750, ab32206; Abcam) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG Abs with DyLight 405 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and mouse anti-bassoon Abs (1:500, ab82958; Abcam) and goat anti-mouse IgG Abs with Alexa 488 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were imaged with a confocal microscope (710 LSM; Zeiss) after coverslipping with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To label DLM-projecting pallidal neurons, dextran Alexa Fluor 647 (D-22914; Molecular Probes) was injected into DLM 47 d before the perfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target site in DLM was based on stereotaxic coordinates (1.8 mm rostral, 1.1 mm lateral, and 4.1 mm ventral; head angle of 30°) and high-frequency units concomitant with low-frequency large units in multiunit recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeling with the TUNEL system (Promega) or Nissl stain (1:200 NeuroTrace, N-21480; Molecular Probes) was performed after immunohistochemistry according to the protocol provided by the supplier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For quantification of labeled neurons other than Nissl stain, we confined the analysis to near the surface of sections because some agents, such as antiDARPP-32 Abs, did not penetrate the section sufficiently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the number and soma size of neurons, confocal images near the center of area X (0.202 mm2) were binarized with thresholding, noise was removed with a despeckle filter, and puncta with an area of 10 m2 were counted with ImageJ (v1.48; NIH) after correcting misaligned contours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the synaptic colocalization, images were acquired with 0.45-m steps, and all optical sections containing dextran signal on the cell body of a pallidal neuron were maximum-projected and used for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, an outline of the cell body and dendrites was traced in the maximum-projected image within a circle roughly twice the diameter of the cell body centered on the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, colocalization of gephyrin, bassoon, and dextran signal was automatically detected within the traced region using the Puncta Analyzer plug-in for ImageJ v1.29 after background subtraction with a rolling ball radius of 50 and thresholding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters for synaptic analysis were determined in a section from a normal bird and kept constant throughout the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extracellular_Recording_in_Singing_Birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 16-channel silicone probe (A1x16-5mm-100-177-CM16LP; NeuroNexus) was implanted to LMAN and/or area X in a hemisphere based on stereotaxic coordinates (5.3 mm rostral and 1.7 mm lateral; head angle of 40°) and characteristic LMAN and pallidal units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Habituation of the bird to a dummy weight (1.52 g) for 7 d before the implantation shortened the recovery period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected with a universal serial bus (USB) interface board (RHD2000; Intan Technologies) after band-pass filtering (0.210 kHz) and sampling at 20 kHz with a small amplifier board (RHD2132 16-Channel; Intan Technologies) on the birds head.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spikes were sorted offline with a custom MATLAB program based on OSort v3.0 (Ueli Rutishauser, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles) (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the sorted units had a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (mean peak/noise SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unit activity in area X was classified as a pallidal unit if the resting mean firing rate was 50 Hz (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the recording, the brain was cut and Nissl-stained to confirm the recording sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LMAN_Inactivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microdialysis probes were bilaterally implanted into LMAN based on stereotaxic coordinates (4.9 mm rostral, 1.85 mm lateral, and 2.4 mm ventral; head angle of 40°) and by the presence of bursting units in multiunit recordings (Carbostar-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a recovery period of 23 d, probes were loaded with saline or 5 mM muscimol in saline, followed by a wash with saline after 6 h. Infusion of muscimol into LMAN for 2 h eliminated the multiunit activity in LMAN without reducing the multiunit activity in the medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MMAN) (112.0 ± 0.9% of the activity before infusion; n = 2 anesthetized birds), which is distant by 1 mm from LMAN and may also be involved in regulating vocal sequences (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
