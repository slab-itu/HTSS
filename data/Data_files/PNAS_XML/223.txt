title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification of a small molecule inhibitor of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to target serine biosynthesis in cancers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Serine supports a number of anabolic processes, including protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells can either import serine or synthesize it de novo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, overexpression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the gene encoding the first committed step of serine synthesis, via focal amplification and other mechanisms, has been identified in human cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cell lines that overexpress PHGDH are uniquely sensitive to PHGDH knockdown whereas lines that express little PHGDH are insensitive, suggesting that PHGDH may be a clinically interesting target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the discovery of a specific small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH, which enables preclinical evaluation of PHGDH as a target in cancer and provides a tool to study the biology of de novo serine synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to promote growth and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic evidence pointing to the importance of the amino acid serine in tumorigenesis is striking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene encoding the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which catalyzes the first committed step of serine biosynthesis, is overexpressed in tumors and cancer cell lines via focal amplification and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHGDH-overexpressing cells are exquisitely sensitive to genetic ablation of the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the discovery of a selective small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH, CBR-5884, identified by screening a library of 800,000 drug-like compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 inhibited de novo serine synthesis in cancer cells and was selectively toxic to cancer cell lines with high serine biosynthetic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical characterization of the inhibitor revealed that it was a noncompetitive inhibitor that showed a time-dependent onset of inhibition and disrupted the oligomerization state of PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of a small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH not only enables thorough preclinical evaluation of PHGDH as a target in cancers, but also provides a tool with which to study serine metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Screening for inhibitors of PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Serine synthesis from glucose via the phosphoserine pathway: Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) oxidizes the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (p-Pyr) using NAD+; phosphoserine amino transferase (PSAT1) transaminates p-Pyr to phosphoserine (p-Ser) using glutamate as a nitrogen donor; phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) dephosphorylates p-Ser to yield serine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) In vitro PHGDH assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diaphorase couples the NADH produced upon PHGDH turnover to the reduction of resazurin to fluorescent resorufin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resorufin fluorescence is a proxy for PHGDH activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSAT1 is included to prevent product feedback inhibition of PHGDH by p-Pyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Z-score plot for the 800,000-compound library screened using the above PHGDH assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point represents a single compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A negative score indicates inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Screen triaging strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Setting a Z-score threshold of 3 gave 3,906 putative hits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After counter-screening against diaphorase to rule out false positives and confirming activity against PHGDH, 408 compounds remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected compounds were profiled against a panel of metabolic NAD(P)+ dehydrogenases to ascertain selectivity for PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Structures of representative PHGDH inhibitors evaluated in cell-based assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Screening_for_Small_Molecule_Inhibitors_of_PHGDH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An in vitro enzymatic assay for PHGDH activity amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS) was developed by coupling the production of NADH, upon 3-PG oxidation, to the reduction of resazurin to resorufin using diaphorase as the coupling enzyme (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, resorufin fluorescence served as a proxy for PHGDH activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay was miniaturized to a 1,536-well format with a Z-factor of  greater than 0.75, indicating a high quality assay (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A library of 800,000 small molecules was screened in single point format at 13 M (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Setting a threshold Z score of 3, corresponding to at least 50% PHGDH inhibition, gave a 0.5% hit rate, yielding 3,906 hits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative hits were reassayed in triplicate and counter-screened against diaphorase to rule out false positives targeting diaphorase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counter screen eliminated 3,498 compounds, giving 408 PHGDH inhibitors (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A triaging strategy based on hit potency and selectivity was designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that inhibitors specific to PHGDH would minimize general cellular toxicity compared with compounds that hit a variety of dehydrogenases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined for a panel of NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenases that included PHGDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH1), and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-HSD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds at least fourfold more selective for PHGDH were progressed for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this triaging, seven of the most potent PHGDH inhibitors were selected as lead compounds for evaluation in cell-based assays; selected structures are shown in Fig 1E (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of these compounds are likely to target sulfhydryl groups and may therefore react with a PHGDH cysteine residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, both CBR-5807 and CBR-6936 contain sulfhydryl-reactive disulfide centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, CBR-5807 (Disulfiram) is an approved drug dosed in humans to treat alcoholism and known to inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase by reacting with sulfhydryl groups (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CBR-5884_Inhibits_Serine_Synthesis_in_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We determined whether any of our seven leads inhibited serine synthesis in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we turned to gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GCMS) with uniformly carbon-13labeled glucose (13C6-glucose) tracing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the isotopic enrichment of serine, it is possible to decouple newly synthesized serine from extracellular serine or serine that was synthesized before tracer addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly synthesized serine has a mass-shift of 3 (M+3) due to the incorporation of glucose-derived 13C via 3-PG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first investigated the kinetics of serine labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serine labeling plateaued around 6 h, with 65% of the serine pool being 13C-labeled (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plateau phase likely reflects exchange between intra- and extracellular serine pools (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With an understanding of serine-labeling kinetics, we designed a 13C6-glucose tracing assay to acutely interrogate the effects of compounds on serine synthesis (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assaying serine synthesis with a 3-h compound treatment was preferred to longer treatments to guard against false positives that decrease serine labeling by an indirect effect, such as generally compromising cellular viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among our lead compounds, CBR-5884 was able to decrease de novo serine synthesis by 30%; the remaining compounds had little effect (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose at which CBR-5884 had an effect on serine labeling was consistent with the in vitro biochemical IC50 of 33 Â± 12 M for PHGDH (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At such concentrations, CBR-5884 had no effect on two other NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and MDH1 (Fig 2C and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, under the acute treatment time period used in the labeling assays, CBR-5884 was not generally cytotoxic at concentrations up to 40 M as determined by two independent cellular viability assays (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, decreases in serine labeling are a direct effect of CBR-5884mediated PHGDH inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We resynthesized CBR-5884 in-house and performed a doseresponse experiment for CBR-5884 using the same acute treatment method as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serine labeling was significantly decreased at 30 M and trended toward a decrease at 15 M (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, perturbations in labeling were specific to serine in that neither the PHGDH substrate, 3-PG, nor the end products of glycolysis, pyruvate and lactate, were affected (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed that glycolytic metabolites were unperturbed by CBR-5884 treatment using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to interrogate a greater panel of metabolites (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, changes in serine labeling are a direct effect of CBR-5884mediated PHGDH inhibition and not a consequence of changes in PHGDH substrate levels or general perturbations in glycolytic flux (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of an effect on lactate labeling was consistent with the in vitro data showing that CBR-5884 does not inhibit LDH under the drug concentrations used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, the data argue that CBR-5884 is able to selectively inhibit serine synthesis in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that CBR-5884 is an ethyl ester and therefore susceptible to intracellular esterases, we investigated whether the carboxylic acid derivative of the parent molecule was still active against PHGDH; were the acid less active, it would likely decrease the efficiency of targeting PHGDH in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parent and acid derivatives were equally potent against, and selective for, PHGDH in vitro, suggesting that intracellular deesterification is unlikely to affect CBR-5884 activity (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CBR-5884_Selectively_Inhibits_the_Proliferation_of_Cancer_Cells_with_a_High_Propensity_for_Serine_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We established a system to test the ability of CBR-5884 to inhibit PHGDH-dependent cancer cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first evaluated the ability of a panel of breast and melanoma cell lines to proliferate in serine replete or deplete media as a proxy for serine biosynthetic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breast lines were selected based on PHGDH expression according to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data and validated by blotting for PHGDH (Fig 3A and Fig S2) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing extracellular serine had no effect on proliferation of high PHGDH-expressing lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-436, HCC70, and Hs578T (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four lines cluster in the top quartile of the CCLE dataset for PHGDH expression (Fig S2); MDA-MB-468 and HCC70 cells harbor PHGDH amplifications (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, serine depletion almost completely abrogated proliferation of low PHGDH-expressing lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In melanoma cells, PHGDH protein levels were similarly commensurate with the ability to proliferate in serine-free media (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although Carney cells are sensitive to extracellular serine depletion, they can adapt and proliferate, as evidenced by increased PHGDH protein levels upon serine depletion (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the ability to proliferate in the absence of extracellular serine is indicative of a high propensity for serine synthesis, we hypothesized that such lines should be sensitive to CBR-5884.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, lines that cannot grow in serine-free media have a low propensity for serine synthesis and should therefore be resistant to PHGDH inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating the breast lines with CBR-5884 in serine-replete media inhibited growth of the four lines that grew without extracellular serine in a dose-dependent manner, with growth inhibition ranging from 35% to 60% at 30 M CBR-5884.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitor had no effect on the three lines sensitive to serine withdrawal, indicating that the inhibitor was selectively toxic to cells with high serine synthesis activity (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether removing serine from the media, to enhance the reliance on de novo serine synthesis, could sensitize cells to PHGDH inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, serine depletion increased the efficacy of CBR-5884 in lines already sensitive under serine-replete conditions as evidenced by an 8090% decrease in proliferation with 30 M CBR-5884 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, MCF7 cells, which were of intermediate sensitivity to serine withdrawal, and insensitive to drug under serine-replete conditions, became partially sensitive to the inhibitor under serine-deplete conditions (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, under serine-replete conditions, PHGDH knockdown phenocopied the effects of CBR-5884 treatment in that the drug-sensitive lines were also sensitive to PHGDH knockdown (Fig 3E and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as with the drug treatments, growing cells in serine-free media enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of PHGDH knockdown (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends were observed for the melanoma panel in terms of both the selectivity of CBR-5884 for cells with a high propensity for serine synthesis and the increased efficacy under serine-deplete conditions (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the acid derivative of compound 5884 was not effective on MDA-MB-468 cells, likely owing to poor membrane permeability, and is therefore not a viable alternative to the parent compound (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_CBR-5884_Inhibition_Modality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sought to more deeply characterize the mechanism by which CBR-5884 inhibits PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition constants (Ki) for CBR-5884 with respect to each substrate were determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 inhibited PHGDH in a noncompetitive mode with respect to both substrates, as evidenced by a decreasing Vmax with increasing CBR-5884 concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition constants were 50 Â± 20 M and 50 Â± 3 M for 3-PG and NAD+, respectively (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed whether there was any time dependence to the onset of inhibition by varying the time period for which drug and PHGDH were preincubated before initiating the enzymatic reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 was progressively more potent with increasing preincubation time, culminating in an IC50 of 7 M when drug and PHGDH were preincubated for 4 h (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrigued by the combination of a time-dependent onset of inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition, the latter suggesting that CBR-5884 might be binding to an allosteric pocket, we speculated that CBR-5884 could be affecting the PHGDH oligomerization state, where the time dependency of inhibition could potentially stem from drug-induced conformational changes in PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the PHGDH oligomerization state, we incubated PHGDH with drug and then cross-linked before SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 shifted the PHGDH equilibrium from the tetrameric to the dimeric state (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No such effect was observed with LDH, which is resistant to CBR-5884mediated inhibition (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 still inhibited a truncated form of PHGDH, which lacks the C-terminal domain responsible for tetramerization and is therefore a constitutive dimer (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that disruption of the tetramer might assist PHGDH inhibition but is not necessary for inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have reported the discovery of a PHGDH inhibitor, CBR-5884, and have shown that it inhibits serine synthesis in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CBR-5884 specifically inhibited the proliferation of melanoma and breast cancer lines with high levels of serine synthesis activity, with little effect on lines reliant on serine import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CBR-5884 is selective for lines addicted to serine synthesis and phenocopies sensitivity to PHGDH knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a biochemical analysis of CBR-5884 revealed that it was a noncompetitive inhibitor that showed a time-dependent onset of inhibition and disrupted the oligomerization state of PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent work examining how malignant cells rewire their metabolism to support growth and proliferation has revealed a number of clinically interesting targets (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the most promising is the discovery of gain-of-function mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes that result in the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings translated into chemical probes that yielded insights into the biology of IDH mutations (25, 26) and led to clinical programs (e.g., NCT02481154).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic evidence pointing to a role for PHGDH in cancer is similarly striking: PHGDH is one of few metabolic enzymes genetically deregulated in cancer (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, elevated PHGDH expression correlates with clinical aggressiveness and poor prognosis in TNBC (13, 16) and NSCLC (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a paucity of targeted therapies for these cancers and chemotherapies are frequently used (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the clinical potential of PHGDH inhibitors as targeted agents for TNBC and NSCLC tumors addicted to serine synthesis, as a single agent or in combination with standard of care, is an exciting perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond the preclinical applications, a PHGDH inhibitor provides a tool to study de novo serine synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it remains unclear why a serine biosynthesis enzyme is critical for tumor growth when serine is available in the serum (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBR-5884 provides a valuable tool complementary to genetic strategies to study the necessity of serine synthesis and other phenomena because small molecules provide greater temporal resolution and do not deplete the actual protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CBR-5884 has already suggested an interesting feature of PHGDH biochemistry: namely, that human PHGDH could be regulated by transitions between different oligomerization states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are reminiscent of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) regulation in that both an endogenous metabolite, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and pharmacological small molecule activators enhance PKM2 activity by stabilizing the tetrameric form (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenously, 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) has been reported to activate PHGDH (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, 2-PG could be functioning by modulating the PHGDH oligomerization state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is possible that CBR-5884 is a covalent inhibitor of PHGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PHGDH does not rely on an active site cysteine, there are a number of cysteines that could potentially perturb enzymatic function were they modified because they are in close proximity to the active site (PDB ID code 2G76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to determine whether changes in the PHGDH oligomerization state are unique to CBR-5884, it would be interesting to determine whether Disulfiram (CBR-5807), CBR-6936, or sulfhydryl blocking reagents have similar effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of a selective small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH capable of modulating de novo serine synthesis in PHGDH-dependent cancer cells represents a significant step toward the goal of targeting serine metabolism in oncology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future in vivo evaluation of the CBR-5884 chemical series will require medicinal chemistry-based optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, CBR-5884 was found to be unstable in mouse plasma, and, as described, replacement of the ethyl ester moiety with the corresponding negatively charged carboxylic acid resulted in a derivative that retains enzyme inhibitory activity but loses activity on cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CBR-5884 is more likely to serve as a tool compound, and as a starting point for generating more drug-like molecules, than an actual drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the cell-based potency of this series will likely need to be improved to enable in vivo evaluation at exposure levels that are not generally toxic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results provide a proof-of-concept that small molecule inhibitors of PHGDH represent a viable class of anti-cancer drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
