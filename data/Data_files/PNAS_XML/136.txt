Metabolic stress is a barrier to EpsteinBarr virus-mediated B-cell immortalization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although nearly all adults are infected with EBV, very few go on to develop disease, for reasons that we are only beginning to understand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with EBV induces a period of very rapid cell division, which requires an increased supply of metabolites, such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that EBV-infected cells that are unable to meet this increased metabolic demand are forced to stop proliferating and undergo a permanent growth arrest called senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that has been causally linked to the development of B-cell and epithelial malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early after infection, EBV induces a transient period of hyperproliferation that is suppressed by the activation of the DNA damage response and a G1/S-phase growth arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This growth arrest prevents long-term outgrowth of the majority of infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a method to isolate and characterize infected cells that arrest after this early burst of proliferation and integrated gene expression and metabolic profiling to gain a better understanding of the pathways that attenuate immortalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the arrested cells have a reduced level of mitochondrial respiration and a decrease in the expression of genes involved in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the growth arrest in early infected cells could be rescued by supplementing the TCA cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrested cells were characterized by an increase in the expression of p53 pathway gene targets, including sestrins leading to activation of AMPK, a reduction in mTOR signaling, and, consequently, elevated autophagy that was important for cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy was also critical to maintain early hyperproliferation during metabolic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in assessing the metabolic changes from early infection to long-term outgrowth, we found concomitant increases in glucose import and surface glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) levels, leading to elevated glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and suppression of basal autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that oncogene-induced senescence triggered by a combination of metabolic and genotoxic stress acts as an intrinsic barrier to EBV-mediated transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

EBV_Infection_of_Primary_B_Cells_Induces_a_Senescence-Like_Growth_Arrest  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early after EBV infection, B cells undergo a transient period of hyperproliferation that induces a G1/S-phase growth arrest in a subset of the population (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To functionally characterize this population, we have devised a protocol that allows us to identify and isolate cells that initially proliferate and then arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human blood and stained with CellTrace Violet followed by infection with the B95-8 strain of EBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then stained with a second proliferation tracking dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), at day 4 after infection to coincide with the initial burst of hyperproliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then monitored over time, with those that were low for the Violet stain but high for the CFSE stain termed proliferatedarrested (PA) and those that were low for both stains designated proliferatedproliferated (PP) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Precursor cohort analysis (25) of the double-stained cells on day 8 after infection demonstrated that the PA cells had a mean division number of 2, similar to the day 4 cell population and in contrast to the PP cells, which had a mean division number of 4 (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the double-stain experiment allows us to determine the percentage of cells that arrest after each initial division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the day 8 cells that divided three times or less, population doublings 13 (PD13), arrested (PA), whereas the cells that had divided more than four times were predominately in the PP population (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the PD13 population was previously found to have elevated markers of the DDR, which is known to attenuate EBV-mediated B-cell transformation (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed growth arrest could be a transient quiescence or senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to address these possibilities, we sorted PA cells from three independent donors to purity and monitored their growth for 12 d. The number of PA cells remained constant with no new proliferation or cell death as determined by trypan blue exclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the PP cells continued to divide and ultimately transformed into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the PA cells had a significant decrease in the expression of the proliferation marker MKI67 (Fig S1C), as well as decreased BrdU incorporation, further confirming the growth arrest (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells exhibit a number of distinctive characteristics in addition to growth arrest that allow for their identification in vitro (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unscheduled oncogene activation, resulting in DNA damage, leads to the activation of the DDR and the downstream p53-p21 and Rb-p16 signal transduction cascades, which can mediate the senescence growth arrest (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PA cells had a significant increase in the expression of the DDR marker 53BP1 (Fig 1E) and the tumor suppressors, CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16) (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells are also characterized by altered chromatin structure known as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci, which are enriched for trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis demonstrated that the PA cells have a significant increase in H3K9me3 staining relative to the PP cells (Fig 1G), as well as an increase in overall heterochromatic DNA, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig 1H and Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV promotes and maintains B-cell proliferation through the concerted action of the EBV latency proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBNA2 and EBNA-LP induce the expression of progrowth genes (24), whereas EBNA3C inhibits the expression of tumor suppressors such as p16 (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that the growth arrest could be due to the reduced expression of one of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed that there was a modest increase in the expression of EBNA-LP and only a slight decrease in EBNA3C in the PA cells relative to the PP population (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with our previous observations demonstrating that PD13 cells have a greater ratio of EBNA-LP to EBNA3C, reflective of an earlier state of viral latency-driven outgrowth (5) and is also consistent with the work of others indicating that proliferating B cells after EBV infection are uniformly EBNA2-positive (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transcriptomic_Analysis_of_PA_vs_PP_Indicates_Heightened_p53_Pathway_and_Decreased_Cell_Cycle_and_DNA_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To delineate the effector pathways that mediate this EBV-induced growth arrest, we performed gene expression analysis using an Affymetrix Human U133 2.0 Plus microarray with three independent donors sorted into PA or PP populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting hybridization data were robust multi-array average (RMA)-normalized, and a total of 158 genes were expressed higher in the PA cells relative to PP cells (1.5-fold, P less_than 0.05), whereas the expression of 160 genes was reduced (1.5-fold, P less_than 0.05) (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PA cells were depleted for mRNAs in pathways involved in cell-cycle progression and displayed lower levels of transcriptional targets of E2F indicative of G1/S cell-cycle arrest (Fig 2A and Tables S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the PA cells had elevated levels of p53 pathway transcriptional targets (Fig 2 A and B and Tables S1S3), which is activated in response to cellular stress and regulates the expression of genes involved in processes such as cell-cycle progression and metabolism (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we confirmed that PA cells displayed activated p53 pathway including p53 phosphorylation on serine 15, accumulation of total p53, and induction of the downstream target p21 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, two notable p53 target genes, SESN1 and SESN3, were increased in the PA cells (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sestrins are an evolutionarily conserved group of genes induced in response to genotoxic stress and nutrient deprivation, leading to the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed increased expression of sestrins in the PA population by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblot analysis (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that EBV-induced hyperproliferation drives a subset of EBV-infected B cells into a state of metabolic or genotoxic stress that is then sensed by pathways that relay signals through the sestrins to induce growth arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PA_Cells_Exhibit_Reduced_Activation_of_the_mTORC1_Pathway_and_Inefficient_Autophagic_Flux  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sestrins inhibit mTOR signaling through activation of the energy sensing protein AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (29, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of mTOR signaling leads to a reduction in energy-consuming pathways, such as protein synthesis, and induces catabolic processes, such as autophagy (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, we found that the PA cells had increased activation of AMPK and reduced activation of mTOR pathway components relative to the PP cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A consequence of decreased mTORC1 activation is the induction of autophagy, which has been linked to the onset of cellular senescence (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assayed for markers of autophagy in our PA and PP cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an increase in the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II in the PA cells relative to the PP population (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed an increase in the presence of autophagosomes and phagolysosomes in the PA cells relative to both the PP cells and LCLs as detected by TEM (Fig 3B and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, there was an increase in the colocalization of LC3 with lysosomes in the PA relative to the PP cells (Fig 3C and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCLs exhibited a further reduction in colocalized LC3 with lysosomes relative to all populations (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC3-II is subject to autophagic degradation, and its accumulation in the PA cells could be the result of enhanced autophagy or reduced degradation due to a blockage in autophagic flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To differentiate between these possibilities, we treated sorted PA and PP cells with bafilomycin A, which inhibits lysosomal acidification and autophagic degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that there was only a modest increase in LC3-II staining in the PA cells after bafilomycin A treatment, in contrast to the PP cells, which exhibited a substantial increase in the levels of LC3-II (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, combined with the increased colocalization of LC3 with lysosomes and increased number of autophagolysosomes in the PA cells, indicates that the PA cells have a blockage in autophagic flux that prevents them from efficiently degrading cellular material to drive proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next wanted to elucidate the functional role of autophagy during hyperproliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated EBV-infected, CD19+ B cells for 48 h with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and observed a substantial decrease in proliferation at 8 d after infection, with treated cells displaying a CellTrace Violet profile reminiscent of cells at the time of treatment (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a substantial increase in apoptosis specifically in PA cells relative to both LCLs and the PP population (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin promoted autophagy as determined by an increase in LC3 staining and increased the percentage of arrested B cells (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data demonstrate that EBV-infected, hyperproliferating cells need a balanced level of autophagy to produce the biosynthetic intermediates necessary for cell growth and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Analysis_Reveals_Decreased_Mitochondrial_Respiration_in_PA_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autophagy is often triggered as a consequence of nutrient deprivation caused by a cellular metabolic imbalance (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore wanted to determine whether there was an altered metabolic state between the hyperproliferating cells (PA and PP) and other B-cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our gene expression analysis indicated that the PA cells had reduced levels of mRNAs in the canonical TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport pathways, as well as transcriptional targets of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), which activates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis confirmed that components of complex I of the electron transport chain and TCA cycle enzymes were decreased in the PA cells (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV infection induces B cells to undergo a period of rapid proliferation combined with a concomitant increase in biomass, processes that require both energy and biosynthetic intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased expression of enzymes important for mitochondrial respiration and the TCA cycle could lead to a metabolic imbalance promoting autophagy and senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To look for metabolic changes that occur in B cells before and after primary B-cell infection with EBV, we used the Seahorse XF, which simultaneously measures the basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of OXPHOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the PA cells are metabolically distinct from the other B-cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the PA cells are similar to PP cells in both the basal level and rate of glycolysis (ECAR) (Fig 4C and Fig S3A), they have a significantly lower OCR than PP cells, a level that is only slightly higher than that observed in resting B cells (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ratio of OCR to ECAR indicates that the PA cells are more heavily reliant on glycolysis to meet their energy needs (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that there was a substantial increase in both glycolysis and OXPHOS as cells transition from the hyperproliferating state to transformed LCLs (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower basal level of mitochondrial respiration combined with the lower expression of genes involved in the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain suggests that the PA cells may have a reduced capacity to undergo mitochondrial respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether there was a difference in the potential maximal level of respiration, we uncoupled the electron transport chain from OXPHOS using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which dissipates the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FCCP causes the OCR to increase to the maximum level supported by the electron transport chain and substrate supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there is a significant decrease in the maximum level of OCR in PA cells relative to the PP cells (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the basal level of OCR relative to the maximal level can be used to calculate the spare respiratory capacity of the cells, which is defined as the amount of additional energy that the cell can make in times of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is only a slight difference between the basal and maximal OCR in both the PA and PP cells (Fig 4 D and F), leading to a significantly lower spare respiratory capacity relative to resting B cells and LCLs (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the hyperproliferating cells have an overall reduced capacity to mitigate metabolic stress compared with LCLs and that the subset that arrest have a significant reduction in mitochondrial respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Stress_and_Genotoxic_Stress_Contribute_to_the_Suppression_of_Early_EBV-Induced_B-Cell_Proliferation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to functionally characterize this metabolic imbalance observed during early EBV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that early hyperproliferating cells were more sensitive to the nonhydrolyzable glucose analog, 2-DG, relative to LCLs (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was not due to increased glucose import or glucose transporter expression, but rather a reduction in glycolysis (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a corollary, we would also expect that increasing the ability of early proliferating cells to promote OXPHOS would stimulate early B-cell proliferation, while not affecting LCLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that supplementation of medium with a cell-permeable form of fumarate, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), significantly increased the number of cells that hyperproliferate, but had no effect on uninfected B cells or LCL proliferation (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that DMF treatment reduced the accumulation of LC3 with lysosomes (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously demonstrated that the DDR was a major suppressor of EBV-infected B-cell hyperproliferation and that inhibition of the Chk2 kinase would increase the number of proliferating B cells (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assayed whether our observed metabolic imbalance was distinct from the DDR by infecting cells in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor of Chk2 (Chk2i) either with or without DMF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a distinct difference in the proliferation kinetics between cells treated with DMF compared with Chk2i treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proproliferative phenotype induced by DMF manifested by day 4 after infection/treatment, and the increased number of proliferating cells remained constant over time (Fig 5 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, treatment with Chk2i resulted in a suppression of proliferation on day 4 (Fig 5E), followed by a strong increase in proliferation by day 6 after infection/treatment, which amplified over time (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of Chk2i and DMF further increased the number of proliferating cells at days 6 and 8 relative to single treatment alone (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that both metabolic imbalance and DNA replicative stress contribute to restricting EBV-mediated B-cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV is found ubiquitously within the adult population, but only leads to the development of malignancies in a small subset of the infected population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this discordance is largely due to the actions of an adaptive immune response, there is clearly an additional intrinsic response that suppresses the development of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also long been observed that the efficiency of EBV transformation is low, with only 110% of infected, primary human B cells becoming immortalized, further pointing to an innate barrier to transformation (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously demonstrated that EBV infection drives human B cells into a transient period of hyperproliferation, which induces a DDR, leading to a G1/S-phase growth arrest (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to characterize this population further to gain an understanding of the host cell factors that mitigate transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed a double-stain assay that allows us to identify and isolate the population of cells that undergo this early, rapid wave of proliferation and then arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Senescence allows the host cell to inhibit the aberrant proliferation induced through the expression of viral latent oncoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear, however, that EBV has evolved mechanisms to bypass this growth arrest to allow for transformation (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viral latency protein EBNA3C is essential for transformation because cells infected with EBV lacking this gene undergo a cell-cycle arrest due to the up-regulation of p16 (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need for EBNA3C is ablated in B cells that naturally lack functional p16 (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells infected with the EBNA3C-deficient virus do undergo the robust burst of proliferation and divide normally for the first week, albeit with a significant increase in markers of the DDR (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we only observed a modest decrease in the expression of EBNA3C in our PA cells relative to the PP population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this finding points to the need for additional latency genes to bypass the growth arrest, it is clear that EBNA3C plays a critical role in allowing EBV-infected cells to avoid OIS through its suppression of p16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autophagy has both beneficial and deleterious consequences during viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many viruses, including EBV, manipulate autophagy to complete lytic replication (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, autophagy has the potential to provide the metabolic intermediates needed to fuel the rapid proliferation necessary for the establishment of EBV latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, autophagy has generally been viewed as a threat to many viruses because it can result in the degradation of viral proteins and leads to the onset of OIS (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, many viruses have evolved elegant mechanisms of subverting autophagy (12, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, very little was known about the role of autophagy during EBV latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the basal level of autophagy is increased in hyperproliferating cells relative to LCLs and that the inhibition of autophagy early during infection suppresses growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the arrested cells had a reduced level of autophagic flux that could act as a barrier to the production of the biosynthetic intermediates necessary for proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transient period of hyperproliferation requires a substantial increase in nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids for DNA replication and cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These needs can be met through a combination of metabolic reprogramming and an increase in the basal level of autophagy (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that an inability to meet the metabolic demands of hyperproliferation could induce the EBV-infected B cells to undergo senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the PA cells have a reduced ability to undergo OXPHOS and that complementing this defect with a soluble TCA intermediate increases the number of cells that hyperproliferate early after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the reduced ability to undergo mitochondrial metabolism points to the cause rather than a consequence of OIS, because senescent cells typically favor the more efficient OXPHOS over glycolysis (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the transition from early hyperproliferation to transformation, EBV strongly up-regulates glycolysis and OXPHOS and also suppresses autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMP1 is an EBV latency protein that has been linked to the regulation of glycolysis and autophagy in LCLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMP1 can induce autophagy through the unfolded protein response as a way of regulating its own expression (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, LMP1 reduces autophagy in LCLs by up-regulating glucose import via NF-B signaling (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, LMP1 has been shown to up-regulate glycolysis in NPC cells (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we found that LCLs have increased expression of GLUT1 as well as increased glucose uptake relative to the hyperproliferating cells, which we have previously shown to express much lower levels of LMP1 (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the strong increase in glycolysis and suppression of autophagy that we observed in LCLs relative to the hyperproliferating cells is directly linked to the delayed expression of LMP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study characterizes the intrinsic pathways that contribute to the arrest of B cells early after EBV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid cellular proliferation, as is seen after EBV infection, leads to replicative stress such as stalled or collapsed replication forks (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, proliferating cells need to increase the production of biosynthetic intermediates such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids to promote cell growth and proliferation (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An insufficient supply of nucleotides can contribute to the generation of stalled replication forks, linking replicative stress to metabolic stress (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV-infected cells meet these metabolic demands through an increase in both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells that arrest early after infection have a reduced capacity to undergo OXPHOS, which would lead to a reduction in the intermediates required for faithful DNA replication as well as cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the combination of genotoxic and metabolic stress activates the p53 tumor suppressor, resulting in sestrin/AMPK-mediated permanent growth arrest of early infected cells, severely limiting EBV-driven B-cell immortalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Additional antibodies used within this study are shown in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Double_Staining_Protocol_to_Capture_Early_Proliferating_and_Arresting_B_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PBMCs were isolated from a buffy coat and stained with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C34557) followed by infection with EBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were grown in R15 medium for 4 d before staining with CFSE (Sigma, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21888).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were resuspended in fresh R15 medium, and proliferation was monitored as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Proliferation_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PBMCs were EBV-infected and stained with CellTrace Violet and CFSE as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation was monitored in CD19+ B cells by the dilution of the CellTrace Violet stain at day 8 after infection on a BD FACS Canto II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percent arrested population was determined by calculating the percentage of cells that diluted the CellTrace Violet stain but did not dilute the CFSE stain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed by using FlowJo software (Version 10.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Sorting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD19+ B cells were sorted for the PA and PP populations based on the CellTrace Violet and CFSE profile by using either a Beckman Coulter Astrios or Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP sorter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lysotracker  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One million PBMCs or LCLs were stained with 50 nM Lysotracker Deep Red (Molecular Probes, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L12492) for 2 h at 37 °C in R15 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stain was washed out with PBS, and the data were collected on a BD FACS Canto II or Imagestream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imagestream  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CFSE and CellTrace Violet labeled and EBV-infected PBMCs or LCLs were stained with Lysotracker as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  554714) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were blocked in Perm/Wash buffer containing 5% (vol/vol) goat serum for a minimum of 60 min followed by incubation with the LC3 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A11036) for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired by using an ImageStream multispectral imaging flow cytometer (Amnis Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed by using IDEAS software (Version 3.0; Amnis Corporation) as described (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single cells were first gated by size and CellTrace Violet staining to identify the proliferating population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proliferating cells were then further subdivided based on CFSE staining as described in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For colocalization studies, the PA and PP subsets were then plotted for log intensities of LC3 and Lysotracker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCLs were not stained with proliferation dyes but were analyzed in an identical fashion in all other respects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells that stained high for both markers were further analyzed for colocalization by looking for cells with a high Bright Detail Similarity (BDS) score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDS calculates the degree of overlapping pixels taken from different channels of fluorescence imagery (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BDS is the log-transformed Pearsons correlation coefficient that is nonmean normalized and is applied to the image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 10,000 cells were used for each analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were pelleted, resuspended in 25 L of PBS, spread on a microscope slide, and dried at 37 °C for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, washed in PBS, permeablized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then blocked in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 containing 5% (vol/vol) normal goat serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibody incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A11034) for 2 h. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1200) containing DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All IF slides were visualized by using Zeiss 780 upright confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above IF method was modified for visualization of GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of GLUT1 IF, the cells were not permeabilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were washed one time with PBS before being pelleted and frozen at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellets were resuspended in LDS Sample Buffer (NuPAGE, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NP0008) containing 1 mM DTT, NaF, sodium pyrophosphate, sodium orthovanadate, beta-glycerophophate, sodium molybdate, and complete protease inhibitors without EDTA and incubated on ice for 30 min before sonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23225) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were separated on a 412% Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, NP no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0322) run in Mops-SDS running buffer (NuPAGE, NP no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0001) followed by transfer to PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C before washing and staining with a secondary anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A0545).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification was performed by using Gene Tools software with normalization to -actin after imaging using the G-box gel imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation_and_qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74106) and reverse-transcribed by using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4368814) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative mRNA abundance was measured by using a SYBR green-based real time PCR assay with 5 ng of cDNA per reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All primers were used at a concentration of 1 µM per reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR was carried out by using the Step One Plus Real Time PCR light-cycler (Applied Biosytems), and data were analyzed by using the supplied Step One software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All expression levels were first normalized to SETDB1 as a control and then to PPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, with the exception of SETDB1, which was purchased from IDT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers used in this study are shown in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microarray_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total mRNA was isolated from sorted PA and PP cells by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA was processed by using an Ambion MessageAmp Premier Package (Life Technologies, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AM1792) and hybridized to a Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Chip (Affymetrix, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  900466) by the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology Microarray Core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant CEL files were RMA-normalized (Partek), and the data were analyzed with GenePattern (53) and GSEA (Version 2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
B cells were pelleted and washed in serum-free RPMI medium, and 2% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde was overlaid onto the undisturbed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were scraped into 1- to 1.5-mm piles on parafilm and encased in 1% molten agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agar-embedded pellets were washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and further fixed and stained in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 30 min by microwave processing or 12 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and infiltrated with EmBed 812 epoxy resin using a 50:50 mixture of 100% acetone for 1 h and two changes of 100% resin for 1 h each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After baking at 60 °C for 48 h, ultrathin sections were cut on a diamond knife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were poststained with 2% (vol/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate, washed in water, stained with 1% aqueous lead citrate, and washed again in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were viewed in an FEI CM 12 electron microscope, and micrographs were recorded on an AMT 2.6K digital camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolic_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glycolysis and glucose uptake assays by using 3H-glucose or 3H-2-deoxyglucose have been described (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All values were normalized to cell number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCR and ECAR were measured with an XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) as described (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspension cells were attached to culture plates by using Cell-Tak (BD Bioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCR and ECAR were measured in unbuffered DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10 mM d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM l-glutamine, as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCR and ECAR values were normalized to cell number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For certain experiments, OCR was measured over time after injection of oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone, and antimycin A. Maximal OCR is defined as the OCR value after FCCP injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spare respiratory capacity is defined as the difference between basal OCR and OCR after FCCP injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Glucose_Uptake  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were starved in glucose-free medium for 1 h before the addition of 25 µM 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) (Thermo, N13195) for 5120 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry and fit to linear regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the line was defined as the rate of glucose uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
