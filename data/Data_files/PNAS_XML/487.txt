Siderophore vaccine conjugates protect against uropathogenic Escherichia coli urinary tract infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are primarily caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), and 1 in 40 women experience chronic UTIs during their lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibiotic courses required to treat infections promote antibiotic resistance, and current vaccine options offer limited protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have pioneered a strategy using small iron-chelating compounds called siderophores as vaccine antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These siderophores are not produced by commensal bacteria and are required for UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siderophore vaccines reported here are easy to formulate and reduce bacterial burdens in a murine model of UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This report highlights the untapped resource of bacteria-specific small molecules as potential vaccine antigens and provides a proof of principle for incorporating these compounds into multicomponent vaccines for the prevention of bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas most infections are isolated cases, 1 in 40 women experience recurrent UTIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rise in antibiotic resistance has complicated the management of chronic UTIs and necessitates new preventative strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, no UTI vaccines are approved for use in the United States, and the development of a highly effective vaccine remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have pursued a strategy for eliciting protective immunity by vaccinating with small molecules required for pathogenesis, rather than proteins or peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small iron-chelating molecules called siderophores were selected as antigens to vaccinate against UTI for this vaccine strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathogen-associated stealth siderophores evade host immune defenses and enhance bacterial virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous animal studies revealed that vaccination with siderophore receptor proteins protects against UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The poor solubility of these integral outer-membrane proteins in aqueous solutions limits their practical utility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because their cognate siderophores are water soluble, we hypothesized that these bacterial-derived small molecules are prime vaccine candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we immunized mice with siderophores conjugated to an immunogenic carrier protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siderophoreprotein conjugates elicited an adaptive immune response that targeted bacterial stealth siderophores and protected against UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study has identified additional antigens suitable for a multicomponent UTI vaccine and highlights the potential use of bacterial-derived small molecules as antigens in vaccine therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By virtue of the confirmed importance of Ybt and Aer in uropathogenesis (3337), the proven efficacy of their receptors in experimental vaccines (20, 42), their increased prevalence among pathogenic E. coli (39), and amenable biochemical features, we hypothesized that Ybt and Aer could represent valid vaccine candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the siderophores are small (less_than564 Da) and unlikely to be immunogenic, Ybt and Aer were conjugated to cationized BSA (cBSA), an immunogenic carrier protein that has aminoethyl-capped carboxylic acids (4446).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive surface charge of cBSA increases vaccine binding to immune cells, and the aminoethyl modifications improve the coupling reaction by both eliminating carboxylic acids and providing additional primary amines on the carrier protein (4446).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Ybt and Aer have carboxylic acid moieties; thus, standard amide coupling conditions were used to prepare the cBSAsiderophore conjugates using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as the coupling reagent (SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cBSA incubated with EDC in the absence of siderophore was used as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry on trypsin-digested cBSAsiderophore conjugates confirmed linkage of the siderophores to cBSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cBSAAer conjugate, peptide fragment ions supporting the linkage of Aer to Lys266, aminoethyl-Asp474, and aminoethyl-Glu267 were detected (SI Appendix, Fig S2 AC and Tables S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cBSAYbt, peptide ions supporting the linkage of Ybt to aminoethyl-Asp272 and Lys437 were detected (SI Appendix, Fig S2D and Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data confirm at least two conjugation sites on cBSA for each siderophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the efficacy of vaccination with the stealth siderophore conjugates, mice were immunized intranasally with 10 g of vaccine conjugate prepared in 20 L of PBS (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three vaccine groups were examined along with a cBSA control, including cBSAYbt, cBSAAer, or a 1:1 mixture of cBSAYbt:cBSAAer, which was composed of 5 g of each conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports have shown that intranasal vaccination provides the most consistent protection in murine UTI vaccine studies (20, 42, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, mice were boosted intranasally with 20 L of PBS containing 2.5 g of vaccine conjugate 7 and 14 d postimmunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UPEC strain HM69, a strain recently isolated from a patient with uncomplicated cystitis, was selected for challenge because it encodes Ent, Ybt, and Aer (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 21 postimmunization, mice were transurethrally inoculated with 108 colony-forming units (cfus) of HM69, and after 48 h, the bacterial burdens in the urinary tract were quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vaccination with cBSAYbt reduced bacterial burden by 12-fold in the urine (P = 0.04) and 10-fold in the kidneys (P = 0.01), whereas cBSAAer reduced bacterial burden by 19-fold (P = 0.02) in the urine (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coimmunization with 1:1 cBSAYbt:Aer also decreased bacterial burdens in the urine by 14-fold (P = 0.3) and, most dramatically, reduced bacterial burden in the kidneys by 126-fold (P = 0.002) (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data demonstrate that the siderophoreprotein conjugates significantly reduce the bacterial burden in experimental UTI, particularly dissemination to the kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of sacrifice, a subset of the kidneys and bladders from infected mice were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-micrometer histologic sections were randomized and blindly scored for neutrophilic inflammation by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores were semiquantitative and ranged from 0 (no inflammation) to 3 (severe inflammation) (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccination with cBSAYbt, cBSAAer, and 1:1 cBSAYbt:cBSAAer significantly reduced pyelonephritis and overall inflammation scores (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain whether the vaccine specifically targets Ybt and Aer, three isogenic mutants were generated; E. coli HM69 ybtS::cam (ybtS) and iucA::kan (iucA) have the Ybt and Aer biosynthetic machinery disrupted, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, both biosynthetic operons were disrupted in a ybtSiucA double mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that if the vaccines specifically target Ybt or Aer during infection, then infection with each siderophore biosynthesis mutant would result in loss of protection by the corresponding vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were vaccinated with either cBSA or cBSAYbt (SI Appendix, Fig S1C) and then transurethrally challenged with ybtS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, there were no significant differences in the bacterial burdens of ybtS between cBSA- and cBSAYbt-vaccinated mice (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar experiments were conducted by vaccinating mice with cBSAAer and then challenging with iucA, as well as by covaccinating with 1:1 cBSAYbt:cBSAAer and then challenging with ybtSiucA (Fig 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all instances, no significant differences were identified between the vaccinated groups and the cBSA control mice (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S4), indicating that the vaccines elicit an immune response specifically targeting Ybt and Aer during UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unexpected differences in kidney colonization for iucA and ybtSiucA mutants (Fig 2 B and C) compared with the cBSAAer- and 1:1 cBSAYbt:cBSAAer-vaccinated and infected with WT HM69 (Fig 1C) could be due to disparities between the effects of genetically disrupting intracellular siderophore biosynthesis and immunologically targeting extracellular siderophore activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of iucA (Fig 2B) and cBSAAer (Fig 1C), it is possible that the immune response does not inactivate Aer-mediated iron acquisition as well as genetically disrupting Aer biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in the case of ybtSiucA (Fig 2C) and 1:1 cBSAYbt:cBSAAer (Fig 1C), ybtSiucA may colonize the kidneys better than WT in 1:1 cBSAYbt:cBSAAer-vaccinated mice because of increased virulence or Ent production in ybtSiucA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have shown that disrupting siderophore biosynthesis impacts central metabolism, which could affect the elaboration of other virulence factors and ultimately pathogenesis (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, elevated Ent levels have been detected in bacterial strains with mutations in the Aer and Ybt pathways, which could improve pathogenesis (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated Ent levels in ybtSiucA may also explain the surprising increase in kidney colonization of cBSA-vaccinated mice infected with ybtSiucA compared with iucA (Fig 2 B and C), as the iucA and ybtSiucA mutants have been rigorously confirmed to be genetically correct and found to grow similarly in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these confounding factors presented by the use of isogenic siderophore biosynthesis mutants, the data presented in Fig 2 reveal that the bacteria must encode the targeted siderophore to be susceptible to the corresponding cBSAsiderophore vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes that the protection elicited by vaccination with Ybt and Aer is target-specific, suggestive of an adaptive immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the molecular masses of Ybt and Aer are relatively small (481 Da and 564 Da, respectively), we hypothesized that Ybt and Aer are unable to stimulate an immune response alone and are acting as haptens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the immunogenicity of Ybt and Aer, mice were vaccinated with Ybt, Aer, or a 1:1 mixture of Ybt:Aer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the theoretical maximum amount of siderophores administered in the cBSAconjugate vaccine, mice were immunized with 0.75 g of siderophore and boosted with 0.19 g of siderophore on days 7 and 14 postimmunization (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 21 postimmunization, mice were challenged with 108 cfu of HM69 and bacterial burdens were quantified 48 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without a carrier protein, immunization with Ybt and Aer no longer protected against UTI (Fig 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig S6A), revealing that Ybt and Aer require cBSA to elicit a protective immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To fully address whether the siderophores are acting as haptens, we next vaccinated the mice with cBSA unconjugated to Ybt, Aer, or a 1:1 mixture of Ybt:Aer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that if the siderophores are acting as haptens, then protection will be lost when the mice are vaccinated with cBSA and unconjugated siderophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were immunized with 0.75 g of siderophore plus 10 g of cBSA on day 0 and boosted with 0.19 g of siderophore plus 2.5 g of cBSA on days 7 and 14 postimmunization (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 21 postimmunization, mice were transurethrally inoculated with 108 cfu of HM69, and after 48 h, the bacterial burdens in the urinary tract were quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a small pilot experiment, bacterial burdens were diminished in the urine and kidneys (Fig 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig S6B) following the same trend as the conjugated vaccine (Fig 1), indicating that the siderophores are not acting as haptens and do not require conjugation to cBSA to protect against pyelonephritis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Ybt and Aer require cBSA as an immunogen to elicit a protective immune response and bacterial production of the targeted siderophore, we hypothesized that protection is mediated by the adaptive immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the highly cationic surface charge of cBSA interferes with analysis by ELISA (51), we examined this notion using our murine model of ascending UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were immunized once with 10 g of cBSA, cBSAYbt, cBSAAer, or a 1:1 mixture of cBSAYbt:cBSAAer and then challenged transurethrally with E. coli HM69 7 d postimmunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenging shortly after immunization precludes the development of an effective adaptive immune response (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, the bacterial burdens in the urinary tract were enumerated, and as predicted, no protection was observed (Fig 3 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig S6C), suggesting that protection is mediated by an adaptive immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings provide a significant conceptual advance in which bacterial-derived small molecules have been successfully formulated in a vaccine regimen that reduces both inflammation and the bacterial burden in the kidneys and urine in a murine model of UTI (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To protect against pyelonephritis, the bacteria used for challenge must encode the targeted stealth siderophores (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siderophores do not need to be conjugated to the immunogen to elicit protection, indicating that despite their small molecular weights (481 Da and 564 Da), Ybt and Aer are large enough to stimulate a protective immune response (Fig 3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, successful vaccination with siderophores requires repeated coadministration with the immunogen cBSA over the course of 3 wk (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that the cBSAsiderophore conjugates elicit an adaptive immune response that specifically targets pathogens encoding stealth siderophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that Aer and Ybt are suitable for inclusion in multicomponent vaccines due to their amenable biochemical features, specificity for pathogenic bacteria compared with commensal organisms, and synergistic protection in the kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have been unable to confirm, however, that the protective immune response is antibody-mediated, as we do not detect siderophore-specific antibodies by direct or sandwich ELISAs or ELISpot using the cBSA-conjugated siderophores as capture antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cBSA interferes with ELISAs (51) and the siderophores are not suited for adsorption to ELISA plates, we have also probed for anti-siderophore antibodies by direct and sandwich ELISAs with Ybt and Aer conjugated to cholera toxin or BSA; neither revealed siderophore-specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that these carrier proteins are poorly haptenized or antisiderophore antibodies do not recognize the siderophores in the context of these carrier proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to identify siderophore-specific antibodies, however the data presented here suggest that the vaccine is specific (Fig 2) and acts in a time frame consistent with adaptive immunity (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that siderophore-specific antibodies are either absent or present and effective but below the limit of detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the utility of small molecules formulated for use as vaccine antigens is intriguing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous publications describing the use of siderophores in vaccines against human pathogens primarily focus on eliciting an antibody response and either did not observe protection against infection or did not use an animal model to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first report describing the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against a siderophore targeted pseudobactin, the siderophore of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas putida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These MAbs were primarily used for studying iron acquisition in the plant pathogen and were not developed for therapeutic applications (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly thereafter, another group elicited mouse MAbs against ferric Aer (FeAer) and demonstrated that these antibodies restricted E. coli growth in calf serum (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These FeAer-specific MAbs were useful for detecting Aer-producing Enterobacteriaceae but did not provide protection in three tested models of infection (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lethal i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infection model with E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was used to assess the protection provided upon either passive or active immunization of Swiss mice (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, vaccination did not significantly improve the survival of the mice despite the confirmed presence of anti-FeAer antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same vaccine preparation was also used to assess protection in a passive transovarian immunization chick model challenged with E. coli, and despite the presence of Aer-specific antibodies, the chicks succumbed to infection similar to the unvaccinated controls (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last published study regarding siderophore vaccine preparation successfully elicited vibriobactin-specific antibodies in mice, but the protective effects of these antibodies were never reported (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building upon these studies, we have shown that vaccination with siderophores is protective in a mouse model of ascending UTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of the vaccine strategy described here compared with previous publications using siderophore vaccines may be due to the intranasal immunization route and an animal model that better recapitulates natural infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been documented that vaccination with outer-membrane proteins up-regulated during iron limitation protects against E. coli infections (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, our laboratory investigated the immunoprotective properties of the outer-membrane protein receptors for Ybt and Aer: namely, FyuA and IutA, respectively (20, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with FyuA resulted in a 1.5 log decrease in the bacterial burden in the kidneys (urine counts were not reported), and immunization with IutA reduced bacterial burden in the urine, bladders, and kidneys by 1.3, 1.0, and 0.9 logs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies reported here recapitulate these findings with the exception of the protection observed in the bladder with the IutA vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our extensive experience with developing UTI vaccines, we have found that protection in the bladder is more difficult to achieve in our murine model than protection in the kidneys, likely due to low levels of antigen-specific antibody detected in the bladder (20, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to technical issues implicit in a murine model of UTI or the lower abundance of antibodies in the urine compared with the sera (20, 5860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the lack of protection in the bladder in response to targeting Aer-mediated iron acquisition could be due to the different immune response elicited by vaccination with the low-molecular mass siderophores compared with the proteinaceous receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Building upon these prior studies, we now show that vaccination with siderophores protects against pyelonephritis in a mouse model of ascending UTI and circumvents the biochemical challenges associated with using outer-membrane proteins as antigens (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Aer and Ybt may be suitable for a multicomponent vaccine due to their amenable biochemical features, specificity for pathogenic bacteria over commensal organisms, and synergistic protection in the kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The practical utility of cBSA as an immunogen in human vaccines remains to be evaluated in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining Aer and Ybt with other protective antigens such as adhesins, toxins, and other iron receptors may prove to be a successful vaccination strategy (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding Aer and Ybt to such multicomponent vaccine preparations should prove simple due to their amenable biochemical properties and their ability to elicit protection without being conjugated to a carrier protein (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, highly evolved iron acquisition strategies, including Aer and Ybt, are critical virulence factors for ExPEC and other pathogenic species within the Enterobacteriaceae (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by defining the protective efficacy of two stealth siderophores prevalent among pathogenic E. coli (39), we have determined that Ybt and Aer are valuable antigens that have not heretofore been included in any UTI vaccines and, more generally, exemplify the untapped resource of bacteria-specific small molecules as potential vaccine antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Vaccination_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All mouse studies were conducted in accordance with protocol 00005052 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Michigan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protocol is in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane use and care of laboratory animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vaccination was performed as previously described (SI Appendix, Fig S1C) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All vaccine doses were prepared in advance from 2 mg/mL stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at 80 °C until the time of vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 67-wk-old CBA/J mice were intranasally immunized with 20 L of vaccine conjugate (10 L/nare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 0, the mice received 10 g of the appropriate vaccine conjugate (0.5 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On days 7 and 14, mice were boosted with 2.5 g of vaccine conjugate (0.125 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were challenged, as described below, on day 21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One exception to this protocol was for vaccinations that used unconjugated siderophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When PBS pH 7.4 or unconjugated cBSA was used as controls, mice were immunized with 0.75 g siderophore (37.5 µg/mL in PBS pH 7.4) and boosted with 0.19 g of siderophore (9.4 µg/mL in PBS pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amounts of siderophores used were calculated based on the maximum amount of siderophore the mice could potentially receive from the cBSAvaccine conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second exception to the above protocol was when mice were transurethrally challenged 1 wk after the initial immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No boosters were given to assess the requirement for adaptive responses to elicit protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Murine_Model_of_Ascending_UTI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previously described murine model of ascending UTI was used to assess vaccine efficacy (20, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless noted otherwise, female CBA/J mice were transurethrally challenged with 50 L of 4 × 109 cfu/mL of E. coli HM69 resuspended in PBS, resulting in an inoculum of 108 cfu per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculum was delivered using a sterile 0.28-mm inner-diameter polyethylene catheter connected to an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus) over a period of 20 s. Infection progressed for 48 h, after which bacterial burdens in urine as well as bladder and kidney homogenates were enumerated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were homogenized in PBS with a GLH homogenizer (Omni International) and plated on LB agar using an Autoplate 4000 spiral plater (Spiral Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A QCount automated plate counter (Spiral Biotech) was used to enumerate colony counts on the plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unpaired, nonparametric analysis was performed using the MannWhitney test calculated in GraphPad Prism 6.01 for Windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were considered significant if the P value was less than or equal to 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
