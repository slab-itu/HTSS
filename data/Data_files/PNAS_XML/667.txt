Discovery of scmR as a global regulator of secondary metabolism and virulence in Burkholderia thailandensis E264  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silent biosynthetic gene clusters represent fertile grounds for the discovery of new small molecules, and a number of approaches have been developed for activating them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their regulation, however, has received far less attention, especially in Gram-negative bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, which we name scmR, acts as a gatekeeper of secondary metabolism and virulence in the model organism Burkholderia thailandensis E264.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, genetic, chemical, and omics-based approaches unveil ScmR as a master regulator that interacts with pathway-specific transcriptional regulators to control, and primarily suppress, secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this gene is conserved in other Burkholderia species, our results suggest that scmR-mediated control of secondary metabolism and virulence may be common within this genus and the Pseudomallei-group pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacteria produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites that have been invaluable in the clinic and in research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These metabolites are synthesized by dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which assemble architecturally complex molecules from simple building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of BGCs in a given bacterium are not expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions, and our understanding of how they are silenced is in its infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have addressed this question in the Gram-negative model bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis E264 using genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and chemical approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that a previously unknown, quorum-sensing-controlled LysR-type transcriptional regulator, which we name ScmR (for secondary metabolite regulator), serves as a global gatekeeper of secondary metabolism and a repressor of numerous BGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptionally, we find that 13 of the 20 BGCs in B. thailandensis are significantly (threefold or more) up- or down-regulated in a scmR deletion mutant (scmR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolically, the scmR strain displays a hyperactive phenotype relative to wild type and overproduces a number of compound families by 18- to 210-fold, including the silent virulence factor malleilactone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the scmR mutant is hypervirulent both in vitro and in a Caenorhabditis elegans model in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from secondary metabolism, ScmR also represses biofilm formation and transcriptionally activates ATP synthesis and stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data suggest that ScmR is a pleiotropic regulator of secondary metabolism, virulence, biofilm formation, and other stationary phase processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A model for how the interplay of ScmR with pathway-specific transcriptional regulators coordinately silences virulence factor production is proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selected secondary metabolites produced by B. thailandensis E264.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds 111 and 21 were identified previously (see text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds 1220 were elucidated in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_scmR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent RNA-seq studies by Greenberg and coworkers have allowed identification of a core set of genes that is QS-activated in the Pseudomallei group pathogens, which include B. thailandensis, B. pseudomallei, and B. mallei (19, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the importance of LTTRs in regulating secondary metabolite production in other Proteobacteria, we searched the RNA-seq datasets for transcriptional regulators that were common to all three strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one LTTR was found to be conserved among these strains and transcribed at sufficient levels in stationary phase, gene BTH_I1403 (in B. thailandensis E264) with orthologs BP1026B_I0582 and BMA2049 in B. pseudomallei Bp82 and B. mallei GB8, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this gene as scmR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its genomic context shows that it is preceded by a lux box, the sequence of which is akin to those from other Proteobacteria (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears to be expressed from a polycistronic operon, along with its downstream gene, predicted to encode a lactate dehydrogenase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lux box upstream of scmR indicates that it is induced as a function of QS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, RNA-seq data by the Greenberg laboratory showed an approximately twofold activation of this gene in high- vs. low-cell density cultures (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified this result using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig 2B), which revealed accumulation of scmR transcripts as a function of cell density and up to a 70-fold induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no activation of scmR occurred in a triple-btaI deletion strain, in which all three QS signal synthases have been removed (SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S1) (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results show that scmR is a QS-activated transcriptional regulator that is conserved in the Pseudomallei group pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolomic_Analysis_of_scmR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine a possible role for scmR in the transcriptional control of BGCs in B. thailandensis, we created an unmarked scmR deletion mutant (scmR; SI Appendix, Table S1) and compared its secondary metabolic profile with that of the parental WT strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed major induction of a number of metabolites in scmR (Fig 3A)notably, burkholdac, malleilactone, thailandamide, and acybolins (11) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in the mutant strain malleilactone A, burkholdac A, thailandamide A, and acybolin A were overproduced 210-, 61-, 54-, and 18-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous new compounds appeared to be induced as well as a result of the deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the role of scmR in this remarkable up-regulation, complementation studies were carried out, in which a plasmid-encoded scmR was expressed in the scmR mutant from a rhamnose-inducible promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ScmR expression led to a major down-regulation of secondary metabolite synthesis and thus rescued the mutant phenotype (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, expression of plasmid-encoded scmR returned the abundant production of malleilactone and burkholdac to WT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, scmR greatly represses the biosynthesis of a number of known and unidentified metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We wished to gain further insights into the scmR-regulated metabolome of B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we generated a mass spectral network of the secondary metabolomes of the WT and scmR strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this method, recently pioneered by Dorrestein and coworkers, untargeted MS/MS data are used to generate a global network of all secreted small molecules (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each node within the network represents a distinct metabolite, and the lines connecting them are indicators of structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the MS/MS network shown, the red, blue, and green nodes correspond to molecules detected only in scmR cultures, only in WT cultures, or under both conditions, respectively (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network revealed 13 molecular families that are only observed in the scmR deletion mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four families are unique to the WT, and the remainder contain molecules that are detected under both growth conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This initial analysis is consistent with an important role for scmR in the regulation of BGCs in B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It further suggests that some BGCs are repressed by scmR (red compound clusters, Fig 4A), whereas others are activated (blue clusters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the available high-resolution (HR) MS and HR-MS/MS data, we were able to assign compounds to several molecular families (shaded in gray, Fig 4A), including burkholdac, malleilactone, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs), thailandamide, bactobolin, and acybolin (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were intrigued by the large molecular family of burkholdac, which appeared to contain numerous high-molecular-weight analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these were isolated and structurally elucidated using NMR and HR-MS, leading to burkholdac C (12) and D (13), which are thiomethyl-modified derivatives of burkholdac A (8) and B (9), respectively (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S10 and Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified bis-burkholdacs A, B, and C, which were assigned by HR-MS, HR-MS/MS, and chemical degradation analysis (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 and S12 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These derivatives consist of two burkholdac monomersburkholdacs A-A (14), A-B (15), or B-B (16)linked through two intermolecular disulfide bonds (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of the disulfide bonds with a thiol-containing reducing agent gave the anticipated monomeric products, as verified by HR-HPLC-MS, consistent with their structural assignments (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the exact position of disulfide bond formation was not identified in our studies, although the degradation analysis of 16 suggests that both combinations of intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aside from identifying new analogs of known compounds, the differential metabolomic analysis also provided an opportunity to discover new metabolites in the scmR strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found a family of aromatic compounds that were produced only in the scmR strain (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation of four variants followed by structural elucidation via NMR yielded the N-acylated anthranilic acids shown (1720; Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural assignments were consistent with HR-MS and tandem HR-MS studies (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13S18 and Tables S2 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-acylated anthranilic acids are previously undescribed biological molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derivative 17 has been prepared synthetically and assessed for its bioactivity (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies revealed significant PCAF lysine acetyltransferase inhibition, a transcriptional activator associated with p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also showed anticancer activities for compound 17, with IC50 values between 31 and 87 M against eight cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bioactivity of derivatives 1820 have not yet been characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two sources can be envisioned for compounds 1720.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthranilic acid is a common metabolite in bacteria and a precursor for secondary metabolites, including HAQs (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could be adorned with variable acyl groups by an acyl transferase to give metabolites 1720.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it has been shown that bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter express hod, a dioxygenase that can degrade the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone, to acylated anthranilic acids (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that B. thailandensis does not encode a hod with significant homology to that of Arthrobacter, we prefer the former explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, a HAQ degradation pathway for the production of 1720 cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the data above show that scmR controls a vast secondary metabolome, repressing the production of many compounds, while activating that of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transcriptomic_Analysis_of_scmR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next aimed to underpin the metabolomic studies above with a global transcriptomic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three biological replicates of each WT and scmR were cultured to early stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 2230 million reads were obtained per replicate, each read with an average length of 75 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the chosen time point, 41% of the genome was found to be expressed in WT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the two sample sets, good reproducibility was observed with a low coefficient of variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analyzed by determining differential gene expression levels for all observed transcripts that were mapped onto the sequenced B. thailandensis E264 genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT samples, the scmR mRNA was the most abundant transcriptional regulator among all of the annotated LTTRs, consistent with its important role during stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The top-40 up-regulated genes and top-70 down-regulated genes in scmR (relative to WT) are listed in Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the metabolomic data, we observed a major induction of burkholdac, malleilactone, and bactobolin biosynthetic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the 11 genes that were up-regulated most are all part of the burkholdac BGC; they were induced 50- to 135-fold relative to WT (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AraC-type transcriptional regulator, which has been shown to be a bhc pathway-specific positive regulator, was induced 19-fold in scmR (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining groups of genes from Table 1 include the malleilactone and bactobolin gene clusters, which are induced 8- to 18-fold and 7- to 13-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this list (Table 1), only eight genes are not directly involved in secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the significant repression of the bhc, mal, and bta BGCs by scmR, as well as the induction observed in Fig 3A, we next examined the effect of the regulator on all BGCs in B. thailandensis (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our sequencing data captured 20 of the 23 BGCs, and of these, 13 were significantly affected by scmR, being either up- or down-regulated threefold or more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten were up- or down-regulated by fourfold or more (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with the metabolomic data and again underscore the importance of scmR in the regulation of secondary metabolism in B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the down-regulated genes, those involved in the biosynthesis of an unknown nonribosomal peptide and of terphenyl (21) were affected the most, at 4- to 14-fold and 3- to 7-fold, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S6) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAQ biosynthesis was also down-regulated (approximately threefold), indicating that ScmR acts as a positive regulator for the hmq cluster, consistent with the metabolic data in the MS/MS network (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a number of stress response genes, subunits of ATP synthase, and various transcriptional regulators were also significantly affected (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that ScmR, in addition to controlling secondary metabolism, directly or indirectly activates stress response genes and ATP synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could speculate that WT cells cope with the energy demands of the stationary phase by limiting secondary metabolism and enhancing ATP synthesis, and that these are simultaneously driven by ScmR; further experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, the RNA-seq analysis shows that scmR controls expression of a vast and diverse regulon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regulon consists primarily of secondary metabolite BGCs, but also includes stress response, ATP synthase, various transcriptional regulators, and other genes, whose importance is not yet known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 328 genes are either up- or down-regulated fourfold or more, and 470 are affected threefold or more, indicating that this transcriptional regulator is important to the stationary phase lifestyle of B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_scmR_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malleilactone has been shown to be cytotoxic in a C. elegans model (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biosynthetic mutants that cannot generate malleilactone were found to exhibit significantly reduced virulence compared with the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the scmR strain, with its ability to overproduce malleilactone, would be hypervirulent to C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, C. elegans growth inhibition assays were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT worms were synchronized, grown to the L4 larval stage, and then transferred to an assay plate, where they were provided with either E. coli, WT B. thailandensis, or the scmR mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas WT B. thailandensis led to a slow decline in viability, the scmR mutant caused remarkably rapid death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After only a 20-min incubation with scmR, 90% of the C. elegans worms were killed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, 95% of the worms remained viable when treated with WT B. thailandensis for the same time span (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the transcriptomic and metabolomic studies above, secondary metabolite and virulence factor production are decidedly up-regulated in the scmR strain, leading to a hypervirulent phenotype in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biofilm_and_Morphological_Analysis_of_scmR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Proteobacteria, induction of some secondary metabolites is linked to the onset of biofilm formation (3033).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that scmR primarily represses secondary metabolite production, we wondered whether it had a similar effect on biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the crystal violet assay showed enhanced biofilm formation in scmR cells relative to the WT (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was corroborated by RNA-seq results, which showed induction of key biofilm formation genes in the deletion mutant (SI Appendix, Table S7) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, liquid cultures showed augmented pigmentation and pellicle formation in scmR (Fig 6C), and colonies grown on agar exhibited a corrugated, rugged cell morphology, in contrast to the smoother phenotype of WT B. thailandensis (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, scmR acts as a repressor of biofilm formation, virulence, and secondary metabolite production in stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interaction_of_scmR_with_Pathway-Specific_Transcriptional_Regulators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data above provide a snapshot of the metabolomic, transcriptomic, and morphological state of the scmR mutant, and we next began to examine the regulatory mechanisms by which this state is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the expression of the mal and bhc clusters, because they are most strongly repressed by ScmR (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, an AraC-type regulator has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator of burkholdac production (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the former, we previously showed that MalR, an orphan luxR-type pathway-specific regulator, is required for induction of the mal cluster using small molecules elicitors (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the interaction of scmR with these two transcriptional regulators, we created malR and araC mutants, as well as two double mutants, malRscmR and araCscmR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metabolic profiles monitoring burkholdac production are shown for WT, araC, scmR, and araCscmR strains (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WT produced minute amounts of the metabolite, whereas production was greatly enhanced in scmR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of any production in the araC and araCscmR strains indicated that the AraC-type regulator is required for induction of bhc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the scmR deletion induces the bhc cluster by acting through the AraC regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is also borne out in the transcriptomic data, which show an 19-fold up-regulation of the araC transcript in scmR relative to WT (Table 1) and suggest a model for scmR-mediated silencing of the bhc cluster (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A similar scenario was observed with the mal cluster (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little to no malleilactone was observed in WT, in contrast to a massive overproduction with scmR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual malR and malRscmR strains gave minimal amounts of malleilactone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data again show that ScmR acts through the MalR regulator to control malleilactone production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small amount of malleilactone observed in the double mutants suggests that other pathways, independent of malR and scmR, can lead to minor induction of the mal cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, malR expression was required for activation of mal, but its expression was not affected in the scmR mutant, as determined by RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest a different model for interaction between ScmR and MalR, compared with that of ScmR with AraC (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They further show that ScmR can interact with two distinct pathway-specific regulators to silence the bhc and mal BGCs by probably disparate mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that scmR expression is cell-density-dependent, we hypothesized that a QS-deficient mutant would exhibit enhanced secondary metabolite production in B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we compared the metabolic profile of a QS-deficient triple-btaI deletion mutant with that of WT (Fig 7 C and D) (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, and consistent with our hypothesis, the triple-btaI mutant turned out to be a hyperproducer of some secondary metabolites: It exhibited a drastic 100-fold overproduction of malleilactone, 3-fold overproduction of known burkholdacs, and induction of several cryptic burkholdac variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of btaI2 from a rhamnose-inducible plasmid in the QS-deficient mutant rescued this phenotype and resulted in silencing of the bhc and mal biosynthetic pathways (Fig 7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, overexpression of btaI2 led to lower levels of burkholdac A relative to WT (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, QS, via ScmR, silences numerous BGCs in stationary phase and limits the secondary metabolic output of B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The studies above show that the QS-deficient triple-btaI mutant and scmR have similar phenotypes as determined by malleilactone and burkholdac production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore this relationship further, we determined the levels of AHLs using quantitative HR-HPLC-MS. We found a drastic reduction in the biosynthesis of all three AHLs, C8-HSL (115-fold), 3-OH-C8-HSL (4-fold), and 3-OH-C10-HSL (114-fold) in scmR compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig S19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, scmR behaves like a QS-deficient strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the apparent discrepancy of enhanced btaI2 transcription, yet diminished AHL production in scmR, may be explained on grounds of reduced AHL precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AHLs are synthesized from S-adenosylmethionine, the production of which requires ATP, and fatty acid-conjugated acyl-carrier proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP levels are likely low in the scmR strain (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, biofilm construction is enhanced in the mutant (SI Appendix, Table S7), and this process requires fatty acids (37, 38), which may be siphoned away from AHL synthesis, again resulting in lower levels of AHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the AHL quantification studies further underline the role of QS in silencing biosynthetic genes and curbing secondary metabolism at high cell densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Model_for_Repression_of_mal_and_bhc_by_scmR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose the following working model, in which QS and ScmR coordinately silence mal, bhc, and other BGCs, and thus regulate secondary metabolism (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QS-regulated expression of scmR, via AHL signaling, leads to an abundance of ScmR in stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, ScmR serves as a repressor of the bhc, mal, bta, cap, tha, and other gene clusters, including the AHL synthase btaI2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that QS- and btaI2/R2-controlled induction of scmR followed by ScmR-mediated repression of btaI2 forms a negative feedback loop, by which scmR curbs the output of the bta cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ScmR also serves as a repressor of araC expression, as seen in the RNA-seq experiments, and thus silences the bhc cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the down-regulation of araC transcription by ScmR, one plausible model would entail binding of ScmR to the promoter region of araC, ParaC, and thus repression of this pathway-specific regulator, which limits or eliminates burkholdac biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ScmR likewise silences mal expression, but in this case, not by modulating malR transcription, because no changes in the malR transcript levels were observed in WT vs. scmR cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least two general models by which ScmR and MalR interact may be envisioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One would involve competition of ScmR with MalR for the mal promoter, with ScmR binding leading to silencing of the mal cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of competition among two transcriptional regulators for one binding site has been observed in other systems before (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, because MalR has been shown to be an orphan LuxR with an unknown ligand (35, 41), a small molecule coinducer, only present under conditions of lowly expressed scmR (or scmR), could also be invoked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are needed to test these ideas and to provide a molecular basis for the interaction of ScmR with pathway-specific regulators of secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 8 also shows additional targets of scmR-mediated control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from lowering the output of the mal, bhc, bta, cap, and tha BGCs, ScmR also represses biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, it serves as a transcriptional activator of HAQs (hmq cluster), terphenyl production, BGCs with as-of-yet unidentified products, ATP synthesis, and some stress response genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ScmR controls a large and diverse regulon centered on virulence and secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
B. thailandensis harbors an abundance of BGCs that are not expressed during normal laboratory growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How these gene clusters are silenced has remained unknown, as has the role of QS in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify and characterize a missing piece in the regulatory cascade of B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and chemical approaches show the transcriptional regulator ScmR to be an important and global gatekeeper of secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that ScmR has a significant (threefold or more) positive or negative regulatory effect on 13 of the 20 BGCs that we can monitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, it is involved in silencing production of the known virulence factor malleilactone (15) and the HDAC inhibitor burkholdac (17), as well as in limiting production of the potent antibiotic bactobolin (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, ScmR is also a key regulator and repressor of virulence factor production in B. thailandensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Broadly speaking, two pathways can be envisioned for activation of a silent biosynthetic pathway: one where a BGC, preceded by a weak promoter, needs to be positively regulated, or alternatively, a repressed BGC, where the repression needs to be lifted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulatory logic that emerges for B. thailandensis corresponds to the latterthat is, a scenario in which ScmR curbs secondary metabolism, especially the expression of mal and bhc, which would otherwise be highly expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the regulatory hierarchy that emerges involves a sequence of BtaRScmRAraC/MalR: BtaR promotes expression of scmR, the gene product of which interacts with pathway-specific regulators to silence or curb secondary metabolites from the mal, bhc, and bta clusters, as well as those of other BGCs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derepression via a scmR mutant results in massive overproduction of virulence factors and, consequently, a hypervirulent phenotype against C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, scmR regulates virulence both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aside from controlling secondary metabolite production, scmR also regulates other phenomena that mitigate the pressures of stationary phase growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it transcriptionally activates ATP synthesis and stress response genes, while repressing biofilm formation, possibly to facilitate the transition to a planktonic lifestyle, in which motile B. thailandensis cells can migrate to nutrient-rich environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of scmR along with lactate dehydrogenase can be rationalized on the same grounds (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High pH values ensue as a result of NH3 release, when B. thailandensis uses amino acids as the primary carbon source in stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have explained the QS-controlled production of the di-acid oxalate in B. thailandensis as a strategy to maintain or control pH under this condition (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reducing pyruvate to lactate and potentiating fermentative growth, lactate dehydrogenase can also contribute to lowering pH at high cell densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LTTRs that induce or repress secondary metabolite production have been found in other bacterial genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Streptomyces coelicolor contains an abundance of LTTRs and one of these, StgR, has been shown to limit production of actinorhodin and prodigiosin in the early growth phase via interaction with pathway-specific transcriptional regulators (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stationary phase cultures, when biosynthesis of these metabolites is activated, stgR expression was found to be down-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to see whether conditions that result in secondary metabolite induction in B. thailandensis (36) act through down-regulation of scmR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, LTTRs are better characterized in Gram-negative bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, the best-studied example is MvfR (4548), which regulates PQS production in P. aeruginosa and, like ScmR, is QS-activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike ScmR, however, MvfR positively regulates virulence factor production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTTRs have a coinducer binding domain, which allows their functions to be controlled by small molecules (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MvfR activity has been shown to be modulated by PQS (4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether ScmR is responsive to a coinducer, and, if so, the nature of such a coinducer, remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the examples of StgR, MvfR, and other related regulators, such as ShvR in B. cenocepacia (49), show that LTTRs can act as activators or repressors of secondary metabolite production and that diverse and complex regulatory pathways have evolved, which are mediated by LTTRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with other types of transcriptional regulators of secondary metabolism, such as DasR in Streptomyces spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (50, 51), these insights suggest that designing screens to find unknown or unsuspected regulatory proteins may provide an attractive strategy for both activating silent BGCs and, at the same time, identifying regulatory circuits that control them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interference with the function of MvfR results in lowered virulence by P. aeruginosa (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, MvfR has advanced to a target for the development of strategies to combat P. aeruginosa infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orthologs of scmR are also abundantly expressed in B. pseudomallei and B. mallei as a function of QS (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to examine the roles of scmR in virulence factor production in these strains and to explore whether interfering with its function can lead to effective therapies against Pseudomallei group pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
