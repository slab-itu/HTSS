Ancestral genetic diversity associated with the rapid spread of stress-tolerant coral symbionts in response to Holocene climate change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reef corals in the Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG) withstand exceptionally high salinity and regular summer temperatures of 35 °C that kill conspecifics elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These thermotolerant communities established themselves within only 6,000 y under the pressure of rapid climate change and can therefore inform how other coral reefs may respond to global warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One key to the thermotolerance of PAG corals is their symbiosis with Symbiodinium thermophilum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogeographic evidence indicates that this symbiont represents a stress-tolerant subpopulation of an ancestral taxonomic group with surprising genetic diversity that exists at barely detectable levels outside the PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the critical importance of present-day biodiversity for future adaptation to climate change for coral reefs and ecosystems in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral communities in the Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG) withstand unusually high salinity levels and regular summer temperature maxima of up to 35 °C that kill conspecifics elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the recent formation of the PAG and its subsequent shift to a hot climate, these corals have had only less_than6,000 y to adapt to these extreme conditions and can therefore inform on how coral reefs may respond to global warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One key to coral survival in the worlds warmest reefs are symbioses with a newly discovered alga, Symbiodinium thermophilum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, it is unknown whether this symbiont originated elsewhere or emerged from unexpectedly fast evolution catalyzed by the extreme environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyzing genetic diversity of symbiotic algae across  greater than 5,000 km of the PAG, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea coastline, we show that S. thermophilum is a member of a highly diverse, ancient group of symbionts cryptically distributed outside the PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that the adjustment to temperature extremes by PAG corals was facilitated by the positive selection of preadapted symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that maintaining the largest possible pool of potentially stress-tolerant genotypes by protecting existing biodiversity is crucial to promote rapid adaptation to present-day climate change, not only for coral reefs, but for ecosystems in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proportion of S. thermo.-indelcontaining variants in total ITS2 sequences from C3 predominated cnidarians (n = 116) from the PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cnidarians included in the analysis contained  greater than 50% clade C Symbiodinium, of which  greater than 95% were C3 or closely related variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average % S. thermo.-indelcontaining amplicons: 16.6%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We screened for S. thermophilum at 23 sites across  greater than 5,000 km of coastline from the northwestern PAG to the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba in the Red Sea (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbiont was detected by the presence of the S. thermo.-indel in libraries containing 2.8 × 106 ITS2 amplicons obtained by 454 and MiSeq sequencing (except Eilat; see Methods) of  greater than 900 symbiotic hexa- and octocorallians from 46 genera (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the 10 most sampled taxa are presented in Fig 1A, with details being given for all samples in Fig 2 and Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Members of the S. thermophilum group were found in 10 out of the 11 sampled genera in the southern PAG but were less frequent in the western PAG and could only be detected at low levels in 4% of samples in the Gulf of Oman and the Red Sea (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, when screening public databases for ITS2 sequences containing the S. thermo.-indel, we retrieved a close match with a sequence originating from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, which was recently entered in GenBank (accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EF428343).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hit may indicate the presence of a S. thermophilum group member in the Indo-Pacific, implying an even wider, cryptic distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PsbAncr sequences of samples containing the S. thermo.-indel from the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea are resolved within the strongly supported (PP = 1) monophyletic S. thermophilum group (Fig 1B and Table S3) but as genetically separate from the majority of PAG sequences and with larger average within-group genetic distances (0.065 vs. 0.039; Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average genetic distance of the five most divergent sequence pairs within the S. thermophilum group was larger than that between the considerably divergent C27 and C40 ITS2 types (0.163 vs. 0.154; Fig S2 and Table S4), demonstrating a genetic diversity in the group greater than that found among considerably divergent clade C lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the existence of a wide range of previously unidentified and possibly stress-tolerant genotypes within the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish the age and taxonomic position of the S. thermophilum group within clade C, we estimated molecular phylogenies of this group with representatives from Symbiodinium clades AI, including subclade C representatives, using a suite of single gene markers (Tables S3 and S5) through Bayesian analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These markers varied in their ability to resolve between clade C types (Fig S3 and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nine of the 31 S. thermophilum group samples showed identical resolutions across all markers and resolved on the ancestral node in a supermatrix phylogeny (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All non-S. thermophilum group samples resolved as a strongly supported monophyletic group derived from this ancestral node, whereas those S. thermophilum group samples not resolved on the ancestral node separated as sister groups or individual samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the molecular dating of the radiation of clade C placed in the mid-Miocene, these results provide strong evidence that the S. thermophilum group represents one of the oldest (13 Mya) and most genetically diverse groups of extant clade C symbionts (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, estimation of divergences between lineages within the ITS2 type C3 and closely related ITS2 variants according to the psbAncr as being between 2 and 12 My old (17), would suggest that within-group genetic distances of the S. thermophilum group represent evolutionary divergences occurring over at least several million years, a span considerably longer than the age of the PAG (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diversity of S. thermophilumpsbAncr was assessed by analyzing sequences from independent samples (Table S7) representing six sites in the PAG and nine sites in the Gulf of Oman and the Red Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant difference (two-sample t test, P value less_than 0.01) obtained for group comparisons between within-group genetic distances of PAG sequences (0.039; 112 samples) and Gulf of Oman/Red Sea sequences (0.065; 22 samples) (Table S4) provides evidence that the genetic diversity of S. thermophilum in the PAG is strongly reduced compared with the sites outside of this water body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the southern PAG, the overall Symbiodinium diversity at the species/clade level is lower compared with the western PAG and the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the PAG with the Gulf of Oman (15, 18) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1A and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The low genetic diversity of the S. thermophilum population in the southern PAG could be indicative of a recent bottleneck event or a founder effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the PAG is well connected to the Gulf of Oman via the dominant inflow of surface water through the Strait of Hormuz (18), and various symbiont types including S. trenchii (synonym type D1a/D1-4), some of which are known to be heat stress-tolerant and to associate with many different coral species (19), are already established in other regions of the PAG and the Strait of Hormuz (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the fact that Symbiodinium can disperse rapidly over long distances (6, 19, 20), these conditions should promote a rapid homogenization of the symbiont distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the distinct distribution patterns presented in this study render founder or bottleneck effects rather unlikely causes of the low genetic diversity of S. thermophilum in the southern PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More plausibly, the genetic uniformity of this symbiont in the hottest coral reef ecosystem in the world may have resulted from a strong positive selection of a few of the most thermally tolerant genotypes from an old lineage with a more widespread but cryptic distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selection pressure may not have resulted only from temperature extremes in the southern PAG, but might also have been influenced by the exceptionally high salinity of this habitat (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that characteristics of todays S. thermophilum populations were recently influenced by evolutionary processes despite the relatively short time (thousands of years) that this symbiont has been exposed to the pressures of the PAG environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A contrasting scenario was recently presented for the Caribbean, where the lack of genetic diversity among thermotolerant S. trenchii was interpreted as an indicator of a recent, long-range introduction of coral symbiont species (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, the opportunistic/invasive nature of a small founder population promoted its rapid spread to coral communities across the Greater Caribbean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although productive coral ecosystems exist in the southern PAG, the diversity of its habitat-forming scleractinian corals (34 species) (21) is substantially lower compared with the adjacent Gulf of Oman (68 species) (11) and the central and northern Red Sea (289 species) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to many other parts of the world, where corals construct reefs by forming vertically growing platforms through calcium carbonate accretion, corals in the southern PAG form only a living veneer over suitable substrates (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the findings from the PAG to the future of coral reefs elsewhere, it appears that coraldinoflagellate symbioses may respond rapidly to increasing water temperature by the spread of tolerant symbiont associations, which are normally ecologically rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the PAG ecosystem has had millennia to adapt, whereas the adaptation to global warming will need to take place over decades to centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As exemplified by the coral communities of the PAG and changes in their composition in response to short-term temperature anomalies, not all species will survive beyond certain changes in the environment (21, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inevitably, the shift toward more extreme environmental conditions on the global scale will be accompanied by a substantial loss of diversity both at the species and within-species level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the failure of corals to build reefs in the PAG has been previously attributed to high-frequency disturbances, high-level bioerosion, and the constant exposure of corals to temperature and salinity extremes (8, 15, 24), the dominance of thermally tolerant coraldinoflagellate combinations might also contribute to reduced reef accretion as recently exemplified for coral communities elsewhere (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because modeling predicts that reef accretion will not easily keep up with projected rates of sea-level rise at present days growth rates (25), the question arises whether the thermal adaptation of reef corals might come at the cost of an increased risk of reefs drowning in the rising oceans of the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the potential tradeoffs that might be associated with the thermal adaptation of coral communities, the example of the PAG suggests that protecting present-day biodiversity is of upmost importance to provide the largest possible genepool from which more stress-tolerant species and genotypes may emerge and become more common under severe natural selection (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For coral reef ecosystems, this implies that any loss of biodiversity by causes other than heat stress including habitat destruction, pollution, and eutrophication (2831) will reduce their likelihood of adapting to climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collection_and_DNA_Extraction_of_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cnidarian samples from 46 genera were collected at 23 reefs in the PAG, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling locations were categorized as follows: water bodies (the PAG, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea), sampling regions (made up of one or more reef), and reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed list of the sampling locations and number of cnidarians collected at each site can be found in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were collected by SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving with 1 cm2 of tissue sampled from the surface of each cnidarian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples collected at Eilat were placed into 5 mL of RNAlater, whereas all other samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted as described for environmental samples in Arif et al., 2014 (32), except for samples collected at Eilat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Eilat samples, host and symbiont gDNA was extracted using a cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before extraction, each of the samples was washed with 96% (vol/vol) ethanol to remove the majority of RNAlater storage buffer to minimize coprecipitation of salts during the DNA precipitation step of the extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen before being added to 1 mL of CTAB extraction buffer [2% (wt/vol) CTAB; 1.4 M NaCl; 0.5% 2--mercaptoethanol; 2% (wt/vol) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP); 20 mM EDTA; 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0] and beaten using a 5-mm stainless steel ball in a Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen) at maximum speed until the sample was completely homogenized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were incubated at 60 °C for 30 min before three extractions in 1 mL of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (IAA) (24:1), phenol:chloroform:IAA (25:24:1), and chloroform:IAA (24:1) with centrifugation after each extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was added to an equal volume of isopropanol before incubation at 20 °C for 2 h. The DNA was pelleted through centrifugation before being washed in 750 µL of 96% ethanol and centrifuged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatant was removed and pellets were dried before suspension in 50 µL of ddH2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All centrifugation steps were carried out at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ITS2_Genotyping_of_Symbiodinium_spp_Harbored_by_Coral_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Symbiodinium nuclear ribosomal ITS2 region of all samples except those collected at Eilat was sequenced by 454 and MiSeq sequencing as detailed (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Symbiodinium ITS2 region of the Eilat-collected samples was sequenced by direct PCR sequencing (services provided by Eurofins MWG) using the internal primer SYM_VAR5.8SII (13) on the 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S amplicon amplified by SYM_VAR-FWD and SYM_VAR_REV as detailed (33), with the exception of an annealing temperature of 56 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of this sequencing revealed a mix of C15-cluster ITS2 sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that S. thermophilum group symbionts are characterized by an ITS2 type C3, these samples were excluded from further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Screening_of_Corals_for_Associations_with_S_thermophilum_Group  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the presence of S. thermophilum group symbionts, all corals were screened for the characteristic 8-bp indel sequence described in Hume et al., 2015 (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incorporate the possibility of PCR error and the existence of possible genetic variants, sequences 1 bp different (substitution only) from the originally described 8-bp sequences were also included in the results (hereafter referred to as the S. thermo.-indel) as indicative of the S. thermophilum group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symbiont complements identified as having at least one ITS2 amplicon containing the S. thermo.-indel (hereafter referred to as S. thermo.-indel amplicons) were further categorized according to whether such amplicons made up more than or less than 1% of the total Symbiodinium amplicon sequences found in that organism (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. thermo.-indelcontaining amplicons made up between 2% and 41% of the C3 type ITS2 amplicons in S. thermophilum samples (i.e., a coral sample hosting 100% S. thermophilum would likely have between 2% and 41% ITS2 amplicons containing the S. thermo.-indel; Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the 1% cutoff used in this study could potentially represent a 50% complement of S. thermophilum group symbionts, whereas symbionts containing  greater than 15% have a high likelihood of containing a close to pure complement of an S. thermophilum group symbiont.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Verification_of_S_thermophilum_Group_by_PCR_Amplification__Sequencing__and_Phylogenetic_Analysis_of_the_psbAncr  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the successful identification of the S. thermophilum group by the presence of the S. thermo.-indel, samples from the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea that contained more than 25% clade C ITS2 sequences and in which S. thermo.-indel amplicons made up more than 1% of the clade C sequences had the psbAncr analyzed by direct PCR sequencing as detailed in Hume et al., 2015 (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatograms were checked manually for miscalls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatograms with multiple peaks were first assessed to determine whether the multiple peaks could be explained by a reading frame shift caused by indels by calling secondary peaks using the software Geneious 5.1.7 (www.geneious.com) before attempting to resolve indels using Indelligent 1.2 (dmitriev.speciesfile.org/indel.asp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the multiple peaks could be resolved in this way, the majority sequence was associated with that sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If multiple peaks were not explained by such indel analysis, chromatograms were characterized by no more than two peaks at each nucleotide location, and multiple peak locations clearly showed a predominant and lesser abundance of called nucleotide, then these predominant and lesser calls were used to identify a primary and secondary sequence, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the primary sequence was associated with the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where multiple-peaked chromatograms could not be explained by indel analysis or by identifying primary and secondary sequences, the sample genotype was not used in further analysis (1 out of 10 samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nine samples that successfully returned psbAncr sequences were aligned manually with additional sequences from the psbAncr alignment created by Hume et al., 2015 (13) that contained sequences from corals collected within the PAG and C3 radiation sequences (17) collected external to the PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted by Bayesian inference using Mr. Bayes 3.2.2 (mrbayes.sourceforge.net/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenies were estimated using the JukesCantor (JC) model with a gamma-shaped distribution (+G) with invariable sites (I) (according to Akaike Information Criterion using MEGA6; www.megasoftware.net/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses were run for 2.0 × 106 generations (SDs of split frequencies less_than 0.05), sampling every 1,000 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relative burn-in of 0.25 was used in calculating a 50% majority rule consensus tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare psbAncr genetic diversity between the S. thermophilum group and the two most divergent ITS2 types (C40 and C27) that resolve within the C3-radiation psbAncr phylogeny, as well as between S. thermophilum group sequences found within and external to the PAG, pairwise genetic distances and within-group genetic distance were calculated in MEGA6 using the JC model +G (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variance was determined to be equal (F test) before conducting a two sample Students t test to compare the within-group genetic distances of the samples from sites internal and external to the PAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taxonomic_Position_of_S_thermophilum_Group_Within_Symbiodinium_Clade_C  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the taxonomic position of the S. thermophilum group within clade C, a selection of S. thermophilum group, ITS2 type C3, and C41 and C39 (two of the top four numerically common subclades) harboring corals (including some corals under culture at the Coral Reef Laboratory Experimental Mesocosm Facility) (34) had their symbiont complement genotyped with six additional genetic markers (35): the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nr28S), the nuclear elongation factor 2 (elf2), the chloroplastic ribosomal large subunit (cp23S) domain V, the coding region of the plastid-encoded photosystem II protein D1 (psbAcds), the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (coi), and the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cob).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess fine-scale taxonomic resolution, the psbAncr was also amplified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specifically, the following coral samples underwent this additional genotyping: all samples in the Gulf of Oman and the Red Sea characterized as S. thermophilum by psbAncr genotype and containing  greater than 99% clade C ITS2 sequences (eight samples); a selection of 23 samples collected in the PAG as part of studies by Hume et al., 2015 (13) and DAngelo et al., 2015 (15), representing samples collected over  greater than 400 km within the PAG and as resolving in different positions within the psbAncr phylogeny of DAngelo et al., 2015 (15); samples collected in the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman harboring ITS2 type C3 as their numerically dominant ITS2 amplicon and containing no S. thermo.-indel amplicons (three samples; OMD001, OMD002, and YBA008; Table S3); three ITS2-type C3-harboring Euphyllia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  corals currently in culture at the Coral Reef Laboratory Experimental Mesocosm Facility (34) but originating from Indo-Pacific waters in proximity to Bali (EU2, EU3, and EU4; Table S3); and finally, four corals containing predominant ITS2 variants for C41 and C39 (representing the first and fourth most common ITS2 variants sampled, respectively) collected in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Oman (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All PCR conditions were as for the SYM_VAR_FWD/SYM_VAR_REV primer pair with cycles as detailed in Pochon et al., 2014 (35), except for the psbAncr region that was amplified according to Hume et al., 2015 (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were attained through direct PCR sequencing, services provided by Eurofins, using forward (elf2, psbAcds, coi, and cob) and reverse (nr28S and cp23S) primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences from this study were added to a selection of reference sequences (Table S5) representing members from clades AI, including subcladal C1, C15, C90, and C91, as well as sequence collections from Gymnodinium simplex and Polarella glacialis as outgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequences returned from the six additional genetic markers (i.e., not psbAncr) were aligned in MEGA 6 with the ClustalW algorithm and checked by eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypervariable regions that prevented robust alignment were removed from the cp23S alignment sensu Pochon et al., 2006 (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenies were estimated both from individual markers and from a concatenated supermatrix of all six markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenies were estimated by Bayesian Inference in Mr. Bayes 3.2.2 using the following nucleotide substitution models: nr28S, Kimura 2-Parameter (K2) +G; Elf2, K2 +G +I; cp23S, Hasegawa Kishino Yano (HKY) +G; psbAcds, Generalized Time Reversible +G; coi, HYK +G; cob, HKY +G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supermatrix analysis was partitioned with the separate nucleotide models being used for each markers region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCMC analyses were run for 1.0 × 106 generations, sampling every 500 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relative burn-in of 0.25 was used in calculating a 50% majority rule consensus tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignments of the psbAncr sequences returned from the ITS2 type C3 (non-S. thermo.-indelcontaining), C41, and C39 samples were not possible between ITS2 types from this study and with previous alignments by Hume et al., 2015 (13) (C3/S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  thermophilum radiation) and Thornhill et al., 2014 (17) (C1 radiation) due to the dissimilarity of the sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
