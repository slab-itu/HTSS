Structural basis for ligand binding to an enzyme by a conformational selection pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cellular chemical reactions are slow, and to make them compatible with biological life, enzymes have evolved to accelerate their associated rate constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzymatic catalysis is a complex process where the increase of rate constants predominantly depends on a reduction of the free energy barrier for product formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now established that transient, so-called high-energy, enzyme states are indispensable entities that contribute to lowering of free energy barriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such states are inherently difficult to study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have been able to arrest a catalytically indispensable high-energy state of the enzyme adenylate kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed characterization of its structure, dynamics, and function has revealed several aspects that together increase the understanding of how enzymes can perform their spectacular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins can bind target molecules through either induced fit or conformational selection pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conformational selection model, a protein samples a scarcely populated high-energy state that resembles a target-bound conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In enzymatic catalysis, such high-energy states have been identified as crucial entities for activity and the dynamic interconversion between ground states and high-energy states can constitute the rate-limiting step for catalytic turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient nature of these states has precluded direct observation of their properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a molecular description of a high-energy enzyme state in a conformational selection pathway by an experimental strategy centered on NMR spectroscopy, protein engineering, and X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the introduction of a disulfide bond, we succeeded in arresting the enzyme adenylate kinase in a closed high-energy conformation that is on-pathway for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1.9-Å X-ray structure of the arrested enzyme in complex with a transition state analog shows that catalytic sidechains are properly aligned for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that the structural sampling of the substrate free enzyme corresponds to the complete amplitude that is associated with formation of the closed and catalytically active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that the trapped high-energy state displayed improved ligand binding affinity, compared with the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that substrate binding to the high-energy state is not occluded by steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that quenching of fast time scale motions observed upon ligand binding to adenylate kinase is dominated by enzymesubstrate interactions and not by intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Approach_for_Arresting_AdK_in_a_High-Energy_Conformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cysteine pairs were designed by using the computer program Disulfide by Design (20) with the boundary conditions that the positions should be separated as much as possible in the open apo structure (Fig 1A, PDB ID code: 4AKE; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) but in close proximity in the closed structure (Fig 1B, PDB ID code: 1AKE; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) of AdK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A successful disulfide bond formation is thus designed to occur only if the substrate-free enzyme fluctuates on the open-to-closed conformational coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if the apo enzyme meeting these distance conditions samples the fully closed conformation then, over time, formation of a disulfide bond will arrest the enzyme in a high-energy state even in the absence of bound substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing cysteins at positions Gly56 (G56C) and Thr163 (T163C) (Fig 1 A and B) promoted the formation of a disulfide bond in the substrate-free enzyme (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful disulfide bond formation in this double cysteine variant is enabling isolation of a substrate-free and at the same time closed AdK state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This AdK variant (denoted AdKcc) could be purified to homogeneity (Fig 1 C and D) in amounts sufficient for subsequent biophysical studies, including NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemical_Evidence_for_Formation_of_an_Intramolecular_Disulfide_Bond  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial evidence for formation of a disulfide bond in substrate-free AdKcc was obtained from SDS/PAGE analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The migration through the polyacrylamide matrix of a protein containing a disulfide bond depends on the proteins oxidation state, i.e., the absence or presence of the disulfide bond (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The migration behavior of AdKcc under SDS/PAGE conditions (Fig 1C) differs in oxidizing and reducing conditions, as expected for a protein containing a disulfide bond (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings confirm that AdKcc can be purified in an oxidized state with a disulfide bond present (designated AdKcc,ox, whereas the reduced form is designated AdKcc,red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using size exclusion chromatography, it could be further shown that AdKcc,ox elutes as a monomeric enzyme (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics of disulfide bond reduction in AdKcc,ox was quantified by following the change in intensity of a selected methyl group in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time-dependent process could be accurately fitted to an exponential function yielding a half-life time for reduction of 54 ± 15 min at 25 °C (SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Substrate-free AdKcc,ox is a well-folded protein as judged by the chemical shift dispersion in a 1H-15N 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectrum (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a high degree of assignment for backbone 1HN, 15N, CO, and C resonances of this enzyme variant: 76% (1HN, 15N, and CO) and 89% (C) completeness for AdKcc,ox; 95% (1HN, 15N, and CO), and 99% (C) completeness for AdKcc,red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These numbers are on the same level as the degree of assignments of 1HN and 15N chemical shifts for wild-type AdK (97% for apo and 95% for Ap5a-bound state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assignments enabled quantitative analysis of secondary structure by conducting analysis of torsion angles ( and ) with the empirical program TALOS+ (24) (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profound spectral differences were observed in the NMR spectra following reduction of AdKcc,ox with the reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spectral differences between AdKcc in the oxidized and reduced states were analyzed on basis of changes of 1H-15N chemical shifts (SI Appendix, Table S1) and mapped onto the structure of AdK in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall chemical shift perturbation pattern between the oxidized and reduced states of AdKcc is similar to the pattern observed for the open-to-closed transition of wild-type AdK following binding to the tight binding inhibitor P1,P5-di(adenosine-5)pentaphosphate (Ap5a) (25) (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that Ap5a is a well-characterized bisubstrate analog for AdK, that binds to AdK with nanomolar affinity (3, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ap5a consists of one ATP and one AMP molecule bridged by an additional phosphate group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence of the chemical shift perturbation patterns for reduction of AdKcc,ox and Ap5a binding to wild-type AdK is suggesting that substrate-free AdKcc,ox populates a closed-like conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the amplitude of the overall perturbation of 1HN and 15N chemical shifts for the open-to-closed transition of wild-type AdK triggered by adding Ap5a (Fig 3B) is larger than for the transition between the reduced and oxidized states of AdKcc (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect depends on additional contributions to the chemical shifts from the presence of the strongly negatively charged Ap5a molecule because Ap5a alters both the overall protein conformation and the local chemical environment close to the interaction site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the backbone torsion angles  and  provides additional support for the closed nature of apo AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar correlations for the open-to-closed transitions were found by either monitoring the open-to-closed transition by addition of Ap5a to wild-type AdK or by reducing AdKcc,ox into AdKcc,red (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemical shifts of carbons are known to be highly sensitive to local molecular topology (2830), and we exploited this feature to further characterize the structural state of AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of changes of chemical shifts for backbone C and CO chemical shifts for the transitions: (i) wild-type open apo AdK to the Ap5a-bound closed state and (ii) the structural transition occurring upon reducing AdKcc,ox to AdKcc,red confirms that AdKcc,ox adopts a closed conformation (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the chemical shift differences for these two transitions cluster on the same spatial location of the structure of AdK (SI Appendix, Fig S3) mainly in the core of the central -helix (T175, A176) and in the AMP binding domain (AMPbd) (around residues M34, K40, L45, A55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the importance of the central helix in the enzymes opening-to-closing dynamics has been established by all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (31) and a comprehensive NMR study (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C and CO chemical shift changes were further analyzed quantitatively for residues in the AMPbd and the central helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A striking linear correlation exists for these two residue clusters when the chemical shifts, corresponding to the transitions resulting from closure of wild-type AdK and reduction of AdKcc,ox, are plotted against each other (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations reinforce the notion that AdKcc,ox is populating a closed conformational state in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finding that AdKcc,ox is occupying a closed conformational state was further supported by analysis of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RDCs are NMR parameters that carry information about the angle formed between a specific bond vector with the external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, RDCs provide additional structural information of a proteins topology (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 1H-15N RDC values were obtained for 90 residues of AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For subsequent analysis, the RDCs were grouped into three classes corresponding to: AMPbd (Fig 1A, colored in red), ATP binding domain (ATPlid) (Fig 1A, cyan), and core domain residues (Fig 1A, light blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis was performed by comparing the experimental RDCs with calculated RDCs from either the closed Ap5a-bound structure (1AKE) or the open apo structure (4AKE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For residues in both the AMPbd domain (SI Appendix, Fig S5 A and B and Table S5) and the ATPlid domain (SI Appendix, Fig S5 C and D and Table S5), the correlation between experimental and calculated RDCs is stronger when the closed structure is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured RDC values for residues belonging to the core domain of AdKcc,ox show no dependency on the structure chosen for RDC calculation (SI Appendix, Fig S5 E and F and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the structural changes in the core domain are likely to be too small to generate a measurable perturbation to the RDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the RDC analysis confirms the hypothesis that both the AMPbd and ATPlid domains are populating a closed-like conformation in the apo AdKcc,ox structure, which is fully consistent with changes in chemical shifts observed for apo AdKcc (Fig 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural analyses carried out with different, independent NMR methods demonstrate that formation of the disulfide bond between positions Cys56 and Cys163 traps AdKcc,ox in a closed-like conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformation corresponds to a high-energy enzyme state that would be anticipated in a model where substrate binding occurs by conformational selection (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamic_Signature_of_Disulfide-Arrested_Adenylate_Kinase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we have investigated the intrinsic dynamics of AdKcc on a picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, AdKcc,ox has similar picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics compared with AdKcc,red and wild-type AdK when quantified at the level of amino acid residues with heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (hNOE) experiments (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison indicates that the enzymes arrest in a closed-like state does not affect its fast time scale dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there is significant quenching of wild-type AdKs picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics when the closed state is generated by binding to Ap5a (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further evidence for this property is provided from analysis of crystallographic B factors, as described in the section below where the X-ray structure of Ap5a-bound AdKcc,ox is presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the fast time scale motions are predominantly affected by enzyme-to-substrate interactions and not by intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystallographic_Structure_of_Inhibitor-Bound_Cross-Linked_Adenylate_Kinase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been demonstrated that Ap5a can form a complex with AdK, which adequately mimics the ternary complex formed by AdK, ATP, and AMP (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the study reported here, diffracting crystals of AdKcc,ox in complex with Ap5a were obtained by adding an excess of Ap5a to purified AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete dataset to 1.9 Å was obtained, and the phases for 3D structure determination were obtained by using molecular replacement with Ap5a-bound wild-type AdK used as a search model (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron density between C56 and C163 clearly shows the presence of a disulfide bond in AdKcc,ox with bound Ap5a (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the AdKcc,ox structure in complex with Ap5a presented here is similar to the wild-type structure in complex with Ap5a (1AKE; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) with an overall rmsd of 0.40 Å for 214 aligned C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the orientation of catalytic side chains are in optimal positions for catalysis as deduced from a comparison with a catalytically competent cocrystal structure of AdK in complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP and AMP (34) (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, the Ap5a bound and cross-linked structure is in a conformation that is poised for catalysis and it can be concluded that the conformation of the closed and active state of AdK is not disturbed by the introduction of the disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clear correlation between motions on a picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale determined from NMR spectroscopy and crystallographic B factors has been established (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, the quenching of fast time scale motions in AdK following binding to Ap5a is reinforced by analysis of crystallographic B factors in apo wild-type AdK and Ap5a-bound Adkcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and B, there exist a significant redistribution of B factors when comparing these two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the B factors are large in the flexible ATPlid and AMPbd of apo wild-type AdK (SI Appendix, Fig S7A), the corresponding values in Ap5a-bound Adkcc,ox are substantially attenuated (SI Appendix, Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that the motions that affect the B factors are quenched in AdK as a result of binding to the transition state mimic Ap5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We were unable to crystallize apo AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can think of two reasons that may prevent crystallization of the trapped high-energy state: (i) structural heterogeneity caused by isomerization of the disulfide bond or (ii) energetic frustration (36) in apo AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isomerization of disulfide-bonded cysteines plays a vital role in protein folding (37) and has been shown to occur, e.g., as rotamer transitions in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor on a microsecond-to-millisecond time scale (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, relaxation dispersion experiments (40) on apo AdKcc,ox could not show contributions to chemical exchange on this time scale (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, it is more likely that the disulfide bond between C56 and C163 forces AdKcc,ox into an energetically frustrated state, thus preventing protein crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, calculation of the local mutational frustration index (36) suggested that the closed AdK structure is energetically more frustrated compared with the open conformation (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Trapped_High-Energy_State_Is_On-Pathway_for_Catalysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural analysis above suggests that AdKcc,ox is arrested in a closed-like structure that resembles the conformation of the catalytically active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a thermodynamic point of view, arrest of AdKcc,ox in an on-pathway state for substrate binding should result in significantly stronger substrate binding affinities compared with those of wild-type enzyme (16, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This argument will hold true if substrate binding is not occluded through steric hindrance in the arrested state (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of the natural substrates ATP and AMP to AdKcc,ox was quantified with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding affinities (KD) of ATP and AMP to AdKcc,ox were found to be 200 times stronger relative to the wild-type enzyme (Fig 5A and SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously there is a strong convergence in the improvement of binding of both ATP and AMP to arrested AdKcc,ox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that confining apo AdKcc,ox in a closed-like conformation gives rise to a large entropic penalty seen for both titrations (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because AdK is known to possess a strong entropy-enthalpy compensation upon ligand binding (3), the enthalpic component due to AMP and ATP interaction with AdKcc,ox is for this reason expected to be significantly reduced in comparison with wild-type AdK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is indeed the case (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, addition of ATP or AMP to AdKcc,red and to both single mutation variants AdK G56C and AdK T163C shows enthalpic and entropic components on the same order of magnitude as seen for ligand interaction with wild-type AdK (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the 200-fold increase in both ATP and AMP binding establishes that arrested AdKcc,ox is on-pathway for ligand binding and, therefore, also for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of the transition state mimic Ap5a to AdKcc,ox is also significantly stronger compared with wild-type AdK as shown by ITC (SI Appendix, Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing NMR spectra between apo AdK variants and related Ap5a-bound states structurally underlines that profound interaction (SI Appendix, Fig S10 BH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, the enzymatic activity of arrested AdKcc,ox was quantified by using an established coupled kinetic assay (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic model for AdK involves a rate limiting conformational change from a substrate-bound closed state (4) to a substrate-bound open state (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this model it is predicted that AdKcc,ox should have a significantly lower catalytic efficiency than wild-type AdK, because of restriction of the opening process caused by the disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, AdKcc,ox showed only weak residual activity, with a kcat of 1.5 ± 0.1 s1, but with preserved MichaelisMenten characteristics and a KM of 18 ± 8 M (Fig 5B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control experiments, activities of the single mutation variants AdK G56C and AdK T163C were quantified (Fig 5B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their kcat values were found to be 31 ± 1 s1 and 195 ± 5 s1, respectively, confirming that the orders of magnitude slower catalytic turnover of AdKcc,ox is primarily due to conformational restriction of the enzyme because of the disulfide bond and not a consequence of the selected two mutation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key contribution to enzymatic rate enhancement is lowering of the transition state barrier for product formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the microscopic scale, this phenomenon depends on a large number of events that collectively conspire to enable lowering of the transition state energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been established that enzymatic high-energy states are conformational ensembles that contribute to lowering the transition state energy barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These states are only transiently populated, and have so far only been detected and characterized experimentally by indirect methods such as smFRET (1012) and NMR spectroscopy (5, 6, 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An emerging property of proteins in general (42, 43) including enzymes is that their substrate-free states may sample high-energy states that resemble the target-bound conformation (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of adenylate kinase, such dynamics have been inferred from NMR spectroscopy with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (10) and chemical shift analysis (9), and with smFRET methodology (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A missing piece in our understanding of the contribution to enzymatic catalysis from the sampling of high-energy states is a detailed understanding of their structure, dynamics, and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have succeeded in arresting a high-energy state that is on-pathway for ligand binding and catalysis for adenylate kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach was to introduce a pair of cysteine residues that are distant in the open and inactive apo structure while in close proximity in the closed and active conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful disulfide bond formation could then only occur for the substrate-free state if the enzyme fluctuates on the open-to-closed conformational coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data conclusively show that the innate structural dynamics of apo AdK enables sampling of the fully closed and catalytically active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property indicates that AdK can, in fact, bind to substrates with both induced fit and conformational selection pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously proposed that ATP binding to AdK occurs with a hybrid mechanism that uses aspects of both these general models (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the microscopic level, this hybrid mechanism corresponds to an initial induced-fit recognition of ATP occurring with modest structural rearrangements of the p-loop segment followed by the large conformational change occurring with a thermally driven conformational selection event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented here establish that AdK has the inherent properties required for this hybrid model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside cells, the scenario is more complex and the actual pathway with dominant flux depends on both enzyme and ligand concentration as outlined in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For several cases, it has been shown that ligand binding to proteins is accompanied by a loss of flexibility of the proteins polypeptide backbone, which is manifested by increased order parameters as quantified from fast (picosecond-to-nanosecond) time scale motions probed by NMR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For AdK, a similar scenario was described by comparisons of the dynamics of the substrate-free apo state and an inhibitor (Ap5a) bound state (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An open question is whether the change in fast time scale (picosecond-to-nanosecond) dynamics depends on enzymeligand interactions or on intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data clarifies this question for AdK, because we show that the fast time scale dynamics of the trapped closed state are similar to that of the apo wild-type enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the changes in fast time scale dynamics for AdK primarily depend on the interactions formed between the enzyme and the ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exist at least one notable exception to the general trend that ligand binding to proteins is inducing quenching of fast time scale motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the carbohydrate binding protein Galectin-3, an increase in fast time scale motions has been observed for the ligand-bound state in comparison with the substrate-free state (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect points toward a substantial contribution from increased polypeptide backbone entropy in ligand recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a steric occlusion argument, it has been suggested that closed states of enzymes should generally not be binding competent states (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results contradict this suggestion, at least for the closed and active state of AdK designed and explored in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrested high-energy state of AdK has a 200-fold higher binding affinity for the natural substrates AMP and ATP than the wild-type enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the model of AdK catalysis (4), substrate release, which depends on the slow reopening of the ATPlid and AMPbd substrate-binding subdomains, is the rate limiting step of catalytic turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model predicts that the enzymes activity should be significantly reduced in the disulfide bond arrested state compared with the wild-type state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements validated the prediction, because enzymatic activity was 100-fold lower in the disulfide-locked state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the increase in binding affinity of the trapped high-energy state is accompanied by a significant decrease of its catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results presented here establishin the context of previous findings (6, 8, 10)that the energy landscape (47) of enzymes evolved to allow sampling of catalytically active states even in the absence of substrates (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, substrates are not per se required to activate enzymes but to reshape the free energy landscape in favor of the catalytically active conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature of the free energy landscape was originally postulated in the MonodWymanChangeux (MWC) model of cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work presented here reveals that the sampling of binding competent high-energy states is of substantial functional relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the benefit of the significant increase in substrate affinity by trapping AdK into a high-energy structural state has to be paid by a decrease in enzymatic turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an artificially designed network of disulfide bonds can be used to control both the affinity and the turnover of an enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basic principle may open an avenue for the targeted design of enzymes and other functional biomolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
