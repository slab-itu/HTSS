The decadal state of the terrestrial carbon cycle: Global retrievals of terrestrial carbon allocation, pools, and residence times  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative knowledge of terrestrial carbon pathways and processes is fundamental for understanding the biospheres response to a changing climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon allocation, stocks, and residence times together define the dynamic state of the terrestrial carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quantities are difficult to measure and remain poorly quantified on a global scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we retrieve global 1° × 1° carbon state and process variables by combining a carbon balance model with satellite observations of biomass and leaf area (where and when available) and global soil carbon data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal emergent continental-scale patterns and relationships between carbon states and processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that conventional land cover types cannot capture continental-scale variations of retrieved carbon variables; this mismatch has strong implications for terrestrial carbon cycle predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The terrestrial carbon cycle is currently the least constrained component of the global carbon budget.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large uncertainties stem from a poor understanding of plant carbon allocation, stocks, residence times, and carbon use efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imposing observational constraints on the terrestrial carbon cycle and its processes is, therefore, necessary to better understand its current state and predict its future state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine a diagnostic ecosystem carbon model with satellite observations of leaf area and biomass (where and when available) and soil carbon data to retrieve the first global estimates, to our knowledge, of carbon cycle state and process variables at a 1° × 1° resolution; retrieved variables are independent from the plant functional type and steady-state paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal global emergent relationships in the spatial distribution of key carbon cycle states and processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live biomass and dead organic carbon residence times exhibit contrasting spatial features (r = 0.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allocation to structural carbon is highest in the wet tropics (8588%) in contrast to higher latitudes (7382%), where allocation shifts toward photosynthetic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon use efficiency is lowest (0.420.44) in the wet tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find an emergent global correlation between retrievals of leaf mass per leaf area and leaf lifespan (r = 0.640.80) that matches independent trait studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that conventional land cover types cannot adequately describe the spatial variability of key carbon states and processes (multiple correlation median = 0.41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mismatch has strong implications for the prediction of terrestrial carbon dynamics, which are currently based on globally applied parameters linked to land cover or plant functional types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diagnostic ecosystem C balance model DALEC2 (19, 35) and datasets used to retrieve 1° × 1° C state and process variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPP, a function of climate and foliar C, is partitioned into autotrophic respiration (Ra) and NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPP is partitioned into the live biomass pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant mortality provides input to the DOM pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterotrophic respiration (Rh) is derived from decomposing DOM pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire fluxes are derived from burned area data (35) and all C pools (SI Text, section S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each 1° × 1° grid cell, we use a Bayesian MDF algorithm to retrieve C state/process variables and uncertainties; variables are retrieved without prior land cover type or steady-state assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data constraints consist of MODIS leaf area, total biomass (24) (tropics only), and soil C (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on the Bayesian fusion approach are provided in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distinct C allocation patterns emerge from our terrestrial C analysis (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net primary production (NPP) allocation to structural biomass (wood and fine roots) is largely 80% (area-weighted 25th to 75th percentile range = 8588%) in the wet tropics (less_than23° N/S; annual precipitation  greater than 1,500 mm) in contrast to the dry tropics (7787%) and extratropical regions (7382%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest NPP allocations to foliage (30%) spatially coincide with major grassland areas, including the North America prairies, the central Asia steppes, and the Sahel region in Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dry tropics exhibit relatively high NPP allocation to labile C (714%) (Fig S1), which reflects the increasing impact of seasonality on production as precipitation declines, requiring labile C stores for leaf flush.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C use efficiency (CUE; equivalent to 1  autotrophic respiration fraction) is overall lowest within the wet tropics (0.420.44) in contrast to dry tropical (0.450.50), temperate (2355° N/S; 0.470.50), and high-latitude ( greater than 55° N/S; 0.490.50) areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Live biomass and dead organic C residence times exhibit contrasting spatial features (r = 0.3) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the majority of wet tropical land area (56%)especially across most of the Amazon River (76%) and Congo River (69%) basinsthe longest C residence time occurs within the woody pool (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dry tropics and extratropical latitudes, soil C residence times exceed wood C residence time by a median factor of 2.6 (1.64.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Woody residence time is typically shorter in the dry tropics (819 y) compared with other biomes (wet tropics: 1221 y; temperate latitudes: 2129 y; and high latitudes: 2528 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter C residence time is typically longer in extratropical ecosystems (0.81.6 y) compared with tropical ecosystems (0.40.5 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longest foliar residence time (or leaf lifespan) occurs in the wet tropics and semiarid regions (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the wet tropics are characterized by relatively high structural C ( greater than 100 tC ha1) and photosynthetic C ( greater than 2.5 tC ha1) (Fig 4): in contrast, the dry tropics and extratropical regions exhibit less structural and/or photosynthetic C. Foliar C stocks are typically larger in the wet tropics (2.84.7 tC ha1) relative to other biomes (0.20.6 tC ha1); similarly, fine root stocks are also greater in the wet tropics (4.05.3 tC ha1) compared with other biomes (0.82.7 tC ha1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root:shoot (fine root C:leaf C) is lowest in the wet tropics (1.11.5) followed by the dry tropics (1.61.9) and extratropics (1.82.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find larger woody C uncertainties (1° × 1° 90% confidence range/median) in the extratropics (1.84.6) in contrast to tropical woody C (1.41.6) because of the latitudinal limits of the total ABGB map (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter C is greater in high latitudes (2.43.4 tC ha1) relative to temperate (0.62.4 tC ha1) and tropical (0.22.6 tC ha1) regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-latitude ecosystems have higher labile C stocks linked to seasonal leaf expansion (0.20.5 tC ha1) relative to temperate (0.10.3 tC ha1) and tropical (0.10.3 tC ha1) ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find high leaf C mass per leaf area (LCMA) values in the wet tropics (8597 gC m2) and semiarid regions, such as the Sahel, southwestern United States, and the Australian continent (typically  greater than 100 gC m2) (Fig 5); LCMA estimates are lower (typically less_than80 gC m2) in high latitudes and the dry tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a positive correlation between leaf lifespan and LCMA in high-latitude (r = 0.79), temperate (r = 0.80), dry tropical (r = 0.78), and wet tropical (r = 0.64) areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global gross primary production (GPP; global 25th to 75th percentile = 91134 Pg C y1), ecosystem respiration (91137 Pg C y1), and fires (1.32.0 Pg C y1) are broadly consistent with a terrestrial C model ensemble (22), data-driven estimates (36), and bottom-up inventories (37) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net C exchange uncertainty (8 to +13 Pg C y1) is an order of magnitude greater than mode net C exchange (NCE; 2 Pg C y1); NCE latitudinal uncertainty is larger but comparable with the terrestrial C model ensemble range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global atmospheric model CO2 concentrations based on CARDAMOM mode NCE fluxes are seasonally consistent [r2 = 0.93; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.53 ppm CO2] with mean total column CO2 measurements (38) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean integrated C residence time in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 is within the range of individual pool residence times at locations B, T, D, and W (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20012010 CARDAMOM analysis spatial and temporal LAI variability is consistent with the MODIS LAI constraints (r2 = 0.8; RMSE = 0.6 m2/m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When alternative GPP (36), alternative model structure, or biased data constraints (±20%) are imposed at locations B, T, D, and W, 88% of median sensitivity analysis estimates are within ±50% of median C state and process variable retrievals (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retrieved C cycle variables are broadly consistent with a range of in situ measurements (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of CUE within the Amazon River basin are comparable with the upper bound of recent measurements (0.320.47) (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent estimates of extratropical forest C density (40) are, on average, 38% lower than CARDAMOM total biomass estimates within forested areas (although the forest biomass estimates are typically within the CARDAMOM 1° × 1° uncertainty).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of mean Amazon woody C residence times (1521 y) are lower but comparable with aboveground woody C residence times derived from site-level measurements (2070 y) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that 8899% of C state and process variability is accounted for by eight empirical orthogonal basis functions (EOFs) (Fig 6); in other words, retrieved C state and process variables are largely explained by eight modes of spatial variability (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, the Global Land Cover Map (GLOBCOVER) land cover classifications (41) (e.g., deciduous forests, evergreen forests, and grasslands) account for less_than50% of C state and process variability (median multiple correlation coefficient R = 0.41); GLOBCOVER land cover types best describe spatial variations in C stocks (0.5  R  0.8) followed by LCMA (R = 0.4), residence times (0.3  R  0.5), and allocation fractions (0.1  R  0.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typically, C allocation and residence time parameters are based on land cover types in global-scale terrestrial C cycle studies (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 22 among others); here, spatially broad allocation and residence patterns emerge instead as a result of the MDF approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, high-biomass ecosystems throughout the wet tropics display similar C allocation, residence time, and LCMA configurations (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we find that dead organic matter (DOM) C residence is generally longer in high latitudes (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with conventional land cover types, EOFs 14 account for a larger degree of the spatial structures in retrieved C variables (Fig 6); for most variables, the two dominant EOF modeswhich together reflect first-order variations in latitude and global precipitation patterns (Fig S5)explain more spatial variability than GLOBCOVER land cover types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mismatch between land cover types and retrieved variables has major implications for the estimation and prediction of terrestrial C cycling, which is currently based on small sets of globally applied parameters linked to land cover types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of climate, biodiversity, fire, and anthropogenic disturbance in generating these mismatches needs to be explored in additional research (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It also is clear that plant traits vary across biomes (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and Fig S1), not just at biome boundaries (43), and that there are continental-scale tradeoffs and correlations among traits (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis is consistent with these viewpoints: for example, the emergent relationship between LCMA (proportional to leaf mass per area) and leaf lifespan (Fig 5) matches the positive correlation found in global plant trait datasets (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluating global plant trait patterns emerging from CARDAMOM provides a novel opportunity for connections to theoretical and functional biodiversity research and a route to integrating this knowledge into predictive terrestrial C cycle modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The residence times of major C stocks provide substantial insights into the sensitivity and potential future trajectories of the terrestrial C cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, land cover changes in the wet tropics may result in rapid DOM C losses given the relatively short DOM residence times (less_than30 y) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, high-latitude C residence times are an order of magnitude higher (30300 y), and therefore, shifts in C allocation or turnover rates are likely to result in long-lived C flux responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, given the predominant role of C residence times in future terrestrial uptake responses (9), the derived residence times provide a first-order estimate of ecosystem response times as a result of changes in C cycling regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note that model structure is likely to be a major source of uncertainty in long-lived ( greater than 10 y) C flux predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although reduced complexity models can capture some of the principal long-term ( greater than 10 y) DOM dynamics represented in earth system models (8), systematic errors in DOM dynamics can arise because of the underrepresentation of processes controlling DOM residence times (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that our decadal analysis is unlikely to be able to capture slow feedback processes acting on longer timescales, such as permafrost remobilization and priming (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large allocation and stocks and short residence time of wood in the wet tropics indicate the potentially rapid postdisturbance regrowth and C accumulation (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that fires are less frequent but major events within boreal ecosystems (50), and therefore, longer time periods are required for retrievals to fully account for the effect of fires on high-latitude C residence times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C state and process variable retrievals are sensitive to the uncertainty characteristics of C cycle observations (35) and the prior parameter ranges (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We highlight that the current coverage and accuracy of C cycle observations (24, 51) remain major limiting factors in our approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, extratropical C stock and residence time uncertainties are higher because of the absence of biomass observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undoubtedly, future estimates of globally spanning biomass density will provide a major constraint on CARDAMOM estimates of extratropical C state and process variables (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Land to atmosphere C flux estimates could be used to further constrain CARDAMOM C fluxes (Fig S2) and C cycle variables associated to nonsteady C states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, soil C residence time samples are negatively correlated with corresponding mean 20012010 NCE samples at locations B (r = 0.3), T (r = 0.4), D (r = 0.5), and W (r = 0.3); therefore, regional- or grid-scale estimates of NCE could provide a much-needed additional constraint on soil C residence time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CARDAMOM flux magnitude and uncertainty can be used as prior information in global atmospheric CO2 inversions; in turn, the assimilation of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (26) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 atmospheric CO2 observations (53) should further constrain CARDAMOM NCE estimates and their associated uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, nonsteady-state C fluxes can ultimately be reconciled with ecosystem state and process variables, such as C stocks and residence times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CARDAMOM approach provides a framework to test alternative model structures (54): in this manner, combined C cycle model parametric and structural uncertainties can be characterized, while ensuring consistency between models and global-scale datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assessment would amount to a major step forward from conventional C cycle model intercomparison studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, an ensemble of models can be used to determine the degree to which retrievals of key C state and process variables are model-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, alternative model structures could be used in CARDAMOM to assimilate globally spanning plant traits related to C cycling (55) and satellite observations, such as solar-induced fluorescence (27), vegetation optical depth (56), soil moisture (57, 58), and changes in aboveground biomass (25, 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that the incorporation of additional datasets and alternative model structures into CARDAMOM will generate quantifiable reductions in retrieved C variable uncertainties and new ecological insights on the state of the terrestrial C cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We grid MODIS LAI, ABGB (24), and HWSD topsoil and subsoil (0100 cm) C density (23) at a 1° × 1° resolution (SI Text, section S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DALEC2 is analytically described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35; an overview of DALEC2 C fluxes and pools is shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17 DALEC2 parameters (controlling the processes of photosynthesis, phenology, allocation, and turnover rates) and six initial C pools robustly characterize terrestrial ecosystem C balance (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DALEC2 is a generic representation of C cycling, where plant functional types are not explicit; instead, model parameters are treated as unknown and independent quantities for each 1° × 1° grid cell (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incorporate a fire C loss parameterization to account for seasonal and interannual variations in fire C fluxes from DALEC2 (SI Text, section S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model drivers consist of monthly time step European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim (ERA-interim) meteorology and MODIS burned area (34) at a 1° × 1° resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each 1° × 1° grid cell, we use Bayesian inference to retrieve the probability of DALEC2 model parameter xi (Table S2) given observational constraint Oi [henceforth p(xi|Oi)], wherep(xi|Oi)p(xi)p(Oi|xi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the expression, p(xi) is the prior parameter information, and p(Oi|xi) is the likelihood of xi with respect to Oi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample xi from p(xi|Oi); we henceforth refer to the retrieved DALEC2 parameter values at pixel i as yi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each grid cell, C allocation fractions, residence times within each C pool, stocks, LCMA, and associated C fluxes are derived from 4,000 samples of yi (SI Text, section S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, hence, obtain a probability density function for all C cycle variables within each 1° × 1° grid cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We do not impose plant functional type-specific prior parameter distributions or steady-state assumptions: p(xi) consists of ecologically viable parameter ranges (Table S2) and ecological and dynamical constraints (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constraints guarantee ecologically consistent parameter retrievals within a globally prescribed parameter space without imposing spatially explicit prior parameter information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the C state and process variable estimates within each 1° × 1° grid cell, we use 4,000 samples of yi to determine the mean, median, mode, and percentile ranges for each C state and process variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24, we present C allocation, residence time, and C stock 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles at four selected locations: B: 62.5°N, 81.5°E; T: 40.5°N, 120.5°W; D: 12.5°N, 20.5°E; and W: 7.5°S, 60.5°W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose B, T, D, and W as representative examples for C state and process variable values within each area (the full 1° × 1° C state and process variable maps are shown in Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the robustness of our C state and process variable estimates, we perform dedicated sensitivity tests to characterize the role of systematic errors in data constraints and model structure: we repeat our C variable retrievals using ±20% LAI, ±20% ABGB, ±20% HWSD, ±20% combustion coefficients, alternative GPP (36), and limited heterotrophic respiration at less_than0 °C (SI Text, section S4 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compare our results against in situ and regional observations of C allocation, pools, and residence times (SI Text, section S5), and we evaluate the resulting fluxes against atmospheric CO2 observations across 12 Total Carbon Column Observing Network sites (38) by incorporating NCE results in a 4D atmospheric transport model (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether global land cover types can predict the spatial variability of our results, we conduct a multiple correlation coefficient analysis between C state and process variables and 18 GLOBCOVER land cover fractions at 1° × 1° (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used a principal component analysis on C state and process variables to retrieve the primary 1° × 1° EOFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the CARDAMOM results evaluation and analyses are fully described in SI Text, sections S5, S6, S7, and S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pearsons correlation coefficient is abbreviated as r throughout the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spatially derived r and RMSE values reported in the text are area-weighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retrieved C variable rangesreported as area-weighted 25th to 75th percentile rangeare derived from 1° × 1° mean allocation and C stocks, log-based mean C residence times (Fig S1), and median LCMA values (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All CARDAMOM datasets presented in this study can be downloaded from datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/875.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

S2_DALEC2_Fire_Module  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the monthly C losses from fires at time t, we determine the monthly fraction of each grid cell burned, Barea(t), based on the MODIS-derived burned area product (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each monthly time step, the fire losses within each 1° × 1° grid cell are derived asFe(t)=Barea(t)×p=16kfactor(p)C(p,t),[S6]where Fe(t) is the total fire C emissions at time t, kfactor(p) is the combustion factor for pool p, and C(p,t) is the C in pool p at time t. We also impose a resilience factor r to the remaining pools within the burned area: for the live biomass pools, a firemortality flux is derived from the uncombusted C pools asFm(t,p)=Barea(t)×(1kfactor(p))(1r)C(p,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]The firemortality C flux from foliage, roots, and labile is deposited into the litter pool, and firemortality C flux from wood is transferred to the soil C pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally, 1  r of uncombusted litter C is transferred to the soil C pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kfactor values for labile (0.1), foliar (0.9), root (0.1), wood (0.1), litter (0.5), and soil C (0.01) are broadly equivalent to the kfactor values used by the Global Fire Emission Database (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply a resilience factor of r = 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity calculations associated with kfactor(p) and rf are described in SI Text, section S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S3_Global_State_and_Process_Variables  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spatial distributions of individual C pool allocation fractions, residence times, and stocks are shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residence time for each C pool at grid cell i is derived asRTpool(j)=Cpool(j)Fin(j)Cpool(j)×365.25,[S8]where Cpool(j) is the mean pool size, Fin(j) is the mean daily C pool input, and Cpool(j) is the mean daily change in pool size throughout 20012010 for the jth parameter vector sample of yi [i.e., Cpool(j), Fin(j), and Cpool(j) are calculated from DALEC2 output driven with jth parameter vector sample of yi].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean live biomass (DOM) pool residence times are derived based on Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8, where Cpool(j), Fin(j), and Cpool(j) are the total live biomass (DOM) C corresponding to jth parameter vector sample of yi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaf lifespan is equivalent to RTfoliar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reported global and zonal 25th to 75th percentile ranges of total annual fluxes were derived from the sum of monthly 1° × 1° 25th and 75th percentiles for each flux multiplied by the 1° × 1° grid cell area; the same approach was used to derive median fluxes and mode NCE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monthly mode NCE within each 1° × 1° grid cell was derived by binning NCE samples into 0.01 gC m2 d1 intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S4_Sensitivity_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We determine the sensitivity of C allocation, residence times, and C pool size estimates at locations B, T, D, and W (the B, T, D, and W coordinates are reported in the Materials and Methods) to LAI, biomass, and soil C data constraints (sensitivity tests S1S6); fire combustion and resilience factor coefficients (sensitivity tests S7S10); the use of Max Planck Institute GPP product (MPI GPP) (36) instead of the default DALEC GPP (19) (sensitivity test S11); and the suppression of heterotrophic respiration under 10 °C (sensitivity test S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity experiments are summarized in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the sensitivity tests are shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S5_Comparison_Against_in_Situ_and_Regional_Observations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CARDAMOM results are compared against a range of in situ measurements in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare each in situ measurement against the 50% and 90% confidence ranges of the mean 1° × 1° values within the stated region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison details and footnotes are included in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compare CARDAMOM total biomass against the extratropical Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar forest biomass map (BIOMASAR map) (40) aggregated to 1° × 1°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CARDAMOM to BIOMASAR comparison is conducted for the total biomass across all 1° × 1° areas with at least 95% BIOMASAR map coverage; total BIOMASAR biomass within those areas is 38% lower than CARDAMOM biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that lower than expected LCMA estimates in boreal ecosystems (Fig 6) could be explained by (i) understory plant traits (linked to deciduous shrubs) or (ii) seasonal MODIS LAI biases (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the significant correlation between LCMA and leaf lifespan suggests that retrieved LCMA accuracy could be strongly linked to seasonal biases in MODIS LAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S6_Comparison_with_GLOBCOVER_Land_Cover_Types_and_EOFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each 1° × 1° grid cell I, we determine the fraction of each GLOBCOVER (41) land cover type L: FL(i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then determine the Pearsons correlation coefficients (rLS values) between fL (the vector of all 1° × 1° land cover type L fractions) and each C state and process variable vector cS (the vector of each 1° × 1° state and process variable): state or process variables (denoted by subscript S) consist of allocation fractions, C residence times, C pool sizes, and LCMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rLS2 values between each GLOBCOVER land cover type fraction L and each C state/process variable S are shown in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The land cover categories are irrigated croplands, rain-fed croplands, mosaic cropland  greater than  vegetation, mosaic vegetation  greater than  cropland, closed to open broadleaved evergreen or semideciduous forest, closed broadleaved deciduous forest, open broadleaved deciduous forest/woodland, closed ( greater than 40%) needle-leaved evergreen forest, open needle-leaved deciduous or evergreen forest, closed to open mixed forest, mosaic forest or shrub land  greater than  grassland, mosaic grassland  greater than  forest or shrub land, closed to open shrub land, closed to open herbaceous vegetation, sparse vegetation, closed to open broadleaved forest regularly flooded, forest or shrub land permanently flooded, and closed to open vegetation on flooded or waterlogged soil (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multiple correlation coefficient RS between C state/process variable S and 18 GLOBCOVER land cover type fractions is derived asRS=rSTRLL1rS,[S9]where rS is the 1 × 18 vector of correlations coefficients between state/process variable vector cS and 18 1° × 1° land cover type fraction vectors fL, rsT is the transpose of rs, and RLL1 is the inverse of the correlation matrix RLL, which contains the intercorrelations between 18 land cover type fraction vectors fL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RS is equivalent to the maximum correlation (Pearsons r2) between the spatial variability of C state/process variable cS and the best-fitting linear combination of land cover type fraction fL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting RS values are shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also use a multiple correlation coefficient analysis on the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs; primary modes of variability) of all cs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a principal component analysis to derive the eight primary EOFs [EOFs were derived using the pca.m function in Matlab; each cs vector is centered at zero and scaled to the standard deviation (SD) of cs].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standardized EOFs (normalized by EOF SD) and EOF coefficients are shown in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EOF maps exhibit the primary modes of cs variability in space; for each cs, the maximum spatial variability explained by EOFs 1N is the sum of standardized EOFs 1N multiplied by their associated coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EOF multiple correlation coefficientsRS(EOF)were derived for the primary two, four, and eight EOFs based on Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9, where RLL is the identity matrix (given that EOFs are orthogonal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RS(EOF) results are shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S7_Comparison_Against_the_Multiscale_Synthesis_and_Terrestrial_Model_Intercomparison_Project  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compare GPP, ecosystem respiration, and NCE against the Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) terrestrial biosphere model ensemble version 1.0 (62) NCE (note that total C exchange is reported as net ecosystem exchange by MsTMIP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 0.5° × 0.5° monthly GPP, total (heterotrophic and autotrophic) respiration, and NCE values for 20012010 based on the BG1 simulation were downloaded from nacp.ornl.gov/mstmipdata/ and aggregated to a 1° × 1° grid [the BG1 simulation includes time-varying nitrogen deposition, atmospheric CO2, and land use history (22)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight MsTMIP models are shown in Fig S2: for the sake of brevity, we did not label individual models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S8_Atmospheric_CO2_Comparison  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We incorporated the 20092010 CARDAMOM monthly mode NCE values into the Goddard Earth Observing System 4D chemistry and transport model (GEOS-Chem) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GEOS-Chem model simulations are based on GEOS-Chem version 8.2 driven by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration GEOS-5 meteorological fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to NCE, fossil fuel emissions and oceanic surface CO2 fluxes are prescribed (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the 20092010 GEOS-Chem model CO2 concentrations against the monthly mean anomaly across 12 total C column observing network sites (38): Bialystok, Poland; Darwin, Australia; Eureka, Canada; Garmisch, Germany; Karlsruhe, Germany; Lauder, New Zealand; Lauder, New Zealand; Lamont, Oklahoma; Orleans, France; Park Falls, Wisconsin; Sodankyla, Finland; and Wollongong, Australia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the GEOS-Chem total C column observing network comparison are reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63 and references therein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the uncertainty in the GEOS-Chem trend stemming from the CARDAMOM flux uncertainty is substantial: global NCE 25th to 75th percentile = 8  +13 Pg C y1, which roughly corresponds to a ±5-ppm growth rate (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the CARDAMOM seasonal NCE variability, we compare the linearly detrended model and observations (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
