Two-and-a-half-year-olds succeed at a traditional false-belief task with reduced processing demands  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among social scientists interested in the development of childrens ability to infer mental states, an enduring controversy concerns false-belief understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested with traditional tasks, which require answering questions about the likely actions of agents with false beliefs, children do not succeed until age 4 y or later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When given nontraditional tasks without such questions, however, children succeed much earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are traditional tasks more difficult because they tap an advanced form of false-belief understanding or because they impose greater processing demands?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments support the latter possibility: 2.5-y-old toddlers succeeded at a traditional task when response-generation and inhibitory-control demands were both reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditional tasks thus assess the same form of false-belief understanding as nontraditional tasks but impose additional processing demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When tested with traditional false-belief tasks, which require answering a standard question about the likely behavior of an agent with a false belief, children perform below chance until age 4 y or later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested without such questions, however, children give evidence of false-belief understanding much earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are traditional tasks difficult because they tap a more advanced form of false-belief understanding (fundamental-change view) or because they impose greater processing demands (processing-demands view)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence that young children succeed at traditional false-belief tasks when processing demands are reduced would support the latter view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prior research, reductions in inhibitory-control demands led to improvements in young childrens performance, but often only to chance (instead of below-chance) levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examined whether further reductions in processing demands might lead to success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated that: (i) young children could respond randomly in a traditional low-inhibition task because their limited information-processing resources are overwhelmed by the total concurrent processing demands in the task; and (ii) these demands include those from the response-generation process activated by the standard question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis suggested that 2.5-y-old toddlers might succeed at a traditional low-inhibition task if response-generation demands were also reduced via practice trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, toddlers performed above chance following two response-generation practice trials; toddlers failed when these trials either were rendered less effective or were used in a high-inhibition task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the processing-demands view: Even toddlers succeed at a traditional false-belief task when overall processing demands are reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 144 English-speaking toddlers (72 males, range 28 mo;17 d to 36 mo;21 d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean ages were 31 mo;27 d (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), 31 mo;9 d (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), 33 mo;13 d (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), 31 mo;13 d (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 follow-up condition), and 33 mo;25 d (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 were divided via a median split into an older group (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, mean age 33 mo;25 d, range 31 mo;13 d to 36 mo;15 d; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, mean age 32 mo;16 d; range 31 mo;12 d to 34 mo;27 d) and a younger group (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, mean age 29 mo;29 d, range 28 mo;17 d to 31 mo;1 d; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, mean age 30 mo;3 d, range 28 mo;22 d to 31 mo;10 d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 29 toddlers were tested but excluded because the parent interfered (1 subject) or because they were distracted (3 subjects), refused to continue (1 subject), or failed to point in the practice trials (10 subjects) or test trial (14 subjects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our experiments examined the effects of response-generation practice on test performance, only children who responded to the practice and test questions were retained in the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Written informed consent was obtained from the parent before the test session, and all protocols were approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Apparatus_and_Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The picture book was mounted on a black wooden frame (46.5-cm tall × 56-cm wide × 52.5-cm deep) inclined at a 70° angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nine book pages (for the six story trials, two practice trials, and one test trial) were bound at the top of the frame with six binder rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pages consisted of clear plastic sheet protectors (32 cm × 56 cm) containing white paper to which color photos (20 cm × 25 cm) were affixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single photos were centered at the bottom of the page, and double photos were placed 4.5 cm apart at the bottom of the page.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Coding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One camera (located behind a 5-cm hole in the frame, below the book) captured childrens responses, an overhead camera captured both the book and childrens responses, and a third camera captured the experimenter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each practice and test question, we coded where children pointed and how many prompts they received (number of prompts was coded not as a proxy for response latency but as a measure of our practice manipulation: The more prompts children received, then arguably the more practice they had in processing a question).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each test trial was coded independently by a naive coder who did not know which was the false-belief container.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each experiment, the two coders agreed on points and prompts on all trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, in each story trial the experimenter turned a page toward the child, recited a line of the story, and then paused for 2 s, looking naturally between the book and the child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous pointing in the story trials was relatively rare, occurring on 11% of the trials across experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each practice trial, the experimenter turned a page toward the child, asked the practice question, and then paused for 5 s. If the child responded correctly, the experimenter praised the child and went on with the story.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the child did not respond, the experimenter repeated the question, with slight variations (e.g., Can you show me where Emmas apple is?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), for a maximum of four prompts, each with a 5-s pause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children responded readily and received, on average, 1.13 prompts per question (SD = 0.38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the test trial, the experimenter followed the same procedure except that children received up to five prompts, to maximize the probability of a response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the child did not respond to the initial test question (Where will Emma look for her apple?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), the experimenter repeated the question with slight variations (Can you show me where Emma will look for her apple?).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children responded after 1.72 prompts (SD = 0.99) on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the practice and test trials, the experimenter looked continuously at the children to ensure that they: (i) would interpret the question as a direct question (16) and (ii) could not use the experimenters gaze as a cue for where to point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24, the procedure was identical to that in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 except as indicated in the main body of the article.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice trials without a where question, the experimenter said, There is Emmas apple/ball!, paused for 5 s, and then went on with the story (the experimenter did not point to a picture in this or any other trial, as this could have provided indirect response-generation practice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, on average, children responded to each practice question after 1.36 prompts (SD = 0.63) and to the test question after 1.59 prompts (SD = 1.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding numbers of prompts for the other experiments were as follows: Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, practice question 1.31 (0.54), test question 1.41 (0.84); follow-up condition without practice questions, test question 2.06 (1.06); and Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, practice questions 1.21 (0.41), test question 1.22 (0.79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
