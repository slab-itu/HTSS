Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulation suppresses pathogenic astrocyte activation and chronic progressive CNS inflammation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) inflicts severe and irreversible disability on the affected individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astrocytes are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that Sphingosine-1-receptor (S1PR) modulation suppresses pathogenic astrocyte activation and disease progression in an animal model of SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using functional in vitro assays, we defined direct effects of S1PR modulation on murine and human astrocytes, as well as astrocyte-mediated effects on microglia and proinflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in unbiased transcriptome-wide studies on human astrocytes, we identified candidate targets for the modulation of astrocyte function in SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this study sheds light on the pathogenesis of SPMS and evaluates the therapeutic value of S1PR modulation in an animal model of SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS that causes disability in young adults as a result of the irreversible accumulation of neurological deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, these therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod (FTY720) ameliorated chronic progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in nonobese diabetic mice, an experimental model that resembles several aspects of SPMS, including neurodegeneration and disease progression driven by the innate immune response in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, S1PR modulation by FTY720 in murine and human astrocytes suppressed neurodegeneration-promoting mechanisms mediated by astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide studies showed that FTY720 suppresses transcriptional programs associated with the promotion of disease progression by astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study of the molecular mechanisms controlling these transcriptional modules may open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies for progressive MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

FTY720_Ameliorates_Chronic_Progressive_EAE_in_NOD_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EAE induced in NOD mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 3555 (MOG3555) peptide recapitulates several features of SPMS, including the progressive accumulation of neurodegeneration and axonal loss and the chronic activation of the innate immune system in the CNS (3, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to assess the therapeutic potential of S1P receptor modulators in SPMS, we evaluated the effects of FTY720 on NOD EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following immunization with MOG3555 in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) and pertussis toxin administration, NOD mice initially develop an acute neurological event, which is followed by a chronic progressive phase that starts at approximately day 25 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we initiated treatment with daily doses of FTY720 (0.3 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle 40 d after NOD EAE induction and monitored disease development until day 120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTY720 ameliorated NOD EAE during the progressive phase, as indicated by the reduction of clinical scores and mortality (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beneficial effects of FTY720 in NOD EAE were also reflected in decreased demyelination and axonal loss (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the amelioration of NOD EAE by FTY720 was not linked to alterations in the recall T-cell response to MOG3555, or with changes in peripheral or CNS immune cell counts (Fig 1D and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FTY720 ameliorated progressive NOD EAE without significant effects on the peripheral T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FTY720_Reduces_Pathogenic_CNS_Innate_Immune_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CNS innate immune response plays a central role in the progressive phase of NOD EAE (1, 3, 5, 6, 3539).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of astrocytes, microglia, and proinflammatory monocytes isolated from vehicle- and FTY720-treated mice 120 d after EAE induction using custom-made Nanostring nCounter arrays (Table S1) (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTY720 administration down-regulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in astrocytes, including Il6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2), Ccl20, Ifng, Il23a, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (Cxcl10), and Il1b, among others (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, neurotoxic mediators such as Tnfa and Nos2 as well as factors governing proinflammatory macrophage polarization, including colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) and Il12a, showed diminished expression under FTY720 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the expression of anti-inflammatory factors such as Cxcl12 (40) and Il33 (41, 42) was up-regulated by FTY720 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microglia and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SPMS and the progressive phase of NOD EAE (36, 37, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus analyzed the transcriptional profile of microglia and CNS-infiltrating CD11b+CD45+Ly6Chi proinflammatory monocytes in vehicle- and FTY720-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected decreased expression of proinflammatory gene clusters associated with NOD EAE pathology (2, 3) in microglia and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the down-regulation of proinflammatory gene expression was stronger in microglia than in monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, microglia displayed strong up-regulation of factors expressed in alternatively activated microglia such as Csf2, Chi3l3, and Cd206 in FTY720-treated animals (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, FTY720 decreased the expression of proinflammatory, chemoattractant, and neurotoxic molecules thought to mediate the pathogenic role of astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-infiltrating monocytes in MS and NOD EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Astrocytic_S1PR_Controls_Astrocyte_Neurotoxicity_and_Monocyte_Recruitment_and_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
S1PR1 expression in astrocytes contributes to the protective effects of FTY720 in acute EAE (22), but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected decreased expression of proinflammatory chemokines (Ccl2), cytokines (Csf2, Il6, Tnfa), neurotoxic (Nos2, Tnfa), and macrophage polarizing factors (Csf2) in highly purified primary astrocyte cultures (Fig S2) activated in the presence of FTY720 in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, FTY720 up-regulated the expression of neuroprotective Il10 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, S1PR modulation in astrocytes affects the expression of mediators thought to promote disease progression in MS and NOD EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Astrocytes display neurotoxic activities in the context of chronic CNS inflammation and also induce and amplify pathogenic activities in microglia and monocytes recruited to the CNS (40, 4551).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to evaluate the relevance to disease pathogenesis of the effects of FTY720 on the transcriptional program of astrocytes, we analyzed the effects of FTY720 on the neurotoxic potential of astrocytes and on their ability to control migration and monocyte polarization (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Astrocytes promote neuronal death through the production of TNF-, glutamate, lactate, and reactive oxygen species, among others (1, 6, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we used a cell-based assay to evaluate the effects of FTY720 on astrocyte-driven neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, we activated astrocytes in vitro in the presence of FTY720 or vehicle for 24 h and then added new culture medium after extensive washings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following culture for additional 48 h, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) was collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the neurotoxic activity of ACMs, we exposed neuronal cells to the ACMs and monitored neuronal death by quantifying lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTY720 treatment led to a small but significant reduction of ACM neurotoxic activity (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During MS and EAE, proinflammatory monocytes are recruited to the CNS, where they play a central role in promoting neurodegeneration (2, 36, 37, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, chemotactic factors produced by astrocytes play an important role in promoting disease progression in MS (40, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the effects of FTY720 on the recruitment of Ly6Chi proinflammatory monocytes by astrocytes we used an in vitro transwell migration assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that FTY720 decreased Ly6Chi inflammatory monocyte recruitment by ACM (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Astrocytes also modulate myeloid cell activation and polarization in the CNS (1, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effects of FTY720 on the control of monocytes by astrocytes, we activated astrocytes in the presence of FTY720 or vehicle for 24 h, washed them extensively, and established cocultures with sorted Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following coculture for 24 h, the monocytes were reisolated and their transcriptional profile was analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of astrocytes with FTY720 decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic molecules in monocytes (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse and human activated microglia, however, did not exhibit significant changes in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines or neurotoxic mediators upon exposure to FTY720 (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, neurotoxicity and induction of migration was not altered in supernatants of activated microglia upon treatment with FTY720 (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTY720 treatment led to a significant suppression of NF-B p65 nuclear translocation in activated astrocytes (Fig S4A), concomitant with decreased production of the proinflammatory and neurotoxic mediators IL-6, TNF-, GM-CSF, CCL2, and nitric oxide (NO; Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in blocking experiments, we identified CCL2 and IL-6 as the active components in ACM driving monocyte migration in vitro, whereas TNF-, GM-CSF, and IL-6 mediated astrocyte neurotoxic activity (Fig S4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these studies suggest that S1PR modulation in astrocytes by FTY720 contributes to the amelioration of chronic progressive NOD EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FTY720_Modulates_Activation_of_Human_Astrocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the relevance of S1PR modulation in astrocytes to its potential effects on MS, we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional response of human astrocytes activated in vitro in the presence of FTY720.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 1,221 transcripts that were differentially regulated under FTY720 treatment (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingenuity pathway analysis determined that FTY720 modulates the expression of transcriptional modules associated with migratory pathways, antigen presentation, inflammasome activation, axonal guidance, and fatty acid -oxidation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, NF-B signaling was significantly altered by FTY720 in human astrocytes (Fig 4C), recapitulating our findings of decreased NF-B p65 activation in mouse astrocytes in vitro (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B plays a central role in the control of astrocyte activities that promote inflammation and neurodegeneration (2, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the NF-B pathway, which confirmed that FTY720 down-modulates NF-B signaling in human astrocytes (activation z-score, 1.89; Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the functional relevance of our transcriptional analyses, we validated the expression of selected transcripts on independent samples and examined the functional effects of FTY720 on human astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTY720 decreased the expression of proinflammatory and neurotoxic mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and degenerative mediators, while increasing anti-inflammatory IL10 in human astrocytes, as determined in quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses from separate sets of samples (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ACMs from FTY720-treated human astrocytes exhibited a marked reduction in neurotoxic and chemotactic properties, concomitant with an increased production of neuroprotective mediators (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human microglia, however, did not show a significant response to exposure to FTY720 (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these findings reveal an overall neuroprotective effect of FTY720 on human astrocytes mediated, at least in part, by the suppression of NF-B signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these findings highlight targets of FTY720 on astrocytes, which may guide novel potential therapeutic interventions for the modulation of astrocyte function during progressive MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The immunosuppressive and disease-ameliorating effects of FTY720 in RRMS are mostly attributed to the blockade of inflammatory cell migration into the CNS (19, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylated FTY720, however, crosses the BBB and acts on CNS-resident cells, including astrocytes (22, 24, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of FTY720 in astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes have been previously documented in vitro (26, 27, 55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the beneficial effects of FTY720 on organotypic cultures in vitro and its BBB permeability (27, 56), FTY720 has the potential to modulate the local innate immune response in the CNS, thought to contribute to disease progression in MS (1, 6, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effects of FTY720 on chronic CNS-innate immune responses in vivo, as well as their relevance to the pathogenesis of disease progression in MS, are still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies highlight the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of S1PR modulation on mouse and human astrocytes at transcriptional and functional levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we evaluated the biological relevance of these observations in the NOD EAE model (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the chronic phase of this EAE model, disease progression is driven by the pathogenic activity of astrocytes, microglia, and inflammatory monocytes, without a major contribution of the adaptive immune system (e.g., T cells), thus recapitulating several aspects of SPMS (3, 32, 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that FTY720 ameliorates progressive CNS inflammation and neurodegeneration, most likely as a result of its CNS-intrinsic effects on astrocytes, microglia, and proinflammatory monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, our in vitro data on microglia point to an indirect effect of FTY720 on microglia mediated by the modulation of astrocyte-derived factors that influence microglia polarization and pathogenic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five isoforms of S1P receptors are expressed by immune and nonimmune cells relevant to autoimmune diseases, stroke, and cancer (11, 12, 5962).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, S1P receptors constitute attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, S1PR modulation by FTY720 is efficacious in the treatment of RRMS (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1PR modulation did not reach the primary endpoints in the INFORMS (oral fingolimod in primary progressive multiple sclerosis) trial in primary progressive MS (63), but ameliorated MRI parameters of disease activity (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAF312 (siponimod) is a BBB-permeable modulator of S1P1 and S1P5 receptors effective in slowing down demyelination in vitro (6466).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The safety and therapeutic efficacy of BAF312 on RRMS has been recently demonstrated in terms of clinical and MRI parameters in the phase II BOLD (BAF312 on MRI lesion given once daily) study (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic effects of BAF312 on SPMS are currently being investigated in the EXPAND (exploring the efficacy and safety of siponimod in patients with secondary progress multiple sclerosis) trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the effects of FTY720 on the CNS-innate immune response during NOD EAE, S1P receptor modulation by BAF312 is likely to modulate local CNS inflammation in SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, preliminary results of the EXPAND trial suggest a protective effect of BAF312 on 3-mo confirmed disease progression in SPMS (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, side-by-side comparisons of the effects of FTY720 and BAF312 on adaptive and innate immune cells are needed to determine whether the structural differences existing between these compounds affect their biologic activities on specific cell populations relevant to SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is worth noting that, whereas FTY720 modulates S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors, BAF312 modulates S1P1 and S1P5 receptors only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTY720 is also reported to modulate sphingolipid metabolism, which is thought to promote disease progression in NOD EAE and MS (3, 19, 23, 69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we showed that inhibitors of B4GALT6 and lactosyl ceramide production suppress disease progression in NOD EAE by arresting local CNS-innate immunity and neurodegeneration (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrest of NOD EAE obtained with B4GALT6 inhibitors is stronger than the amelioration obtained with FTY720, thus calling for caution as to the therapeutic potency of FTY720 and its analog BAF312 in SPMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of FTY720 on NOD EAE may reflect its moderate inhibitory effects on sphingolipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our unbiased genome-wide analyses identify additional potential targets for the therapeutic modulation of astrocyte function and the CNS-innate immune response, which may guide the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of progressive MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared and used for qPCR with the results normalized to Gapdh levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All primers and probes were from Applied Biosystems as follows: mouse, Ccl2, Mm00441242_m1; Csf2, Mm01290062_m1; Gapdh, Mm99999915_g1; Il10, Mm00439614_m1; Il12a, Mm00434165_m1; Il23a, Mm01160011_g1; Il6, Mm00446190_m1; Nos2, Mm00440502_m1; Tnf, Mm00443258_m1; Gfap, Mm01253033_m1; Aldh1a1, Mm00657317_m1; Itgam, Mm00434455_m1; and human, CCL2, Hs00234140_m1; IL6, Hs00985639_m1; NOS2, Hs01075529_m1; IL10, Hs00961622_m1; IL12A, Hs01073447_m1; and IL23A, Hs00900828_g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Affymetrix_Gene_Assay__Heat-Map_Generation__and_Pathway_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured fetal human astrocytes were exposed to IL-1 plus FTY720 or IL-1 plus vehicle and were screened by using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array Screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray data were analyzed using Genomics Suite software (Partek), Bioconductor, and R statistical software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Affy package was used for background correction, quantile normalization, and gene expression calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentially regulated genes were assessed with the Limma package, and FDR control based on the BenjaminiHochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat maps were generated by using Gene-E program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ingenuity_Pathway_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine significant pathways, differentially expressed genes that passed FDR less_than 0.1 for vehicle vs. FTY treatment were uploaded and analyzed by using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated by using Fishers exact test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Network_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NF-B network diagram was generated by using IPA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation status of a pathway was predicted by using IPA Upstream Regulator tool by an activation z-score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z-score was calculated by using the formula z = (iwixi)/(iwi2), where wi is the weight of gene i and xi is the number of activating and inhibiting predictions of gene i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive z-score indicated up-regulated pathway whereas negative z-score indicated down-regulated pathway as the overall effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (GraphPad) by using the statistical tests indicated in the individual figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No samples were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigators were blinded to the treatment of mice in individual experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values of less_than0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All error bars represent SEM or SD as noted in the individual figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise stated, three independent experiments were used for all assays, and displayed figures are representative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
