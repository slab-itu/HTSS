Metapopulation stability in branching river networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metapopulation stability is a critical ecological property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ecosystem size has been considered as a fundamental driver of metapopulation stability, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may not be appropriate for complex branching ecosystems, such as rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a scale-independent characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We theoretically revealed that a strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of branching complexity was consistently observed in metapopulations of four ecologically distinct riverine fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, branching complexity may be a ubiquitous agent of metapopulation stability in branching ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of such complexity may undermine resilience of metapopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intraspecific population diversity (specifically, spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems, an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In riverine systems, each branch (i.e., tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics, and confluences serve as merging points of those branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems, metapopulation size (a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is likely to be a pervasive feature of branching networks that strongly affects species persistence during rapid environmental changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A, Upper) Framework for developing random river networks as a function of scale length l (i.e., spatial scale of subpopulation), metapopulation size N, and branching probability P. (A, Lower) Metapopulation size N defines the number of interacting subpopulations (number of nodes) in a network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each node with scale length l is assigned to be either a branching (or upstream terminal) node with probability P or a nonbranching node with probability 1  P. Filled nodes represent branching (or terminal) river sections, while open nodes denote nonbranching river sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrows wb and ab denote examples of within-branch and among-branch combinations of nodes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nodes grouped in shaded areas represent an individual branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Map of Hokkaido Island, Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shaded areas are the 31 independent watersheds (separated by the ocean) where fish monitoring programs have been carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Example from one watershed (Nikanbetsu watershed), with gray dots denoting sampling sites of fish abundance surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Theoretical_Prediction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We described analytical relationships between the coefficient of variation of metapopulations (CVm) and branching probability P (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical model predicted that branching complexity should dampen temporal variability of metapopulations if within-branch population synchrony was greater than among-branch synchrony (within-branch correlation wb  among-branch correlation ab) (lines in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these relationships were reversed if ab exceeded wb (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metapopulation size N, the number of interacting subpopulations in a network (Fig 1A), did not change the relation of branching complexity and CVm (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, for both scenarios, stochastic simulations suggested that the uncertainty of expected CVm decreased with increasing branching probability P (dots in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stemmed from low structural variability in networks with high branching probabilities: In our model, stochastic variation in the number of subpopulations within a branch (n) fell nonlinearly as branching probability increased [Var(n)=(1P)/P2] (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This facilitated greater structural stability of randomly branching networks, leading to more predictable spatial synchrony and global stability patterns of metapopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contrary to the effects of branching complexity, effects of metapopulation size were not directly related to metapopulation stability; rather, they were contingent upon branching probability P (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, vague relationships between metapopulation size and CVm were observed except when wb equaled ab (dots in SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, metapopulation size effects were apparent only when branching probability was low (P less_than 0.3; Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the effects may be hardly detectable in real river networks, where both branching probability P and metapopulation size N vary simultaneously (dots in SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metapopulation stability depended exclusively on N and  when all subpopulations were equally correlated (wb = ab) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above predictions were also supported in more realistic metapopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when abundances and CVs of subpopulations were unequal (SI Appendix), branching complexity consistently stabilized metapopulations as long as within-branch synchrony was higher than among-branch synchrony (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, effects of metapopulation size were unclear in most parameter settings (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, an individual-based simulation model, which incorporated detailed ecological processes that underlie population synchrony (dispersal, local demography, and environmental stochasticity), reproduced the patterns expected from our analytical model (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S15S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the relationship between branching complexity and metapopulation stability was not sensitive to simplified theoretical assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Empirical_Evidence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first estimated detectability of the study species with a Bayesian multinomial model that accounted for random variation across sites and years; thus, this approach corrects not only for imperfect detection but also for observer-specific errors (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, detection probabilities were reasonably high across four study species (detection probability = 0.730.92; SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bayesian state-space model was fitted to the detectability-corrected data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reconstructed complete 18-y population trends of four freshwater fish species (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18S21 and model check fit in Fig S22) to quantify the stability of metapopulations (CVs of watershed-scale metapopulation dynamics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the substantial variation in the ecological traits of study species (SI Appendix, Table S3), a fixed-response model [no species-specific responses to explanatory variables; widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) = 345.9] outperformed a variable-response model that assumed differential species responses (WAIC = 365.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there was no statistical evidence of species-specific responses to the explanatory variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the Bayesian P value for the fixed response model was 0.53, indicating that the model fit was reasonably good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the fixed-response model, watershed metapopulation variability (CV) decreased significantly with increasing branching probability (Fig 3 and Table 1), providing empirical evidence for the stabilizing effect of branching complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as predicted by stochastic simulations, increased branching probability decreased the uncertainty of watershed metapopulation stability; that is, highly fluctuating metapopulations are less likely to occur in complex river networks (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, branching complexity has dual important impacts on watershed metapopulation dynamics: dampening average and maximum levels of watershed metapopulation variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other environmental factors, including watershed area (i.e., an empirical proxy for metapopulation size N), had little effect on the watershed metapopulation stability (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ecosystem size, a variable intimately linked to metapopulation size, has been believed to be a general predictor of metapopulation stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in branching networks, size effects were poorly supported by theory (metapopulation size N) or empirical analyses (watershed area; an empirical proxy for metapopulation size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity, emerged as an important stabilizing agent across four riverine fishes, in line with our theoretical predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species-invariant effect of branching complexity implies the existence of a general statistical property underpinning watershed metapopulation stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are particularly valuable for biodiversity conservation in complex landscapes because species living in branching ecosystems are likely to exhibit classical metapopulation dynamics that are inherently vulnerable to rapid environmental changes (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results are in general agreement with a few previous studies suggesting that branching complexity enhances metapopulation stability or persistence (24, 25, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our theoretical exploration provides two insights into metapopulation stability under natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony greatly exceeds among-branch synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is an emergent phenomenon of purely probabilistic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our theoretical prediction should be applicable to many species inhabiting river networks and other branching ecosystems (e.g., trees, caves, mountain ranges).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the form of the complexity-stability relationships changed very little along a gradient of metapopulation size N. Hence, the impact of branching complexity should appear across a wide range of spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two properties, which have not been recognized in previous studies, may explain why stabilizing effects of branching structure were invariant across four ecologically distinct fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many potential mechanisms could promote within-branch population synchrony, including external forces acting on subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common feature of riverine systems is that environmental signals (e.g., flood disturbance) cascade down along branches of stream networks (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental conditions are highly distinctive among branches due, in part, to variability of local geological and geomorphological features, such as slope, aspect, and soil porosity (14, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such spatial patterning of environmental effects may cause subpopulation responses that are unique to each branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, systematic heterogeneity of population synchrony can stem from internal properties of organisms, such as dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within-branch mixing of individuals is typically more frequent than among-branch dispersal (35, 36, 41), because cross-branch movements impose longer travel distance along a network (22) or extra costs for overland dispersal [e.g., salamanders (41)] to potential dispersers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural constraint, per se, should enhance coherent subpopulation dynamics within a branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the limited gene flow across branches, combined with branch-specific environments, may foster local adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Life history variation among streams (e.g., spawning timing) has been found in various aquatic organisms (40, 42, 43) and is thought to bring differential responses to shared environmental fluctuations (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the above mechanisms can act in concert and form the basis of the observed stabilizing effect of branching complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our theoretical model also suggested that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity should fade out, or even reverse, as among-branch population synchrony (ab) increases (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern may arise from homogenization of branch-specific environmental conditions, as well as strong local demographic/environmental stochasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human alterations, such as flow regulations by dams (44, 45), land use change (11, 31), and artificial propagation programs of fishes (3), have homogenized branch distinctiveness of flow, physical conditions, and resource type and availability across the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stabilizing effects of branching complexity may be diminished in severely altered landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such human-induced processes could be responsible for the apparent lack of stabilizing effects of branching complexity in one notable study, which assessed salmon metapopulation stability across pristine and human-altered watersheds (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, our study system offered an excellent opportunity to quantify branching effects since the study watersheds had very little human impact (SI Appendix and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any influence of unmodeled confounding factors should be minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our advanced statistical approach fostered by exhaustive sampling efforts (i.e., two-pass removal across all sites for 18 y) allowed us to account for unavoidable observation errors (e.g., imperfect detection), a critical issue of long-term monitoring programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strengths may have helped to illuminate the stabilizing effect of branching complexity that otherwise can be easily missed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our empirical analysis, direct comparisons between within-branch and among-branch population synchronies were impossible because they require a greater number of within-network replication than available even in our large dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the possibility exists that other ecological processes could be responsible for our empirical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we are unaware of any general theories that could provide convincing explanations for the observed patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is difficult to envision that detailed ecological traits (e.g., dispersal rate), which are often species-specific, explain the consistent stabilizing effect of branching complexity on very different fish species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our proposed theory arises from the physical architecture of spatial structure and is applicable across a wide range of spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the wealth of indirect evidence implies the existence of systematic heterogeneity of population synchrony (discussed above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, our theory should best explain the observed impacts of branching complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An intriguing avenue for future research is to ask how our findings can be scaled up to metacommunities (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Branching structure is a primary determinant of species diversity patterns in experimental (4850) and natural branching landscapes (51, 52); however, it remains elusive how long-term dynamics of metacommunities are mediated by spatial network structure (but ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that interspecific synchrony may play an important role in determining the relationship between branching complexity and metacommunity dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the present study focused on single-species metapopulations separately, an extension of our framework that incorporates interspecific synchrony terms (53) may offer a promising tool to predict metacommunity-level stability in branching ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Branching systems are ubiquitous in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biological, geomorphological, and other habitat-forming processes can create fractal branching networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those systems, the scale-invariant complexity of ecosystems can drive metapopulation stability via purely probabilistic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, there is no reason to believe that our fundamental finding is any less relevant for other aquatic and terrestrial organisms living in branching ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognition of the role of branching structure in driving metapopulation stability should increase our ability to manage and conserve species in complex landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Branching networks can be depicted by nodes connected via edges (25, 39, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our framework, following Yeakel et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39), nodes denote populations living in discretized river sections with a scale length l, which include either nonbranching or branching river sections (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale length l defines the spatial scale of local reproductive interactions (hereafter subpopulation) and may depend on attributes of the species of interest, such as dispersal ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed binary river networks, in which rivers bifurcate at confluences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We define metapopulation stability as relative fluctuations of metapopulation abundance (or density) through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major goal of our theoretical exploration is to describe metapopulation stability by the following properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
