Stress impairs cognitive flexibility in infants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infancy is regarded as a period of increased vulnerability to stress, but it is currently unknown how stress influences cognitive functioning in infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with adults have revealed that stress promotes rigid habitual behavior at the cost of flexible behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that stress similarly affects 15-mo-old infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the infants underwent a stress induction, the other half did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, all infants learned to habitually perform an action that produced an interesting effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the action had become ineffective, only stressed infants continued performing this action, showing rigid habitual behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonstressed infants explored an alternative action, showing flexible behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If stress occurs frequently, infants failure to explore alternative behaviors could hamper knowledge acquisition in the long term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In human adults, learning and memory under acute stress are characterized by an increased use of rigid habitual response strategies at the cost of flexible cognitive strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate effects of stress on cognitive functioning early in life are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show experimentally that acute stress leads human infants to perform habitual behavior rigidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 15-mo-old infants exposed to stress thereafter kept performing a previously effective action, even after the action suddenly became ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants in a no-stress control group flexibly adjusted their behavior by disengaging from the newly ineffective action in favor of exploring an alternative action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding demonstrates that stress impairs infants ability to adjust their behavior to changing circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematic overview of the procedure used in the instrumental learning task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In phase I (pictures 14), infants were shown how to push each of two buttons (A and B) to produce a light and sound effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infants were then allowed to push each button once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants access to the other button was blocked by a screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In phase II, the infants had a view of and access to one of the buttons, which lit and sounded when pushed, as before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infants were allowed to interact with it until they refrained from pushing it for more than 10 s. In phase III, the screen was removed so that infants had access to both buttons, but pushing these no longer produced any light or sound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were allowed to operate the buttons at will for a 30-s test period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E, experimenter; I, infant; S, screen used to block the infants view and access to one of the buttons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first evaluated the effect of the stress induction on infants salivary cortisol levels, as shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2 (time: premanipulation, postmanipulation) × 2 (condition: stress, no stress) mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time, F(1, 18) = 26.45, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.595, and a significant effect of condition, F(1, 18) = 6.34, P = 0.021, p2 = 0.261.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These main effects were qualified by a significant interaction between time and condition, F(1, 18) = 17.96, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.499.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means in Table S1 reveal that the significant main effects and interaction occurred because before the stress intervention, both groups showed similarly low cortisol levels but afterward only the stressed group showed markedly elevated cortisol, whereas the unstressed groups cortisol remained low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we assessed whether the stress manipulation influenced infants stress-related behavior by analyzing their fussiness, crying, and signaling their parents to be picked up during the stress induction (see, for example, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MannWhitney U tests revealed that infants in the stress condition cried longer than did infants in the no-stress condition during the stress manipulation: U = 8.50, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants in the stress condition also signaled their parent their wish to be picked up for longer than did infants in the no stress condition: U = 27.00, P = 0.003.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in fussiness between infants in the two conditions: U = 53.00, P = 0.118.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, to evaluate the effect of the stress manipulation on parental report of infants calmness, we conducted a 2 (time: premanipulation, postmanipulation) × 2 (condition: stress, no stress) mixed-model ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was an effect of condition, F(1, 24) = 21.33, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.471, and an effect of time F(1, 24) = 33.07, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.579.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This main effect was qualified by a significant interaction between time and condition: F(1, 24) = 27.45, P less_than 0.001, p2 = 0.533.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means reveal that the significant interaction occurred because both groups were rated as similarly highly calm before the stress intervention, but the stressed group was rated markedly less calm afterward, whereas the unstressed groups calmness rating remained high (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that the stress induction had a significant effect on infants physiological and behavioral stress level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the next step we assessed infants behavior during the instrumental learning task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we compared how often the experimenter needed to demonstrate pushing each of the buttons three times before the infants pushed the respective button themselves during the learning phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was not a significant difference between infants in the stress condition and infants in the no-stress condition in the number of required demonstrations (for the blue button: Mstress = 1.17, Mno-stress = 1.00, U = 70.0, P = 0.49, for the red button Mstress = 1.17, Mno-stress = 1.00, U = 77.0, P = 0.74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we compared whether infants in the stress and no-stress conditions differed in the amount they interacted with the button during the habit-acquisition phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was not a significant difference between conditions in the number of times infants pushed the button, Mstress = 30.42, SD = 27.18; Mno-stress = 20.50, SD = 15.55, t(24) = 1.16, P = 0.26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we assessed whether infants in the stress and the no-stress conditions engaged in the task to a similar degree during the test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was not a significant difference between conditions in the number of times infants touched both buttons overall during the test, Mstress = 14.50, SD = 9.42; Mno-stress = 15.07, SD = 10.57, t(24) = 0.14, P = 0.89.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, to assess cognitive flexibility during the test, we analyzed how often during the 30-s test phase infants touched the button they had learned to push habitually relative to touching both buttons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of times infants pushed the buttons during the habit-acquisition phase might have interacted with the infants behavior during the test phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our analysis controlled for pushing times in the habit-acquisition phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the development of infants behavior over time, we divided the test phase into three 10-s intervals (Table S3) and conducted a 3 (time interval: 010 s, 1020 s, 2030 s) × 2 (condition: stress, no-stress) mixed-model ANCOVA (covariate: number of button pushes during the habit-acquisition phase) on the means shown in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant effect of condition: F(1, 22) = 7.71, P = 0.011, p2 = 0.259.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This main effect was qualified by a time interval by condition interaction: F(2, 44) = 8.86, P = 0.001, p2 = 0.287 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant main effect of, nor an interaction with, the covariate: largest F(1,22) = 1.56, P = 0.225, p2 = 0.066.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means show that the significant interaction reflects the diverging frequency over the testing intervals of touching by the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post hoc analyses revealed that infants in the no-stress condition touched the habituated button relatively less often during the final 20- to 30-s segment than during the initial 0- to 10-s and 10- to 20-s segments: t(12) = 4.12, P = 0.001, t(12) = 2.33, P = 0.038, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, infants in the stress condition touched the habituated button more often during the 20- to 30-s interval than during the 0- to 10-s interval: t(11) = 2.21, P = 0.049.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, during the 20- to 30-s interval, infants in the no-stress condition touched the habituated button less often than infants in the stress condition: t(23) = 5.18, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present results show that infants in the stress condition persisted in performing an action they previously had carried out repeatedly, even after that action became ineffective and an alternative action was freely and saliently available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, these infants increased the frequency with which they performed the habitual action relative to performing the nonhabitual action over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, infants in the no-stress condition disengaged from executing the habitual action in favor of exploring an alternative action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants in the stress condition did not engage to a lesser degree with the buttons during the test nor learn the actions generally more slowly than did infants in the no-stress condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the effect of stress on infants behavior was highly specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are at least three explanations for the observed effect of stress on infants behavior that are not mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the second phase of the instrumental learning task, two processes might occur simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, pushing the available button presumably becomes habitual in the sense that the action occurs increasingly automated as a result of repeated practice (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, repeated exposure to the light and sound outcome can be assumed to devalue the action effects of pushing the available button (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress might thus interfere both with the ability to alter automated behavior and to react to changes in the value of an outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, stressed versus not-stressed infants relative engagement with both buttons during the test phase was similar initially and became increasingly distinct over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of results could well indicate that outcome devaluation was of secondary importance as a mechanism, because otherwise the unstressed infants might have switched to the nonhabituated button immediately when it became available because the habituated button was no longer attractive to them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, during the test phase, infants in the no-stress condition initially still engaged with the button they had pushed in the habit-acquisition phase and disengaged from it over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, infants in the stress condition exhibited an increasing relative preference for the button that had been available in the habit-acquisition phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, instead of outcome devaluation, automation might explain infants behavior more accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this perspective, both stressed and nonstressed infants might have established a strong tendency to habitually push the button that was available during the habit-acquisition phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, infants in the stress group had difficulties disengaging from this habit when the usual effect no longer occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was shown in their increasing tendency over time to engage with the habituated button relative to the nonhabituated button.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research could informatively test directly which mechanisms lead to reduced cognitive flexibility in stressed infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A third possible explanation for the observed differences in infants responding in the instrumental learning task could be not stress per se, but differences in the novelty of the infants experiences during the stress manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants in the stress condition encountered a novel object (i.e., robot) and an unfamiliar person, whereas infants in the no-stress condition played with their parent with common toys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the novelty of the experiences in the stress condition rather than stress per se interfered with habit formation or other aspects of the instrumental learning task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that infants in both the stress and the no-stress condition engaged in a 12-min play session with their mother and the experimenter after the stress manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the experiences immediately before the learning task were similar across conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to keep the experiences of infants in both conditions more similar throughout the visit would be to include more novel stimuli (e.g., unusual toys) or experiences during the stress manipulation for infants in the no-stress condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In several previous studies, infants and young children did not experience an increase in cortisol after exposure to a mild stressor (11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effectiveness of the present stress manipulation, however, shows that a series of relatively mild stressors similar to those in daily life can be sufficient to increase cortisol levels in 15-mo-old infants (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early stress response appears to be socially regulated (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, potentially stressful episodes often fail to elicit a physiological response if an attachment figure is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The encounter with a completely unfamiliar person, then with a mechanical device, and then separation from the caregiver, appears to be a combination of events sufficient to elicit the physiological stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This and similar procedures might enable further experimental investigations into the effect of acute stress on cognition during the first years of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present results suggest that stress effects on infants memory could be similar to those observed in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift from thinking to doing (19) that occurs under stress could well be adaptive during stressful episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Habit memory is more efficient and less demanding than cognitive memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the use of habit memory might save cognitive resources needed to deal with a stressor and to generally support fast resolute action (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the habitual memory system is rather rigid and reduces behavioral flexibility (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first years, infants acquire knowledge at a rapid rate and establish entire memory networks (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If stress occurs often, it could lead the infant to fail frequently to explore alternative behaviors, which in turn could hamper establishing memory networks and acquiring knowledge in the long term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final sample consisted of 26 15-mo-old infants (M = 14 mo 28 d, SD = 10 d, 14 girls).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen infants were assigned to the no-stress condition and twelve infants to the stress-condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional four infants (one infant in the no-stress condition and three infants in the stress-condition) were tested but their data could not be analyzed because the apparatus used for the instrumental learning task was faulty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These infants were not included in the final sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To standardize the timing of the circadian rhythm of infants cortisol level (21), we started all testing between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This research was approved by the Department of Psychology ethics review board at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants completed the experiment individually and were randomly assigned to a stress or a no-stress condition before testing as they became available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a research assistant had access to a list containing contact details of parents who had previously expressed interest in taking part in child-development studies and who were unknown to the research assistant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The research assistant alternated between the stress and no-stress condition when calling parents to arrange an appointment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, first she decided which condition she would assign the next infant to and then she went through the list until she reached the first family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was repeated for each infant in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed parental consent was obtained before participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the stress condition, infants experienced three potentially stressful episodes (stranger episode, robot episode, and separation episode) (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the no-stress condition, infants were allowed to play with their parent for an equivalent amount of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent to the stress manipulation, all infants were tested first in an object permanence task and then in an instrumental learning task to assess cognitive flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The object permanence task was not part of the present research question and is therefore not further reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the stress manipulation, a commercially available remote-controlled robot (Wowee 8081N Robosapien; 35 × 37 × 24cm) was used in the stress condition only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robot performed a preprogrammed sequence of movements accompanied by music, also generated by the robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To collect the infants salivary samples we used four eye sponges (bviBeaverVisitec) at each measurement point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sampling, the sponges were stored in plastic tubes at 15 °C in a commercially available freezer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The instrumental learning task used a gray rectangular box (7 × 40 × 11 cm) with a round red button and a round blue button (diameter of each: 8 cm) embedded in the top side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both buttons lit up and each produced its own distinctive sound while being pushed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a light gray screen (25 × 40 × 1 cm) blocked the infants view of and access to one of the buttons during the first and second phases of the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parents rated their infants calmness using an eight-item questionnaire, each item rated on a five-point Likert scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example item is My child is calm: 1 = not at all, 5 = very much as adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cronbachs  was 0.86 for the first (premanipulation) measurement and 0.97 for the second (postmanipulation) measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
