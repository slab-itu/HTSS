Efficient CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis in primary immune cells using CrispRGold and a C57BL/6 Cas9 transgenic mouse line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated mutagenesis is necessary for robust genetic screening in primary cells and requires sufficiently high levels of Cas9 and reliable single guide RNAs (sgRNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide a sgRNA design tool that selects high-fidelity sgRNAs and a Cas9 transgenic mouse line that expresses Cas9 at high levels in all cells analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we achieved an average knockout efficiency of 80% in primary B cells and established a robust CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic screening system that can be adapted to other primary cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applying clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated mutagenesis to primary mouse immune cells, we used high-fidelity single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) designed with an sgRNA design tool (CrispRGold) to target genes in primary B cells, T cells, and macrophages isolated from a Cas9 transgenic mouse line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we achieved an average knockout efficiency of 80% in B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we established a robust small-scale CRISPR-mediated screen in these cells and identified genes essential for B-cell activation and plasma cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This screening system does not require deep sequencing and may serve as a precedent for the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to primary mouse cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Design_of_Specific_and_Efficient_sgRNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coding genes typically contain hundreds of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences, allowing for a wide choice among possible sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To design the most specific and efficient sgRNAs to target a gene or set of genes, we implemented our sgRNA design rules in a tool that we termed CrispRGold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CrispRGold first projects the coding sequences (CDSs) of the different isoforms of a gene to a single minimal CDS, to identify sgRNAs that would target most or all isoforms of that gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sgRNA candidate, the position in the minimal CDS is stored and the sgRNA is aligned to the genome using the BurrowsWheeler aligner (BWA) (14) to identify potential off-target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the quantitative measurement of off-target site activity (15), we defined a type- and position-dependent mismatch-penalty matrix, such that the sum of mismatch penalties (or mutation distance) for the various off-target sites would inversely correlate with the frequency of detected off-target site activities (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mismatch penalty matrix especially weighs the increased impact of mismatches close to the 3-end of the sgRNA and the decreased relevance of mutations causing wobble base pairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CrispRGold uses this matrix to calculate the risk of each individual predicted off-target site genome-wide for a given sgRNA, sorts these sites according to their risk, and attributes a global off-target risk (or specificity score) to each sgRNA based on the three off-target sites with the highest risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CrispRGold computes sgRNA-intrinsic properties, such as the GC content and the folding energy between the targeting sequence and the scaffold RNA of the sgRNA (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high binding energy between the targeting sequence and the scaffold may alter the secondary structure of the sgRNA and potentially disturb recognition of the sgRNA by Cas9 or binding of the targeting sequence to the DNA (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, CrispRGold goes through iterative loops of decreasing stringency to find the required number of sgRNAs per gene or sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each loop, sgRNAs are prioritized according to their specificity (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Cas9_Transgenic_Mouse_Line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the mice created by Platt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) (hereafter called R26-Cas9p2aGFP), the Cas9 protein is fused to eGFP via a self-cleaving P2A peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our Rosa26-LSL-Cas9iGFP mice, generated by CRISPR-mediated editing of C57BL/6 zygotes, Cas9 is also expressed from the Rosa26 locus in a Cre-dependent manner, but with the Cas9 coding sequence linked to eGFP via an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To apply the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to primary immune cells, we generated Cas9-transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of Cas9 by crossing Rosa26-LSL-Cas9iGFP with Cre-deleter mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then evaluated the expression of Cas9 in the resulting R26-Cas9iGFP/+ animals by monitoring GFP reporter levels by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All hematopoietic subpopulations analyzed exhibited high GFP levels, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM), and various hematopoietic lineages, such as T, B, and myeloid cells, independent of their anatomical location (Fig 1 F and G and Fig S1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of HSCs, B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells were similar between R26-Cas9iGFP/+ and control mice, indicating that the expression of Cas9iGFP is not toxic to any of these cell types (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP levels in R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice were higher than in R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+ mice (6), likely due to the presence of the IRES instead of the P2A peptide between Cas9 and GFP (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that Cas9 is indeed present in the GFP+ cells, we performed Western blotting on splenic B cells that were activated in vitro and on BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, we detected high levels of Cas9 protein (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Cas9 was localized in the nucleus in the BMDM (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, primary immune cells of R26-Cas9iGFP/+ animals express high levels of GFP and nuclear Cas9 to nontoxic levels, allowing for genome editing and easy discrimination of Cas9+ and Cas9 cells in subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Efficient_CRISPR_Cas9-Mediated_Mutagenesis_in_Primary_Immune_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the knockout efficiency of the sgRNAs designed by CrispRGold in primary immune cells, we first selected 12 genes encoding B-cell surface markers and designed two sgRNAs per gene (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sgRNAs were individually cloned into retroviruses bearing a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) reporter and a puromycin resistance gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then isolated B cells from wild-type and R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice and mixed them in a 1:4 ratio, such that we could use the Cas9 (GFP) cells as internal controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mixed B cells were activated with anti-CD40 antibodies and IL-4 for 2 days and then transduced with retroviral particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transduced cells were further cultured on 40LB feeder cells (17) (NIH3/T3 cells stably expressing CD40 ligand and BAFF) in the presence of IL-21 and puromycin (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four days after transduction, all sgRNAs had led to cell surface marker knockouts, mostly with very high efficiency and an average knockout frequency above 70% (Fig 2 B and C and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one sgRNA led to significantly lower knockout efficiencies due to a T-rich sequence adjacent to the PAM, now implemented in CrispRGold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that these high knockout efficiencies are not unique to B cells, we performed a similar experiment using primary T cells that we activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four days after transduction with retroviral particles encoding sgRNAs against CD44, about 50% of the cells showed a complete knockout of CD44 (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to determine whether we reached similarly high knockout frequencies in quiescent primary myeloid cells, we differentiated bone marrow cells into resting BMDMs using macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and transduced them with lentiviral vectors expressing sgRNAs targeting CD64 and CD14 (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four days after transduction, 4080% of the cells showed a knockout of the targeted genes (Fig 2E and Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, primary immune cells of R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice are suitable for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, and CrispRGold designs reliably highly efficient sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the intrinsic properties of sgRNAs, the on-target dosage of sgRNA/Cas9 complexes is essential for efficient mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower GFP levels in lymphocytes of R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+ mice (6) suggested that they have lower levels of Cas9 than the R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice here described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the impact of Cas9-dosage on knockout efficiency, we thus repeated the experiment depicted in Fig 2A, using the same sgRNAs and B cells of both Cas9-transgenic lines side by side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, all sgRNAs tested led to significantly lower knockout efficiencies in B cells from R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+ mice compared with R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice (Fig 2 F and G and Fig S3C), consistent with lower Cas9 levels in these cells (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the combination of optimal sgRNAs and high levels of Cas9 in primary cells of R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice led to the high knockout efficiencies observed in primary cells isolated from these animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Robust_Inactivation_of_Transcription_Factors_Known_To_Be_Important_for_B-Cell_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extending the analysis to transcription factors (TFs), we selected five TFs, Prdm1, Irf4, Myc, Xbp1, and Pou2af1, that are known to be important for B-cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1824) (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed three sgRNAs per TF (Fig S6B) and performed retroviral transduction experiments as before, but this time analyzing B-cell survival and plasma cell differentiation (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of sgRNAs targeting Xbp1, Irf4, Pou2af1, and Myc led to a strong survival disadvantage of Cas9-expressing cells, indicated by the decreased percentage of GFP+ cells (Fig 3 B and C and Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for plasma cell differentiation, monitored by CD138 expression, targeting of all five TFs led to a strong block of differentiation (Fig 3 D and E and Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous reports, showing that Xbp1, Irf4, Pou2af1, and Myc are important for both B-cell survival, proliferation, and terminal differentiation (1822), whereas Prdm1 is only important for the latter (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in all cases, the three individual sgRNAs showed a strong and consistent effect on the biological readout, further demonstrating that sgRNAs designed by CrispRGold work with high efficiency and consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Genes_Important_for_B-Cell_Activation_and_Plasma_Cell_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Benefitting from the robustness of our system and the consistently high knockout frequencies, we performed a small-scale screen to identify genes important for B-cell proliferation and terminal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a microarray analysis of B cells and plasma cells isolated from immunized mice, we selected 83 candidate genes up-regulated during plasma cell differentiation in vivo (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed one sgRNA against each of these genes and 13 control genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed the same experiment as before in a 96-well system, using the percentage of GFP+ and CD138+ cells as readout for survival/proliferation and plasma cell differentiation, respectively (Fig 3A and Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on two experiments, which led to highly consistent results, we identified 22 genes to have a strong impact on survival/proliferation and 8 genes to selectively affect plasma cell differentiation (Fig 3 F and G and Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 22 genes important for B-cell survival/proliferation contained genes whose function in this context was previously unknown, such as Egr2, Dis3, Ost4, Preb, and Pomp, which we validated in further experiments (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dis3 is potentially involved in Ig class switch recombination via targeting AID (25), whereas Pomp might be involved in plasma cell differentiation (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identified Arf4, Creld2, and Zfp36 among the genes enhancing or blocking plasma cell differentiation (Fig 3H and Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, mice deficient for Zfp36 have been shown earlier to develop autoimmune disease, a finding that could connect to our observation of enhanced plasma cell differentiation in its absence (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that the screening system as described here leads to clear and consistent functional results, permitting small-scale screens in primary mouse cells without the need of high numbers of sgRNAs per gene or deep sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We provide a flexible sgRNA design tool that reliably identifies highly specific and efficient sgRNAs for a given set of genes or DNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CrispRGold can also be used for other organisms and will be available on a web platform (crisprgold.mdc-berlin.de).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary cells of R26-Cas9iGFP/+ mice express high levels of GFP and Cas9 to nontoxic levels, allowing for efficient CRISPR-mediated gene editing and the use of GFP internal controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that these tools can be combined in an easy and robust screening assay of CRISPR mutagenesis in primary hematopoietic cells and identify genes important for B-cell activation and terminal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same approach can be easily applied to other types of primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal care and mouse work were conducted according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, the Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, and the Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cas9 knockin mice were reported previously (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we knocked a Cas9-IRES-GFP cassette preceded by a LoxP-flanked Stop cassette into the mouse Rosa26 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LSL-Cas9 mice were bred with Cre-deleter mice to generate Cas9 transgenic mice (available from The Jackson Laboratory, stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  028555).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C57BL/6 mice were obtained by local breeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterozygous R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  026179).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BALB/c mice were from Charles River Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the microarray of in vivo generated plasma cells, BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 µg 2-phenyl oxazolone coupled to chicken serum albumin (CSA), precipitated with aluminum hydroxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 68 wk, mice were boosted i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 100 µg soluble antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma cells were sorted from spleen and the BM at day 6 and day 60 after secondary immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CrispRGold  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Minimal CDS (minCDSs) are generated based on the refseq tables (mm9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sgRNA candidates are defined by the presence of NGG and cutting site inside the minCDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sgRNA candidates are mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using BWA (14) (version 0.7.12) to identify potential off-target sites, ignoring the first base of the targeting sequence and allowing for four mismatches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The folding energy between the targeting sequence and the scaffold RNA is calculated using RNAduplex (Vienna Package) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CrispRGold is written in Perl, as all scripts are that were implemented in CrispRGold if not otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, sgRNA candidates are processed and scored as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first loop considers sgRNAs within the first 45% of the minCDS, with Tm  60 °C, the lowest off-target risk score 11, a scaffold-folding energy 20 kcal/mol, targeting the max N isoforms, without low-efficiency features and distance to the CDS-start 50 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second loop considers sgRNAs as the first loop, but within the first 60% and with the lowest off-target risk score 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third loop considers sgRNAs as the second loop, but with Tm  65 °C and distance to CDS-start 10 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth loop considers sgRNAs as the third loop, but with distance to the CDS-start 1 nt and neglecting Tm, scaffold-folding energy, and low-efficiency features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last loop considers sgRNAs as the fourth loop, but extending the search space to 90% of the minCDSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ninety-Six-Well_Cloning_Approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MSCV_hU6_CcdB_PGK_Puro_T2A_BFP vector was generated by cloning the PCR-amplified hU6-BbsI-CcdB-BbsI-gRNA fragment into the SalI and XhoI sites of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PGK-puromycin-T2A-BFP fragment was amplified by overlapping PCR and cloned into the MluI site of the MSCV-hU6-BbsI-CcdB-BbsI-gRNA vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For generating the minilibrary, forward and reverse oligos were separately ordered in 96-deep-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each forward and reverse oligo was mixed and phosphorylated individually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then annealed oligo duplexes were cloned into the BbsI sites of the MSCV_U6_CcdB_PGK_Puro_T2A_BFP vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids were transformed into DH5 bacteria using a heat-shock 96-well system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 30-min preculture at 37 °C, the transformed bacteria were transferred into 96-deep-well plates containing 1.5 mL LB liquid medium and sealed with PCR seals (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plates were cultured for 12 h then split into two new 96-deep-well plates and further cultured for 1012 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm (Rotor A-4-81, Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, in all following steps) for 1 min and plasmids were isolated using the NucleoSpin 96 plasmid core kit (Macherey-Nagel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retroviral Plat-E packaging cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplied with 10% (vol/vol) FCS (Gibco), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), and 2 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40LB feeder cells, producing BAFF and CD40L, were previously generated by Nojima et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) and maintained in completed DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare the feeder layer, 40LB feeder cells were irradiated with 12 Gy and plated at 5 × 104 cells per centimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naïve B cells were isolated from the spleen of R26-Cas9iGFP/+, R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+, or C57BL/6 mice by depletion of CD43+ cells using CD43 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resting B cells were plated at 106 cells per milliliter in DMEM (Gibco) supplied with 10% FCS (Gibco), 2 mM l-glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM Hepes (Gibco), 1× NAA (Gibco), -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10 g/mL gentamicin (Lonza).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cas9 (GFP+)-expressing B cells were mixed wild-type (GFP) B cells and stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody (Biolegend) and IL-4 (Perprotech) for 48 h before retroviral transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Throughput_Retroviral_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plat-E cells were plated at 2.2 × 104 cells per 100 L medium in each well of 96-well plates at day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day later, the cells were transfected with 100 ng DNA using FugeneHD transfection reagents (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve hours after transfection, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were cultured with 150 L new complete medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfected cells were cultured in a 32 °C incubator for 24 h. The retroviral supernatant was collected 48 h and 72 h after transfection into 96-deep-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 96-deep-well plates with supernatant were centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred into new 96-deep-well plates and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Throughput_Retroviral_Transduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 48 h after stimulation, GFP+/GFP mixed B cells were harvested and resuspended at a density of 2 × 105 cells per milliliter in completed B cell medium supplemented with 16 g/mL Polybrene (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 100 L cell suspension was transferred into each well of the 96-well plates and 100 L of retroviral supernatant was added, then activated B cells were spin transduced at 2,500 rpm for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 96-well plates were placed in a 37 °C incubator and on the next day the transduced GFP+/GFP B cells were transferred into 96-well 40LB feeder cell plates in the presence of 20 ng/mL of IL-21 (Perprotech) and selected with 1.25 g/mL puromycin (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transduced GFP+/GFP B cells were harvested and analyzed at different time points by using BD Fortessa with a 96-well high-throughput sample unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Activation_and_Transduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total T cells were isolated from R26-Cas9iGFP/+ and C57BL/6 mice using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit II; mouse (Miltenyi Biotec) and subsequently CD4 and CD8 T cells were sorted by FACS; and the Cas9 (GFP+)-expressing T cells were mixed with wild-type (GFP) T cells and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (145-2C11, Biolegend) and anti-CD28 (37.51, Biolegend) in the presence of 25 ng/mL recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech) for 2 d. The activated T cells were spin transduced with retroviral particles expressing sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transduced T cells were selected with puromycin for 4 d. After puromycin selection, the transduced T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry or sorted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BMDM_Generation_and_Lentiviral_Transduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BMDMs were differentiated from total mouse BM cells for 14 d in macrophage growth medium (DMEM) with 10% FCS, 20% l-cell supernatant, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% l-glutamine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sgRNAs targeting CD64 and CD14 surface makers were cloned into BbsI sites of pLKV-U6gRNA(BbsI)-PGKPuroP2ABFP vector (Addgene, 50946).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral particles were produced at the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI) U1111/UMR5308 Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Université Claude-Bernard Lyon 1École Normale Supérieure de Lyon (Lyon, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMDMs were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well of 24-well plates and transduced with lentiviral supernatant for 4 h. The medium was then replaced, and 2 d later, transduced cells were selected with 2 g/mL puromycin for 4 d. The transduced BMDMs were analyzed by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FACS_Analysis_and_Sorting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For FACS analysis, single cell suspensions were prepared from the BM, spleen, peritoneal cavity, and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) from R26-Cas9iGFP/+, R26-Cas9p2aGFP/+, or C57BL/6 mice and cells were blocked with FcR antibody (Biolegend) for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface antigens were stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS/1% BSA) and analyzed by BD Fortessa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analyzed using FlowJo software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For cell sorting, the BFP+ (sgRNA) GFP+ (Cas9) cells were sorted into 15-mL Falcon tubes and centrifuged before DNA isolation for further analaysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For single cell sequencing analysis, single BFP+GFP+ cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing 5 L of DNA quick extraction buffer (Epicenter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were briefly centrifuged, DNA was denatured, and PCR was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescent_Staining_and_Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 1 × 105 BMDMs were transferred into lysine-coated coverslips and further cultured for 24 h. The cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were washed and permeabilized with PBS/0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were washed and stained overnight with anti-Flag tag M2 antibody at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-Flag tag antibody was developed with rat anti-mouse IgG1 PE (Biolegend) for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were analyzed by Keyence fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect Cas9 protein, activated B-cell and BMDM lysates were run on SDS/PAGE gel and transferred into PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cas9 protein was developed with anti-Flag tag and anti-Cas9 antibodies; -actin was used for loading controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
