Mediator subunit MED25 links the jasmonate receptor to transcriptionally active chromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sensing of the plant hormone jasmonate (JA) by the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) triggers profound transcriptional changes that are regulated by the master regulator MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how COI1 communicates with the general transcription machinery and chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that MED25, a subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex, physically and functionally interacts with COI1 on the promoters of MYC2 targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED25 also physically and functionally interacts with HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE1 (HAC1), which selectively regulates histone (H) 3 lysine (K) 9 acetylation of MYC2 targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, MED25 integrates regulatory signals that converge on the promoters of MYC2 targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a fundamental mechanism by which Mediator coordinates the actions of both genetic and epigenetic regulators into a concerted transcriptional program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the active form of the plant hormone jasmonate (JA), is sensed by the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), a component of a functional SkpCullinF-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensing of JA-Ile by COI1 rapidly triggers genome-wide transcriptional changes that are largely regulated by the basic helixloophelix transcription factor MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how the JA-Ile receptor protein COI1 relays hormone-specific regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase II general transcriptional machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the plant transcriptional coactivator complex Mediator directly links COI1 to the promoters of MYC2 target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED25, a subunit of the Mediator complex, brings COI1 to MYC2 target promoters and facilitates COI1-dependent degradation of jasmonateZIM domain (JAZ) transcriptional repressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED25 and COI1 influence each others enrichment on MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MED25 physically and functionally interacts with HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE1 (HAC1), which plays an important role in JA signaling by selectively regulating histone (H) 3 lysine (K) 9 (H3K9) acetylation of MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the enrichment and function of HAC1 on MYC2 target promoters depend on COI1 and MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the MED25 interface of Mediator links COI1 with HAC1-dependent H3K9 acetylation to activate MYC2-regulated transcription of JA-responsive genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study exemplifies how a single Mediator subunit integrates the actions of both genetic and epigenetic regulators into a concerted transcriptional program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

COI1_Is_Enriched_on_the_Promoters_of_JAZ8_and_ERF1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that COI1-dependent JA-Ile perception triggers rapid degradation of JAZ proteins, which interact with and repress MYC2 in the resting stage, we hypothesized that COI1 associates with promoter regions bound by MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure the enrichment of COI1 on the chromatin of JAZ8 and ERF1, which are direct transcriptional targets of MYC2 (5, 11, 21) (Fig 1A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-qPCR assays of wild-type (WT) seedlings using an anti-COI1 antibody revealed that, without JA-Ile stimulation, COI1 was much more highly enriched on the G-box regions and transcription start sites (TSSs) of these genes than on the upstream promoter regions and gene bodies (Fig 1 A and B), indicating that COI1 preferentially associates with the G-box and TSS regions of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether and how the promoter association of COI1 is regulated by JA signaling, we examined the JA-Ileinduced pattern of enrichment of COI1 on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 by ChIP-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile, COI1 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were relatively high, whereas following JA-Ile treatment, COI1 enrichment levels were reduced within 15 min and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of the experiment (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal that COI1 is enriched on MYC2 target promoters and that this enrichment is down-regulated by hormone stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, we examined whether depletion of MYC2 affects the enrichment of COI1 on the promoters of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile, COI1 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were significantly reduced in myc2-2 (8) in comparison to the WT (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JA-Ile treatment decreased COI1 enrichment in both myc2-2 and the WT, and the level of COI1 enrichment was lower in myc2-2 than in the WT (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the COI1 enrichment on MYC2 target promoters depends on the function of MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MED25_Interacts_with_COI1_and_Facilitates_COI1-Dependent_Degradation_of_JAZ1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the molecular determinants that link COI1 to MYC2 target promoters, we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays to identify COI1-interacting proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, one of the COI1-interacting proteins we identified was the MED25 subunit of the plant Mediator coactivator complex (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the physical interaction between MED25 and COI1, we performed in vitro pull-down experiments using a purified maltose-binding protein (MBP)tagged MED25 fragment (MED25551-836-MBP) and histidine (His)-tagged COI1 (COI1-His).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED25551-836 could pull down COI1 (Fig 2B), indicating that MED25 interacts with COI1 in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether MED25 interacts with COI1 in planta, we conducted firefly luciferase (LUC) complementation imaging (LCI) assays in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, MED25 was fused to the N-terminal half of LUC (nLUC) to produce MED25-nLUC, whereas COI1 was fused to the C-terminal half of LUC (cLUC) to produce cLUC-COI1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N. benthamiana cells coexpressing MED25-nLUC and cLUC-COI1 displayed strong fluorescence signals, whereas those coexpressing nLUC and cLUC-COI1 or MED25-nLUC and cLUC displayed no signal (Fig 2C), confirming that the MED25COI1 interaction occurs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain mapping with LCI assays revealed that the MED25COI1 interaction requires the glutamine-rich domain of MED25 and the F-box domain of COI1 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using COI1-myc plants (9) and anti-MED25 antibody (21), and found that COI1-myc could pull down endogenous MED25 (Fig 2D), corroborating that MED25 interacts with COI1 in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the functional relevance of MED25COI1 interaction in JA signaling, we first investigated whether depletion of MED25 would affect the COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins, a convenient reporter for assessing the in vivo JA response (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we introduced the JAZ1-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion protein (4) into the med25-4 mutant (21) background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2E, JA-Iletriggered degradation of JAZ1-GUS was considerably slower in med25-4 than in the WT, confirming that MED25 plays an important role in COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ1-GUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed an in vitro pull-down assay to test whether MED25 plays a role in JA-Ilemediated promotion of COI1JAZ1 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, protein extracts from COI1-myc/WT and COI1-myc/med25-4 seedlings were incubated with recombinant His-tagged JAZ1 protein (JAZ1-His) in the presence of JA-Ile, and protein bound to JAZ1-His was detected with an anti-myc antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of JA-Ile to promote the COI1JAZ1 interaction was reduced in med25-4 relative to the WT (Fig 2F), suggesting that MED25 contributes to JA-Ilemediated promotion of the COI1JAZ1 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MED25_and_COI1_Reciprocally_Affect_Each_Other_s_Enrichment_on_the_Promoters_of_JAZ8_and_ERF1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observations that COI1 is enriched on MYC2 target promoter, and that MED25 interacts with COI1 in planta, suggested that the MED25COI1 interaction occurs on the promoters of MYC2 targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we compared the JA-Ileinduced pattern of MED25 enrichment with that of COI1 on the chromatin of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-qPCR assays using MED25-myc plants showed that, in the absence of JA-Ile treatment, MED25 was significantly more enriched on the G-box and TSS regions of JAZ8 and ERF1 than on the upstream promoter regions and gene bodies (Fig 1 A and C), indicating that in the resting stage, MED25 exhibits an enrichment pattern similar to that of COI1 on MYC2 target promoters (Fig 1 C vs. B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to JA-Ile treatment, however, MED25 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 rapidly increased, reaching a maximum after 15 min (Fig 1E), indicating that the JA-Ileinduced enrichment pattern of MED25 is distinct from that of COI1 (Fig 1 E vs. D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, MED25 enrichment on the TSS regions of JAZ8 and ERF1 was decreased in myc2-2 in comparison to the WT before and after JA-Ile treatment (Fig 1G), indicating that the enrichment of MED25 on MYC2 target promoters depends on the function of MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rapid reduction in enrichment of COI1 on MYC2 target promoters upon JA-Ile treatment, in contrast to the rapid increase in enrichment of MED25, prompted us to ask whether COI1 and MED25 are simultaneously associated with the promoters of MYC2 targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we performed sequential ChIP-qPCR assays using chromatin from MED25-myc seedlings, which was sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-COI1 and anti-myc antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed high enrichment of the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 (Fig 3 A and B), indicating that COI1 and MED25 are indeed enriched on the promoters of these genes at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further understand the significance of the MED25COI1 interaction on MYC2 target promoters, we assessed whether depletion of MED25 affects the enrichment of COI1 on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile, COI1 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were substantially reduced in med25-4 in comparison to the WT (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JA-Ile treatment decreased COI1 enrichment in both med25-4 and the WT, and the level of COI1 enrichment was lower in med25-4 than in the WT (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, together with the finding that the med25-4 mutation showed a negligible effect on COI1 protein levels before and after JA-Ile treatment (Fig S3A), indicate that MED25 mainly affects the enrichment of COI1 on the promoters of JAZ8 and ERF1 before JA-Ile stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In parallel, we performed ChIP-qPCR to investigate whether depletion of COI1 affects enrichment of MED25 on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile, MED25 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were slightly reduced in coi1-2 in comparison to the WT (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in the presence of JA-Ile, MED25 enrichment levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were greatly reduced in coi1-2 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, together with the finding that the coi1-2 mutation showed negligible effect on MED25 protein levels (Fig S3B), indicate an important role for COI1 in JA-Ileinduced recruitment of MED25 to MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, the above results reveal important functions of MED25 for linking COI1 to MYC2 target promoters in the resting stage, and thereby facilitating COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors in response to hormone elicitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two aspects of mechanistically related functions favor the hormone-induced activation of MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MED25_Interacts_with_HAC1__Which_Is_also_Enriched_on_the_Promoters_of_JAZ8_and_ERF1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore the significance of the MED25COI1 interaction on MYC2 target promoters, we tested the possible interaction of MED25 with histone modification enzymes whose activities are associated with active transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the three Arabidopsis CREB-binding protein (CBP)like proteins that exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity (3133), MED25 preferentially interacted with HAC1, but not with HAC5 and HAC12, in Y2H assays (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain mapping with Y2H assays indicated that the middle domain (MD), together with the activator-interacting domain (ACID) of MED25 (21) and the HAC1 fragment containing the transcription adaptor putative Zinc finger (TAZ)-type Zinc finger (Znf-TAZ) domain (31, 33), is involved in the MED25HAC1 interaction (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In co-IP assays using MED25-myc plants and an anti-HAC1 antibody, endogenous HAC1 could be pulled down by MED25-myc (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In LCI assays, N. benthamiana cells cotransformed with MED25 fused to nLUC (MED25-nLUC) and HAC1 fused to cLUC (cLUC-HAC1) displayed strong fluorescence signals, whereas those cotransformed with MED25-nLUC and cLUC or cLUC-HAC1 and nLUC displayed no signal (Fig 4C), confirming that the MED25HAC1 interaction occurred in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether HAC1 is also recruited to the promoters of JAZ8 and ERF1, we performed ChIP-qPCR experiments with transgenic plants expressing functional HAC1-GFP fusion (Fig S5) and an anti-GFP antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile treatment, HAC1 was mainly enriched on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to JA-Ile treatment, HAC1 enrichment on the TSS of JAZ8 was obviously elevated at 15 min, reaching a peak at 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, JA-Iletriggered induction of HAC1 enrichment on the TSS of ERF1 occurred later (Fig 4 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that, similar to MED25 and COI1, HAC1 is also enriched on the promoters of JAZ8 and ERF1, and this enrichment is regulated by JA-Ile stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Depletion_of_HAC1_Affects_JA-Responsive_Gene_Expression_and_Impairs_H3K9ac_Levels_of_JAZ8_and_ERF1_Promoters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the biological significance of the MED25HAC1 interaction, we compared JA-responsive gene expression between the WT and the hac1-4 mutant (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JA-Ileinduced expression of VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN 1 (VSP1), a marker gene for the JA-regulated wound response (35) (Fig S1), exhibited a slight yet significant reduction in hac1-4 expression (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the JA-Ileinduced expression of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2, a marker gene for the JA-regulated pathogen response (36) (Fig S1), was markedly reduced in this mutant (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that HAC1 preferentially affects pathogen-responsive genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, JA-Ileinduced expression of MYC2 direct target genes, including JAZ8 and ERF1 (Fig S1), was significantly reduced in hac1-4 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the impact of HAC1 on JA-regulated gene expression on a genome-wide scale, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments to compare the transcriptome profiles between WT and hac1-4 seedlings treated with or without JA-Ile (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quality assessment of the RNA-seq data is shown in Fig S6 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 3,354 genes that were up-regulated by JA-Ile at any time point (1 or 24 h) in WT [fold change  greater than  1.5, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified 2,010 genes whose expression was significantly reduced in hac1-4 compared with the WT at any time point after JA-Ile treatment (fold change  greater than  1.5, FDR-adjusted P less_than 0.05) (Fig S6C and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of these two sets of genes led to the identification of 890 genes showing significantly reduced expression in JA-Iletreated hac1-4 seedlings compared with JA-Iletreated WT seedlings (fold change  greater than  1.5, FDR-adjusted P less_than 0.05) (Fig S6C and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HAC1 is involved in the activation of around 26.5% (i.e., 890 of 3,354) of the JA-Ileup-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 890 genes were defined as HAC1 and JA-Ilecoup-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that these genes are enriched in pathways related to JA response, wounding response, and other defense responses (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top 10 enriched biological processes are shown in Fig S6E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, many well-characterized JA-inducible genes were identified as HAC1 and JA-Ilecoup-regulated genes (Fig 5B and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This list includes genes involved in JA metabolism, JA signaling, and JA-induced defense responses (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In parallel, we identified 3,305 genes that were down-regulated by JA-Ile in WT (fold change  greater than  1.5, FDR-adjusted P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified 535 genes whose expression was significantly higher in hac1-4 compared with the WT at any time point after JA-Ile treatment (fold change  greater than  1.5, FDR-adjusted P less_than 0.05) (Fig S6D and Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of these two sets of genes led to the identification of 153 genes that were less repressed in JA-Iletreated hac1-4 seedlings compared with JA-Iletreated WT seedlings (fold change  greater than  1.5, FDR-adjusted P less_than 0.05) (Fig S6D and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HAC1 is involved in the repression of around 4.6% (i.e., 153 of 3,305) of the JA-Iledown-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 153 genes were defined as HAC1 and JA-Ilecodown-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO analysis indicated that this group of genes does not show significant enrichment in any biological processes (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our RNA-seq experiments indicated that HAC1 mainly acts as a coactivator of JA-induced gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the substrate specificity of HAC1 for histone modifications, we compared the histone acetylation profiles of the WT and hac1-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to JA-Ile treatment, global levels of H3ac, but not H4ac, were reduced in hac1-4 to a greater extent than in the WT (Fig 5C), indicating that HAC1 mainly affects H3ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined the site specificity of HAC1 for H3ac and found that, in response to JA-Ile treatment, global H3K9ac levels were reduced in hac1-4 to a greater extent than in the WT (Fig 5C), indicating that HAC1 mainly affects H3K9ac, a chromatin mark that is typically associated with actively transcribed genes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-qPCR assays revealed that, in WT plants, H3K9ac was primarily enriched on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 (Fig S7 A and B), and that H3K9ac enrichment on these TSSs was increased by JA-Ile treatment (Fig S7 A and C), indicating that the H3K9ac enrichment pattern on MYC2 target promoters is similar to that of HAC1 and MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hac1-4 mutants, JA-Ileinduced H3K9ac levels on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 were dramatically reduced in comparison to the WT (Fig 5 D and E), confirming that the defective JA-responsive gene expression in hac1-4 is linked to impaired H3K9ac of these MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, JA-Ileinduced enrichment of the conserved C-terminal domain of Pol II on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 was obviously reduced in hac1-4 in comparison to the WT (Fig 5 D and F), indicating that HAC1 function is required for the recruitment of Pol II to MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enrichment_and_Function_of_HAC1_on_the_Promoters_of_JAZ8_and_ERF1_Depend_on_the_Function_of_COI1_and_MED25  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how HAC1, a general histone modification enzyme, selectively regulates H3K9ac of JA-responsive genes, we asked whether depletion of COI1 affects the enrichment levels of HAC1 itself and HAC-dependent H3K9ac on the promoters of JAZ8 and ERF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-qPCR assays revealed that, in coi1-2, JA-Ileinduced enrichment of HAC1-GFP on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 was substantially lower than in the WT (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, H3K9ac levels on these TSSs were also dramatically reduced in coi1-2 (Fig 6 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that COI1 did not affect HAC1 protein levels (Fig S8), these results demonstrate that the enrichment and function of HAC1 on MYC2 target promoters depend on COI1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parallel ChIP-qPCR assays revealed that, in med25-4, JA-Ileinduced enrichment of HAC1-GFP (Fig 6 A and D) and HAC-dependent H3K9ac (Fig 6 A and E) on the TSSs of JAZ8 and ERF1 was greatly reduced in comparison to the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that MED25 does not affect the protein levels of HAC1 (Fig S8), our results demonstrate that the enrichment and function of HAC1 on MYC2 target promoters also depend on MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MED25_and_JAZ1_Simultaneously_Interact_with_MYC2_in_the_Resting_Stage__and_Hormone_Elicitation_Shows_Differential_Effects_on_the_MED25COI1_Interaction_and_the_MED25MYC2_Interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above results, together with our recent finding that MED25 physically and functionally interacts with MYC2 (21), raise a possibility that MED25 and JAZ proteins could be bound simultaneously to MYC2 in the resting stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we performed co-IP experiments by transiently expressing combinations of MYC2-myc, Flag epitope (Flag)-tagged MED25 (MED25-Flag), and JAZ1-GFP in N. benthamiana leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, both MED25-Flag and MYC2-myc were coimmunoprecipitated by JAZ1-GFP (Fig 7A), indicating that MED25-Flag and JAZ1-GFP could be bound simultaneously to MYC2-myc in the resting stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To substantiate these observations, we conducted co-IP experiments with transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing JAZ1-GFP (Fig S9) and anti-MYC2 or anti-MED25 (21) antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, endogenous MYC2 and MED25 could be coimmunoprecipitated by JAZ1-GFP (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that the MED25 coactivator and JAZ repressors could be bound simultaneously to the master transcription factor MYC2 and suggest the existence of a JAZMYC2MED25 ternary complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, our study reveals two aspects of closely related functions for MED25 in regulating JA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the resting stage, it brings COI1 to MYC2 target promoters through physical interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, upon JA-Ile elicitation, it cooperates with both genetic and epigenetic regulators to activate MYC2-dependent gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this perspective, we speculate that JA-Ile elicitation might affect the MED25COI1 interaction as well as the MED25MYC2 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether JA-Ile treatment affects the MED25COI1 interaction in planta, we treated COI1-myc plants with JA-Ile and examined the ability of COI1-myc to pull down native MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon JA-Ile treatment, the ability of COI1-myc to pull down MED25 was slightly reduced at 15 min and dramatically reduced at 60 min (Fig 7C), suggesting that the MED25COI1 interaction is weakened upon JA-Ile elicitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the above results that the enrichment of COI1 on MYC2 target promoters is decreased upon JA-Ile elicitation (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, we treated MYC2-myc plants (37) with JA-Ile and examined the ability of MYC2-myc to pull down native MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon JA-Ile treatment, the ability of MYC2-myc to pull down MED25 was slightly increased at 15 min and obviously increased at 60 min (Fig 7D), suggesting that, in contrast to the above MED25COI1 interaction case, the MED25MYC2 interaction is enhanced upon JA-Ile elicitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the above results that the enrichment of MED25 on MYC2 target promoters is increased upon JA-Ile elicitation (Fig 1E) and the recent finding that JAZ repressors compete with MED25 for interaction with MYC transcription factors (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we propose a working model (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of JA-Ile, MED25 and JAZ proteins could be bound to MYC2, and therefore form a JAZMYC2MED25 ternary complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, JAZ proteins do not interact with COI1 but interact with MYC2, and thereby function as transcription repressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that, at this stage, the MED25COI1 interaction is relatively strong, whereas the MED25MYC2 interaction is relatively weak because JAZ repressors interfere with the interaction of MED25 with MYC transcription factors (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal levels of MED25 bring COI1 to MYC2 target promoters through physical interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to stress or developmental cues, plants produce JA-Ile, which acts as molecular glue to promote the formation of the COI1JAZ coreceptor complex (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this stage, JAZ proteins transiently switch the repressor function into a coreceptor function in a JA-Iledependent manner (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincidently, the MED25COI1 interaction is weakened, whereas the MED25MYC2 interaction is enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of the COI1JAZ coreceptor complex will eventually lead to proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon JAZ degradation, MED25 shows enhanced interaction with MYC2 and recruits HAC1 as well as Pol II to the promoters of MYC2 target genes, and thereby activates their expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model highlights the mechanistic function of MED25 in transmitting the hormone-specific signals from the JA-Ile receptor protein COI1 to activate MYC2-regulated gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent biochemical isolation of the plant Mediator complex from Arabidopsis (19) significantly facilitated the characterization of the diverse functions of individual plant Mediator subunits (3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a thorough mechanistic understanding of plant Mediator function remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it is unclear how specific Mediator subunits integrate regulatory signals from diverse internal or external cues, as well as how they convey these signals to the Pol II general transcription machinery to regulate the expression of specific target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we show that MYC2 forms a ternary complex together with the MED25 coactivator and the JAZ repressors in the resting stage and reveal functions of MED25 in regulating JA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the resting stage, MED25 brings COI1 to MYC2 target promoters through physical interaction, and thereby facilitates COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, upon hormone elicitation, MED25 brings the coactivator HAC1 to MYC2 target promoters and thereby regulates H3K9ac, which favors gene activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, together with our previous observation that MED25 bridges MYC2 and Pol II for preinitiation complex assembly during JA-regulated gene transcription (21), advance the overall understanding about how the JA signals are transmitted to activate gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, several aspects of the molecular details by which the multitalented MED25 executes these versatile functions remain to be further explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important aspect concerns the functional significance of MED25COI1 interaction for JA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The COI1 enrichment on MYC2 target promoters is relatively high in the resting stage and exhibits a rapid reduction upon JA-Ile treatment (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings that the MED25 enrichment on MYC2 target promoters is relatively low in the resting stage and exhibits a rapid induction upon JA-Ile treatment (Fig 1E) and that depletion of MED25 reduces COI1 enrichment on MYC2 target promoters in the resting stage and impairs COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins in response to JA-Ile treatment (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2E and 3C) support the notion that the major functional relevance of MED25COI1 interaction in JA signaling is to bring COI1 to MYC2 target promoters in the resting stage and to facilitate COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins upon JA-Ile elicitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that JA-Iletriggered reduction of the COI1 enrichment on MYC2 target promoters could be due to the finding that JA-Ile stimulates the formation of the COI1JAZ coreceptor complex, and thereby promotes JAZ degradation, since JAZ degradation might lead to disassociation of COI1 from MYC2 target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent structural studies of the COI1JAZ coreceptor complex (17) and the MYCJAZ repression complex (22) have revealed that hormone-mediated protein interaction is a major strategy governing JA-Ile perception and JAZ repression of MYC transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that, in the resting stage, there exists a JAZMYC2MED25 ternary complex and that hormone elicitation triggers extensive changes of protein interactions involving MED25 and the major components of the core JA signaling module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the MED25COI1 interaction is relatively strong in the resting stage and tends to be weakened upon JA-Ile elicitation (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the MED25MYC2 interaction is relatively weak in the resting stage and tends to be enhanced upon JA-Ile elicitation (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that hormone elicitation exerts differential effects on the MED25COI1 interaction and the MED25MYC2 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of the observations that JAZ proteins undergo pronounced conformational changes (through the Jas motif) before and after hormone elicitation, and therefore switch their interactions with MYC transcription factors (in the absence of JA-Ile) or with COI1 (in the presence of JA-Ile) (17, 22), it is reasonable to speculate that the JA-Iledependent alterations of the MED25COI1 interaction or the MED25MYC2 interaction may be coupled with conformational changes of the COI1-JAZ coreceptor and/or their interacting MYC2 and MED25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future structural studies should provide insight into the mechanism by which MED25 changes its interaction with the hormone receptor COI1 or with the master transcription factor MYC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, structural studies promise to provide insight into the mechanism by which MED25 facilitates JA-Ileinduced degradation of JAZ proteins by enhancing COI1JAZ interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the JA-Ile receptor protein COI1, we found that MED25 physically and functionally interacts with the evolutionarily conserved coactivator HAC1 (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support a scenario by which, in response to JA-Ile elicitation, MED25 recruits HAC1 to MYC2 target promoters, and thereby regulates H3K9ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we found that JA-Ile treatment led to obvious reduction of H3ac and H3K9ac levels in hac1-4 but not in the WT (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct action modes of JA-Ile on H3ac and H3K9ac levels between hac1-4 and the WT can be explained by previous observations that JA could activate the expression of HISTONE DEACETYLASE6 (HDA6) and HDA19, two histone deacetylase genes that affect H3ac levels (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that histone acetylation and deacetylation play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, it is reasonable to speculate that plants have evolved a mechanism to keep a dynamic balance between histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this scenario, JA-Ile may simultaneously up-regulate the activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, thereby maintaining a steady-state level of H3ac and H3K9ac in the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hac1-4 mutants, the JA-Ileinduced up-regulation of H3ac or H3K9ac through HAC1 is blocked, but JA-Ile still reduces H3ac and H3K9ac through activating HDA6 and HDA19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects likely lead to reduced H3ac and H3K9ac levels of hac1-4 in response to JA-Ile treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study suggests two related directions for future exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, recent advances have led to the surprising discovery that, in addition to JA, the main receptors for several other plant hormones, including auxin (43), gibberellin (44), abscisic acid (45), and salicylic acid (46), are localized in the nucleus and directly linked to hormone-regulated gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important future direction will be to determine whether the signaling paradigm described herein can be extended to other hormones whose receptors are localized in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is the case, it will be critical to study the principles that govern the general and/or context-specific functions of Mediator, and especially to determine how a single multiprotein complex can perform so many diverse tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, this study reveals several aspects of striking analogy between plant and animal nuclear hormone receptor (NR) systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the overall protein domain composition of the plant MED25 is largely similar to that of its animal counterpart (19, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in addition to interacting with MYC2, the plant MED25 interacts with the JA-Ile receptor protein COI1; in an analogous manner, the human MED25 engages in a ligand-dependent interaction with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and several other NRs, which are themselves transcription factors (26, 28, 29, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in term of their interaction with MED25, the JA-Ile coreceptor complex (SCFCOI1JAZs), together with the master transcription factor MYC2, resembles the NR system of metazoans (26, 28, 29, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we show here that the plant MED25 cooperates with HAC1, an Arabidopsis ortholog of the well-studied animal histone acetyltransferase CBP, for JA-Iletriggered activation of MYC2; in a similar manner, the animal MED25 also cooperates with CBP for RAR activation (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the plant MED25 and its animal counterpart cooperate with similar epigenetic regulators in distinct signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal Mediator was first biochemically isolated as a thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex (47), and has been shown to be an indispensable NR-interacting coactivator (26, 28, 29, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These previous observations, together with our findings, support a scenario in which plants and animals have evolved distinct, but nonetheless largely similar, mechanisms for NR activation at the level of transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies aimed at elucidating the roles of plant Mediator in integrating different plant hormone responses should provide deeper insight into these mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

LCI assays were carried out as described previously (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coding sequences of COI1, MED25, and their derivatives were cloned into vector pCAMBIA1300-nLUC, and the coding sequences of HAC1, COI1, and their derivatives were cloned into vector pCAMBIA1300-cLUC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers are summarized in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. tumefaciens GV3101 carrying the indicated constructs was incubated in LuriaBertani (LB) medium at 28 °C overnight, and then transferred to new LB medium containing 10 mM 2-(N-morpholine)-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 5.6) and 40 M acetosyringone [1:100 ratio (vol/vol)] for 16 h. The culture was pelleted and resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2 containing 0.2 mM acetosyringone to a final concentration of OD600 = 1.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacteria were kept at room temperature for at least 3 h without shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For coinfiltration, equal volumes of Agrobacterium suspensions carrying the indicated constructs were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After infiltration, plants were incubated at 23 °C for 72 h under 16-h light/8-h dark conditions before LUC activity was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low-light-cooled CCD imaging apparatus (NightOWL II LB983 with Indigo software) was used to capture the LUC image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaves were sprayed with 0.5 mM luciferin and placed in darkness for 3 min before detection of luminescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_GUS_Activity_Assay_of_Plant_Extracts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of GUS activity from JAZ1-GUS seedlings was carried out essentially as described (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, JAZ1-GUS fusion protein was collected from 7-d-old JAZ1-GUS seedlings using GUS extraction buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assay GUS activity, 10 L of extract was mixed with 500 L of 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-d-glucuronide in extraction buffer prewarmed to 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10, 30, or 60 min; at each time point, 50 L of the mixture was mixed with 450 L of stop solution (0.2 M sodium carbonate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant fluorescence was measured on a BioTek Synergy Mx multilabel counter, with excitation and emission at 365 nm and 455 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein content was determined according to the Bradford method to normalize GUS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
