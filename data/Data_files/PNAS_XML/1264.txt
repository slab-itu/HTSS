Mechanistic insights into GLUT1 activation and clustering revealed by super-resolution imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many membrane proteins are functioning in aggregations and associating with microdomains, which range from nanometers to micrometers in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is indispensable to directly analyze these proteins and microdomains in native cell membranes at a single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLUT1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, contributing to basal and growth factor-stimulated glucose uptake in many tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is overexpressed in almost all tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we previously mapped GLUT1 on native cell membranes and highlighted key contributions of the lipid raft, cytoskeleton, and glycosylation to the formation of clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we elucidated that the clustered distribution of the transporter was associated with its activation, which is crucial to advance our understanding of the transporters spatial organization and activation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The glucose transporter GLUT1, a plasma membrane protein that mediates glucose homeostasis in mammalian cells, is responsible for constitutive uptake of glucose into many tissues and organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies have focused on its vital physiological functions and close relationship with diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms of its activation and transport are not clear, and its detailed distribution pattern on cell membranes also remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these, we first investigated the distribution and assembly of GLUT1 at a nanometer resolution by super-resolution imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On HeLa cell membranes, the transporter formed clusters with an average diameter of 250 nm, the majority of which were regulated by lipid rafts, as well as being restricted in size by both the cytoskeleton and glycosylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, we found that the activation of GLUT1 by azide or MCD did not increase its membrane expression but induced the decrease of the large clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggested that sporadic distribution of GLUT1 may facilitate the transport of glucose, implying a potential association between the distribution and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our work characterized the clustering distribution of GLUT1 and linked its spatial structural organization to the functions, which would provide insights into the activation mechanism of the transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mapping_GLUT1_on_Cell_Membranes_Using_STORM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering the fluidity of the cell membrane, we used fixed HeLa cells to observe the distribution of GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the fixation was not adequate, proteins on cell membranes would not be completely immobilized, causing the redistribution of proteins (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, we first optimized the fixation time and found that the morphology of GLUT1 has no significant difference on cell membranes with different fixation time (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 20 min for fixation was used in all subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultured HeLa cells present adherent growth and their adherent side and medium exposed side face different environments, which we think may influence the distribution of GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we used dSTORM to investigate the spatial distribution of GLUT1 on both the medium exposed side and adherent side (see Experimental Section and SI Appendix, Fig S3 for detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed dSTORM images and the corresponding magnified pictures showed that GLUT1 tended to form elliptic and dense clusters on the medium exposed side (Fig 1 A and B) but sparse clusters with irregular shapes on the adherent side (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same phenomenon was also observed on OS-RC-2 cell (human renal carcinoma cell) membranes (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the features of the clusters, we used Ripleys K function (13) to analyze the spatial clustering in nanoscale domains (see SI Appendix, Fig S5 for detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maxima of the L(r)-r (medium exposed side: 180 ± 20, adherent side: 101 ± 4) in Fig 1E indicated that the degree of clustering on the medium exposed side was higher than that on the adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rmax value corresponding to the maximum of L(r)-r was defined as the average size of the analyzed clusters in the region of 2 × 2 m2, which showed that GLUT1 formed clusters with an average diameter of 250 ± 20 nm on the medium exposed side and 137 ± 16 nm on the adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also extracted the information of the amount (Fig 1F) and size (Fig 1G) of the GLUT1 clusters on the medium exposed side and adherent side of HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the transporter formed much more and larger clusters on the medium exposed side than on the adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further clarify the sporadic GLUT1 and the molecular organization in clusters, we applied semiquantitative analysis (Experimental Section) to calculate the amount of distribution of sporadic GLUT1 (one molecule) and clustered GLUT1 containing more than two molecules (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical result showed that GLUT1 formed clusters with different numbers of molecules, ranging from 2 to more than 10, but a few were more than 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small clusters containing two to four molecules were in the majority.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, more large clusters that consisted of more than four molecules were found to generate on the medium exposed side, while sporadic GLUT1 were more on the adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By comparison, we found that GLUT1 formed clusters with different numbers and sizes on HeLa medium exposed side and adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-density and large-diameter clusters were seen on the medium exposed side, while sparse and small clusters were observed on the adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discrepancies may be caused by the varying external environments experienced by different surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium exposed side are entirely exposed to the external environment and are able to contact with more external factors, such as hormones and extracellular growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previous studies reported that growth factors like IGF and SCF can increase glucose metabolism (34), it is thus possible that the changes of glucose levels induced by extracellular factors could result in the difference of GLUT1 distribution on the medium exposed side and adherent side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interactions_Between_GLUT1_and_Lipid_Rafts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many studies have been reported that GLUT1 is partly localized to DRM domains and that the transporter activity is sensitive to the phospholipid and cholesterol environment (12, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, several studies have depicted that lipid rafts exist as nanodomains or microdomains on the cell membrane (14, 35), and our previous studies also observed lipid rafts with the size ranging from 10 to 200 nm (14, 36, 37), which was consistent with the average diameter of GLUT1 (200 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we hypothesized that GLUT1 clustering might be associated with lipid rafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this assumption, dual-color dSTORM imaging was performed to locate the lipid rafts and GLUT1 on the medium exposed side of HeLa cells (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The merged image of lipid rafts and GLUT1 (Fig 2C) showed a degree of colocalization between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manders coefficients (38), M1 and M2, were used to analyze said colocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coefficients represented the amount of colocalized pixels relative to the total covered by each component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on their values, we sorted the positional relationships into four types: overlap (M1/M2  greater than  0.66, Fig 2D), partial overlap (0.33 less_than M1/M2 less_than0.66, Fig 2E), edge connection (0 less_than M1 and M2 less_than 0.33, Fig 2F), and isolation (M1/M2 = 0, Fig 2G), then we determined the percentage of the four localization states (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlap and partial overlap were collectively referred to as colocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data showed that 35% (overlap: 11%, partial overlap: 24%) of total GLUT1 was associated with lipid rafts, whereas the remaining might be localized in other lipid compositions of rafts or nonlipid rafts domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hinted us that the clusters formation was not only affected by lipid rafts and there might be other factors that contributed to the aggregation of GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Rafts_Disruption_Weakens_GLUT1_Clustering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reasons why GLUT1 clusters did not totally colocalize with GM1-enriched lipid rafts (CT-B labeled) may be two: (i) other compositions of rafts may colocalize with GLUT1 clusters; and (ii) other factors may participate in regulating clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we decided to further confirm the role of lipid rafts at first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated HeLa cells with 10 mM methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) for 2030 min, which can remove the cholesterol from the lipid rafts (39), to investigate whether the alteration of the cholesterol environment could influence GLUT1 distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a lot of GLUT1 clusters became smaller or even disappeared after adding MCD (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ripleys K-function plots indicated that the degree of clustering decreased dramatically and that the average diameter of the clusters dropped from 250 nm to 140 nm (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the number of clusters per unit area reduced from 2.3 ± 0.3 to 1.2 ± 0.3 (Fig 3F), and clusters consisting of more than two molecules declined sharply (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out the destructive possibility of MCD on membrane structure or other membrane constituents, we performed the experiment of cholesterol repletion (MCD saturated with cholesterol at a MCD:cholesterol molar ratio of 8:1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S6A, lipid rafts returned to the clustered structure after repletion of cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localizations and size of lipid rafts decreased sharply with MCD treatment, while these values increased to the level of control cells after cholesterol repletion (SI Appendix, Fig S6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results indicated that MCD had no effect on other constitutes except lipid rafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also validated that GLUT1 clusters formed again and the average cluster size recovered to that on control cell membranes (0.12 m2) (SI Appendix, Fig S6 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dual-color imaging, together with the disruption and repletion of lipid rafts, demonstrated that the stable existence of most GLUT1 clusters is dependent on the integrality of lipid rafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The destruction of lipid rafts may induce to partial or complete fragmentation of larger GLUT1 clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, although the number of large clusters reduced after MCD treatment, there were a portion of GLUT1 that still formed clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was consistent with that only 35% of GLUT1 colocalized with lipid rafts, suggesting other mechanisms in regulation of its distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Limitation_of_the_Actin_Cytoskeleton_in_GLUT1_Clustering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As above mentioned, there are other factors participating in GLUT1 clustering, and previous studies have reported that various membrane channel proteins directly interact with actin (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to clarify whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in controlling the distribution and clustering of GLUT1, we first imaged GLUT1 on HeLa membranes treated by 20 g/mL cytochalasin B (CB) for 30 min, which can depolymerize actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average cluster area (Fig 4) and the molecules within clusters (SI Appendix, Fig S7A) decreased significantly compared with that on control cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CB not only inhibits actin filaments from generating networks, but also weakens glucose transport by interacting with the substrate efflux site (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also showed that CB-treated cells consumed less glucose than control (see Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the effect of glucose transport on GLUT1 distribution, we used another inhibitor cytochalasin D (CD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, it inhibits actin polymerization but hardly affects the cellular permeability to sugars (41), which was supported by our data of glucose consumption as well (see Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After CD treatment, the total localizations of GLUT1 did not change, whereas clusters became scattered and small (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrated that the disruption of actin filaments limited the ability of GLUT1 to form clusters, but did not change its total level, therefore verifying the role of actin cytoskeleton in transporter clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Impairment_of_N-Glycosylation_Disruption_in_GLUT1_Clustering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glycosylation is a prevalent protein modification with a profound effect on protein stability, folding, and a multitude of biological processes (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since GLUT1 owns an N-glycosylation site, we presupposed that GLUT1 clustering would be related to glycosylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove this, HeLa cells were pretreated with 50 g/mL N-acetyl--d-gulcosaminides (NAG) for 30 min, which has an effective transglycosylation of N-acetyl--d-gulcosaminides, a common motif of N-linked sugar chains in proteins (36); then the nanoscale organizations of GLUT1 on cell membranes were investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deglycosylation made GLUT1 clusters disperse, and almost all of the large clusters disappeared (Fig 5 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the Ripleys K function analysis (Fig 5E), we found that the degree of clustering and the diameter of GLUT1 clusters fell down significantly (from 250 nm to 130 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further statistical data indicated that there was a distinguishable decline in both the number of localizations (Fig 5F) and clusters (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, sporadic molecules and clusters containing two molecules increased, whereas other large clusters with more than two molecules fell down (SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasons for the decrease of cluster size and number might be two: One is that deglycosylation directly inhibits the formation of clusters, and the other is that the lower level of total GLUT1 could not generate larger and more clusters as it could on control cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not determine which one or both were the right reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even so, the results clearly supported the hypothesis that glycosylation was an indispensable element in maintaining of the distribution and clustering of GLUT1 on cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Effect_of_GLUT1_Activation_on_Its_Clustering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exposure to osmotic or metabolic stimuli like MCD or azide can increase the maximal transfer rate of GLUT1 (12, 34), we wondered what changes would be brought to GLUT1s membrane distribution by activating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, we first performed glucose uptake assay to confirm the activation of sodium azide and MCD on GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7, the glucose consumption increased, and the cell viability did not change after treatment with azide or MCD, validating that these two reagents can effectively activate glucose transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we used 5 mM sodium azide to stimulate the adherent HeLa cells for 30 min before staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the reconstructed dSTORM images, most of the molecules on treated membranes seemed to form clusters in the same way as those on control membranes (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further Ripleys K function analysis and statistical results showed some differences in the size, number, and molecular organization of GLUT1 clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total localizations of GLUT1 remained stable (Fig 6D), and even the cluster number reduced slightly on azide-treated cell membranes (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the degree of clustering and diameter of clusters reduced, which was only 170 ± 25 nm (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the number of monomer GLUT1 increased following activation, and small clusters with less than five molecules went up significantly (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that the activation of GLUT1 might change the molecular organization of clusters and inhibit the formation of large clusters on cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At this time, we focused on the results of MCD treatment again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster number decreased (Fig 3F) and only monomer GLUT1 increased, but small clusters with less than four molecules were not as many as those on control cells (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicated that the inhibition of MCD on GLUT1 clustering was stronger than that of sodium azide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is easy to understand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCD has two functions, i.e., disrupting lipid rafts and activating glucose transporter, both of which can weaken the clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we also tested the influence of CB, CD, and NAG treatment on the activity of glucose transport (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only CB reduced the glucose uptake compared with control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CB has two antagonistic effects on clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is inhibiting actin polymerization that could limit the aggregation of GLUT1, the opposite one is inhibiting GLUT1 activity that may induce the formation of clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the changes of clustering features after adding CB were not as obvious as those with CD treatment (Fig 4), because CD only affects the actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NAG groups, we thought the glucose consumption would decrease due to the disruption of N-glycosylation, while it did not change as we expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be because there is another family of glucose transporters, sodium-linked glucose transporters (SGLTs) (43), which are not affected by the deglycosylation of NAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the detailed molecular mechanism for the clustering of GLUT1 and glucose uptake is complex; even so, our findings revealed a potential relationship between GLUT1 clustering and activation and suggested that small clusters may be more beneficial to glucose transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, by the combination of dSTORM imaging and proposed single molecule analysis methods, we observed that most of GLUT1 was aggregated in clusters on the HeLa membrane and found a precise spatial association between GLUT1 and lipid rafts, which resolved the debate surrounding on the localization of the transporter in membrane domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the organizational mechanism of GLUT1 clusters, our study revealed that not only the lipid rafts environment can stabilize their existence, but also the actin cytoskeleton and N-glycosylation play important roles in the clusters formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, under the activation by MCD and sodium azide, we found that many transporters were prone to distribute sporadically or form small clusters, which might facilitate glucose uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to directly visualize the transporters distribution at a nanometric resolution provided crucial information of clustering features, clarified many regulatory factors, and captured a probable relationship between GLUT1 distribution and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With further studies such as mutation and simultaneously observation of multiple glucose transporters, these initial observations may form a significant step forward in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of GLUT clustering and glucose uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
