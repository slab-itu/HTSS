Global risk model for vector-borne transmission of Zika virus reveals the role of El Niño 2015  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study quantifies the impact of climate variability on Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission by two mosquito vectors with distinct characteristics: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed climate data were used to dynamically drive a two vectorsone host R0 epidemiological model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our modeling results indicate that temperature conditions related to the 2015 El Niño climate phenomenon were exceptionally conducive for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus is believed to have entered the continent earlier in 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implicates that such a large ZIKV outbreak occurred not solely because of the introduction of ZIKV in a naive population, but because the climatic conditions were optimal for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America in 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a climate-driven R0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two key mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 19502015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 20152016 El Niño climate phenomenon affecting the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti is abundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our R0 model output (Fig 1 A and B) captures well the observed largely tropical distribution of ZIKV transmission (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the 1950s, ZIKV transmission or seropositivity has been reported in several African countries, Pakistan, India, southeastern Asia, and parts of Oceania (22), and it recently spread in 2015 and 2016 to Latin American countries, Florida, Thailand, and the Philippines (Fig 1C), where importantly, large R0 values are simulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been speculated that the epidemiologically naïve population of people in South America may account for the size of the outbreak there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this statement is very likely true, our model also finds the average R0 of ZIKV to be greater in South America than in any other region of the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other areas with high values of R0 are some African countries (Côte dIvoire, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and Asian countries (India, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, and Thailand), where ZIKV circulation was also previously reported (7, 8, 2229).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model finds southern and southeastern Asia to be suitable for ZIKV transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV was first identified in Asia nearly 50 y ago (28), but there have not been significant outbreaks recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model seems to underpredict for Egypt, because it does not find Egypt to be suitable for ZIKV transmission, although seropositive people have been reported there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the prevalence in Egypt is believed to be very low (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The R0 model output is further validated against other published estimates of R0 for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Colombia as a whole (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum; 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles; and maximum R0 values simulated for Rio de Janeiro (0, 3.4, 3.9, 4.3, and 5, respectively) are very similar to estimates in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 (0, 3.2, 3.8, 4, and 4.6, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated R0 values for Colombia range from 0 to 6.9, with a median value of 4.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are also in good agreement with preliminary R0 estimates for ZIKV in Colombia (3, 3.9, and 6.6) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The climate data are unfortunately too spatially coarse to obtain R0 estimates for small islands in Oceania, where Zika outbreaks were also reported in the last decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, if one assumes that ZIKV transmission might occur where dengue virus transmission was reported because of the similarity of both viruses and their mosquito vectors, the ZIKV R0 model captures about 96% of dengue occurrence points as reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33 (SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated the effect of seasonal change in climate on the risk of ZIKV transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our R0 model shows that boreal summer temperature conditions lead to increased R0 values over temperate regions where both vectors (or only Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus) are present (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the model outputs suggest that the environmental conditions might be suitable for ZIKV transmission to occur over a wider geographical range than has currently been observed (Fig 1A), particularly when considering the seasonal peak in R0 (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the South American continent, R0 values are large all year and peak during the boreal winter and spring (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Africa, the largest R0 values are simulated over southern Africa during boreal winter and the Sahelian region during boreal summer and fall (SI Appendix, Fig S4), which correspond to the peak of the rainy season over these regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over Asia, R0 values are relatively large all year in Oceania, whereas a clear peak in R0 is shown during boreal summer and fall over India, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During boreal summer, a large increase in R0 is simulated over the southeastern states of the United States (SI Appendix, Fig S6), and smaller increases are simulated over southern Europe (SI Appendix, Fig S7) and southern China (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large R0 summer values over the southeastern states of the United States are because of both very conducive temperature conditions and the spatial overlap of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our model indicates that there is a large potential risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern United States and to a lesser extent, over southern China and southern Europe in boreal summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal mainly relates to the presence of the highly invasive Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus in temperate regions (SI Appendix, Fig S8) as well as higher biting rates (SI Appendix, Fig S9), lower EIPs (SI Appendix, Fig S10), and lower mortality rates (SI Appendix, Fig S11) during the warm season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modeling framework also allows investigation of the respective contributions of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus to the total R0 burden (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the selected parameter settings, which are based on the published literature, Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti is responsible for 90% of ZIKV transmission risk in the tropics, whereas Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus seems to make a smaller contribution (less than 10%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus is, however, the main vector responsible for ZIKV transmission risk in temperate areas, such as the northern United States and southern Europe (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VBDs are not just affected by seasonal variations in climate; extreme climatic anomalies can also favor epidemics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the strongest El Niño events ever recorded occurred in 20152016, and there have been concerns about its possible impact on VBD burden (34) and agricultural production worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  El Niño events are characterized by the movement of warmer than average sea surface temperatures across the central Pacific basin and associated with warmer temperature conditions over the Tropics and rainfall anomalies that vary greatly by region and season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the impact of El Niño on potential ZIKV transmission risk at a global scale, we derived the R0 relative anomaly for 2015 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large positive anomalies in R0 are simulated over the Tropics, meaning that climate conditions were particularly conducive for ZIKV transmission in 2015 relative to the long-term average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal can be seen over South America (especially Colombia and Brazil) but also, in Africa (with the largest anomaly shown over Angola), southern India, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although intense ZIKV transmission was only reported over Central America and South America in 2015, the virus is believed to have entered the region in 2013 (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standardized model anomalies calculated for the South American continent further reveal that 2015 was the year with the highest R0 value (exceeding 2 SDs) over the whole 66-y time period (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This R0 maximum is mainly related to simulated maximum biting rates, minimum EIPs, and mortality rates in 2015 (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13 and S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large positive anomaly is also shown for the 19971998 El Niño before ZIKV was introduced to the South American continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our model indicates that the 2015 El Niño event, superimposed on the long-term global warming trend, has had an important amplification effect through its impacts on mosquito vector and their overall ability to transmit virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model provided interesting insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of potential disease transmission risk, permitted the relative contributions of the two main disease vectors to be quantified, and implicates the current El Niño in playing an important amplification role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that warm temperature conditions associated with the current El Niño climate phenomenon superimposed on the warming trend were exceptionally conducive for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV in 2015 over the South American continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conducive temperature conditions in 2015 over South America can be related to the superposition of climate change and decadal and year to year variability (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, R0 modeling work for the risk of bluetongue, an animal VBD that emerged in northern Europe in 2006, highlighted that temperature conditions in northern Europe in that particular year were also exceptionally conducive for disease transmission (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other notable impacts of El Niño 20152016 are historical droughts impacting food security in Ethiopia and southern Africa and forest fires in California, Canada, Malaysia, and Indonesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of dengue cases in India in 2015 was the largest recorded (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our model finds one of the largest 2015 R0 anomalies for ZIKV in Africa to be centered on Angola.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ZIKV has not been recently reported, Angola is currently experiencing a large outbreak of Yellow Fever transmitted by Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti, and we speculate, therefore, that this outbreak might also have been favored by El Niño conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding raises additional concerns about the impact of large El Niño events on VBD risk in a future warmer, more connected world with increasing levels of drug and insecticide resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flaviviruses, in general, should have a promising future (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results corroborate that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti, likely because of its anthropophilic behavior and its aggressiveness, is a larger threat than Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus for ZIKV transmission worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the threat posed by Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus is not negligible, especially during the warm season in temperate regions, and the overlap of both vector species produces the largest R0 values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in Europe in recent years, Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus was responsible for a small number of autochthonous cases of chikungunya and dengue in Italy, southern France, and Croatia, whereas Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti was responsible for more than 2,000 cases of dengue on the island of Madeira in 2012 (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is a need to focus disease preparedness measures or vector control interventions primarily in regions infested by Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti or where both vectors co-occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simulated spatial distribution of ZIKV is similar to other published estimates, which used environmental covariates and the boosted regression tree method to estimate environmental suitability for ZIKV at global scale (42) or a one-host, one-vector R0 modeling approach to derive attack rates for Latin America (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model framework further allowed for exploring of spatial and temporal changes in potential disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed the potential of ZIKV transmission during boreal summer over the southeastern states of the United States as previously considered by others (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autochthonous transmission of ZIKV was observed in Florida in the summer of 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only a few cases were reported so far; because there is large proportion (80%) of asymptomatic infections with ZIKV, more people might be infected without showing any clinical signs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are several caveats in our modeling framework that need to be mentioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we did not consider sexual transmission of ZIKV, because it likely plays a very minor role in the overall amount of transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we only considered the risk posed by Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus, believed to be the main competent vectors of ZIKV (and certain other arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya viruses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other Aedes species can transmit ZIKV locally (such as Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hensilli in Pacific islands and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus in parts of Africa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also a debate about the capacity of the geographically widespread Culex quinquefasciatus vector to transmit ZIKV (4547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most recent studies are showing poor or no competence of this species to transmit ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model might, therefore, underestimate R0 in some localities where vectors other than Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti or Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mathematical framework can be readily extended to include additional vectors, but limitations arise from the lack of detailed distribution and epidemiological data for these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is an urgent need for additional studies on vectors of ZIKV and their distribution, abundance, and transmission parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, estimates of vector to host ratios for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus were approximated from probability of occurrences, because they were limited by the large spatial and temporal differences in published field studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional estimates of mosquito densities in different demographic and geographic settings, preferably with standardized methods (48), will be highly useful to improve and upscale mechanistic spatiotemporal risk models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV EIPs were approximated by dengue virus estimates in our study, because they were similar in high-temperature settings (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better estimates of the dependency of the EIP of ZIKV to temperature, especially in the lower and higher temperature tails of the distribution, will be highly valuable for additional model refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our R0 model presents the risk of transmission given the introduction of virus in a fully susceptibility population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not address the potential of the pathogen and the vectors to spread via tourism and trade or the risk of transmission in populations that have already been exposed to ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent modeling work suggests that the ZIKV epidemic in Latin America should be over in 3 y maximum and that acquired herd immunity will likely cause a delay of more than a decade until large epidemics reemerge (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand have been estimated at risk for mosquito-borne ZIKV infection because of the large volume of travelers arriving from affected areas in Latin America (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, socioeconomic factors (such as health service per capita, urbanization, and vulnerability indices) should be included in assessments of the full impact of Zika in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model uses recently published studies by the medical, biological, and entomological communities; it benefits from statistical (51) and mathematical (13) modeling techniques and recent environmental datasets produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact underlines the importance of taking multidisciplinary approaches to address and anticipate the health and food security challenges to come.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
R0_Model_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate R0 for ZIKV transmission, we adapted the two hoststwo vectors expression derived from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression is suitable for pathogens, including bluetongue virus, that have two main hosts and two main vectors with different feeding preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ZIKV, there is one main host (i.e., humans) capable of transmitting the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we prevented the second host from contracting and transmitting the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus feed to different extents on humans, we retained the measures of feeding preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because infection with ZIKV is not associated with mortality, the standard pathogen-induced mortality rate (d) was set to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting expression isR0=R11+R22,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
whereR11=(b11a121)(11+1)(12m1r)andR22=(b22a222)(22+2)(22m2r).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rij is the average number of infectious vectors of type i produced by an infectious vector of type j; one stands for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti, and two stands for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of the second host being noninfectious, the between-species terms R12 and R21 are eliminated from R0 (additional details are given in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, this expression for R0 is true for any number of hosts, providing that only one of them is a true host (i.e., capable of transmitting the infection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biting rates (a), mortality rates (), and EIPs (eip = 1/) for both vector species are the only parameters dynamically relying on temperature data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dependencies to temperature were calculated based on published evidence from the literature (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vector preferences (), transmission probabilities (from vector to host b and host to vector ), and ZIKV recovery rate (r) were assumed to be constant, and they were derived from recently published estimates for ZIKV or dengue virus if they were not available (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vector to host ratios (m1 and m2) were derived from published probability of occurrence (prob1 and prob2) at global scale (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the large differences in mosquito density estimates published in the literature for different regions and seasons (48), these probabilities of occurrences (01) have been arbitrarily linearly rescaled to range between zero and a maximum estimate of vector to host ratio following the work in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This maximum was estimated as an order of magnitude (SI Appendix, Fig S16) using the maximum ZIKV R0 value to calibrate it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maximum R0 value of 6.6 was reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 for Colombia during the outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This maximum R0 value is reached when the vector to host ratio value reaches about 1,000 in the model between 30 °C and 37 °C (SI Appendix, Fig S16C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constraint is on the maximum solely; however, the model reproduces well the distribution of R0 values with respect to other published estimates (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower values for m are generally reported by entomologists [10 is a commonly reported value (48)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this value depends on the selected field method to estimate m. Values of 52 Aedes mosquitoes per person per hour have been reported in Macao using human baits, 1.8 mosquitoes per hour have been reported using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traps, and 110 mosquitoes per hour have been reported using aspirators (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both Aedes species are active from dawn to dusk (e.g., over 12 h maximum, with a peak of activity in the early morning and late afternoon), this is equivalent to 624, 21.6, and 1,320 mosquitoes per day, respectively, thus including the selected maximum if we assume that a trap is a potential host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biting rate estimates for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti of about 150 bites per person per day were reported for Thailand over a 7-mo period (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Macao, biting rates were reported to range between 94 and 314 bites per person per day (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our estimates of (m × a) range between 100 and 250 bites per person per day for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti and between 25 and 125 bites per person per day for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus if we assume m = 1,000 (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The percentages of R0 attributed to Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti (R11/R02) and Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albopictus (R22/R02) were derived from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, which can be rewritten as 1 = 100% = R11/R02 + R22/R02.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An explicit mathematical derivation of the R0 model is provided in SI Appendix; parameter setting details and the publication references used to estimate them are shown and discussed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

R0_Model_Integration_and_Driving_Datasets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Zika R0 model is dynamic, meaning that some epidemiological parameters are varying in both space and time from 1948 to 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model runs on a monthly time step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incorporate rainfall seasonality effects, we used a criterion derived for malaria in Africa within the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa project framework [e.g., 80 mm per month for at least five months for stable transmission (56)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the criterion was not met, we assumed that R0 = 0 for a particular location and month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spatially varying parameters were interpolated to the temperature data grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For temperature, we used gridded data, which combine station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 with the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This monthly temperature dataset is available at 0.5° × 0.5°-square resolution at global scale for the period 19482015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For rainfall, we used the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre global rainfall data available at similar spatial and time resolution for the same time period (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

R0_Model_Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Countries with active transmission of ZIKV (Fig 1C) were obtained from the CDC at www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control at ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/zika_virus_infection/zika-outbreak/pages/zika-countries-with-transmission.aspx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historical circulation of ZIKV at country scale (including seroprevalence estimates) was derived from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22 and 57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline R0 estimates for Rio de Janeiro (Fig 2) were mathematically derived from reported cases provided by the Brazilian Notifiable Information System (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R0 estimates for Colombia (Fig 2) were mathematically derived from reported cases provided by the Instituto Nacional de Salud de Bogotá (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
