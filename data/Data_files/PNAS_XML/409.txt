EpsteinBarr virus microRNAs reduce immune surveillance by virus-specific CD8+ T cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most humans are infected for their lifetime with EpsteinBarr virus (EBV), which can cause cancer and other EBV-associated diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infected individuals develop strong immune responses to this virus, in particular cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, but viral infection is never cleared nor is EBV eliminated from the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that certain viral molecules might prevent effective elimination of EBV-infected cells by CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV is rich in genes coding for microRNAs, many with unknown function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that viral microRNAs interfere with recognition and killing of EBV-infected cells by CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple mechanisms and molecules are targeted by microRNAs to achieve this immune evasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, targeting of viral microRNAs may improve antiviral immunity and therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infection with EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) affects most humans worldwide and persists life-long in the presence of robust virus-specific T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both immunocompromised and some immunocompetent people, EBV causes several cancers and lymphoproliferative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV transforms B cells in vitro and encodes at least 44 microRNAs (miRNAs), most of which are expressed in EBV-transformed B cells, but their functions are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we showed that EBV miRNAs inhibit CD4+ T-cell responses to infected B cells by targeting IL-12, MHC class II, and lysosomal proteases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigated whether EBV miRNAs also counteract surveillance by CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found that EBV miRNAs strongly inhibit recognition and killing of infected B cells by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells through multiple mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV miRNAs directly target the peptide transporter subunit TAP2 and reduce levels of the TAP1 subunit, MHC class I molecules, and EBNA1, a protein expressed in most forms of EBV latency and a target of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, miRNA-mediated down-regulation of the cytokine IL-12 decreases the recognition of infected cells by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EBV miRNAs use multiple, distinct pathways, allowing the virus to evade surveillance not only by CD4+ but also by antiviral CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

EBV_MiRNAs_Support_Survival_of_Infected_B_Cells_in_the_Presence_of_CD8+_T_Cells_from_EBV-Positive_Donors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used in vitro infection of primary human B cells as a simple but representative model of EBV infection (Fig 1A) to evaluate if EBV miRNAs counteract immune surveillance by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells (CD19+) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EBV-positive donors were infected with two EBV strains: the laboratory strain B95-8 (WT/B95-8), expressing 13 viral miRNAs, and its derivative miR, expressing no viral miRNAs (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve hours later, autologous CD8+ T cells were added, and the cells were cocultured for 4 wk (Fig 1B), when cell viability was tested in MTT assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surviving cells were further analyzed by flow cytometry for their identification (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the absence of T cells, we observed robust proliferation of B cells infected with miR or WT/B95-8 EBV (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of T cells, the survival and outgrowth of infected B cells was decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong reduction of viable cells was achieved by fewer CD8+ T cells for cells infected with miR EBV than cells infected with WT/B95-8 EBV (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry analyses showed that B cells represented the viable cells in most of the cultures (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that EBV miRNAs protect EBV-infected B lymphocytes from eradication by antiviral CD8+ T cells under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EBV_MiRNAs_Inhibit_Recognition__Killing__and_Expansion_of_EBV-Specific_CD8+_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier studies had shown that B-cell survival could be compromised in cells infected with the miR EBV devoid of miRNAs, because some viral miRNAs contribute to EBV-associated cellular transformation in the early phase of infection (3638).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate a possible role of viral miRNAs in controlling immune functions of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells, we established polyclonal EBV-specific CD8+ T cells from different donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted primary CD8+ T cells were stimulated every 2 wk with irradiated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which had been established by infecting primary autologous B cells with WT/B95-8 EBV (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For T-cell effector assays, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells established in this way were cocultured with B cells that had been infected with WT/B95-8 or miR EBV 15 d earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell activation was quantified by measuring IFN- concentration in the cell culture supernatants after 16 h or by determining cytolysis of infected cells after 4 h. We observed significantly reduced IFN- secretion in response to cells infected with WT/B95-8 relative to cells infected with miR EBV, both in autologous (Fig 2B and Table S1) and HLA-matched conditions (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, T cells were not activated by HLA-mismatched infected B cells or in B-cellfree cultures, indicating that the observed activation was HLA-restricted and EBV-specific (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cytotoxicity assays, we found that the viral miRNAs inhibited killing of infected B cells by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells at all B:T cell ratios and at any HLA-matched conditions tested (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It did not matter whether EBV-specific CD8+ T-cell cultures had been generated by expansion with miR or WT/B95-8 EBV-infected B cells; in each case, miR EBV-infected B cells were better recognized than B cells infected with WT/B95-8 EBV (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because clonal expansion is essential for effective antiviral T-cell responses, we also investigated the selective expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in response to autologous B cells infected with either WT/B95-8 or miR EBV (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From PBMCs of 10 donors, we sorted CD8+ T cells and stimulated them twice on day 0 and day 10 with irradiated autologous B cells, which had been infected for 15 d with WT/B95-8 or miR EBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total numbers of CD8+ T cells obtained at days 10 and 20 (after one or two stimulations) were significantly higher after expansion with miR EBV-infected cells compared with WT/B95-8 EBV-infected cells (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same setting, we also analyzed the expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells that were specific for five different epitopes from EBV proteins latent membrane protein (LMP)2A, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)1, and EBNA3A (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consistently found increased expansion in response to miR EBV-infected cells for each of these specificities (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data suggest that viral miRNAs in EBV-infected B cells reduce clonal expansion of a wide range of antiviral CD8+ effector T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EBV_MiRNAs_Inhibit_MHC_Class_I_Antigen_Processing_and_Presentation_Pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We screened cellular transcripts targeted by EBV miRNAs and likely critical in fending off antiviral CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify potential targets, we performed high-throughput screening with primary B lymphocytes infected with the different EBV strains and a combination of RNA and RNA induced silencing complexes-immunoprecipitation (RISC-IP) sequencing (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach, we identified IL12B and three genes (IFI30, the IFN--regulated thiol reductase GILT; LGMN, the asparagine endopeptidase AEP alias legumain; and CTSB, the peptidase cathepsin B) encoding lysosomal enzymes and important for CD4+ T-cell differentiation and antigen processing as direct targets of viral miRNAs (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focused on genes consistently inhibited by EBV miRNAs and known to play a role in antigen processing and presentation and cytokinecytokine receptor interactions or are considered cell adhesion molecules according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway categories (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of corresponding mRNAs was also enriched in our RISC-IP sequencing analysis (Table 1), indicating that these mRNAs were most likely direct targets of EBV miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TAP1 and TAP2 were significantly down-regulated in RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments, and TAP2 was also found enriched in RISC-IP sequencing (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer mediates transport of antigenic peptides into the ER lumen, where they are loaded onto MHC class I molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presentation of many EBV epitopes depends on TAP (39), and thus we delineated the mechanisms by which EBV miRNAs regulate it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we verified the regulation of TAP1/2 expression by viral miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen days post infection expression of TAP1 and TAP2 was reduced in B cells infected with WT/B95-8 EBV compared with miR EBV both at the level of transcript (Fig 3A) and protein (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we verified that IPO7 (Importin-7), a known target of EBV miR-BART3 (40), was also down-regulated (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because RISC-IP (Table 1) in combination with the in silico target algorithm TargetScan (41) predicted that the 3UTR of TAP2 was directly targeted by EBV miRNAs, we performed dual luciferase reporter assays to test this assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cotransfected HEK293T cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3UTR of TAP2 and single expression plasmids, each of which encoded one viral primary miRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expression of exogenous miR-BHRF13 significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the TAP2 reporter (Fig 3C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mutation within the 3UTR in the seed-matching region abolished this inhibition completely, demonstrating that TAP2 is a direct target of miR-BHRF13 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, miR-BART17, which is expressed in EBV field strains but not in the WT/B95-8 strain, targeted the 3UTR of the TAP2 directly at one of two predicted sites (Fig 3C; predicted seed sequences are provided in Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we did not observe a regulation of the TAP1 3UTR by any viral miRNA present in WT/B95-8 EBV (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggested that TAP1 may not be a direct target of EBV miRNAs, consistent with our RISC-IP data (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A parallel dual luciferase reporter assay performed for IPO7 served as a positive control together with miR-BART3 in these assays (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we quantified the levels of classical HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) cell-surface expression on WT/B95-8 or miR EBV-infected B cells during the course of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steady-state surface levels of HLA class I molecules are a function of TAP activities, as HLA class I molecules lacking peptides are unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consistently observed a slight reduction by 1020% of overall surface MHC class I molecules in cells infected with WT/B95-8 relative to miR EBV during the entire observation period (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By assaying individual HLA class I alleles, we found that HLA-B*07, B*08, and B*40 allotypes were reduced by 2030%, whereas HLA-A*02 levels were not reduced (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the known preference of HLA-A*02 (but not of the other allotypes investigated here) to bind highly hydrophobic peptides, some of which reach the ER independently of TAP (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed for HLA-B*07 and B*08, but direct targeting by miRNAs could not be demonstrated (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EBV_MiRNAs_Control_Multiple_Facets_of_Viral_Immune_Evasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results suggested that EBV miRNAs impose allele-specific controls of HLA molecules, namely affecting HLA-B allotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore asked if HLA-B allotype-restricted antigen presentation is directly controlled by viral miRNAs (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cocultured infected B cells and CD8+ T-cell clones specific for the IED or the FLY epitope, both of which are derived from the viral LMP2 protein (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presentation of the B*40:01-restricted IED epitope is dependent on active TAP transportation (39), whereas the HLA-A*02:01restricted epitope FLY is highly hydrophobic and presented TAP-independently (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a time course experiment with B cells infected with either WT/B95-8 or miR EBV, we observed reactivity of the clonal T cells as early as 57 d post infection (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV miRNAs significantly reduced the activation of the IED-specific T-cell clone (Fig 4B) as expected from the down-regulation of the TAP complex and subsequent reduction of HLA-B molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the activation of the FLY-specific T-cell clone was also strongly reduced (Fig 4C) even though FLY is a TAP-independent peptide and presented via HLA-A*02:01, which was not affected by the expression of EBV miRNAs (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments strongly supported the presence of additional immunoevasive mechanisms that affect recognition of the FLY epitope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the possibility that LMP2A/B gene expression may be regulated by EBV miRNAs, we evaluated the gene transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR in infected B cells 15 d post infection and found LMP2A/B unaffected by viral miRNAs (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, LMP1, a known target of EBV miRNAs (43, 44), was down-regulated as expected (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, LMP2 protein levels did not depend on viral miRNAs (Fig 4E), substantiating the conclusion that EBV miRNAs regulate the activation of LMP2A/B epitope-specific T-cell clones without affecting the viral source of the epitopes they recognize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to LMP2A, EBNA1 transcripts appeared to be under the control of viral miRNAs (Fig 4D) (35), also resulting in decreased levels of EBNA1 protein 15 d post infection (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested the recognition of the HPV epitope of EBNA1 presented by the HLA-B*35:01 allele in a time course experiment (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After only 1 day post infection, the HPV-specific T-cell clone was clearly activated but only when challenged with miR EBV-infected B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later on, B cells infected with either virus presented the HPV peptide, but miR EBV-infected B cells were preferentially recognized (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulation of TAP (Fig 3 AC); lower surface levels of the presenting HLA-B allele, which might be down-regulated similar to other HLA-B allotypes (Fig 3F); and reduced levels of EBNA1 gene expression (Fig 4E) may all have contributed to this result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of EBNA1 epitope presentation did not reveal why TAP-independent LMP2A-derived peptides presented via HLA-A*0201 were under the control of viral miRNAs (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated that other costimulatory molecules or proinflammatory cytokines (35) may be responsible for this TAP-independent immunoevasive function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, IL-12, which contributes to the activation of effector T-cell functions (45), was a possible candidate because it is a direct and prominent target of at least five different EBV miRNAs 5 d post infection (35) and was also down-regulated at the transcript level 15 d post infection (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we neutralized IL-12 secreted from EBV-infected B cells with a suitable antibody and measured IFN- secretion by the FLY-specific T-cell clone (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-12 neutralization dramatically reduced the activation of the T cells cocultured with miR EBV-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell activation with WT/B95-8 EBV-infected target cells was also affected but to a lesser extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very similar results were observed with polyclonal EBV-specific CD8+ T cells cocultured with HLA-matched infected B cells (Fig 4H), showing that miRNA-mediated regulation of IL-12 was globally decreasing recognition by CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect, which was clearly evident for EBV-specific CD8+ T cells, was mild with EBV-specific CD4+ T cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we show that EBV miRNAs inhibit surveillance of EBV by CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral miRNAs reduce virus-specific proliferation, cytokine production, and killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells with various EBV latent epitope specificities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified several mechanisms for this inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, miRNAs target TAP2 directly, down-regulate the entire TAP complex, and reduce HLA allotypes that preferentially present TAP-dependent epitopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, miRNAs repress EBNA1, which limits the level of a protein but is essential during most forms of EBV latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, miRNAs diminish IL-12 release by infected B cells, reducing the virus-specific activity of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EBV miRNAs limit surveillance by CD8+ T cells through multiple mechanisms, likely contributing to the maintenance of lifelong infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is an attractive hypothesis (35) that T-cell immunoevasion in latency would be most economically achieved by miRNAs due to their nonantigenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is now fully substantiated by our present findings that EBV miRNAs interfere with several steps of antigen presentation preventing CD8+ T-cell recognition of latently infected B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are complementary to our previous findings documenting that EBV miRNAs regulate multiple pathways important for differentiation and activation of antiviral CD4+ T cells in the first days of infection (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That study also provided some evidence that CD4+ T-cell recognition is also regulated later, as the structural protein gp350 could be detected by CD4+ T cells in cells 15 d post infection but only when miRNAs were absent (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms of regulation we identified in that contextthat is, regulation of MHC II, lysosomal enzymes, and IL-12are likely relevant in latency as well and may explain why EBNA-specific CD4+ T cells are generally impaired in recognizing LCLs (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study focused on established latency, but because we observed a strong miRNA regulation of EBNA1 recognition by CD8+ T cells already on days 1, 2, and 3 after infection, the hypothesis that EBV miRNAs generally suppress CD8+ T-cell recognition already in the first days of infection during prelatency (13, 22, 47) deserves closer investigation in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An overview of EBV miRNAs that directly target pathways involved in CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell recognition of infected B cells is provided in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As large subsets of viral miRNAs are expressed in all phases of EBVs life cycle (48), it appears plausible that viral miRNAs inhibit these target molecules globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, miRNAs miR-BART1, miR-BART2, and miR-BART22, which target IL-12 (35), are all highly expressed not only in latency III but also in EBV-infected germinal center B cells (latency II) and memory B cells (latency 0/I) from healthy donors as well as different types of EBV-associated cancer cells (34, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, miRNA-mediated reduction of IL-12 could lead to decreased T-cell activation and recognition at different stages of infection and malignant disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among TAP-regulating miRNAs, miR-BHRF13 is predominantly expressed initially upon infection and in latency III in vitro (36), but miR-BART17 also shows expression in memory B cells and cancer cells (48), suggesting that EBV miRNA-mediated TAP regulation could likewise be important in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although EBV-specific immunity is likely to operate at different stages of latency and lytic replication to control viral infection, the question of interest is whether latency III, in its own right, is a target of EBV-specific immunosurveillance by T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunosuppressed patients, it appears clear that T-cell deficiency favors appearance of latency III malignancies (3), that adoptive T-cell therapy can prevent this (4, 5), and that T-cell therapy fails if the EBV strain in question does not express crucial CD8+ T-cell epitopes in a latency III protein (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding infection in immunocompetent carriers, there were early arguments against a T-cell surveillance of latency III (51), but later studies showed that latency III-associated CD8+ T-cell epitopes are in fact under a selective pressure that depends on the frequency of HLA class I allotypes in a population (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulatively, these reports suggest that EBV-specific CD8+ T-cell surveillance of latency III is an important aspect of infection control in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we have analyzed expansion of EBV-specific T cells, cytokine secretion, and cytolysis to study the interference of EBV miRNAs with CD8+ T-cell functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found such interference for T cells specific for five out of five epitopes from three different antigens (LMP2A/B, EBNA1, and EBNA3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this collection contained epitopes with different HLA class I restrictions, derived from different categories of antigen (nuclear vs. transmembrane proteins) and with different processing requirements (TAP-dependent or -independent, proteasome- or immunoproteasome-dependent), our data indicate that the cumulative functional impact of miRNAs allows latently infected B cells to hide from CD8+ T cells in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings with polyclonal CD8+ T cells of complex composition corroborated our view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
miRNAs mediate their effects through direct binding to their target transcripts such as TAP2, for example (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the recognition of TAP-independent epitopes is also inhibited by miRNAs, other mechanisms must contribute to the reduced presentation of the TAP-independent LMP2 epitopes CLG (Fig 2G) and FLY (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a minority of all CD8+ T-cell epitopes (including those of viral origin) are expected to be TAP-independent (42), and the importance of TAP is reflected by the many herpesviruses that have evolved their own TAP-inhibitory proteins (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broad impact of TAP regulation on the immunological status in latency is also suggested by our observation that viral miRNAs do not affect global levels of HLA-A2, which is capable of presenting highly hydrophobic peptides that are more likely to be TAP-independent (39, 56), but do reduce levels of the HLA class I allotypes tested (HLA-B7, B8, and B40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and most HLA class I allotypes are less likely to present TAP-independent epitopes, because they require the presence of polar or charged anchor residues in the peptide (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another effect of EBV miRNAs, suppression of IL-12, seems to act globally on the function of antigen-specific T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IL-12 was originally identified as a product of EBV-infected LCLs (59), its role in EBV-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity has remained obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its well-known function in promoting Th1 differentiation (60), IL-12 was shown in mouse and human studies to promote CD8+ T-cell functions such as proliferation, cytolysis, and IFN- production (60, 61) through STAT4 signaling, up-regulating T-bet, and increasing IL-2 sensitivity (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, blockade of IL-12 fully reverted the effect of the miRNA deletion for polyclonal EBV-specific CD8+ T cells (Fig 4 G and H) but unexpectedly had only a minor effect on polyclonal EBV-specific CD4+ T cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this difference is not clear yet, but one possibility may be a differential requirement for costimulatory signals (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we have shown (35), EBV miRNAs affect CD4+ T-cell responses through IL-12 regulation already at the level of differentiation from naive T cells and thus act on both major classes of T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we found IL-12 to be the gene product most strongly down-regulated by EBV miRNAs, control of this cytokine appears to be central to the maintenance of EBV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PBMCs and surgically removed adenoid biopsies were obtained from volunteer blood donors and patients from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Universitätsklinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local ethics committee (Ethikkommission bei der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) approved the use of this human material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was not required because the biopsies originated from disposed tissues from anonymous donors who underwent routine surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_Primary_Cells__Cell_Lines__and_Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human primary B and T cells were prepared from adenoidal mononuclear cells (MNCs) or PBMCs as described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EBV-positive Burkitts lymphoma cell line Raji, HEK293-based EBV producer cell lines, infected human primary B cells, LCLs, and isolated T cells were cultivated as described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_EBV_Stocks_and_Infection_of_Human_Primary_B_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stocks of recombinant EBV strains were essentially prepared and quantitated as described (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details can be found in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Model_of_EBV_Infection_(B-Cell_Outgrowth_Assay)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
B cells (CD19+) were isolated from PBMCs of EBV-positive donors and infected with WT/B95-8 or miR EBV strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 12 h, the infected B cells were extensively washed to remove free virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD8+ T cells isolated from the same donors were cocultured at B:T cell ratios ranging from 8:11:2 (seeding 32,000 B cells per well).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells cultivated without T cells served as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were refed weekly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 wk, the cultures were analyzed for viable cells in MTT assays as previously described (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Establishment_of_EBV-Specific_Effector_T_Cells_and_T-Cell_Clones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV-specific CD8+ T-cell clones were established by limiting dilution from polyclonal T-cell lines that were generated by stimulating PBMCs with LCLs infected with WT/B95-8 or from specific T cells directly obtained from peripheral blood cells by peptide stimulation, IFN- capture (Miltenyi Biotec), and magnetic isolation (66, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, EBV-specific CD4+ T cells were generated by repetitive stimulation of sorted CD4+ T cells with autologous LCLs infected with WT/B95-8 EBV as described previously (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EBV-Specific_T-Cell_Recognition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV-specific effector T-cell activities were measured with IFN- ELISA and calcein release assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IFN- detection from T cells, effector and target cells were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio (5 × 104 cell per well) for 16 h in a 96-well plate (V bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN- levels were detected with ELISA following the manufacturers protocol (Mabtech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN- concentrations below 16 pg/mL were regarded negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutralization of IL-12 was performed with an antibody (2.5 g/mL), which was added directly to the coculture and is directed against the p40 subunit of IL-12 (C8.6; BioLegend).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous isotype control antibody (MOPC-21; BioLegend) was used as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Cytotoxicity_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EBV-infected B cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (PAN-Biotech) gradient centrifugation, and 5 × 105 target cells were labeled with calcein (Invitrogen) at 0.5 µg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three washing steps with PBS, target and effector cells were cocultured in V bottom 96-well plates with different ratios in RPMI without Phenol Red (PAN-Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 h of coculture, fluorescence intensities in supernatants were measured by the Infinite F200 PRO fluorometer (Tecan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, spontaneous calcein release of target cells cultivated without effector cells and cells lysed with 0.5% Triton-X100 (Carl Roth) were used to define the levels of no and fully lysed target cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Expansion_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD8+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs of EBV-positive donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stimulated 1 × 106 CD8+ T cells with 1 × 105 autologous irradiated B cells (infected for 15 d) and 20 U/mL IL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were restimulated every 10 d. At 10 and 20 d after the first stimulation, T cells were stained with unlabeled HLA/peptide pentamers (Proimmune) for 20 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterstaining was done with CD8 and CD3-specific antibodies and Pro5 fluorotag (Proimmune) on ice for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell numbers were determined using calibrated APC-beads as volume standard by flow cytometry (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Lines_and_Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EBV-positive Burkitts lymphoma cell line Raji, HEK293-based EBV producer cell lines (36), infected human primary B cells, and isolated T cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All media were supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Life Technologies), penicillin (100 U/mL; Life Technologies), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL; Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultivated at 37 °C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Separation_of_Human_Primary_Lymphocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human primary B and T cells were prepared from adenoidal MNCs or PBMCs by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells and CD8+ T cells were isolated using MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec) with CD19 or CD8 MicroBeads, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_EBV_Stocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recombinant EBV genome designated WT/B95-8 in this study is identical to plasmid 2089, which contains the complete EBV strain B95-8 genome, the F factor origin of replication, the chloramphenicol resistance gene, the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, and the hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker in eukaryotic cells (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of all miRNA genes from this construct resulted in plasmid 4027, also called mirALL or miR (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infectious virus was produced by lytic induction of producer cell lines stably carrying these recombinant EBV genomes in episomal form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To induce EBVs lytic cycle in the miR (4027) or WT/B95-8 (2089) HEK 293 producer cell lines, plasmids coding for BZLF1 and BALF4 were transiently transfected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were collected after 3 d. Virus stocks were titrated using Raji cells as described in detail recently (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated primary B cells were infected with the virus stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 GRU (Green Raji Units, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighteen hours later, the infected B cells were cultivated in fresh medium at an initial density of 5 × 105 cells per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Reporter_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3UTRs of TAP2 (ENST00000374897), TAP1 (ENST00000354258), IPO7 (ENST00000379719), and HLA-B7/B8 (ENST00000412585/ENST00000425848) were cloned downstream of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) into the expression plasmid psiCHECK-2 (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pCDH vectors expressing single viral miRNA were used as previously described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The psiCHECK-2 reporter and pCDH-EF1-MCS plasmid DNAs (System Biosciences) with a viral miRNA of interest were cotransfected into HEK293T cells using Metafectene Pro (Biontex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-BHRF13 was expressed from a modified pLSP plasmid vector (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated with miR-BHRF13 sequences obtained from p2089 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting pLSP-BHRF13 plasmid was digested with SfiI and XbaI, and the Cerulean gene was inserted as a phenotypic marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after DNA transfection, we measured luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) and the Orion II Microplate Luminometer (Titertek-Berthold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of Rluc was normalized to the activity of Firefly luciferase (Fluc) encoded by the psiCHECK-2 reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-specific mutagenesis was performed as previously described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed in silico prediction of EBV miRNA binding sites on 3UTRs with TargetScan (www.targetscan.org) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep columns (Zymo Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Mix (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primers were used:  #@NEW_LINE#@#
