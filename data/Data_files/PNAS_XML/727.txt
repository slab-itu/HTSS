Subsurface oxide plays a critical role in CO2 activation by Cu(111) surfaces to form chemisorbed CO2, the first step in reduction of CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments and quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations, this work reveals the essential first step for activating CO2 on a Cu surface, in particular, highlighting the importance of copper suboxide and the critical role of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide the quintessential information needed to guide the future design of improved catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A national priority is to convert CO2 into high-value chemical products such as liquid fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because current electrocatalysts are not adequate, we aim to discover new catalysts by obtaining a detailed understanding of the initial steps of CO2 electroreduction on copper surfaces, the best current catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy interpreted with quantum mechanical prediction of the structures and free energies, we show that the presence of a thin suboxide structure below the copper surface is essential to bind the CO2 in the physisorbed configuration at 298 K, and we show that this suboxide is essential for converting to the chemisorbed CO2 in the presence of water as the first step toward CO2 reduction products such as formate and CO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This optimum suboxide leads to both neutral and charged Cu surface sites, providing fresh insights into how to design improved carbon dioxide reduction catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overview of surface reactions of CO2 on Cu(111) under various in situ conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the g-CO2 indicates gas-phase CO2, l-CO2 indicates linear (physisorbed) CO2, and b-CO2 indicates bent (chemisorbed) CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) The forms of absorbed CO2 on pristine Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Both physisorbed l-CO2 and CO2 are observed at 75 K for pressures up to 106 Torr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Only CO2 is observed at 298 K for pressures ranging from 106 Torr to 0.1 Torr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The adsorption of CO2 when a subsurface oxide structure is deliberately incorporated into Cu(111) but without additional H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we observe that a subsurface oxide coverage of about 0.08 ML is responsible for stabilizing l-CO2 at 298 K and 0.7 Torr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here Osub indicates subsurface oxygen between the top two layers of Cu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) The cooperative interaction of codosed CO2 and H2O on Cu(111) composed of 0.08 ML of subsurface oxide, leading to the first reduction step of CO2 by adsorbed H2Oads; HCOO indcates adsorbed formate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Investigation of various Cu surfaces using APXPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) LEED pattern obtained at an electron kinetic energy of 110 eV and SEM micrograph of the Cu surface after sputtering and annealing cycles obtained by detecting the secondary electrons (SE) with a kinetic energy of the primary beam of 5 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Schematic of the APXPS measurements with the highlighted probed volume (3) along the (111) direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and D) C 1s and O 1s photoelectron peaks and multipeak fitting results obtained for the various experimental conditions and investigated surfaces (at r.t., 298 K): (experimental condition A) pure CO2 0.7 Torr on metallic Cu(111); (experimental condition B) CO2+H2O 0.7 Torr on metallic Cu(111); (experimental condition C) CO2+H2O 0.7 Torr on Cux=2.5O; (experimental condition D) CO2+H2O 0.7 Torr on Cux=1.5O); and (experimental condition E) pure CO2 0.7 Torr on Cux=1.5O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Various Cu surface structures and experimental conditions explored with APXPS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Survey scan acquired in UHV at 650 eV at r.t. (298 K) on the Cu(111) surface after the cleaning cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insets report the scans over the O 1s and C 1s spectral region (acquired in UHV at r.t. with a photon energy of 632 eV and 387 eV, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible to see that the surface did not present traces of O- or C-based contaminations after the cleaning and annealing procedure (surface preparation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C 1s photoelectron peak acquired at r.t. (298 K) as a function of CO2 and H2O partial pressures in the analysis chamber [on metallic Cu(111)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that upon H2O codosing, a downward shift of the l-CO2 BE takes place with the formation of b-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  b-CO2 remains stable upon H2O removal and final pumping of the chamber to HV conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the increase in CO2 partial pressure leads to the emergence and subsequent growth of a gas-phase C 1s core-level signal (the onset occurs between 0.05 Torr and 0.10 Torr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the spectral intensity shown here is rescaled by the intensity of the CO2 gas phase above the onset pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the relatively high gas pressure used in this study attenuates the photoelectron intensity coming from the sample surface, leading to an overall apparent decrease of the surface species intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 3A shows the predicted surface structure for 1/4 monolayer (ML) equivalents (MLE) of CO2 on metallic (Osub-free) Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physisorbed l-CO2 molecules have a C-O bond distance of 1.164 Å compared with 1.163 Å in gas phase and O-C-O angles of 179°, with an equilibrium distance of 3.11 Å from the C atom of CO2 to the Cu surface, characteristic of weak vdW interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum mechanical (QM) electronic bond energy to the surface is E=0.36 eV with H(298 K)=0.30 eV enthalpy of bonding (after including ZPE and specific heat).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the large decrease in entropy from the free CO2 molecule leads to a free energy for physisorbed CO2 that is unfavorable by G(298 K, 0.7 Torr) = +0.27 eV, which would require a pressure of 33 atm to observe at 298 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physisorbed_CO2_with_O_on_Cu(111)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimentally observed O 1s shifts indicate a small amount of surface and/or subsurface adsorbed O (denoted Oads and Osub, respectively) is present in our pristine Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the O 1s BE of O in the l-CO2 configuration, we observe an experimental shift (Oads) of 0.4 eV for Oads and an experimental shift (Osub) for Osub of 1.6 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To deduce the nature of this Oads, we consider the three cases reported in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For computational convenience we assumed a 2×2 surface cell, but the experimental Osub coverage is about 0.08 MLE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2×2 unit cell, our DFT calculations find two cases with O 1s BE consistent with experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C with one Osub per cell leads to a BE=1.35 eV whereas Fig 3D with one Osub and one Oads leads to BE = 0.31 and 1.54 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Referencing to gas-phase O2 (standard conditions), Fig 3D is G=2.34 eV more stable than Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For case Fig 3C we predict G = 0.39 eV bonding for l-CO2 (a pressure threshold of 2×107 Torr), whereas Fig 3D leads to G=0.13 eV with a pressure threshold of 7 Torr, both consistent with experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simultaneous dosing of CO2 in the presence of H2O leads to a dramatic change in the character of the surface CO2, showing clearly the adsorption characteristics for chemisorbed b-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a Cu(111) surface that includes some surface suboxide, the DFT calculations lead to several local minima (Fig 4): (i) physisorbed l-CO2 plus H2Oad, (ii) chemisorbed b-CO2 plus H2Oads (Fig 4 AC), (iii) reacted COOHads plus OHads (Fig S7A), and (iv) HCOOH plus surface Oads (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case of Cu(111) without Osub (Fig 4A), the C atom of b-CO2 is chemically bonded to a surface Cu0, whereas the two O atoms accommodate the partial negative charge transferred from the Cu surface, with one stabilized by hydrogen bonding to H2Oad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this b-CO2 leads to a QM binding energy of E=0.23 eV, but including vibrational and entropy contributions we find b-CO2 is unstable, with G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=1.07 eV, which agrees with our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the Osub is increased to 1/4 ML (Fig 4B), we find that the C atom is chemically bonded to two surface Cu0, one O atom is chemically bonded to one Cu0 center, and the other O atom is stabilized by the surface Cu+ pulled up by H2Oad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This b-CO2 leads to G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=0.06 eV, which is stable in agreement with our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, increasing the Osub to 1/2 ML, we predict that G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=+0.28 eV, which is unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the C atom is chemically bonded to a surface Cu+ that shares an O atom bearing a partial charge (stabilized by a hydrogen bonding to H2Oad on surface Cu+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments also show that increased levels of Osub decrease the binding of b-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we find that chemisorbed b-CO2 is stable only for the case in Fig 4B with 1/4 ML Osub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having more Osub or none at all destabilizes b-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explain this in terms of the distinct interactions of Cu0 and Cu+ induced by the Cu(111)Osub,x=0.25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This result of an optimum Osub for b-CO2 is in agreement with our experiments for CO2 and H2O codosing on the Cux=2.5O and Cux=1.5O suboxide structures, which shows both b-CO2 and l-CO2, but with a l-CO2/b-CO2 ratio of 3.8 and 5.3 for Cux=2.5O to the Cux=1.5O structure, respectively (the ratio was determined from both C 1s and O 1s spectra) (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Fig S8 reports the experimental results of exposing the Cux=1.5O structure to 0.7 Torr of 1:1 CO2 and O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case we do not observe chemisorbed b-CO2, but only physisorbed l-CO2 and its conversion to surface CO3 (carbonate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DFT calculations predict that on Cu(111)Osub,x=0.25, b-CO2 can react with H2Oad to form formate plus OHads, but the product is unstable in our conditions, with G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=+0.20 eV, making it endothermic from b-CO2 in Fig 4B by G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=0.26 eV [it is 0.43 eV endothermic for Cu(111)Osub,x=0.5].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our DFT calculations predict that this formate can extract an H from the OH to form formic acid plus Oads, which is stable with G(298 K, 0.7 Torr)=0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expect that learning how to tune the character of the surface atoms (Cu0 vs. Cu+ in this case) to manipulate these relative energetics of l-CO2 plus H2O, b-CO2 plus H2O, formate plus OH, and formic acid plus Oads may allow us to design modified systems aimed at accelerating these reaction steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we hypothesize that other subsurface anions such as S or Cl might favorably modify the energetics by changing the charges and character of the surface atoms and/or replacing some Cu with Ag, Au, or Ni with different redox properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of the inert linear l-CO2 molecule requires enforcing a bent b-CO2 configuration (30) with great chemical stabilization, but pristine Cu(111) and corresponding derivatives with Osub and/or Oads do not deliver sufficient stabilization, as shown in our calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, forcing CO2 to have the necessary angle (120°140°) and appropriate distance (2 Å) to the pristine Cu surface, we find no stable local minimum; all of the initial bent CO2 structures relax into the stable l-CO2 physisorption state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the presence of modest amounts of Osub generates a mixture of surface Cu+ and Cu0 atoms that combines with H2Oad to stabilize the b-CO2 structure reported in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that this configuration of surface atoms and H2O is responsible for stabilizing b-CO2 and opening up the possibility of forming formate, formic acid, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This elucidates the first reduction step of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This combination of APXPS experiments and DFT calculations enabled us to obtain a detailed understanding of the initial steps of CO2 activation by H2O on a Cu surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a modest level of Osub between the top two Cu layers is essential for stabilizing physisorbed l-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This unexpected finding may explain a general observation empirically derived in the literature from the catalytic performance of Cu oxides for CO2RR: It is known that Cu catalysts previously treated to generate surface oxides generally show improved activity compared with the pristine metallic surface (3, 6, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our experimental results and theoretical predictions, we conclude that the topmost layer needs to expose metallic centers, because CO2 can efficiently chemisorb only on such centers (Fig 4B), to form the activated molecular substrate for subsequent reduction to formate and other products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find that the presence of a subsurface oxide structure is also needed to promote H2O chemisorption onto a Cu+ center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enables the electronic communication between adsorbed CO2 and H2O, favoring the transition from a linearly physisorbed l-CO2 to a bent chemisorbed b-CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig 4B, reactions to form formate and formic acid are possible but not favored under our conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results provide the insight that subsurface oxide plays a critical role in the initial steps for activating CO2, providing a foundation for the rational development of unique active electrocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beamline_932_and_APXPS_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beamline (BL) 9.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) is equipped with a bending magnet and two grating monochromators [100 lines (l)/mm and 600 l/mm] having a total energy range between 200 eV and 800 eV (soft X-ray range) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyzer (Scienta R4000 HiPP) (21) pass energy was set to 100 eV, using a step of 100 meV and a dwell time of 200 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the total resolution (source and analyzer) was equal to about 220 meV at r.t., for photon energies ranging between 280 eV and 660 eV (the maximum flux, around 4.5 × 1010 photons s1, is reached at an energy of 490 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence angle between the incoming photons and the sample surface was equal to 15°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PES measurements were taken in normal emission (NE), at a pressure in the experimental (high pressure) chamber ranging from UHV (109 torr) to 0.7 Torr (in backfilling configuration), whereas the detection stage in the analyzer was under UHV conditions (109107 torr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration of the BE scale was carried out using the Au 4f photoelectron peak as reference (4f7/2 BE = 84.0 eV), from a clean gold polycrystalline surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration of the photon energy was performed acquiring the Au 4f7/2 core level at the desired photon energy and its corresponding II harmonic reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BL, maintained under UHV to avoid contamination of optical elements, is separated from the high-pressure chamber by a 2-mm × 2-mm × 100-nm thick Si3N4 window placed at a distance of about 3.0 cm from the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the fits reported in this work have been carried out using a Doniachunji shape for the Au 4f photoelectron peak, whereas a symmetrical Voigt function (G/L ratio ranging from 85/15 to 75/25) was used to fit C 1s and O 1s photoelectron peaks (after Shirley background subtraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the fitting procedure, the Shirley background was optimized as well together with the spectral components, increasing in this manner the precision and reliability of the fitting procedure (3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2 minimization was ensured by the use of a nonlinear least-squares routine, with increased stability over simplex minimization (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Cu L3M4,5M4,5 Auger transition was acquired at a photon energy (h) of 1,150 eV, using the second harmonic reflection of the 575-eV primary photon energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulations_of_the_Cu_L3M4_5M4_5_Auger_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main Cu Auger transition (L3M4,5M4,5) arises from a single L3 (2p3/2) core-hole decay via the Auger process involving two M4,5 (3d) electrons resulting in a final 3d8 configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected to lead to a final state term splitting from L-S coupling, namely 3F, 1D, 3P, 1G, and 1S corresponding to two d holes (35, 36) that constitute the primary excitation spectrum (F(E)) (the final state terms labeled in Fig S6A with * are indicative of Auger satellite transitions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final state labeled sum denotes the combination of five different final states (4P, 2G, 2P, 2H, and 2D) that cannot be separated into individual spectral components (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Auger transition spectrum can be seen then as the addition of the F(E) and the contribution from electrons that have undergone an increasing number of inelastic scattering (energy loss) events (36), which constitutes the background signal and has a crucial importance for the quantification of the different final states present in the experimental mixed spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cu Auger L3M4,5M4,5 spectrum was simulated, for all of the investigated systems, by convolving the final state terms with the multiple inelastic scattering background determined via a DrudeLindhard continuum medium approach, as reported in previous works by Pauly et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36), Tougaard and Yubero (37), Simonsen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38), and Yubero and Tougaard (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations were then used to fit the experimental signals to obtain the final state term population from the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As can be seen from Fig S6A, Cu0 and Cu+ are characterized by similar final state composition, which leads to the observed limited chemical shift in the core-level spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Passing from metallic Cu to Cux=1.52.5O, a downward kinetic energy shift can be observed for the poorly shielded 3F and 1D final state terms, as results from the loss of repulsive interaction between the emitted Auger electron and the 4s electron at the Fermi level, as a consequence of the partial ionization of the Cu 4s band passing from metallic Cu to Cux=1.52.5O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an important increase of the satellite 4F* term and decrease of the 1G term can be observed, as a function of the surface oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between these two final state terms can be used to estimate the stoichiometry of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S6A reports the Auger L3M4,5M4,5 spectra for metallic Cu, Cux=2.5O, and Cux=1.5O, as references, acquired in UHV conditions (109 torr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observe that despite the adsorption of CO2 and CO2 plus H2O with partial oxidation of the Cu surface, the Cu surface remains metallic (see Fig S6A, comparison between the metallic Cu reference and spectra A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the same coadsorption on the nominal Cux=2.5O and Cux=1.5O structures leads to slightly different surface stoichiometry under APXPS conditions (namely to Cux=2.8O and Cux=1.7O, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the current signal-to-noise ratio, a direct attribution of these observations to a specific surface interaction between CO2, H2O, and the investigated oxidic structures is not yet possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments were performed starting from a Cu polycrystalline surface that was in situ oriented to the (111) plane by repeated Ar sputtering (2 keV, 45 min) and annealing cycles in hydrogen (0.15 Torr) at 1,100 K (for 60 min) (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample preparation as well as the LEED investigation was performed in the preparation chamber connected to the high-pressure chamber available at BL 9.3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was then transferred to the high-pressure chamber, using a transfer arm without breaking the UHV conditions (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The preparation of different Cu suboxide surfaces (performed in the high-pressure chamber by BL 9.3.2) was adapted from the results obtained by Schedel-Niedrig et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first oxidation cycle consisted of a Cu(111) treatment at 625 K for 30 min with 0.3 Torr of molecular oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was then slowly (10 Kmin1) cooled down in the same pressure of oxygen to r. t. (298 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure leads to the formal stoichiometry [determined via the Cu L3M4,5M4,5 Auger analysis (36)] of Cux=2.5O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second cycle performed as described above leads instead to a further surface oxidation, with a formal stoichiometry of Cux=1.5O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Details_of_DFT_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The M06L flavor of DFT (16) was chosen for this study because we found that it describes well both the Cu metal and CO2 molecular crystal, even better than the dispersion-corrected PBE-D3 (29) (see Tables S1 and S2 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations were performed with the CRYSTAL14 package (40), which uses local atomic Gaussian-type basis sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used all-electron 6-311G(d) basis sets of triple- quality for H, C, and O, but we added one extra sp shell for the O basis set and reoptimized it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Cu, we used the SBKJC relativistic effective core potentials (41) and modified associated basis sets of triple- quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an extra-large grid (consisting of 75 radial points and 974 angular points) for accurate integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reciprocal space was sampled by a -centered MonkhorstPack scheme with 3 × 3 × 1 for all slab calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difficulty in discriminating between Cu0 and Cu+ using Cu core levels has been well established and is clearly evidenced from Fig S5A, reporting the Cu 3p photoelectron spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this limitation, the various Cu surfaces were characterized by means of the Cu Auger L3M4,5M4,5 transition (using a photon energy of 1,150 eV, Fig S6A) and the VB (acquired under resonance conditions with the O K edge, at a photon energy of 537 eV, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon passing from metallic Cu to Cux=1.5,25O, we observed a downward kinetic energy shift for the poorly shielded 3F and 1D final state terms (Fig S6A), due to decreased repulsive interaction between the emitted Auger electron and the 4s electron at the Fermi level, as a consequence of the partial ionization of the Cu 4s band passing from metallic Cu to Cux=1.5,25O (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observe an important increase of the satellite 4F* term and decrease of the 1G term as a function of the surface oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the VB spectra (as well as the difference VB spectra) reported in Fig S5B, no unambiguous changes can be detected in the electronic structure of the metallic or oxide surfaces upon CO2 or CO2-H2O coadsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the suboxide structures (Cux=1.5,25O), the VB spectra exhibit the typical intensity increase of the less_thanO 2p greater than less_thanCu 3d greater than  hybridization bands below the Fermi edge (Fig S5B), as well documented by the difference VB spectra obtained taking the metallic Cu VB as reference (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as reported in Fig S6B, the region below the Fermi level shows the typical increase of the density of states (DOS) at around 0.7 eV expected for Cu+-based suboxidic structures (18) [also confirmed by the increase of the positive slope of the DOS (dDOE/dBE)], obtained by interpolating a straight line where the DOS is centered at 0.7 eV within a range of BEs given by taking the double of the spectral resolution (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling of Auger and VB analyses provides then the necessary information to establish in situ copper metallic to subsurface suboxide transitions that occur while changing the experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
