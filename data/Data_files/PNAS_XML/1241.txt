Metaproteomics method to determine carbon sources and assimilation pathways of species in microbial communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the roles that microorganisms play in diverse environments such as the open ocean or the human intestinal tract, we need an understanding of their metabolism and physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of methods such as metagenomics and metaproteomics exist to assess the metabolism of environmental microorganisms based on gene content and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods often only provide indirect evidence for which substrates are used by a microorganism in a community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct protein stable isotope fingerprint (SIF) method that we developed allows linking microbial species in communities to the environmental carbon sources they consume by determining their stable carbon isotope signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct protein-SIF also allows assessing which carbon fixation pathway is used by autotrophic microorganisms that directly assimilate CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements of stable carbon isotope ratios (13C) are widely used in biology to address questions regarding food sources and metabolic pathways used by organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of these so-called stable isotope fingerprints (SIFs) for microbes involved in biogeochemical cycling and microbiota of plants and animals has led to major discoveries in environmental microbiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide low taxonomic resolution, such as the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as nanoscale secondary ion MS imaging of single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present direct protein-SIF and the Calis-p software package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/), which enable high-throughput measurements of accurate 13C values for individual species within a microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold-standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mock community samples, we demonstrate that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteriaanimal symbiosis shows that direct protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected insights into the symbionts metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms the usefulness of this approach to accurately determine 13C values for different species in microbial community samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct protein-SIF workflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the main step of the data analysis with the Calis-p software, the experimentally derived isotope distributions for peptides are compared with theoretical isotope peak distributions computed based on peptide molecular formulae with a fast Fourier transform method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison with theoretical distributions is done for a specified range of 13C values in increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Goodness of fit is calculated for all comparisons and the 13C value for the best fit is reported if a predetermined goodness of fit threshold is passed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more detailed workflow can be found in SI Appendix, Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Benchmarking_with_Pure_Culture_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For benchmarking, we measured the stable carbon isotope ratios of 20 pure culture species using both direct protein-SIF and continuous flow elemental analysis IRMS (CF-EA-IRMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CF-EA-IRMS is the most commonly used method to determine highly accurate carbon isotopic compositions of organic bulk samples with measurement uncertainties of ±0.15 or less and can be considered the gold standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20 pure cultures represented 18 bacterial, 1 archaeal, and 1 eukaryotic species (Datasets S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For seven of the species we obtained technical replicate measurements to determine the precision of the direct protein-SIF method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The protein-SIF 13C values for the technical replicate measurements of individual species were highly consistent with each other and generally deviated by less than ±1 from the mean (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct protein-SIF 13C values were linearly correlated to the CF-EA-IRMS values (R2 = 0.94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct protein-SIF 13C values showed a systematic offset from the CF-EA-IRMS values of 15.4 (SD = 2.55) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This systematic offset is likely caused by isotope fractionation in the Orbitrap mass spectrometer, which has been recently described (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large range of 13C values measured with both direct protein-SIF and CF-EA-IRMS corresponds to the isotope ratios of the different carbon sources used to grow the pure cultures (Dataset S3) and the heterotrophic versus autotrophic lifestyle of the different microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correction_of_Instrument_Isotope_Fractionation_with_Reference_Material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To correct for instrument isotope fractionation when using the direct protein-SIF method, we implemented the use of a reference material which is prepared, measured, and analyzed alongside the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With CF-EA-IRMS, reference materials with known isotopic compositions are also needed to correct for instrument isotope fractionation (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose human hair as the reference material for the following reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The bulk of its dry mass consists of protein, which allows directly correlating protein-SIF and IRMS 13C values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interference from other biomolecules with potentially different isotope composition, such as lipids, is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) It contains a large diversity of proteins providing hundreds to thousands of different peptides that can be measured for protein-SIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The protein sequences required for peptide identification are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) It is easy to obtain in large batches (a few grams) to serve as a reference material for many years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human hair with known 13C values measured by IRMS is also available from major chemical suppliers and the US Geological Survey (https://isotopes.usgs.gov/lab/referencematerials.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The offset between 13C values generated with direct protein-SIF and CF-EA-IRMS for the human hair reference material was 15.7 and thus almost identical to the average offset for the benchmarking pure culture 13C values (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corrected the pure culture protein-SIF 13C values with the reference material offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, the absolute deviation of the protein-SIF 13C values from the CF-EA-IRMS 13C values was on average ±2.1 (SD = 1.5) (Fig 2B and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore whether the approach could also be used to estimate per-amino acid 13C contents, we used multivariate regression to estimate the per-amino acid 13C content for each of the 18 amino acids included in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2 shows consistent trends in 13C content, with some amino acids strongly depleted in 13C (13C 78 for arginine and 64 for lysine) and others strongly enriched in 13C (13C +58 for asparagine and +50 for lysine) relative to an organisms average 13C value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2 also shows that these estimates are not very precise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences of 50 between replicates were not exceptional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_Limit_and_Accuracy_of_Protein-SIF_in_Mock_Communities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the detection limit of our approach and to test how accurately we can measure SIFs in complex community samples, we used mock communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mock communities were created by mixing the 20 pure culture species used for benchmarking with 12 additional microbial strains and species so that the final community contained a total of 32 strains and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated a total of 12 biological replicates of the community with differing species abundances and analyzed each replicate with two different LC-MS/MS methods (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the mock community direct protein-SIF data we only considered the 20 benchmarking species in the community for which IRMS and direct protein-SIF 13C values were known based on the results presented above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The accuracy and detection limit of direct protein-SIF depends heavily on the available amount of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the number of peptides for each species that pass the final Calis-p filtering step has a large influence on the accuracy of the determined SIF values (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If fewer than 60 peptides were available for SIF value calculation, the protein-SIF 13C values differed from the IRMS-derived 13C values by more than 10 for more than half of the 20 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If between 60 and 100 peptides were available, protein-SIF values differed less than 10 from IRMS values for six out of nine species, with only one large outlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With more than 100 peptides available, over 95% of protein-SIF values differed less than 10 from 13C values determined by IRMS (mean deviation 4.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the detection limit for direct protein-SIF depended on the amount of mass spectrometric data available, because to reach the necessary number of high-quality peptide isotopic patterns for low-abundant species more mass spectra are required (Table 1 and Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, one 4-h LC-MS/MS run enabled determination of SIF values for 25% of the species in the mock community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species were relatively abundant (proteinaceous biomass  greater than 5.7% of the total community).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, combined data of 12 4-h runs enabled determination of SIF values for 75% of species, including species with lower (less_than1% of the total proteinaceous biomass) abundance (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the accuracy of SIF estimates of individual peptides strongly depended on the mass spectrometric peak intensities of the peptide (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be explained by the presence of background noise, most likely originating from small interfering peaks that were not completely resolved from some of the analyzed peaks for a peptide, thus slightly changing individual isotopic peak intensities for peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Case_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the power and application of direct protein-SIF we applied it to a well-studied bacteriaanimal symbiosis, the gutless marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O. algarvensis lacks a digestive system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the worm relies on at least five bacterial symbionts under its cuticle for nutrition (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metabolism and physiology of these symbionts and their interactions with the host have been extensively studied using metagenomics, metaproteomics, and physiological incubation experiments (2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these previous studies, the carbon sources of the symbionts and host were thought to be as follows (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sulfur oxidizers (1 and 3) fix seawater-derived inorganic carbon using the CalvinBensonBassham cycle with a Form IA RubisCO enzyme (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sulfate reducers (1 and 4) consume the hosts organic waste products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a spirochete, no data on metabolism and physiology were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host itself derives its carbon directly from the symbionts by digestion through endocytosis (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the 13C values of the - and -symbionts as well as the host were expected to be similar, since all carbon is derived from the initial carbon fixation by the -symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study the 13C value of complete worms was determined by IRMS to be 30.6 (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our expectation was therefore that all direct protein-SIFderived 13C values would be somewhere in the range of 25 to 35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed this range of possible 13C values because of the measurement uncertainty of direct protein-SIF, as well as the fact that different trophic levels in a heterotrophic food chain can vary in their 13C value by 0.52 from their food source (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We put this model of carbon flow in O. algarvensis to the test by applying direct protein-SIF using a metaproteomic dataset obtained from multiple individual worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain sufficient peptides for measurement of 13C values of all of the symbionts, we combined 18 LC-MS/MS runs from a total of 14 individual worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 13C values obtained by direct protein-SIF of the host (25.6), the two -symbionts (32.9 and 31.8) and the 1-symbiont (34.8) were in the expected range (Fig 4D and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the 4-symbiont had a much higher 13C value (17.9, SE ±1.8) than the 1-symbiont.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was unexpected because the two -symbionts appear to be almost identical in terms of expressed carbon uptake and catabolic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are characterized by many abundantly expressed high-affinity uptake transporters for sugars, amino acids, peptides, and organic acids, as well as pathways for the use of host-derived acetate and propionate (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct protein-SIF data now point toward a functional difference between the two -symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, the 4-symbiont derives part or all of its carbon from external sources that have a different carbon isotopic composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently we do not have an explanation of how the 4-symbiont obtains external carbon and what the main physiological difference between the two -symbionts is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential mechanism for how the 4-symbiont could obtain symbiosis-external carbon is that it lives in the sediment pore water and from there continuously infects O. algarvensis; however, continuous infection of the worm is unlikely as the worm does not have any orifices that would allow for such infection to occur and the 4-symbiont genome does not encode for any known pathways that would allow it to penetrate the worms cuticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the two symbionts have differing affinities for specific substrates, which cannot be deduced from the transporter annotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work using isotopically labeled substrates could help to address this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We were also able to measure a sufficient number of peptides to estimate a 13C value for the spirochetal symbiont, despite its low abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spirochete 13C value of 30 was in the range of symbiosis-internal carbon, suggesting that this symbiont uses a symbiosis-internal carbon source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, we are not aware of any symbiosis-external carbon sources that have a 13C value in the range of 30; however, we cannot exclude that the spirochete has access to a symbiosis-external source with such a negative 13C value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, by applying direct protein-SIF to the O. algarvensis symbiosis we derived insights into carbon flow that were not suggested by any of the previous metaomics-based studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The developed direct protein-SIF approach provides a means to directly and simultaneously access the SIFs (i.e., 13C values) of many individual species in microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As little as 4 h of LC-MS/MS time can be sufficient to estimate SIFs for the most abundant species in a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this type of analysis only very small sample amounts are needed; recent advances in sample preparation allow for the production of metaproteomic data of sufficient quality from as little as 1 mg of wet weight cell mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the determination of SIFs for lower-abundant species is desired, more LC-MS/MS run time can provide the required metaproteomic depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For longer or additional LC-MS/MS runs proportionally larger amounts of sample are needed (e.g., 2 mg for two 4-h runs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, enrichment of specific cell populations by filtration or centrifugation methods can be used to obtain better metaproteomic coverage (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences_Between_IRMS_and_Direct_Protein-SIF_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed a range of differences between the 13C values measured by IRMS and direct protein-SIF when using both on single-species biomass (absolute deviation of the protein-SIF 13C values from the CF-EA-IRMS 13C values was on average ±2.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Part of the observed variation between the two methods is likely due to a lower accuracy of direct protein-SIF using the highly complex metaproteomic mass spectrometric data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are at least two other factors that might contribute to this variation in the observed 13C values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, direct protein-SIF measures the 13C value of proteins, while bulk IRMS measures all cell components such as protein, lipids, DNA, and metabolites, providing a weighted average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that the 13C values of different cell components can differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, lipids have a 1.6 lower 13C value than protein in Escherichia coli (28) and the lipids of CalvinBensonBasham cycle autotrophs have around 6 lower 13C values compared with the 13C values of the total biomass (5, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possible difference between protein 13C values and bulk organic matter 13C values should thus be considered when interpreting direct protein-SIF results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, different amino acids have different 13C contents, and even carbon positions within amino acids differ in their 13C/12C ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences might also lead to a detectable bias if the amino acid composition is highly skewed or if only few peptides are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since protein usually makes up the majority of a cell in terms of mass, for example, 55% of E. coli dry weight (BioNumbers ID 104954) (29), protein 13C values will be a good approximation of bulk 13C values in most cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, the variation in the intensities of the peptide isotopic peaks used for direct protein-SIF is mostly due to variation in the ratio of 13C to 12C, because 13C is, with a natural abundance of 1.1%, the most abundant heavy stable isotope in the considered peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, very large isotope fractionation of the three other elements (hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) in the peptides that we consider (sulfur-containing peptides are excluded) could change the measured 13C values by several per mille.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the hydrogen isotope fractionation in photosynthate compared with the water used by the photosynthetic organism is  = 171 (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2H/1H ratio in the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) reference is 0.00015576, which means that the 2H/1H ratio of photosynthate is 0.000129 if ocean water is the hydrogen source (i.e., a change in the fifth decimal of the fraction of heavy atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, carbon isotope fractionation influences the third and fourth decimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the 13C/12C ratio of V-PDB is 0.0111802, a 13C value of 47.2 corresponds to a 13C/12C ratio of 0.01065.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon isotope fractionation by only 3 would already yield a 13C/12C ratio of 0.01115, a shift in the fraction of heavy atoms similar to that produced by the fractionating hydrogen isotopes by 171.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Or, to put it differently, a 2H value of 171 would change the estimated 13C value of 47.2 to 50.1 in direct protein-SIF if the reference material used had a 2H value similar to that of VSMOW (0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, protein reference materials used for direct protein-SIF will have a much more negative 2H value compared with VSMOW [e.g., the 2H values of human hair range typically between 130 and 80 (30)], thus removing the most common hydrogen isotope fractionation effects when applying the reference material-based offset correction to the direct protein-SIF 13C values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, while nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation will usually not have a major effect on direct protein-SIF 13C values, it should always be considered during interpretation of direct protein-SIF results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of  values for these three elements by IRMS bulk analyses of samples and reference material would provide insights into any major deviations that should be considered to achieve even better accuracy of the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Can_This_Approach_Be_Used_for_Protein-SIP?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In recent years, metaproteomics has been successfully combined with stable isotope probing (protein-SIP) to follow the incorporation of isotopically labeled substrates by individual members in microbial communities (3134).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several different algorithms have been used to compute isotope incorporation levels in protein-SIP and some of these algorithms employ approaches similar to our direct protein-SIF approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All current protein-SIP approaches, however, can compute isotope incorporation levels only with low precision (i.e., several atom percent changes in isotope ratios are needed to obtain a clear readout).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally, the question arises if the direct protein-SIF approach could be also employed for protein-SIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answering this question will require further method development, but we predict that the direct protein-SIF approach should be applicable for protein-SIP approaches that use small percentages of labeled substrate or short labeling pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume that the protein identification algorithm used correctly identifies peptides if the intensity of the monoisotopic peak is at least 33% of its original (unlabeled) intensity, the maximum amount of label assimilated that would still enable correct identification of  greater than 90% of all peptides would be 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Calis-p software resolves differences between 13C values of less_than10 units, the resulting resolution would be 0.01%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Calis-p approach would thus not be a replacement for other protein-SIP approaches but would complement them by adding the capability to detect incorporation of very low amounts of heavy atoms into proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two potential limitations of the direct protein-SIF approach when it comes to resolving 13C values for species-level microbial populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, strains within one species often share a high protein sequence identity, which makes it difficult to uniquely assign most peptides to individual strains within one species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that if we sample a microbial community that has multiple strains of the same species and these strains use different carbon substrates, the direct protein-SIF method will only report an averaged SIF for the species, which would hamper deductions about which carbon substrates were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain resolution challenge could be addressed if a strain-resolved metagenomic database were available for the sample in question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With such a database, SIFs for individual strains could be resolved by filtering for strain-unique peptides before calculating the SIFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a careful evaluation of expressed metabolism and physiology of the species-level population using the metaproteomic data would provide insights into which and how many substrates might be used by a population and thus aid in the interpretation of the SIF data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it is conceivable that individual cells of a population consisting of a single strain use different carbon substrates depending on their position in an environmental matrix or the same cell uses multiple substrates at once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This again would lead to an averaged SIF for the strain, confounding the signals from the carbon substrates used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this second case, the use of the metaproteomic data to analyze the expressed metabolism would be essential for the SIF data interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The direct protein-SIF approach provides us with a key ability that no other method can provide at the moment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring 13C values of individual species in microbial communities we can now make inferences about the food sources for these species as well as the metabolic pathways used for carbon assimilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing technological development will further improve the accuracy, detection limits, and capabilities of the direct protein-SIF approach in the future in at least three ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the fractionation of isotopic species in the mass spectrometer could be reduced with specialized methods and potentially with improvements of the instrumentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current approaches for reducing isotope fractionation in Orbitrap mass spectrometers are very promising even though they are not yet usable for metaproteomics (17), as these new approaches significantly reduce the number of MS/MS spectra acquired and thus reduce the number of identified peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, mass spectrometers with increased resolving power at high scan rates will make it possible to separate the isotopologues of peptides based on which element provides the heavy isotope (hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, or oxygen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the exchange of one 14N atom with one 15N atom in a peptide changes its mass by 0.99703489 Da, while the exchange of one 12C with one 13C changes the mass by 1.0033548378 Da.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once isotopic species can be resolved on a per-element basis, it should become feasible to not only determine carbon isotope ratios but also isotope ratios for other elements in peptides such as nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The necessary mathematical approach to calculate the required fine-structure peptide isotope patterns via a multidimensional Fourier transform has been recently demonstrated by Ipsen (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, if sufficient numbers of peptides are measured for a species it is in theory possible to estimate amino acid-specific 13C values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C values of individual amino acids can provide additional information about carbon sources or biosynthetic pathways for a species (5, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cultivation of the pure cultures and the creation of the mock communities are described in Kleiner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the case study, 14 O. algarvensis specimens were collected off the coast of Sant Andrea Bay, Elba, Italy (42°4826N, 010°0828E) in August 2015 from shallow-water (6- to 8-m water depth) sediments next to seagrass beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live worms were transported in native Elba sediment and seawater to the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sand which was used for worm transport and storage was washed three times with clean freshwater followed by three washes with clean seawater to remove life and dead meiofauna and other potential sources of organic substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The worms were kept for 1 mo in the dark and at Elba marine sediment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worms were then carefully removed from the sediment and frozen at 80 °C until further processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human hair used as a standard for correction of instrument isotope fractionation was obtained from M.K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peptide samples for proteomics were prepared and quantified as described by Kleiner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) following the filter-aided sample preparation protocol described by Winiewski et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only modification for the Olavius samples compared with the pure cultures and the mock communities was that no bead beating step was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bead beating step was used for the human hair reference material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

One-Dimensional_LC-MS_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were analyzed by 1D LC-MS/MS as described in Kleiner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One or two wash runs and one blank run were performed between samples to reduce carryover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 1D LC-MS/MS runs of pure culture samples, 2 µg of peptide were loaded onto a 5-mm, 300-µm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano Liquid Chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After loading, the precolumn was switched in line with a 50-cm × 75-µm analytical EASY-Spray column packed with PepMap RSLC C18, 2 µm material (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 1D LC-MS/MS runs of the Olavius samples, 0.84 µg of peptide were loaded onto a 2-cm, 75-µm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an EASY-nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific) set up in two-column mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precolumn was also connected to a 50-cm × 75-µm analytical EASY-Spray column packed with PepMap RSLC C18, 2 µm material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases the analytical column was connected via an Easy-Spray source to a Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides were separated on the analytical column using 260- or 460-min gradients and mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap as described by Petersen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the mock communities, the existing 1D LC-MS/MS data from Kleiner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of bacterial strains, human hair, and culture media were determined (Datasets S2 and S3) by CF-EA-IRMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen cell pellets of bacterial strains were dried at 105 °C and stored at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dried cell pellets as well as carbon and nitrogen sources used for cultivation were weighed (1 mg per sample) into tin capsules and stored in a desiccator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C and 15N values were measured using CF-EA-IRMS on a Delta V Plus (Thermo) mass spectrometer coupled to an ECS 4010 elemental analyzer (Costech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Zero Blank autosampler (Costech) was used for dropping the samples onto a quartz tube combustion column heated to 1,000 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously with sample dropping, an O2 pulse was injected to flash-combust the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultra-high-purity helium was used as a carrier gas to transport the resulting gases through a water trap and a reduction furnace (600 °C) in which NOx species were reduced to N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated N2 and CO2 were separated on a GC column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Finnigan ConFlo III (Thermo) interface was used to deliver the gases to the ion source of the mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak areas for the isotopic species of sample CO2 and N2 were compared with those of reference gas peaks to determine the 13C and 15N values of the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  International standards (Dataset S3) were used at the beginning and end of the measurement sequence to normalize the measurements to the internationally accepted delta () scale with respect to V-PDB for 13C and atmospheric N2 for 15N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, caffeine (C-0750; Sigma-Aldrich) was included at the beginning and gelatin (G-9382; Sigma-Aldrich) after each fifth sample as internal laboratory standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement uncertainty was equal or better than ±0.15 for 13C and 15N values determined by IRMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
