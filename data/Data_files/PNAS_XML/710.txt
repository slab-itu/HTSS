High-throughput, low-loss, low-cost, and label-free cell separation using electrophysiology-activated cell enrichment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell separation is a fundamental process in biomedicine, but is presently complicated, cumbersome, and expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a technique that can sort cells at a rate equivalent to or faster than gold-standard techniques such as fluorescence- and magnetic-activated cell sorting, but can do it label-free and with very low cell loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system uses dielectrophoresis to sort cells electrostatically, using an electrode chip that eschews microfabrication in favor of a laminate drilled with 397 electrode-bearing wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high level of parallelization makes the system immune to the bubbles that limit labs-on-chip, while also increasing capacity and throughput to levels comparable with high-throughput FACS and MACS, whereas the chip is cheap enough to be disposable, preventing interseparation contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, cell separation occurs almost exclusively by density gradient methods and by fluorescence- and magnetic-activated cell sorting (FACS/MACS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variously suffer from lack of specificity, high cell loss, use of labels, and high capital/operating cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based cell-separation method, using 3D electrodes on a low-cost disposable chip; one cell type is allowed to pass through the chip whereas the other is retained and subsequently recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method advances usability and throughput of DEP separation by orders of magnitude in throughput, efficiency, purity, recovery (cells arriving in the correct output fraction), cell losses (those which are unaccounted for at the end of the separation), and cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was evaluated using three example separations: live and dead yeast; human cancer cells/red blood cells; and rodent fibroblasts/red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single-pass protocol can enrich cells with cell recovery of up to 91.3% at over 300,000 cells per second with 3% cell loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-pass protocol can process 300,000,000 cells in under 30 min, with cell recovery of up to 96.4% and cell losses below 5%, an effective processing rate 160,000 cells per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-step protocol is shown to be effective for removal of 99.1% of RBCs spiked with 1% cancer cells while maintaining a processing rate of 170,000 cells per second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the self-contained and low-cost nature of the separator device means that it has potential application in low-contamination applications such as cell therapies, where good manufacturing practice compatibility is of paramount importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DEP spectra of two arbitrary cell types, whose properties are identical save for one (blue line) having a membrane capacitance twice that of the other (red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the frequency band (highlighted), the polarizabilities (and hence direction of force) of the two cells is different, enabling the cells to be separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Enrichment_Using_a_Single-Pass_Protocol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess separation efficacy, binary mixtures of cells were processed through the device in 515-mL units, processed at between 15,000 and 33,000 cells per second, the results of which are summarized in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live and dead yeast showed mean recovery (the proportion of cells output in the correct outlet) of 81.3% and 89.5%, respectively; vole blood and fibroblasts showed separation efficiencies of 87.3% and 73.9%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purities (the proportion of required cells in the output population) at the output for the above populations were 91.3% and 78.2% for live and dead yeast, and 75.6% and 86.4% for vole RBCs and fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas these values are low when considering the technique as a separation per se, they represent sufficiently high values to constitute effective cell enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also significant that for the above population sorts, the mean cell losses (cells which were input but are unaccounted for at the output, due to damage, adherence to the electrodes or device casing, or being left in residual liquid in the device at the end of the experiment) were 1.4%, 2.7%, 4%, and 0.3%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These low cell losses are important for two reasons; first, multiple passes can be used to improve performance without significantly degrading cell numbers; second, unlike methods such as FACS, where a significant number of cells being separated are destroyed by the separation process (6), this protocol does not reduce cell numberan important issue where initial cell numbers are low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments at 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 mL min1 yielded similar results, suggesting these metrics represented a plateau of trapping efficiency, and that the device was working well within its performance limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the viability of cells postsort, collected fibroblasts were suspended in fibroblast-growing medium, divided into two T75 flasks, and placed in the incubator to assess growth potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were observed 1 and 3 d after incubation and were found to have adhered to the flask and reached confluency, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DEP spectrum of the cells was obtained and a further passage performed to check for abnormalities; none was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the upper-throughput limit, live yeast cells were captured in the device in increasing concentrations, as it is the fraction of cells experiencing positive DEP that is limited by the capacity and efficacy of the DEP electrodes (the other, repelled, population simply passing through the device unaffected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retaining the 1-mL min1 flow rate, the concentration of cells per milliliter was increased from 106 mL1 to 2 × 106, 5 × 106, 107, 2 × 107, and 108 cells per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chip saturation was monitored in two ways: first, we measured the total number of cells retained in the chip and subsequently recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, cells were aliquoted in 1-mL fractions and analyzed to determine the cell ratio to observe trap saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saturation can then be detected by the appearance of a higher proportion of live cells in the output stream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any saturation effect would only affect cells collected by positive DEP on the electrodes; cells experiencing zero or negative DEP pass through the chip unimpeded and are collected in the receptacle below, and as a consequence there is no saturation limit on such cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At concentrations up to 2.7 × 107 mL1 the device worked as for 1 × 106 mL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When concentrations of 2.7 × 107 mL1 were used, the aliquots were normal and the mean cell recovery was 279 ± 12.2 million cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the input concentration was 5.9 × 107 mL1, the number of cells increased dramatically (by over 300%) at the sixth aliquot, and the mean total of recovered cells was 321 ± 9.0 million cells; when 1.07 × 108 mL1 were used, the device became saturated after the third aliquot (rising by 38% in aliquot 4, rising to 100% in aliquot 7 and later), and recovery indicated that the trap contained 359 ± 13.3 × 106 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the separation run was completed, the cells collected in the chip were flushed and counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the three instances where the chip was saturated, the number of cells retained before the chip was saturated, with upper limits of 350 × 106 cells representing the capacity of the chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difference in capacity between 59 million and 109 million cells per milliliter is interesting, as it suggests the trap capacity may be increased at high concentrations due to cellcell interactions; however, it appears clear that a 300 × 106 cell sort (20 million cells per milliliter, 15 mL total volume) represents the maximum effective cell separation where the cell content is entirely unknown, although this represents the limit only on the positive DEP fraction; a sort of 300 million cells experiencing positive DEP from a further 300 × 106 (or more) experiencing negative DEP would in principle be entirely workable, raising the throughput past 0.6 × 109 cells per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Volume_Separation_Performance_Using_Multipass_Protocols  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas enrichment on this scale is of interest, a second or third pass through the device enables the user to collect cells that were not retained in previous passes, significantly improving performance in a very short time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two strategies for multiple sorting passes: re-sorting the effluxed and retained cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examine these two protocols separately: a two-pass strategy reprocessing the effluxed cells to minimize cell loss while maximizing enrichment in the shortest possible time, and a three-pass strategy where the collected cells are reprocessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis_of_Performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas purity of sample at output is the final arbiter of the quality of a separation/enrichment method, it is difficult to use as a guide as it depends on the concentration of the two cell types at the input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we can look at the concentration of both the desired and undesired cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyzing the two-pass protocol to enrich live and dead yeast and RBC/fibroblast cells by negative DEP, the population experiencing negative DEP has recovery of 90% for the desired cells and 20% for the undesired fraction for each round of enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two passes, these are approximately squared, such that 0.81× the desired and 0.04 undesired cells are present at the output, leading to a purity of 0.81/(0.81 + 0.04) = 95.3%, in line with experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for enrichment of cells experiencing positive DEP, across the three rounds of separation the same process was observed, with an average of 80% of MDA cells and 20% of RBCs appearing at the output for each round of enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over successive passes, this predicts RBC proportions of 96%, 86%, and 60%, in line with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell losses are sufficiently low for them to be disregarded in the calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Design_on_Optimum_Performance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From our results, it is possible to identify ways to optimize the cartridge design and increase separator performance by improving the values of cell recovery for the wanted and unwanted cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, whereas the peak values of recovery and purity are high, it is the passed cells that have the highest purity, whereas retained cells always have the highest recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As configured, the device contains two dead volumes of sample that cannot be recovered at the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One occurs due to the use of a conical syringe plunger; at maximum insertion the tip of the cone touches the chip and 0.56 mL of unseparated cells remain surrounding the plunger tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, 0.54 mL of postseparation cells remain in the space between the chip and outlet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider a mixture of two populations A and B, where population A experiences negative DEP and passes through the chip while population B is retained by positive DEP; the mixture is contained in a 10-mL sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the solution is passed through, 1.1 mL (11%) of cells remain in the dead volume, limiting maximum recovery of A to 89%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, purity is unaffected because only the cells which have been passed through by the chip are collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the solution has been processed, we then draw 1 mL into the device and release population B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the device also contains 1.2 mL of the original cell mixture, containing cells from population A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the recovery rate for mixture B is as high as can be obtained (because all of the cells are in the extracted volume), but the purity is downgraded by the presence of population A cells in the dead volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In effect, the dead volumes act to take cell mixtures intended for the output for population A, and deposit them in the output to population B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas a future embodiment of the device could reduce the dead volumes by redesigning the plunger and outlet path, we can calculate the effective peak separation by mathematically removing the cells in the dead volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that using this approach, the recovery of RBCs and purity of fibroblasts in the separation described above would equal or exceed the same parameters for the two parameters unaffected by the dead volumes, which is to say that all purities and recoveries would exceed 95% for a two-pass strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The design outlined in this paper is a proof of concept, but a number of design modifications suggest themselves to improve simplicity, throughput, and capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the device presented here is loaded manually by drawing the syringe plunger upward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means there is little control of the flow rate during loading; hence, during this time the chip is not energized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the application of a bidirectional syringe pump that can both push and pull, it would be possible to separate on both draw and expel cycles, making separation simpler and more efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single inlet of the cartridge also lends itself to combining with simple liquid handing /fraction collection systems, allowing automation of complex multipass protocols without user intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also evident that the design presented here could be modified to increase throughput.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a second chip, independently energized, could be mounted below the first to permit a second stage of separation; this could either be at the same frequency as the first, doubling the separation rate by removing the necessity for two separation passes, or at a different frequency to allow two-parameter sorting, while requiring no further antibodies (as would be required for FACS and MACS), making for a negligible cost increase over a single-chip version.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the throughput and total cell capacity could be increased by enlarging the chip and increasing the number of wells; this could be achieved by making a single electrode disk larger, or otherwise increasing the number of wells For example, a chip with 3,500 wells could potentially separate up to 1010 cells in a similar 30-min period, potentially allowing separation on industrial scales, or clinical applications such as sorting of stem cells from bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Other_Separation_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described earlier, cell-separation methods requiring more sensitivity than density gradients can be addressed by two methods: FACS and MACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-throughput FACS system is expensive; both FACS and MACS require expensive labels, and can only separate cells on the basis of this labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EPACE system presented here separates on the basis of physical parameters without the need for labels, and both the instrumentation (pump and generator) and consumables required (media, chips) are an order of magnitude less expensive than either method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the system presented here could be manufactured as a fully assembled, sterile, integrated cartridge; with no cross-over possible with other reparation runs and no residual chemical labels to adversely affect cells, this allows the cells produced to be fully compliant with GMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-throughput rates also compare well with other methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-throughput FACS cell sorters can process up to 100,000 events per second, although a relatively small proportion of these may actually contain cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MACS is a bulk method rather than processing cells serially, but the time taken to prepare and perform separation is comparable to the method presented in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the number of cells to be separated by high-volume MACS systems is 109 cells; although no upper limit for FACS has been identified, a wide review of the literature reports few studies exceeding 2 × 107 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline EPACE performance is comparable to MACS, and better than FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the capacity of the device is 4 × 108 yeast cells; balancing the relatively small size (and hence higher packing density) of such cells against the fact that DEP trapping force scales with cell volume, a capacity of 108 mammalian cells is certainly not unreasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of throughput, if we divide the number of cells processed by the time required for a two-pass sort, we have an effective sorting rate of 167,000 cells per second; adding in a third sort, as in the case of the rare cell study, still gives a net throughput comparable to high-throughput FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering cell loss, EPACE is shown to be comparable to, or better than, either existing method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In no case were more than 7% of cells lost, and in many cases fewer than 3% of cells were lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, FACS typically loses 50% of cells through cell damage during droplet formation or rejection due to incorrect scanning, particularly at higher flow rates (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When used in three-pass mode, cell recovery was lower, but the cells not initially captured by the device will be available for resorting in the outlet stream by using a more complex multiple-run separation strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing our method to published DEP methods, the EPACE process is 30× faster than the Hu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22) system, 6× faster than the Gupta et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) system, and 600× faster than the system presented by Lee (23), with comparable or better cell recovery and cell losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell concentration and recovery were comparable to the Markx et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  system (24); without additional data we cannot compare throughput or cell loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these devices were microfluidic, we suggest that the system presented here should be significantly more robust; whereas the function of planar microfluidic devices can be compromised by the presence of a single bubble, the highly parallel design of our chip means that if a bubble appears it has no more effect than potentially blocking just one of the 397 holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike FACS and MACS, which sort cells on the basis of specific recognition of membrane proteins, DEP separates on the basis of differences in the electrophysiology of the two cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers advantages over these existing methods, as many differences in cell types (and changes in cells in response to external stimuli) exhibit corresponding differences in the cells electrophysiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples have included the differentiation of neural stem cells, where electrical changes in the membrane allow sorting of cells according to differentiation fate far in advance of conventional marker-based methods, e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2729; indeed, stem-cell sorting may be an area where DEP-based separation may dominate over existing methods, whereas DEP separations in cancer cells have been reported for some decades (13), both for diagnosis and development of interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other cases of differential DEP response have been identified in the past 50 y, and all past demonstrations can be performed using this platform (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once differential electrophysiology is established by DEP profiling, it can be exploited through the use of ion channel blockers to emphasize difference and enhance DEP separation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have presented a DEP-based cell-separation technique that has a capacity and throughput comparable to the fastest MACS and FACS machines, requires no chemical labels, offers GMP compatibility, significantly lower cell loss, and significantly lower capital and running costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the opportunity to exploit differences in cell electrophysiology in fields such as stem-cell therapy and cancer, we believe this offers significant promise as a new standard benchtop laboratory technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments followed the steps outlined in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cartridge and chip were cleaned with ethanol before assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip manufacture and cell mixtures are described in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sample containing a mixture of the two cell types A and B was loaded into the fluidic cartridge by inserting the tube into the solution, then manually withdrawing the plunger to load the reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was then placed in a vertically mounted syringe pump (Razel, maximum output of 1 mL min1), and the solution was pumped through the chip while voltage was applied to the electrodes using a signal generator (Jupiter 2000, Blackstar), connected to the chip via a custom-made amplifier board to supply up to 18 peak-to-peak voltage at frequencies up to 1 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output (enriched for population A) was collected in a second receptacle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then fresh solution was loaded into the cartridge, the field was deactivated, and the chip was flushed manually with fresh medium to dislodge and recover the cells from population B that had been collected by positive DEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using a second or third pass, it was possible to enrich either cell-A or -B samples by repeating the procedure with the enriched samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total time for the two-pass procedure was under 30 min for yeast, and under 15 min for RBC/fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were exposed to the electric field for an average of 5 min for the positive DEP fraction, or under 10 s for the negative DEP fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were repeated three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the three-pass experiments to enrich rare cells, at the end of the second and third passes the cells were recovered by switching the field off, manually pulling the plunger up slightly, aspirating air into the fluidic cartridge, and expelling the retained cells in the small sample volume that is still within the chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separations were evaluated for cell recovery (the proportion of desired cells which arrive at the correct outlet), purity (the proportion of desired cells in a given outlet), and cell loss (the number of cells which are unaccounted for at the end of the separation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of missing cells was obtained by subtracting the passed and recovered populations from the initial number of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DEP spectra of individual cell types were measured using a DEPtech 3DEP and a separation frequency midway between the cross-over frequencies (the frequency on the DEP spectrum where the response crosses zero) for the two cell types to be separated; for the live/dead yeast mixture, 1 MHz was selected; for the fibroblast/RBC mixture, 22 kHz was selected; and for the MDA/RBC mixture, 76 kHz was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells in output mixtures were either identified by the use of Trypan blue (live and dead yeast) or by visual inspection of the morphologically quite different RBCs and fibroblasts/MDAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work on human and mammalian cells was approved by the University of Surrey Ethics Committee; further details are available in the Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human participants in the study were screened for relevant self-reported health issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided written, informed consent after having received explanation of the various study procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Live_and_Dead_Yeast  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast was grown using Tescos freeze-dried bakers yeast grown in a yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (Sigma-Aldrich) set overnight in an incubator at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast cells were killed by transferring live yeast in YPD medium to an incubator set to 70 °C for 3 h. Yeast was washed and suspended in deionized (DI) water before use in experiments; conductivity was not fixed, but was at or below 1 mSm1 (typically 0.20.5 mSm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rodent_Fibroblasts_and_RBCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse fibroblasts (3T3), kindly donated by Dr. Andrew Liu, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, were cultured in an incubator set at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) with the addition of 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult common voles were sourced from the University of Surreys breeding colony in the United Kingdom, which was based on animals kindly donated by Prof. M. P. Gerkema, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands (3234).Voles were bred in a licensed establishment, and were housed according to the Home Office Code of Practice for the care and accommodation of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals did not undergo any regulated procedure, and blood was collected after killing using a Schedule 1 method, which was performed by a competent person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole vole blood (1 mL) was collected following published protocols (35) using cardiac puncture, and collected in heparin-coated tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collection was followed by RBC isolation through three identical centrifugation steps (10 min, 1,620 × g, 4 °C), each followed by resuspension of the RBC-containing pellet in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the two cell types were mixed and resuspended in DEP medium comprising DI water supplemented with 8.5/0.3% sucrose/dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), then washed and resuspended in DEP medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium had a similar conductivity to the DI water sample described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_Cancer_and_RBCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human blood was collected from donors at the University of Surrey and RBCs were isolated following published protocols (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RBCs, which were then washed twice in DEP medium consisting of 8.5% (wt/vol) sucrose, 0.5% (wt/vol) dextrose, 100 µM CaCl2, and 250 µM MgCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in MEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 2 mM l-Glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were grown in T75 flasks in a standard cell culture incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidified air at 37 °C and subcultured every 48 h when 80% confluent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare for experiment, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed twice in a medium consisting of 8.5% (wt/vol) sucrose, 0.5% (wt/vol) dextrose, 100 µM CaCl2, and 250 µM MgCl2 and supplemented with NaOH to pH of 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium conductivity was adjusted using PBS to 10 mSm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Mixtures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell samples were prepared by counting using a NanoEnTek C-chip disposable hemocytometer (Labtech), mixing to obtain an 50:50 ratio, then remeasured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stock of live and dead yeast was found to contain 8.0 million live cells and 6.0 million dead cells and was processed as 15-mL samples (a concentration of 0.93 million cells per milliliter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vole fibroblasts and RBCs were mixed, and the resultant mixture was measured to contain 5.1 million fibroblasts and 4.8 million RBCs in each of three 5-mL aliquots, a total concentration of 1.98 million cells per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 20 mL sample of 11.1 million fibroblasts and 13.4 million RBCs was also prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human RBCs were spiked with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, to a final concentration of 1.1% cancer to 98.9% RBCs, at a total cell concentration of 2 × 107 mL1, to a total sample volume of 4 mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Device_Fabrication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The device comprised three principal parts: a fluidic chip, a casing, and the support instrument (including principally a signal generator, amplifier, and syringe driver).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip comprised 10 layers of 70-µm-thick copper separated by 150-µm-thick glass fiber reinforced epoxy (FR4) layers, with two further 35-µm-thick copper layers at the top and bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All copper layers were patterned in a circle slightly larger than the area through which the separation wells were drilled, to minimize overlap and associated capacitive losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hundred ninety seven wells with a 400-µm diameter were drilled in a hexagonal pattern at the center of the chip; larger holes for assembly and contacts were placed at the perimeter of the chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposed copper areas were gold-plated to maintain stability and biocompatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip was housed in a cartridge machined from poly(methyl methacrylate), which comprised a reservoir containing a syringe plunger from a 20-mL syringe, a chip holder, and an outlet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip formed the base of the reservoir, such that when the plunger was pushed, cells were able to flow through all 397 holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the chip, a collection cone funnelled the suspension into a 1.46-mm-diameter outlet tube to a collection receptacle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip was mounted between the top cylinder and bottom cone of the assembly and secured using Allen bolts, with a watertight seal provided by two 19.13-mm-diameter O rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
