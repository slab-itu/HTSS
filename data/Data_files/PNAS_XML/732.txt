Asymmetric distribution of type IV pili triggered by directional light in unicellular cyanobacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Type IV pili (T4P) are cell-surface appendages observed in prokaryotes that perform critical functions in cell motility, surface adhesion, virulence, and biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the architecture of T4P has already been determined, the dynamics resulting from the response to various environmental signals remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrated the sequential process of T4P dynamics from stimulus to taxis at the single-cell level in a model cyanobacterium, which can recognize light direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We directly visualized that T4P filaments dominantly appeared from the side of the cell opposite the illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This asymmetric activation is regulated on a timescale of minutes, and the process was transitioned between three sequential phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide clues toward a general regulation mechanism of the T4P system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type IV pili (T4P) system is a supermolecular machine observed in prokaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells repeat the cycle of T4P extension, surface attachment, and retraction to drive twitching motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the properties of T4P as a motor have been scrutinized with biophysics techniques, the mechanism of regulation remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provided the framework of the T4P dynamics at the single-cell level in Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC6803, which can recognize light direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that the dynamics was detected by fluorescent beads under an optical microscope and controlled by blue light that induces negative phototaxis; extension and retraction of T4P was activated at the forward side of lateral illumination to move away from the light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we directly visualized each pilus by fluorescent labeling, allowing us to quantify their asymmetric distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, quantitative analyses of cell tracking indicated that T4P was generated uniformly within 0.2 min after blue-light exposure, and within the next 1 min the activation became asymmetric along the light axis to achieve directional cell motility; this process was mediated by the photo-sensing protein, PixD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequential process provides clues toward a general regulation mechanism of T4P system, which might be essentially common between archaella and other secretion apparatuses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observation_of_Phototaxis_at_the_Single-Cell_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phototaxis of bacteria has been visualized as colony migration on an agar plate (14, 22) or as the trajectory of cells (15, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To observe a detailed trajectory of negative phototaxis at the single-cell level, we constructed an optical setup that allowed us to simultaneously illuminate specimens on a glass substrate both laterally and vertically (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue light with a wavelength of 488 nm was chosen to induce negative phototaxis, and the stimulus of light intensity was adjusted in the range of 1010,000 mol m2 s1 (photon flux density in the visible light wavelength) on the sample plane, which was calibrated using the intensity of fluorescent beads (Materials and Methods for more detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the cell was visualized by green light from a halogen lamp with a band-pass filter (532/40 nm) with a fluence rate of 1 mol m2 s1, which was confirmed to have no effect on motility (Fig 1 D and E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a blue light with 1,200 mol m2 s1, which is half of direct sunlight (2,000 mol m2 s1), was shone on cells from the side, most cells escaped from the direction of the light propagation on the glass coated with collodion (Fig 1C and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the collodion coating is shown in Fig S1; a 0.007% solution of collodion was used because cells clearly showed negative phototaxis under this condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rose plot, a round histogram that intuitively and simultaneously presents the number of occurrences and direction, clearly indicates that the lateral light induced negative phototaxis (Fig 1 D and E, Left), whereas cells move randomly under the vertical illumination (Fig 1 D and E, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicated that our experimental system successfully quantified the negative phototaxis of this species at the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in the absence of blue-light exposure (i.e., in the dark), cells did not show directional movement on the glass (Fig 1 D and E, Right), suggesting that Synechocystis at least requires light exposure as a trigger to activate migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_Visualization_of_T4P_Dynamics_Through_Fluorescent_Beads  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reveal the dynamics of T4P quantitatively, we fixed cells on the glass substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motility of cells was hindered on the glass surface coating with high concentration of collodion, and when the concentration of collodion reached 0.2% the cells ceased to move entirely and remained immobilized on the surface (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in the presence of polystyrene beads in the aqueous solution, the immobilized cells were able to retract the beads from the solution to the cell surface (Fig 2A and Movies S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that the cells nonspecifically attached on the glass surface and thus were immobilized, but the ability of pili to extend, catch targets, and retract them remained intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, beads were accumulated on cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells treated by the chemical fixation with glutaraldehyde did not show such accumulation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads stabilized by sulfate charges were effectively captured by pili, but neither carboxylated nor BSA-coated beads were accumulated (Fig S2), suggesting the specificity of the tip of a single T4P filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beads accumulated on the cell surface were not released during our observation time, and thus the activity of T4P was directly visualized as the distribution of fluorescence intensity of beads accumulated on the surface (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 2A, light was illuminated vertically onto the sample plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when light was laterally illuminated, the distribution of beads became not symmetric but asymmetric: beads were accumulated to the forward side of the cell along the lateral blue light (Fig 2B and Movies S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetric accumulation suggests that T4P filaments located around the right side of the cell can drive rightward motion, as in Fig 1C, because lateral illumination induces negative phototaxis toward the right side in this setup (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when light was partially illuminated only at the right side of the cell, beads were accumulated only in the illuminated region (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations could be explained by the microoptics effect of a cell, as previously reported (18) (Fig S3) (Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the above three different illumination setups, the displacement of beads induced by T4P was accurately tracked at the single-pilus level (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most beads were retracted toward cells, but we also observed the movement of beads away from the cell body (red lines in Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particular movement was attributable to the elongation of a single pilus, and its speed was about one third compared with the retraction speed (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retraction and extension speeds were not substantially altered in the three different illumination setups, suggesting that the illumination condition of light in each setup was well regulated in our observation system, although the direction of light propagation was different, and so the asymmetric dynamics of T4P observed here may be a natural characteristic of this species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted from the results shown in Fig 2 A and B, the angle distribution of the beads movement was broadly distributed under the vertical illumination (Fig 2G, Left), whereas it was asymmetric under the lateral illumination (Fig 2G, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Visualization_of_T4P_Filaments_as_a_Fluorescent_Image  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the accumulation of beads was quantified at the single-cell level (Fig 2), the essence of the dynamics of T4P was still unresolved: i.e., we detected the extension and retraction only after the beads attached to T4P with the above experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain further insight into the regulation mechanism, we attempted to visualize pilus filaments with a fluorescent marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that conventional labeling with fluorescent chemicals, such as FITC succinimidyl ester (2), did not work in Synechocystis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, pilus filaments were sufficiently visualized with labeling by avidin conjugated with FITC (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several other types of biotin-binding proteins, such as streptavidin or neutravidin conjugated with FITC, were not applicable (Fig S4B), indicating that the avidin-specific labeling of pili is caused by the glycosylated region of avidin (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is already known that the cell has two morphologically distinct pilus types, named thick and thin pili (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check which pilus filament is labeled with FITCavidin, we applied this method to the GT strain, which is known to have nonmotile phenotype (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the cells have low fluorescent signal as a filament (Fig S5A), and the intensity was much less than that in the PCC-P strain, a standard strain in this paper (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is consistent with the EM observation: the PCC-P strain had thick pili as long filaments with a diameter of 8 nm and more than 2 m in length (Fig S4 C and D), corresponding with the morphotype of T4P, as previously described (13), but the number of thick pili in the GT strain was much less (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these observations, we conclude that we successfully established a method to visualize T4P of Synechocystis under an optical microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we applied the labeling procedure in Fig S4A and directly quantified the effect of the lateral illumination on the extension of T4P (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the behavior of the accumulation of beads, T4P filaments dominantly appeared from the side of the cell opposite the illumination (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was consistent with the idea that the probability of the tip of a pilus binding to the target, in the case of a fluorescent bead in Fig 2, is presumably stochastic, and negative phototaxis is mainly driven by the regulated asymmetric distribution of T4P filaments over the cell surface (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The next question raised here is how the asymmetric distribution of T4P is regulated by the blue-light illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the effect of the light, we applied a mutant that lacks PixD, a blue-lightsensing protein (15, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the T4P was generated in the pixD mutant (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of T4P increased with the increase in the power of light in both the wild type and pixD mutant in a MichaelisMenten manner (Fig 3D, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of pili was similar in both samples (Fig 3D, Middle), within a range of 24 m on average, indicating that PixD is not required to induce the extension of T4P; i.e., there should be other photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the distribution of T4P in the pixD mutant was more uniform than that in the wild type (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3C and 3D, Bottom; see also Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that PixD is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of T4P via an unknown mechanism, which suppresses the extension of T4P from the light-illuminated side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we reproduced the experiment in Fig 2B under localized illumination without beads and visualized the dynamics of T4P at the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wild type, T4P were extended only in the illuminated region (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, T4P appeared uniformly when the cell body of the pixD mutant was partially subjected to light (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification measurements clearly revealed the above tendency (Fig 4C), indicating that a partial illumination was sufficient to trigger the extension of T4P from all regions (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of PixD is presumably to suppress the extension in unilluminated areas, which is consistent with the scenario deduced from the results in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such asymmetric distribution of T4P may be associated with the pilus assembly motor, PilB1, because the region of T4P production has a similar dimension to the crescent localization of PilB1 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Three_Phases_in_the_Realization_of_Phototaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, 3, and 4 suggest the possibility that the role of PixD is not to activate but rather to suppress T4P extension to achieve negative phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this were the case, this suppression process could be quantitatively detected via the twitching motility of the cell body triggered by blue-light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we precisely analyzed both the directed motion of the wild type and the relatively random motion of the pixD mutant under lateral illumination of blue light (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and S8 and Movies S1 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The traces clearly showed the negative phototaxis in the wild type, whereas the pixD mutant wiggled (Fig 5A, Left and Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No substantial motility appeared without exposure (Fig 5A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plotted displacements of 50 samples along the x axis, which is the direction of light propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wild type, the directed movement was barely observed for the first 1 min in most cells (Fig 5B, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tendency was clearly visible in the average of traces (Fig 5C, Left) because the net displacement was almost zero for the first 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the question of how the cell movement transitions to the directed movement, we plotted the mean square displacement (MSD) of all cells (Fig 5 D, Left, and E, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the average of MSD linearly increased with time from 0.2 to 1.0 min after the light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was more notable in the magnified view (Fig 5E, Inset), proving that the twitching motility was activated randomly with an apparent diffusion coefficient of 1.2 m2/s, which is good agreement with the scaling behavior of the motility in other bacteria (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The start point of the parabolic line indicates the phase transition to directed twitching motility as a result of the negative phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the pixD mutant, the behavior of cells was different from that in the wild type with respect to directed or random motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The raw traces were fluctuating, and the net displacement was zero (Fig 5B, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linearity of MSD ensured that the twitching motility of the mutant was also activated, and the slope coincided with that of the wild type (Fig 5 D, Right, and E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no parabolic region appeared for the pixD mutant, and MSD linearly increased for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our interpretation of the results in Fig 5 is that the negative phototaxis accompanies transitions between three phases (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, cells are exposed to light, but a delay is needed before starting the wiggling motion within 0.2 min; this is the first phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delay is comparable to the time required for the extension of T4P filaments, a speed of 0.3 m/s to be 3 m in length (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second phase, pili uniformly appear from all directions of the cell surface, and so random twitching motility is activated both in the wild type and pixD mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random movement in the wild type is terminated by PixD within 1 min after the exposure, by suppression of the extension of T4P filaments only at the unilluminated region of the cell surface (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, 3, and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the third phase, Synechocystis drives the motion only by uninhibited pili, which directs the cell body away from the light illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transitions between phases are the essence of negative phototaxis in this species, and other bacteria having photoreceptors might share a common mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrated that the mechanism of taxis in Synechocystis is substantially different from the mechanism of motility in well-studied bacteria such as Salmonella (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flagellated bacteria induce directional net displacement by a change in the frequency of the transition between tumbling and swimming (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy is reasonable, considering that the direction of the swimming in bacteria is fixed to the long axis of an ellipsoidal cell body; i.e., cells can only move on the axis along which flagella protrude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, T4P can extend from all directions of the body, and thus cells can move in any direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the taxis in Synechocystis is achieved by an asymmetric distribution of T4P in the cell body, although cells are fundamentally sphere-shaped, symmetric in rotation, and not polarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We visualized that the cell has the asymmetric distribution of T4P to move away from directional blue light (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also suggest that the above polarization is triggered by the local difference of blue-light intensity, and the T4P extension was activated at the region where the intensity is higher (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations appear to have conflicting results because blue light would be expected to work as a repellent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this could be explained by the microoptics effect of the cell, as previously reported (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a single cell is exposed to collimated light, the cell condenses the light into the opposite side of the light source because the cell body works as an optics with a diffraction index higher than water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was proposed to explain positive phototaxis (18), and we extended the model to negative phototaxis based on the result of direct visualization of T4P and its dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that cell bodies function as an optics was directly confirmed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy seems reasonable because a microorganism with a size on the order of the visible wavelength cannot produce any structure to shield itself from light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we elucidated the following sequence of events from stimulus to taxis in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, blue-light stimulation induces the phototactic response as the uniform extension of T4P filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of pilus assembly motor PilB1 may not be completed at the specific part of the cell in this stage (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, after 1-min delay, T4P dynamics is regulated to be asymmetric along the light axis through the photoreceptor PixD, which mediates a suppression of the T4P dynamics in the region where the intensity is relatively low (Fig 5F and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because PixD is known to form a complex with the response regulator, PixE, and the complex is disassembled by the illumination of blue light in vivo (17, 29, 30), it is conceivable that the 1-min delay observed in Fig 5 originates from the above reaction, whereas the role of PixE to the suppression is not yet clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cell produced directional cell motility as resultant negative phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experimental setup enables us to evaluate the regulation of T4P filament under an optical microscope on a timescale of minutes and thus could be an ideal tool to quantify the detail of phototactic responses in Synechocystis (14, 15, 18, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also visualized the retraction of T4P by tracking a fluorescent bead that attached to the edge of a single pilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay could contribute to quantification of the dynamic properties of T4P, which may be common in other bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrheae (6, 32) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of our experimental system and mutants that lack other receptors or key proteins in various species will reveal more detailed mechanisms in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Lateral light illumination was applied from the left side of the microscope stage at an angle of 5 degrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical light illumination was applied from the objective lens with a dichroic mirror (Di02-R488; Semrock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For partial illumination, the Ronchi ruling (Edmond) was set at the conjugative position of the sample plane to be a 2-m interval on the sample stage (Fig S10 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibration of the blue-light intensity was done as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue-light intensity from a halogen lamp with a band-pass filter (FF01-483/32; Semrock) was measured with a power meter (Q82017A; Advantest), and it was confirmed that the intensity of a fluorescent bead with a size of 0.2 m (F8848; Thermo Fisher) through a filter set (FITC-5050A; Semrock) was increased with increasing light intensity (Fig S10 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linearity was also confirmed by the lateral and vertical illumination with neutral-density filters in the range of 1010,000 mol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
