Extreme cellular adaptations and cell differentiation required by a cyanobacterium for carbonate excavation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microorganisms can play a significant role as agents of erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Euendolithic cyanobacteria, photosynthetic microorganisms that bore their way into carbonate substrates, are among the most important bioerosive agents known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which they dissolve and excavate carbonate rocks has remained a mystery for decades, but is now known to involve calcium transport from cell to cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we show that the mechanism involves two adaptations unprecedented in prokaryotic biology: the polar placement of calcium and proton transporting enzymes in a manner that is coordinated between cells and the differentiation of a novel type of cell that is able to accumulate calcium at levels some 500-fold those found in normal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some cyanobacteria, known as euendoliths, excavate and grow into calcium carbonates, with their activity leading to significant marine and terrestrial carbonate erosion and to deleterious effects on coral reef and bivalve ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their environmental relevance, the mechanisms by which they can bore have remained elusive and paradoxical, in that, as oxygenic phototrophs, cyanobacteria tend to alkalinize their surroundings, which will encourage carbonate precipitation, not dissolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cyanobacteria must rely on unique adaptations to bore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with the filamentous euendolith, Mastigocoleus testarum, indicated that excavation requires both cellular energy and transcellular calcium transport, mediated by P-type ATPases, but the cellular basis for this phenomenon remains obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present evidence that excavation in M. testarum involves two unique cellular adaptations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-range calcium transport is based on active pumping at multiple cells along boring filaments, orchestrated by the preferential localization of calcium ATPases at one cell pole, in a ring pattern, facing the cross-walls, and by repeating this placement and polarity, a pattern that breaks at branching and apical cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, M. testarum differentiates specialized cells we call calcicytes, that which accumulate calcium at concentrations more than 500-fold those found in other cyanobacteria, concomitantly and drastically lowering photosynthetic pigments and enduring severe cytoplasmatic alkalinization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcicytes occur commonly, but not exclusively, in apical parts of the filaments distal to the excavation front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that calcicytes allow for fast calcium flow at low, nontoxic concentrations through undifferentiated cells by providing buffering storage for excess calcium before final excretion to the outside medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vectorial_Transfilamentous_Calcium_Transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If transport were driven exclusively by distal apical pumps, then severing a filament midway should not result in leakage of calcium at the breakpoint, given that the extracellular concentration in seawater medium (10 mM) is much higher than physiologically plausible (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if pumps existed along the entire filament, they would remain active, and localized regions of calcium supersaturation in the medium would be observed adjacent to filament breakpoints, just as it is seen close to the apical cells that extrude Ca2+ to the outside medium (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical severing of boring filaments at various filament locations after making them accessible by cleaving the mineral substrate along the direction of excavation did indeed result in substantial and localized increases in Ca2+ in regions directly adjacent to damaged filaments (Fig 1B, white arrowheads), as measured with extracellular Ca2+ dyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To continually bleed Ca2+, as observed, a back pressure of calcium must have existed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pressure can only be supplied by continuous active pumping of an adjacent cell into the severed cell (or the space around the severed cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Ca2+ pumping occurs along the length of each boring filament, using many active pumps located in more than one cell within each filament, clearly invalidating the notion that transcellular pumping is driven by a negative pressure established at the distal apical cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Type_Calcium_ATPase_Localization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The inhibition of calcium extrusion in BC008 by P-type calcium ATPase-binding antagonists, such as thapsigargin (10, 16), had revealed their agency in the process of calcium extrusion during boring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to localize the exact sites of activity of these enzymes, we used fluorescently labeled thapsigargin (BDTH), which has been shown to bind specifically to eukaryotic P-type calcium ATPases (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls using only the fluorophore [boron-dipyrromethene-FL (BODIPY-Fl), with no thapsigargin] showed some nonspecific binding to the extracellular sheath, but no particular binding patterns, and no membrane colocalization (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control with thapsigargin alone showed no fluorescence in the appropriate channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. testarum strain BC008 stained with BDTH displayed homogenous membrane staining, but significantly higher signal was observed close to the cell septal region (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional reconstructions of the optical sections show that the regions of increased staining manifest as an annulus adjacent to the septal area (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, only one of the two septal sides in a given cell showed preferential staining, and the polarity of the annuli tended to be repetitive along neighboring cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate experiments using membrane-specific dies showed that our current technique allows us to resolve both sides of the septa (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly suggests a sequential, vectorial transport in a single, coherent direction along the filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coordinated polar pattern seems to break down at filament branches, or at certain regions of adjacent cells containing very low photopigment autofluorescence (PSAF), in which signals are intense all around the membrane (Fig 2A, asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some of these special regions, one can indeed see two zones of intense BDTH staining at opposite sides of the same septum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boring filaments that had been disinterred from the calcite matrix showed indistinguishable patterns of binding to those seen in mineral-free filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the intensity of BDTH signal in boring biomass was significantly higher (six times; P less_than 0.03, t test), indicating an increased presence of the transporters in membranes of boring cells (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corroborates previous findings at the gene expression level (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As P-type ATPases extrude calcium, they antiport protons (19) and are likely to alter pH locally if found in sufficient concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorophore to monitor intracellular variations in pH that may denote their activity and preferred location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the localization observed by direct staining, we could observe clear periplasmic alkalization adjacent to septal annular regions (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations support the central role of P-type calcium ATPases in the excavation process, indicating the presence of a vectorial arrangement of these pumps in vegetative cells that drives transcellular transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracellular_Calcium_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cyanobacteria show a very tight regulation of Ca2+i levels, typically in the low nanomolar range (15, 20, 21), but Ca2+ pumping in euendoliths could potentially create transient or even continued intracellular hyperaccumulation (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used several approaches to probe Ca2+i in strain BC008.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our initial studies, we used the extracellular indicator calcium green 5-N (CG5N), noticing that after prolonged incubation, it could penetrate filaments of BC008.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CG5N with transversally cracked calcite chips containing intact filaments (Fig 3E), Ca2+i accumulation was clearly observed in cells corresponding to apical distal tips as they extended into the liquid medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some groups of cells inside the chip did also show such accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these high-calcium cells, which we call calcicytes, presented visibly less photosynthetic pigment (judged by their low PSAF signal) than cells with low Ca2+i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diagnostic inverse PSAF-to-calcium signal of calcicytes was not exclusive of apical distal areas, but was also found in specific stretches along filaments, in individual cells, or more often than not, in a group of adjacent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained using the intracellular Ca2+ reporter dye Fluo-5F AM both in cultures boring inside calcite chips (Fig S3B) and those grown planktonically (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this marked cellular heterogeneity in Ca2+i was an unusual trait specific to BC008 or was common to cyanobacteria at large, we extended our analyses to two common but not endolithic laboratory strains of filamentous cyanobacteria: Nostoc punctiforme 29133 and Microcoleus vaginatus strain PCC 9802.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two strains showed very low Ca2+i signal compared with that obtained in strain BC008, and very small cell-to-cell variations in Ca2+i (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. testarum BC008 clearly shows a high degree of cellular heterogeneity of both Ca2+i content and photosynthetic pigment complement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quantitative analysis of the average volumetric calcium and PSAF intensities in cells of BC008 shows the presence of two distinct cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One encompasses cells with PSAF and calcium similar to Microcoleus or Nostoc (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second population, which typically includes cells close to the tips of filaments (Fig 3D, colored squares), has high Ca2+i signals; in cells from this population, there is a linear inverse relationship between Ca2+i and photopigment, indicative of progressive spatial separation between photosynthesis and Ca2+i hyperaccumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be logically postulated that high Ca2+i levels may interfere with photosynthesis, and that there is a causal relationship in this correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that hyperaccumulating cells are clearly neither dead nor moribund: intracellular dyes are only fluorescent in the presence of active cellular esterases (22, 23), and all cells contained intact DNA (as determined by DAPI staining, not shown), which speaks for the integrity of the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the most parsimonious explanation for these findings is that cells in distal apical (and some intercalary) regions may be differentiating into specialized calcium Ca2+i holding cells, or calcicytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The levels of Ca2+i observed in calcicytes are unprecedented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average Ca2+i signals in M. testarum (including cells with low and high calcium content) were sixfold higher than those in Nostoc and threefold higher than those in Microcoleus under identical imaging and staining conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal Ca2+i could reach 22- and sixfold higher, respectively (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we could not quantitate Ca2+i in BC008 directly, the resting Ca2+i concentration in Anabaena is around 200 nM (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming this level to be typical for filamentous cyanobacteria, some calcicytes of nonboring BC008 biomass accumulated 45 µM Ca2+i and boring calcicytes upward of 100 M, which is 500-fold the resting levels seen in canonical Nostoc cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracellular_pH_Heterogeneity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assessing intracellular pH (pHi) in BC008 was imperative to establish a direct connection among transport of calcium in normal cells, its accumulation in calcicytes, and the mechanism of known calcium ATPases (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although homeostatic regulation of pHi in cyanobacteria is not completely understood, they do not tolerate large drops in external pH (24, 25), and those studied keep circumneutral pHi, even under alkaline external conditions (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a ratiometric pHi indicator [2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; BCECF-AM] to interrogate relative pHi variability in BC008, and could indeed document clear alkalinization within many of the cells containing low PSAF, including distal apical cell groups (Fig 4), indicating that they, in fact, correspond to calcicytes, consistent with the predicted alkalinizing effect of a calcium/proton antiport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our attempts to directly calibrate the pHi data in BC008 were unsuccessful, comparisons with absolute calibration curves carried out in N. punctiforme were used as a reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nonboring cultures, we could detect alkalinization (pH = 1) in cells fitting the low PSAF diagnostic for calcicytes, including apical cell groups (Fig 4 A and B, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, in these cultures, vegetative cell pH was kept slightly acidic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In boring cultures, cellular variations in pH were much larger (pH = 3), with calcicytes reaching pH above 9.5 (upper limit for reliable measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In excavating filaments, cells of acidic pH were closer to the boring front (Fig 4 C and D), in agreement with an overall directional counter transport of protons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of such pHi variations is consistent with those seen in Ca2+i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcicytes thus sustain severe alkalization of the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incidentally, given that the fluorescent yield of most calcium fluorophores is strongly quenched by increasing pH (10), a second corollary of a calcicytes high alkalinity, the levels of Ca2+i we inferred for them are likely underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results shed light on the cellular basis of microbial carbonate excavation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, they point to a sophisticated mechanism that involves two types of unique cellular adaptations: marked, coordinated, cell polarity in calcium transport within normal cells, and the differentiation of a specialized cell type, the calcicyte, which accumulates large concentrations of Ca2+i and sustains significant alkalization of the cytoplasm, likely to the detriment of their photosynthetic capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot ascertain, at this time, whether high Ca2+i or pHi simply impedes photosynthesis, leading to degradation of photosynthetic pigmentation, or whether there is a morphogenetic regulatory mechanism at play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that this euendolithic cyanobacterium maintains Ca2+i levels low and pHi circumneutral (maybe slightly acidic under boring conditions) in most cells, even in the face of high transport fluxes, by concentrating excesses in a few calcicytes that serve as capacitors, or depots for the long-range transport of Ca2+ between mineral and outside medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcicytes are located at crucial points in the flow or, typically, at the distal apical areas, in preparation for final excretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a calcicytes phototrophic capacity is fully impeded, it must rely on resources imported from vegetative cells for energy and fixed carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular basis of calcium transport seems to rely on a biased distribution in the localization of P-type calcium ATPases, across the filaments, which preferentially pump into the periplasm at one side of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this to work, one has to postulate the presence of calcium channels for passive diffusion into the next cell; we do not have evidence of this yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a distribution, with ATPases at one side of the cell and channels at the other, if repetitive, could easily account for vectorial transport while maintaining low intracellular concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct cell-to-cell transport is less likely, as it would have to cross large spaces that span two cell membranes and one peptidoglycan-rich periplasm (the septum is between 30 and 40 nm thick, and the outer membrane does not extend into the septal region; Fig S1 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct transport would fail to explain the localized pH excursions seen in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some aspects beyond the presence of calcium channels remain to be studied in any detail, particularly how the initial mineral calcium enters the cell past the cell envelope (through the sheath, across two membranes, and the periplasm) at the apical cells in the boring front, and how they are fully extruded at the apical cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As far as we know, such transcellular, vectorial calcium transport is unique to euendolithic cyanobacteria and represents a novel physiological adaptation in these organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that pHi dynamics are complex in this organism and directly linked to calcium traffic, presumably in the opposite direction of calcium, toward the boring front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would facilitate crystal dissolution by allowing the continued conversion of carbonate anions to bicarbonate and CO2, which could be used as a carbon source in autotrophy within the crystal matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, Na+ may directly or indirectly adjuvate the proton counter transport by neutralizing any charge imbalance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each filament would then be made up of repeating units of polar cells, with one side allowing calcium entry (boring side) and the other mediating calcium release (and subsequent proton entry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is particularly appealing, as it may also explain the ability of single cells (3) to bore, given that such a single cell could not penetrate the mineral without some type of calcium transport polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
That the evidence for traits necessary for boring, such as the polar localization of calcium transporters (through thapsigargin staining), calcicyte differentiation, and marked Ca2+i/pHi heterogeneity among cells, was observed not only in boring cultures but also in mineral-free filaments indicates that the boring capacity is constitutive, always on, in M. testarum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences found between the two growth modes were only in intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely reflects the fact that these organisms are found exclusively in the boring form in natural settings, so there is no fitness value in a hardwired induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that the only mineral-free form of this organism in nature is that of hormogonia during dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note here that, in agreement with this view, M. testarum strain BC008 cultured without carbonate easily loses its ability to bore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any event, the sophistication of true multicellular differentiation and division of labor in a single prokaryotic organism is remarkable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiation of calcicytes comes in addition to heterocyst formation, true branching, coordinated changes in trichome width, and formation of motile hormogonia for dispersal, all present in BC008 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we have a rather significant fossil record of euendolithic cyanobacteria dating back 1.5 Ga (28), one can infer that such true multicellular (i.e., beyond morphological) (29) adaptations in cyanobacteria are quite ancient as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultures_and_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mineral-free cultures of M. testarum strain BC008 used for experimentation were grown in standard, vented-cap, tissue culture flasks containing 15 mL PES-30 medium, which consists of 30 g Instant Ocean, 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mL a PES nutrient solution stock (30) per liter of distilled water adjusted to a pH of 8.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were incubated on a slowly rocking platform, using a 16 h light/ 8 h dark diel illumination cycle, at a light intensity of 22 mol photon m2s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boring cultures were obtained by adding ethanol-sterilized calcite chips (blocky calcite, Wards Scientific) of small size (less_than 5 mm3) to mineral-free cultures until the chips were colonized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures of N. punctiforme ATCC 21933 and M. vaginatus strain PCC 9802, used for comparisons, were obtained from stocks grown in liquid BG11° medium and Jaworskis medium (31), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Confocal_Microscopy_and_Image_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on either a Leica SP2 or a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained at a minimum of 1,024 × 1,024 resolution (unless specifically noted), with a minimum line average of 2 and a scan rate maximum of 400 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All image analyses were performed using the MBF 64-bit distribution of the image analysis software ImageJ (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each emission channel, we acquired individual Z stacks of images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each channel stack was background normalized by setting the lower pixel intensity value to that which was observed in stacks obtained from appropriate unstained controls, using identical imaging conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear contrast optimization was performed on a case-by-case basis and applied equally to all stacks analyzed simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As needed, normalized images in a stack were then summed, merged, and projected into a single image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess relative concentration of analytes, regions of interest were manually circumscribed around cells of interest in a summed stack, and the average value of the area was divided by the cells thickness, yielding a value with units relative fluorescence unit per cubic micron (RFU/m3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral characteristics of the lipid membrane binding dye used (FM4-64FX) overlap with the endogenous pigmentation (PSAF) emission of BC008; thus, to visualize the outer lipid membranes, the PSAF channel was used to create a binary mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mask was then used to remove PSAF signal from the FM4-64FX channel, leaving behind only pixels that correspond to emission from dye bound to the outer cellular envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the total amount of BODIPYthapsigargin binding between boring and mineral-free biomass, we processed the image stacks as previously described and measured the total pixel average (measurement of all image pixels) BDTH signal intensity for the normalized, summed, projected stacks by the average total PSAF signal intensity to account for differences in biomass between each image series to obtain a ratio of BDTH signal to PSAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calcium_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CG5N is canonically used as an extracellular dye in eukaryotic cell biology (34); however, we observed that extended incubation time (1 h) of M. testarum strain BC008 in CG5N resulted in intracellular CG5N signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actively excavated mineral chip fragments were placed in 10 mL PES-30 with 1 µM CG5N and incubated for at least 1 h under standard culture conditions before imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an effort to validate the observed intracellular CG5N signal, we choose to use a second calcium fluorophore with a lower Kd value than CG5N, Fluo5F-AM (2.3 M, as opposed to 5 mM), which is typically used as an intracellular calcium indicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dye also enabled interspecies comparisons, as CG5N did not seem to penetrate other cyanobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineral-free biomass or single chips containing actively boring biomass were placed in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes and rinsed with fresh PES-30 two times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were then resuspended in 300 L fresh medium containing 25 M Fluo5F-AM (50 M for boring cultures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature and then washed twice in fresh media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were performed as previously stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

P-Type_Calcium_ATPase_Localization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thapsigargin is a pharmaceutical found to inhibit P-type calcium ATPases (18) that is also a potent antagonist to the enzymes responsible for calcium transport and excretion during carbonate boring in M. testarum strain BC008, as well as in other euendolithic cyanobacteria in nature (10, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an effort to determine the cellular localization of these P-type calcium ATPases responsible for Ca2+ transport during excavation, we used a fluorescently labeled analog of thapsigargin (BODPIY-FL, BDTH) that retains its binding specificity to the transporters in vivo in animal systems (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, mineral-free biomass was placed in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, rinsed with fresh PES-30 twice, and incubated in 300 L fresh medium containing 20 M BDTH for 3 h at room temperature in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then spun and washed twice with fresh media before imaging, as described earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls were run using the fluorescent carrier alone (DMSO), thapsigargin alone (no BODIPY), and BODIPY-FL alone (no thapsigargin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boring biomass was disinterred from the carbonate substrate, following the published protocol (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lightly bored calcite chips with the external biomass lightly brushed free were prechilled on ice in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 300 L PES-30 media for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These chips were then subjected to EDTA disinterment, but without continual brushing, as soon as boring beds of filaments became loose, the entire bed was transferred, using sterile fine-tipped forceps, to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube containing chilled fresh PES-30 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beds were gently washed twice without centrifugation and resuspended in PES-30 containing 20 M BD-TH and incubated for 3 h, at room temperature, in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were carefully washed twice without centrifugation, and fresh medium was added before imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BCECF-AM_Ratiometric_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess intracellular pH, we used the ratiometric intracellular pH indicator BCECF-AM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicator has a pH-independent (isobestic) excitation point (445 nm) and a pH-dependent excitation point (488496 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closest laser excitation wavelength to the isobestic point in our laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy was 458 nm, which, although not optimal, was sufficient to detect changes with significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted to create a pH calibration curve using nigericin/valinomycin to obtain absolute pH values; however, the ionophores showed little effect over a large range of tested concentrations in M. testarum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we were able to obtain a good standard curve using N. punctiforme ATCC 21933, which closely followed an exponential regression between pH 6 and 9.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before loading Nostoc with dye, cells were incubated in BG11° containing 10 mM EDTA, spun, washed, and resuspended in fresh BG11° containing 25 M BCECF-AM and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were then transferred into the various pH-calibrated buffers containing 50 M nigericin and 5 M valinomycin and imaged after a 30 min incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular BCECF values were determined by isolating only pixels contributing to intracellular signal by using image masking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Masking was done similarly to in Corvini et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; however, image thresholding was performed using Lis iterative algorithm for minimum cross entropy thresholding, which is integrated into ImageJ (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each channel stack was multiplied by the masks, and then the projected (summed projections) 496-nm image was divided by the 458-nm channel in ImageJ (pixel by pixel) to obtain a 32-bit ratiometric image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This final image represents the relative intracellular pH values for the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each cell was assigned as a region of interest, and average cellular ratio values were plotted against respective pH values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting regression curve was used to approximate the intracellular pH in Mastigocoleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
