Global biogeochemical cycle of vanadium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human emissions of vanadium to atmosphere exceed natural sources by a factor of 1.7 and are destined to rise dramatically as we switch to the use of heavy oils, tar sands, and bitumen as combustion sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breathing vanadium-rich aerosols has unknown but potentially adverse health impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human impacts on the global vanadium cycle parallel impacts on the global cycles for Pb and Hg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesizing published data, we provide a quantitative summary of the global biogeochemical cycle of vanadium (V), including both human-derived and natural fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through mining of V ores (130 × 109 g V/y) and extraction and combustion of fossil fuels (600 × 109 g V/y), humans are the predominant force in the geochemical cycle of V at Earths surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human emissions of V to the atmosphere are now likely to exceed background emissions by as much as a factor of 1.7, and, presumably, we have altered the deposition of V from the atmosphere by a similar amount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive V in air and water has potential, but poorly documented, consequences for human health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the atmospheric flux probably derives from emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, but the magnitude of this flux depends on the type of fuel, with relatively low emissions from coal and higher contributions from heavy crude oils, tar sands bitumen, and petroleum coke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing interest in petroleum derived from unconventional deposits is likely to lead to greater emissions of V to the atmosphere in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis further suggests that the flux of V in rivers has been incremented by about 15% from human activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the budget of dissolved V in the oceans is remarkably well balancedwith about 40 × 109 g V/y to 50 × 109 g V/y inputs and outputs, and a mean residence time for dissolved V in seawater of about 130,000 y with respect to inputs from rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Natural_Sources  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural V mobilization from Earths crust occurs dominantly through mechanical and chemical rock weathering, with lesser contributions from other pathways such as volcanic emissions and aeolian processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mechanical weathering, Hope (24) estimates that 2,300 × 109 g V/y is transported to the sea in suspended sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest a somewhat (30%) lower value, 1,625 × 109 g V/y, derived from the transport of total suspended sediment, 12.6 × 1015 g/y (25), and the mean concentration of 129 mg V/kg in sediments (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With respect to chemical weathering, Shiller and Mao (12) observed that world rivers are characterized by relatively constant dissolved V/Si ratio (66 × 106 mol V/mol Si), suggesting that dissolved V and Si are dominantly derived from chemical weathering of silicate rocks (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a detailed study of global weathering, Gaillardet et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28) concluded that virtually all dissolved silica in rivers derives from silicate weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the approach of Shiller and Mao (12), we calculate the V flux from chemical weathering as 21 × 109 g/y, using their V/Si correlation and a recent estimate of global dissolved silicate flux (380 × 1012 g/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculated value for chemical weathering of V is in the middle of the range of earlier estimates for the transport of dissolved V to the oceans in rivers, 8 × 109 g/y to 32 × 109 g/y (12, 3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anthropogenic_Sources_from_Earth's_Crust  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate the global anthropogenic V flux from the mining and combustion of coals, exploitation and utilization of petroleum and its products, and direct extraction and processing of V compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the exploitation of these resources has increased significantly during the last few decades, which has contributed to a greater mobilization of V through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worldwide, 85% of V is used as an additive in steel alloys; V is also used as a catalyst in the chemical industry and, increasingly, in V redox batteries (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Sinks_for_V_Mobilized_from_Earth_s_Crust  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like other low-volatility elements, most V mobilized on land is transported to the oceans, where it is removed by a variety of processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of sedimentary V in subduction zones can account for 150 × 109 g V/y, calculated from estimates of the mass of subducted sediment (1.3 × 1015 g/y) multiplied by its average V concentration (116 mg/kg; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  69 and 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, Hope (24) estimates 640 × 109 g of V is removed by subduction of ocean sediment each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both estimates are substantially lower than our estimate of the delivery of V to the oceans in suspended sediments (1,625 × 109 g/y; Mobilization of V from Earth's Crust).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of suspended sediment delivered to the oceans is not subducted, however, but is instead deposited on passive continental margins and other areas of the ocean floor not currently subject to subduction (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate the mass of this sequestered ocean sediment as 11.3 × 1015 g/y, following the approach of Rae and Ruff (71) and substituting the recent estimates of sediment supply and subduction noted above (12.6 × 1015 g/y and 1.3 × 1015 g/y, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplying the mass of sediment sequestered by the mean concentration of V in sediment (129 mg V/kg; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26), we calculate that about 1,460 × 109 g V/y is sequestered in oceanic sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
V is widely recognized for its retention on organic materials, especially under reducing conditions (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a concentration of 100 mg V/kg in organic deposits (16), the sequestration of V by the burial of organic matter (of 50% C) in the oceans (0.157 × 1012 g/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74) is only about 0.03 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite its affinity for organic matter, V is largely deposited in inorganic sediments in the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxic sediments tend to release V to seawater, while suboxic (including buried) sediments adsorb and retain dissolved V (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mean concentration of V dissolved in seawater, 1.8 g/L, is higher than that in river waters (0.7 g/L), implying additional sources of V in seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some V is likely released from suspended or accumulating sediments as they experience the higher pH of seawater and from sedimentary environments with oxic conditions (72, 76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hydrothermal vent systems appear to be a net sink rather than a source for V to seawater, with hydrothermal sediment accumulations ranging from 7.1 × 109 g V/y (75, 77) to 22 × 109 g V/y to 28 × 109 g V/y (32, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, while undersea volcanic eruptions at midocean ridges and oceanic volcanoes can influence the seawater composition of various volatile trace elements, V mobilized during such eruptions appears to be rapidly deposited on surrounding seafloor (78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of the dissolved V in rivers (21 × 109 g V/y to 30 × 109 g V/y) and the release from oxic sediments (15 × 109 g V/y to 41 × 109 g V/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  75) can accommodate the estimated uptake by hydrothermal deposits (22 109 g V/y to 28 × 109 g V/y) and suboxic marine sediments (22 × 109 g V/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  75), so that the budget for dissolved V in the ocean is reasonably well balanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mean residence time for dissolved V in the oceans is about 130,000 y, with respect to river inputs [i.e., 2.7 × 1015 g of V dissolved in seawater (13) divided by 21 × 109 g dissolved V in rivers (this paper)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated mean residence time decreases to about 42,000 y if the influx includes rivers, atmospheric deposition, and release from oxic sediments (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, Whitfield and Turner (80) estimate a mean residence time of about 100,000 y, based on the partitioning of V between seawater and marine sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exchange_of_V_with_Earth_s_Atmosphere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural_Sources_in_the_Atmosphere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
V is delivered to the atmosphere as aerosols derived from various natural processes, each of which represents a small source relative to rock weathering, as discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current evidence suggests that the largest source of atmospheric V aerosols is wind erosion, with previous estimates ranging from 16 × 109 g V/y to 27 × 109 g V/y (15, 81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this range, we provide a larger estimate of 155 × 109 g V/y, based on the eolian mobilization of crustal materials with particle sizes of less_than10 m (i.e., PM10; 1,600 × 1012 g/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  82) multiplied by the mean concentration of V in Earths crust (97 mg/kg; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The next largest source of atmospheric V is subaerial volcanic emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common approach to calculate the global flux of trace metals from volcanic activity has been to estimate their metal/sulfur ratios and multiply by the relatively well-investigated volcanic sulfur emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous estimates using this method suggest a global range for V emissions of 0.1 × 109 g/y to 5.5 × 109 g/y (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15, adjusted for an error noted by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this approach and refinements upon it are logical for estimating the volcanic flux of volatile trace metals (e.g., Hg, Pb, Cd; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  84), it is likely less appropriate for estimating fluxes of low-volatility metals, such as V, which are emitted primarily in volcanic ash (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78, 83, and 8587).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, building on the approach of Duce and Hoffman (81), we calculate V/Al ratios of volcanic particulates (using a range of upper crustal and andesitic values of 15.3 to 17 wt.% Al2O3; and 97 mg/kg V to 175 mg/kg V; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) and multiply by two estimates of global volcanic Al emissions [4,500 × 109 g/y (88); 13,280 × 109 g/y (83)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the lower Al emission value, we calculate global volcanic V fluxes ranging from 5 × 109 g V/y to 10 × 109 g V/y, similar to the estimate of Duce and Hoffman (81), while the higher Al value suggests a range of 14 × 109 g V/y to 29 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wildfires are also a source of V in the atmosphere, estimated between 1.8 × 109 g/y and 13 × 109 g/y (15, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate wildfire emissions of V by assuming that 5 × 1015 g/y of biomass are burned annually (89), volatilizing V from tissues that have a mean concentration of 1 mg/kg (10), and thus delivering 5 × 109 g V/y to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, while sea salt aerosols have been shown to be a significant atmospheric source for some elements (e.g., Na, B, Cl), little V is mobilized by this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate that production of sea salt aerosols at the oceans surface (10.1 × 1015 g/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  82) multiplied by the ratio of V to total dissolved solids in seawater (5.14 × 108) would inject 0.52 × 109 g V/y into the marine atmospherea trivial flux in its global cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zoller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14) indicate an even smaller value, 0.012 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Monakhov et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (64) estimated that the annual V flux to the atmosphere from petroleum combustion during the year 2000 was 113 × 109 g/y, which represented about 69% of the V contained in petroleum extracted from the ground (165 × 109 g V/y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, global oil production has increased, and the V content in extracted petroleum may lie between 138 × 109 g V/y and 410 × 109 g V/y (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While improvements have been made in developed countries to capture a greater proportion of the particulate flux from all forms of fossil fuel combustion (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  91), this is offset by increased emissions in developing countries and the absence of emissions regulations for various types of fuel in some developed countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visschedijk et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (92) report that 69% of the emissions of V are not subject to scrubbing in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume that 69% of the V content from petroleum combustion is emitted to the atmosphere, we calculate that the current flux may be as high as 283 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flux now dominates the emission of V to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anthropogenic additions of V to the atmosphere may now exceed natural sources by a factor of 1.7 (Table 1)larger than the similar ratios for Hg and Pb, but somewhat lower than estimated by previous workers (24, 93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An increasing fraction of V atmospheric emissions estimated above derives from combustion of unconventional petroleum products, such as residual/heavy oils and petroleum coke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective incorporation of V into high molecular weight organic compounds (57) controls the preservation and accumulation of V in residual organic materials during distillation and refining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, V is enriched in the residues during the conversion and refinement of oil and bitumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global production of residual/heavy oil was about 467 million metric tons per year in 2014, although, in recent years, demand has decreased in most sectors (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other notable residue products include petroleum coke, a solid carbon-rich material increasingly used as a combustion fuel due to its high carbon content, low cost, and growing abundance (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V enrichment in these residues is often marked; for example, petroleum coke produced during distillation of bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in Canada shows a mean V concentration of 1,280 ± 120 mg/kg (96), while bitumen from this region ranges from 60 mg/kg to 640 mg/kg (97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The global production of petroleum coke rose to about 124 million metric tons per year in 2014, with the United States producing about 47% (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 70% of worldwide production is used as a source of combustible fuel (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, petroleum coke substitutes for coal; for example, in 2002, about 10% of power plants in Kentucky utilized petroleum coke instead of coal (98).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fly ash originating from combustion of petroleum coke is highly enriched in V, with reported concentrations between 2,000 mg/kg and 40,000 mg/kg (99, 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, fugitive emission of fly ash particles from petroleum coke combustion would result in high atmospheric emission of V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the absence of effective scrubber systems, combustion of heavy oils and petroleum coke can dominate regional atmospheric V emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a study of 2005 emissions in northwestern Europe showed that combustion of residual oil (e.g., ships and petroleum refineries) and petroleum coke (power plants and refineries) contributed 80% and 18%, respectively, of the total atmospheric emission of V in that region (1.57 × 109 g V/y; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in Spain (101) and in the United States (14, 102) show similar findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on estimates of the current mix of petroleum products exploited (described above), we estimate that unconventional fuels, with their higher V concentrations, represent about 40.5% (166 × 109 g V/y) of the total V mobilized to the atmosphere from the extraction of petroleum (410 × 109 g V/y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we also assume that, of the V emitted to the atmosphere from burning petroleum products (283 × 109 g V/y), 40.5% originates from unconventional fuels, we calculate that 115 × 109 g V/y are released to the atmosphere from the combustion of residual/heavy oil, petroleum coke, and other unconventional fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Sinks_of_V_from_the_Atmosphere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements of the concentration of V in rainfall collected in remote areas and in continental areas subject to human activities range over four orders of magnitude (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whenever possible, we provide the ratio of V to Al in these samples to provide an estimate of the enrichment factor of V in rainwater versus the V in Earths crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the data from remote areas have enrichment factors of less_than10, whereas those from areas of human activities have factors ranging up to 1,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For remote sites, the median concentration of V in rainfall, 0.03 g/L and global precipitation of 5 × 1017 L/y yields an estimate of global atmospheric deposition in rainfall of 15 × 109 g V/y in preindustrial times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This atmospheric deposition of V might have accounted for a small portion of the dissolved V in rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For modern conditions, we assume that the wet deposition over the oceans has not been affected by human activities and thus could be 11 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the land, the median of all concentration values for V in modern precipitation, 0.4 g/L, would imply deposition of 45 × 109 g V/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median of samples with enrichment factors of less_than10 would imply deposition of 35 × 109 g V/y from the atmosphere and a substantial enhancement (9.0×) due to human activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter amounts to slightly more than 20% of estimated gross sources of V in the atmosphere, suggesting that a substantial amount of dry deposition must occur near sources of human emissions (7, 103, 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some V is carried long distances in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, dissolved and particulate phases are roughly equally represented in Antarctic snow (105), and V in Greenland snow shows a strong relation to crustal dusts, which are the largest natural source of V in the atmosphere (106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the remote atmosphere, concentrations of V are typically about 1 × 109 g/m3, which would result in a global dry deposition of 16 × 109 g/y, assuming a nominal dry deposition velocity of 0.1 cm/s for small particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculation of the sum of wet and dry deposition (72 × 109 g/y) is less than the estimated sources to the atmosphere, leaving us with an unbalanced budget for V in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In urban areas, airborne concentrations can exceed 10 × 109 g/m3 (14, 92, 101, 102), so the atmospheric budget may be balanced by dry deposition near emission sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our data provide insights on the current anthropogenic V fluxes from coal mining and combustion; crude oil exploration, processing, and combustion; and ore mining and industrial processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the beginning of the 21st century, the increasing use of V-rich heavy oil, bitumen, and petroleum coke from unconventional petroleum resources and production residues has changed the V fluxes, such that the V derived from petroleum products is now the largest global flux (56%), followed by coal (26%) and V mining (18%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data on atmospheric V emissions are limited, but the accumulation of V in heavy oils and bitumen residuals, such as petroleum coke, poses a risk associated fugitive emission of V-rich PM, with unknown impacts on human health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
