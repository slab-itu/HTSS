Free-energy landscape of a hyperstable RNA tetraloop  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report a multistate folding free-energy landscape for a hyperstable RNA tetraloop obtained from high-performance molecular dynamic simulations under multiple temperature and pressure conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies advance previous successes of de novo folding of RNA tetraloops and our understanding of the folded landscape of basic RNA motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the canonical A-RNA conformation, our analysis describes de novo folding of a left-handed Z-RNA conformation and the formation of a purine Triplet, each showing differential stabilization as a function of temperature and pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide important insights into the ability of all-atom RNA force fields to describe the conformational heterogeneity of the most basic RNA secondary structures and represent a significant advancement in the utility of RNA molecular dynamics for describing RNA thermodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report the characterization of the energy landscape and the folding/unfolding thermodynamics of a hyperstable RNA tetraloop obtained through high-performance molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling of the configurational landscape is conducted using temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics over three isochores at high, ambient, and negative pressures to determine the thermodynamic stability and the free-energy landscape of the tetraloop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations reveal reversible folding/unfolding transitions of the tetraloop into the canonical A-RNA conformation and the presence of two alternative configurations, including a left-handed Z-RNA conformation and a compact purine Triplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing hydrostatic pressure shows a stabilizing effect on the A-RNA conformation and a destabilization of the left-handed Z-RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a comprehensive description of the folded free-energy landscape of a hyperstable RNA tetraloop and highlight the significant advances of all-atom molecular dynamics in describing the unbiased folding of a simple RNA secondary structure motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermodynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterization of ensembles sampled by the hairpin-forming tetraloop sequence at various thermodynamic states (different temperatures and pressures) is first made by calculating the rmsd of the stem-forming residues relative to the equivalent residues in the NMR experimental structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1ZIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses were conducted across multiple REMD temperature ensembles (Fig 1A) and reveal that the GCAA tetraloop stem adopts three general configurations in the low-temperature to intermediate temperature ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These configurations are represented by (i) a sharp peak at 1.5-Å rmsd, (ii) a significantly populated peak centered at 5.1-Å rmsd, and (iii) a third, less-populated peak centered at 4.2-Å rmsd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these criteria, we refer to the ensemble of configurations that fall within the first peak as the folded state and those within the second and third peaks as alternative states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The thermodynamic stabilities of these three conformations relative to the unfolded ensemble are determined by calculating their relative populations over the sampled temperature range (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lowest temperatures, the folded state (which we will show adopts an A-RNA hairpin) shows a noncooperative unfolding transition up into the intermediate temperatures, whereas conversely, the alternative (nonnative) states show increasing stability up into the intermediate temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above 380 K, all three states show unfolding transitions, and beyond 460 K, these structures are only minimally represented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined together, the three ordered states describe a quasisigmoidal melting curve that mimics a cooperative two-state transition (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Folded_States  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To structurally characterize the ordered ensembles described above, configurations in each temperature were clustered based on rmsd to the experimentally determined folded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sets of ranked centroids representing the average configurational ensembles were used to identify the most common configurations in each temperature ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lowest temperatures, the top 10 clusters represent nearly 65% of the configurational landscape and predominantly exhibit hairpin structures with a canonical A-RNA backbone formed by base pairing of the 3 and 5 GC groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these centroids exhibit highly variable loop geometries with different intraloop hydrogen-bonding interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, several highly ranked cluster centroids describe alternative configurations with nonnative stems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effective separation of different native and nonnative configurations was not achieved with rmsd-based clustering, because many structurally disparate configurations were described by the same centroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an alternative determination of the folded free-energy landscape, we performed a principal component analysis of the dihedral angles (dPCA) (30, 31) of the configurational ensembles in the lowest temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two principal components provided an optimal separation of conformations and effectively described the entire free-energy ensemble in six general configurations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The free energy landscape reveals four centroids with A-RNA stems and differing loop configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two most common configurations show C4 stacked on G3 and A5 forming hydrogen bonds with G3, which causes A6 to be extruded from the loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first centroid, A6 is displaced to the stem minor groove side and adheres to the backbone near A5, whereas the second centroid shows that A6 is displaced to the major groove side of the stem and out into solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third centroid contains a noncanonical sheared interaction between G3 and A6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration is the most similar to the experimental folded state but exhibits a syn-dihedral in A6 that is not characteristic of the experimental configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth A-RNA centroid shows A5 and A6 mutually stacked and extended out and away from the rest of the loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure has been observed in previous simulations as a transition state between the more compact loops in centroids 1 and 2 and the experimental folded state (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to resolving the configurational heterogeneity of the A-RNA hairpin, several highly populated, nonnative conformations were also identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common of these forms a tight loop similar to the A-RNA tetraloops in centroids 1 and 2, but rather than forming the GC stem, a compact purine Triplet structure forms between the two stem guanosines and the extruded A6 (Fig 3, centroid 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All pyrimidines are extruded from this core interaction, with C2 extended into solution and C4 and C8 stacked on G3 and the Triplet, respectively (Fig 3, centroid 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These configurations exhibit rmsd values on the order of 5 Å, which correlate with rmsd histogram peak 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three closely associated peaks in the dPCA landscape describe minor variations in this configuration depending on the stacking of C8 and whether G7 adopts a WatsonCrick association with the backbone or nucleobase of C2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither of these variations is observed to break the Triplet interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second nonnative configuration forms a hairpin with WatsonCrick base pairs but adopts a backbone configuration consistent with a left-handed Z-RNA helix (Fig 3, centroids 7 and 8) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this state, the stem cytosines maintain anti-dihedral angles, whereas the ribose rings reorient their O1 in the 3 direction and adopt C2-endo sugar puckers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, stem and loop guanosines adopt syn-dihedral angles while maintaining C3-endo sugar puckering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the loop, G3 and A6 form a sheared base pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tight associations between K+ ions and the stem minor groove are also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is particular to the CG step in Z-geometry nucleic acids (33), and rapid [picoseconds (ps)] exchanges of ions were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left-handed configurations of nucleic acids are associated with high salt concentration (34) and superhelical twisting (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures exhibit rmsd to the native state of roughly 4 Å, making them a match to rmsd histogram peak 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These folded and alternative configurations form reversibly in all three isochores, and many individual configurations have lifetimes on the order of microseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct conversion between different A-RNA states and the Z-RNA or Triplet states is only observed through unfolding of one configuration before adopting the other (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition kinematics are consistent with the unfolded state serving as a hub that is visited in transitions among the observed ordered states (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pressure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effects of hydrostatic pressure, we determined the average population of each configuration over the shared temperature range for all three isochores (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each folded state, the melting curve retained the same temperature dependency, but pressure exerted clear impacts on the populations of A-RNA and Z-RNA hairpin states over the entire temperature range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At all temperatures in the high-pressure isochore, A-RNA hairpin configurations show increased populations, indicating a systematic stabilization of A-RNA tetraloops by pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the populations of the Z-RNA state diminish relative to increasing pressures and are increased in the negative-pressure isochore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that A-RNA hairpins occupy a lower volume than the unfolded configurations, whereas Z-RNA hairpins likely occupy a higher volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the low number of exchanges between the Triplet state and unfolded ensemble, the errors associated with the Triplet melting curves overlap significantly, and no definitive pressure effects could be ascertained (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The energies of folding in different configurations are readily analyzed by comparing the different folded and unfolded ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses focus on the formation of the native (A-RNA) tetraloop unless otherwise indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The internal energy change on unfolding is determined from EU = EUEF, where EU and EF represent the internal energies of the unfolded and folded ensembles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all three configurations, the energy of unfolding increases approximately linearly with temperature, indicating a constant heat capacity difference in each state (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend for the A-RNA state (red line in Fig 5) is noticeably smaller than that for the other ordered states and has the lowest energy for temperatures below 350 K. Z-RNA has the highest EF of all three configurations over all temperatures (lowest EU) and possesses a higher energy than the unfolded state below 335 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Gibbs free energy of unfolding can be described by the relation G(T,P)U=RTln[NU/NF], where NF and NU represent the numbers of structures adopting a folded or unfolded configuration, respectively, and P represents the average pressure for a given temperature (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Near 310 K, the A-RNA hairpin state shows a GU of 10 kJ/mol in ambient and negative pressures and nearly 15 kJ/mol at high pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Z-RNA hairpin, a maximum GU (4 kJ/mol) is observed at negative pressure, whereas at higher pressures, the GU is approximately 0 because of near-equal populations of unfolded configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Free energy with respect to pressure can be determined, because we sampled identical temperatures in each isochore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the three isochores, a second-order approximation can be made: GU,T(P) = GU,T0 + VU,T(PP0) + U,T(PP0)2, where P0 is the reference pressure, VU,T is the isothermal change in volume, and U,T is the isothermal compressibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fitting to the above relation reveals several important points regarding the pressure stability of the native tetraloop (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the isotherms cannot be fit without nonlinear terms; thus, the change in compressibility (U,T) cannot be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the pseudoparabolic curve of VU and the linear trend of U,T reveal that these coefficients are not constant; thus, GU,T(P) involves higher-order terms in pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, although VU,T remains close to zero throughout the assessed temperature range, the minimum near 335 K indicates that, at this temperature, A-RNA configurations may actually have a lower molar volume than unfolded configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ions_and_Hydration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the association of ions and solvent with A-RNA and Z-RNA tetraloop configurations was analyzed at 350 K in high, ambient, and negative pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distributions of ions relative to polar (P, O, and N), and nonpolar (C) atoms (Fig 8 A and B) show that pressure universally depletes counterion density around the A-RNA state, whereas Z-RNA maintains a higher overall counterion association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both A-RNA and Z-RNA show increased ion accumulation at negative pressures, Z-RNA shows a more dramatic increase, and ion densities at 0.1 and 100 MPa are highly similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both A-RNA and Z-RNA, water density in increasing pressure shows a negligible depletion around polar atoms and a similarly minute accumulation around nonpolar atoms (Fig 8 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more significant changes in counterion density (compared with water) suggest that tetraloop stability is more dependent on counterion associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher pressure, although A-RNA shows increasing counterion depletion, Z-RNA maintains its counterion associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with experimental findings regarding salt-induced transitions to Z-form helices (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two base-paired hairpins have been the subject of multiple studies analyzing the stabilizing effects of noncanonical tetraloop structures because of their small size and unusual thermal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 0.1 M NaCl, the Tm of a gcGAAAgc tetraloop-forming sequence is on the order of 311 K (RNA) to 350 K (DNA) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similarly hyperstable tetraloop, gcUUCGgc, shows a melting temperature of 326 K in 10 mM salt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our sequence, the m-fold program (41) predicts a Tm of 342 K at 1 M salt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Tm of the native state formed in our simulations is significantly higher than that in any of the preceding experiments or predictions (400 K) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 4), our simulations provide a unique perspective into the nature of tetraloop free-energy landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings reveal that the free-energy landscape of a folded hyperstable RNA tetraloop can be characterized by a diverse ensemble of loop configurations with a native A-RNA stem structure and a stable network of basebase hydrogen bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The native A-RNA stem is consistently the most favored configuration in our simulations and stabilized by increasing hydrostatic pressures, whereas the alternative states are either destabilized by pressure in the case of the Z-RNA state or minimally affected in the case of the Triplet state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The A-RNA configurations in these simulations frequently exhibit suboptimally folded loops with a sheared base pair between G3 and A5 and A6 displaced from the loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure has been observed in other simulations of GNRA tetraloops (24, 42) and is structurally similar to restrictocin-bound RNA hairpins (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental evidence of temperature-dependent ribose sugar puckering in A5 (22) also gives credence to the existence of these configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unusually high population of this state is most likely caused by overstabilized hydrogen bonding that results from the reduction of the LennardJones -parameters (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recent study (44) of the efficacy of different AMBER (assisted model building with energy refinement) force fields in stabilizing folded RNA configurations at microsecond timescales reveals that the force field used in our study most effectively stabilizes the native loop configuration of a UNCG tetraloop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results also indicate near-equal populations of native and suboptimal loops being adopted over the course of simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alternative configurations are similar to the global energy minima of our simulations and suggest that, at long timescales, the force field is stabilizing nonnative loops at the expense of the native configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ruggedness of the folding free-energy landscapes of nucleic acid hairpins has been explored in several experiments using temperature jump methods to monitor kinetic transitions away from the melting temperature (10, 20, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on rates of refolding, these studies identified ensembles of partially stacked structures in submelting regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These kinetic studies also suggested that RNA folding becomes two states nearer to the melting temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results agree with this observation, because both Z-RNA and Triplet structures are most stable in submelting regions and minimally expressed nearer to the tetraloop unfolding temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two stable, nonnative folded configurations were observed in this work that have not been previously identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Z-RNA, in particular, revealed many interesting facets about the capacity of our force field to recapitulate the heterogeneity of folded RNA motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of an alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence and high salt concentration has been established as a prerequisite for Z-form backbones for both DNA (37) and RNA (5); additional studies of DNA tetraloops have shown B- to Z-backbone transitions in high salt concentrations (5 M NaCl) (38, 39), and combinations of pressure and salt (6 kbar; 5 M NaCl) (46) have been shown to induce A to Z transitions in r(CG)6 duplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our analyses, pressure is suggested to be a destabilizing factor in the formation of Z-RNA; however, high local density of counterions clearly stabilizes Z-RNA, which was indicated by consistent ion association in increased pressure and consistent coordination within the stem minor groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Triplet represents a highly stabilized network of hydrogen-bonding and -stacking interactions between all purines that is likely an artifact emerging at long timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of structures that adopt the Triplet structure do not unfold, and the few cases of unfolding only occur through the scission of the G1A6 base pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional interactions that stabilize this configuration include a basephosphate interaction between G7 and the G1 phosphate group, which has been categorized as the most stable basephosphate interaction through quantum mechanical calculations at the second-order MollerPlesset level (MP2) (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simulations, this interaction was shown to break, while the sheared base pairs between the G1 and G7 held.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This retention indicates an overstabilization of basebase interactions, which is also responsible for the high melting temperatures obtained in REMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional corrections will be necessary in future modifications to the AMBER force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterizing the free-energy landscapes of RNA tetraloops has long been a goal for RNA molecular simulations and has been the subject of multiple studies on different loop systems using a variety of molecular dynamics techniques (25, 26, 31, 42, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have determined that the free-energy landscape of an RNA tetraloop can be rigorously characterized through extensive REMD simulations and that analysis of multiple global and internal degrees of freedom can describe a plethora of configurations associated with these landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analysis of the energies and solvent interactions associated with these configurations can elucidate underlying thermodynamic stabilities and more comprehensively describe the folding dynamics of RNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We perform all-atom canonical ensemble (NVT) REMD simulations of a small RNA tetraloop to characterize the folding stability and thermodynamics of RNA as a function of temperature and pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system is simulated using the AMBER force field (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifications to the RNA nucleobase parameters in this force field include scaled LennardJones - and -parameters and -torsional parameters (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the role of solventRNA interactions, we simulate the system under three pressure conditions at constant volumes (isochores) that correspond to pressures of 0.1, 100, and 100 MPa at 300 K. Each isochore is simulated with the same temperature spacing over a range of 290497 K for 3 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These isochores model the liquid state of water using the transferable intermolecular potential with three interaction sites water model (TIP3P) (52) at all simulated temperatures (53) and provide an effective (P and T) ensemble range of 290.00496.9607 K and 115520 MPa from a total sampling of 448 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) system, the RNA sequence r(GCGCAAGC) is initialized in an unfolded configuration and solvated in a cubic box of 55.0 Å on a side using 5,168 water molecules and an excess KCL concentration of 1 M (100 K+ and 93 Cl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial isothermalisobaric (NPT) equilibration of this system at 300 K and 0.1 MPa uses the Berendsen barostats and thermostats (54) with coupling constants of 1.0 and 0.2 ps, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial temperature schedule for this system (274.00496.0967 K; 64 replicas) enforces an exchange probability of 20%, and replica swap attempts are made every 2 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model the specific effects of pressure on folding stability and test for system convergence, the high-pressure (100 MPa) and negative-pressure (100 MPa) variants are initialized from a folded tetraloop configuration generated in the normal pressure simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each system is equilibrated in an NPT ensemble for 10 ns at 300 K and the high and negative pressures using the velocity-rescaling thermostat and the Berendsen barostat, respectively, with coupling constants of 1.0 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature schedule for these isochores (290.00496.0967 K; 56 replicas each) include the same temperature spacing as the ambient pressure system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several additional NVT simulations are conducted at 100, 0.1, and 80 MPa to assess water and ion associations around different folded configurations, specifically the A-RNA, Z-RNA, and Triplet states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial structures are drawn from the 0.1 MPa REMD runs and individually equilibrated to 350 K at the appropriate pressure conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only exception to this is the negative-pressure simulation, which has an initial equilibration at 50 MPa before a final equilibration at 80 MPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the tetraloop configurational ensemble using various order parameters across multiple temperatures and pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of native-like structures is determined through rmsd relative to the experimental GCAA tetraloop, and clustering analysis is used to determine the statistical prevalence of the different configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rmsd of structures in multiple temperature ensembles is compared with the NMR structure [Protein Data Bank ID code 1ZIH] (55) and subsequently clustered using a 1-Å cutoff using the single-linkage clustering method and the method by Daura et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (56) (pairwise rmsd of all structures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the different minima of the folding free-energy landscape and identify the barriers between native and nonnative tetraloop configurations, we use dPCA (30, 31) of RNA-specific backbone and sugar nucleobase dihedral angles (, , , , , , and ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual peaks are analyzed with the aforementioned clustering methods, and the first centroid is used to identify individual basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Folded configurations are identified by a combination of the rmsd of nonhydrogen stem atoms and the presence of hydrogen bonds between nucleobase residues in the stem and loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen bonds are defined using cutoff distances of 3.5 Å and incident angles within 30°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All molecular dynamics simulations are conducted using the GROMACS 4.5.5 (57) software package with a modified set of LennardJones parameters from the parm99 AMBER force field (51) described by Chen and García (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periodic boundary conditions are applied, and long-range electrostatics are modeled using particle mesh Ewald (58) with 0.12-nm grid spacing, fourth-order cubic interpolation, and a 105 tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutoff distances of 1.0 nm are used for both real space electrostatics and van der Waals, and neighbor lists are updated every 10 time steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solvent and ions are modeled explicitly using the TIP3P water model (52) and monovalent ion parameters described by Chen and Pappu (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equations of motion are integrated using a leap-frog integrator with a 2-fs time step, and configurations of RNA and ions are saved every 2 ps, with frames containing all atoms saved every 0.5 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature coupling is maintained using a velocity-rescaling algorithm (60) with a 0.2-ps coupling constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Folding_Trajectories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of particular note in our results is the emergence of nonnative configurations that form regardless of initial configurations or simulation pressures and show microsecond-long folded lifetimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the ambient pressure system (Fig S1), replicas begin adopting both alternative configurations around the same time that the system begins sampling the native A-RNA configuration (within the first 100 ns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that every replica adopts a configuration consistent with at least one folded state during the course of the simulation and that all three folded configuration types show exchange with the unfolded ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beginning from a folded ensemble, both the negative- and high-pressure isochores (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3) each show at least one replica that samples all three folded configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the tetraloop begins in the A-RNA folded configuration (white in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3), unfolds, and spends several hundred nanoseconds in the unfolded state (black in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3) before forming a Z-RNA tetraloop (blue in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The few replicas that sample the Triplet state (red in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3) in addition to these first two folded configurations must first resample the unfolded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation offers direct evidence that the folded configurations in our simulations can only be accessed through unfolded ensemble sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Triplet_State_Stability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the Z-RNA configuration, the Triplet state shows nonmonotonic stability relative to temperature and a temperature-dependent maximum in the intermediate temperature range (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of replicas adopting the Triplet configuration is nearly equal in all isochores, and in the majority of cases, a Triplet configuration was retained to the end of the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the lack of exchange between the Triplet and unfolded ensemble, there was considerable error associated with the distribution of Triplet configurations over temperature space in all three isochores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The varying isochore pressures produce moderate shifts in the peak of the Triplet melting curves without significantly perturbing the fraction of replicas adopting the Triplet configuration in either isochore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tetraloop_Folding_Equilibration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stable formation of native (A-RNA) tetraloops serves as a defining metric of the efficacy of this force field and the equilibration of the folded ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each isochore, the number of replicas adopting the A-RNA state accounts for roughly one-half of the entire ensemble in the latter 2 s. This observation, and the fact that all three isochores have reached an equilibrated average number of A-RNA configurations, despite different starting configurations and pressures, assure that these data represent the equilibrated ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using an autocorrelation function (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1) (61) and taking twice the correlation time (Fig S5, Inset) allowed the equilibrated dataset in each isochore to be split into five block averages (400 ns each):C(t)=1Nt=1N=1Nt(A(t)A)×(A()A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pressure_Effects_on_Free_Energy__Alternative_States  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although pressure exerts alternatively stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the A-RNA and Z-RNA tetraloops, respectively (Fig 4), and minimally affects the Triplet state (Fig S4), the effects of pressure on the isothermal free energies of the alternative states are strikingly similar to the native state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7, a parabolic relation exists between the free energy and pressure at low temperatures and relaxes to a near-linear relation at 380 K. Unlike the native configuration, the higher temperature curves for the alternative states do not show the same inverted parabolic trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all three folded states show a chevron-shaped relation for VU vs. temperature with a minimum at 335 K. Similarly, for U,T, all states show a negative trend that decreases to approximately zero by 370 K in the case of the Z-RNA state and above 380 K for the Triplet state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pressure_Effects_on_Solvent_Distribution_(Triplet)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Triplet state shows multiple similarities to the native configuration in terms of ionic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased pressure depletes ions from both the polar and nonpolar surfaces of the RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared with both A-RNA and Z-RNA states, the Triplet shows a slightly lower accumulation of waters around the nonpolar groups (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions are likely caused by the purineTriplet interaction excluding solvent from the RNA core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
