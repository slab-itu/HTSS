Relation between rainfall intensity and savanna tree abundance explained by water use strategies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Savannas account for 20% of global land area and support 30% of terrestrial net primary production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biome is characterized by the coexistence of trees and grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tree abundance strongly influences savanna ecosystem dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum tree abundance in tropical savannas is found to be negatively correlated with rainfall intensity, which remains unexplained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through combining in situ observations, a biophysical treegrass competition model, and a stochastic rainfall generator, we present that differentiated tree and grass water use strategies are essential to explain the phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show the importance of vegetation physiology in determining tree abundance in the biome and enhance our ability to predict future ecosystem composition and dynamics under global change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tree abundance in tropical savannas exhibits large and unexplained spatial variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose that differentiated tree and grass water use strategies can explain the observed negative relation between maximum tree abundance and rainfall intensity (defined as the characteristic rainfall depth on rainy days), and we present a biophysical treegrass competition model to test this idea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is founded on a premise that has been well established in empirical studies, namely, that the relative growth rate of grasses is much higher compared with trees in wet conditions but that grasses are more susceptible to water stress and lose biomass more quickly in dry conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is coupled with a stochastic rainfall generator and then calibrated and tested using field observations from several African savanna sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the observed negative relation between maximum tree abundance and rainfall intensity can be explained only when differentiated water use strategies are accounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical experiments reveal that this effect is more significant than the effect of root niche separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results emphasize the importance of vegetation physiology in determining the responses of tree abundance to climate variations in tropical savannas and suggest that projected increases in rainfall intensity may lead to an increase in grass in this biome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differentiated water use strategies of C4 grass (black) and tree (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Transpiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Net growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net growth is defined as net primary production (NPP) minus biomass turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative soil moisture is volumetric soil moisture normalized by soil porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersections of growth curves (sg0 for C4 grasses and st0 for trees) with the zero-growth curve (blue) are shown in the Inset of B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curves are generated by a saturating function of soil moisture (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5) with parameters based on field and laboratory observations (Methods and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of radiative transfer and shading can induce small changes in the location of the curves (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first test the model in a well-studied broad-leaf savanna in Nylsvley, South Africa, where trees and grasses are known to have similar rooting depth (80 cm) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using rainfall parameters derived from station observations (SI Appendix, Table S2), our ensemble simulations (Methods) generate treegrass coexistence (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The year-to-year oscillations in leaf area index (LAI) (calculated as leaf biomass per ground area multiplied by specific leaf area) are attributable to interannual variations in rainfall [SD, 105 mm y1; comparable to station records (20)] from the stochastic rainfall generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simulated coexistence is achieved because the alternation of dry and wet days drives the alternation of tree and C4 grass advantage, not because of disturbance or root niche separation, which was not included in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better compare our simulation to field observations, we calculated the equilibrium seasonal cycles of LAI by averaging the last 50 y of the simulation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensemble-average peak wet season LAI is 0.9 for trees and 0.6 for grasses, close to the observed reports of 0.78 for trees and 0.5 for grasses (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model overestimated dry season tree LAI in Nylsvley (reported to be 0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bias is probably attributable to the simplified phenology module in our model, in which we use a constant leaf turnover rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short-term turnover rate might increase in the dry season, resulting in a more complete decrease of tree LAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this bias should not influence the simulated long-term ecosystem dynamics because dry season NPP and transpiration are very small in both simulations and nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are also supported by the fact that the simulated equilibrium biomass and water fluxes are similar to reported values in Nylsvley savannas (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further test the model for nine other savanna sites along the Kalahari Transect (21), Africa, where the wet season LAI of both trees and grasses have been measured (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simulations, no model parameters were changed except for those determining the rainfall statistics, which were tuned to station observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model largely reproduces the observed LAI for both trees and grasses (Fig 2C), except that it tends to underestimate grass LAI in sites where grass LAI is low (lower left black dots in Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those sites are either very dry (300 mm y1) or very wet (900 mm y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biases at such sites are unsurprising given that our model does not include highly drought-adapted grasses in the dry sites or shade-tolerant C3 grasses in the wet sites (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of fire in our model could be another reason.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire can reduce the abundance of trees and thus favor grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assess whether differentiation in water use strategies is sufficient to explain the observed negative relation between rainfall intensity and maximum tree abundance by conducting simulations under a range of rainfall regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundance of trees and grasses is sensitive to the rainfall statistics in the coupled model (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S2); when rainy season length is fixed (250 d), ensemble-mean equilibrium LAI of C4 grasses and trees is a function of both MAP and rainfall intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of trees, as indicated by equilibrium LAI, increases with MAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the abundance of C4 grasses increases rapidly with rainfall in the drier half of the MAP range but decreases in the wetter half because the grasses are shaded out by the trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with empirical studies (5, 6), but we now also directly show that coexistence is greatly modified by rainfall intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of C4 grasses is much higher under an intense rainfall regime (their LAI can reach 1.25 when intensity is 20 mm d1) than under a mild rainfall regime (their LAI can only reach 0.125 when intensity is 5 mm d1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effect of rainfall intensity is attained with fixed rainy season length, it still holds when the rainy season length is allowed to change (Methods and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern emerges because C4 grasses have a relative advantage over trees when there are more wet periods (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better illustrate the dependence of coexistence on rainfall intensity and to compare with empirical studies, we calculated the average equilibrium LAI of trees (an indicator of maximum tree abundance) at three intensity levels for a series of MAP values (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern displays a strong resemblance to observed response of tree cover to rainfall intensity (7) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulated tree abundance is most sensitive to rainfall intensity at intermediate MAP (500800 mm y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium tree LAI in mild rainfall regimes (510 mm d1; Fig 3B, black dots) is around twice as large as in intense rainfall regimes (1520 mm d1; Fig 3B, light gray dots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute difference in LAI can reach 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern still holds if we change soil parameters from sandy loam soils that are common for dystrophic savannas to clay soils that are representative of eutrophic savannas (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the pattern is associated with differentiated plant water use strategies between trees and grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggressive water use of grasses at high soil moisture (Fig 1B) is essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of rainfall intensity weakens if the relative advantage of grasses at high soil moisture reduces (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3D shows an extreme scenario where the C4 grass and tree water use strategies were swapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the relation between tree abundance and rainfall intensity disappeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of rainfall intensity was not reversed because trees can still shade out grasses; otherwise, trees would grow better when rainfall intensity is higher (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of rainfall is also a function of MAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MAP is small, the effect of rainfall intensity is reduced because variations in rainfall intensity cannot induce significant changes during wet periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MAP is large, the dependence of tree LAI on rainfall intensity is also limited (Fig 3 BD); because soil moisture is generally high, trees can always acquire enough water, and in the extreme case, grasses are ultimately shaded out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small effect mainly arises because total drainage increases as the rainfall regime becomes more intense (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we allow plants to adjust their rooting depth in response to biotic and abiotic environments to examine whether the plasticity of root systems (23) influences our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) framework (24) to derive the rooting depth that optimizes equilibrium LAI for C4 grasses and trees under competition (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is no carbon cost associated with creating and maintaining deep roots, the resulting tree and grass rooting depths are consistent with classical root niche separation theory (11), with trees having deeper roots than grasses (SI Appendix, Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root niche partitioning leads to the opposite effect compared with water use strategy differentiation because trees in this case can benefit from water infiltrating into deep soil layers under high rainfall intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this compensation is only partial, and the effect of water use strategy differentiation still dominates (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If carbon cost is included, the ESS rooting depths of trees and grass almost converge and display a fair amount of variability because of rainfall stochasticity (SI Appendix, Fig S8 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the simulated tree abundance is still very similar to that obtained under the assumption of fixed rooting depths (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In dry savannas, plants must manage the stochasticity of rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through developing more aggressive water use strategy, grasses are able to gain relative advantages over trees under high soil moisture period that is associated with high intensity rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differentiation in water use strategy creates temporal niche separation in water use between grasses and trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a parsimonious biophysical model, we show that this physiological differentiation is sufficient to maintain treegrass coexistence and can explain the observed inverse correlation between maximum tree abundance and rainfall intensity in dry tropical savannas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical (46) or modeling (1, 25) studies that use monthly or annual rainfall neglect this critical mechanism and therefore need to be interpreted cautiously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that C4 grasses might prosper and suppress trees in dry tropical savannas if rainfall intensity increases in the future (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, careful assessment and quantification of plant water use strategies and future changes in rainfall statistics are required to accurately predict vegetation dynamics and environmental feedbacks in water-limited biomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, nutrient availability (27), CO2 concentration (28), and disturbances like fire and herbivore (29, 30) also influence vegetation dynamics in savannas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounding effects of rainfall intensity, differentiated water use strategies and these factors should be addressed by future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We formulate a biophysical model based on a plant water use model (31) to capture the daily dynamics of soil moisture and tree/grass biomass in tropical savannas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, trees and grasses use different water use strategies based on their observed physiological traits, and they compete for water and light, two of the most important limiting resources (32) in tropical savannas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the competition model and the computer code implementation can be found in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the parameters used in the model are also listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model is then coupled with a stochastic rainfall generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We separated each year into rainy season and dry season with rainy season length denoted as train (day).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although rainfall in the dry season is assumed to have the same intensity ( mm d1) as in the rainy season, rainfall frequency ( rainy day d1) in the dry season is assumed to be 20% of that in rainy season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rainfall frequency in the rainy season (rain) can be calculated given mean annual rainfall (MAP mm),  and train according to the following equation:rain=MAP×[train+0.2×(365train)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rainfall is modeled as a marked Poisson process (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time between two rainfall events is a random variable with exponential distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean value of the exponential distribution is equal to rain in the rainy season and 0.2 × rain in the dry season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rainfall intensity is also a random variable with exponential distribution, the mean value of which equals to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computer codes for the model are included in Dataset S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulation_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For simulations of the field sites, rainfall parameters were inferred from weather station data (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rooting depth was set at 80 cm for both C4 grass and trees according to field observations (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values and sources of other model parameters are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only maximum surface evaporation rate was tuned to reproduce the observed evaporationtranspiration ratio in the Nylsvley site (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each site, we conducted 10 ensemble simulations, each for 200 y, to obtain the average treegrass coexistence over the possible rainfall scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the initial LAI of both trees and grasses to be 1 and the initial relative soil moisture at 0.25 for all simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium wet season LAI, defined as the mean LAI within the last 50 d in wet season averaged over the last 50 y, from each simulation was calculated for both trees and C4 grasses to compare with field observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted simulations (Fig 3) with 9 MAP values (2001,000 mm with a step of 100 mm) and 15  values (620 mm d1 with a step of 1 mm d1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, there exist different combinations of rain and train value with a given set of MAP and  value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we conducted three sets of simulations where changes of  relative to baseline value (6 mm d1) were attributed differently between rainfall frequency and rainy season length: (i) under a given MAP, rainy season length was fixed and variations in  were solely balanced by changes in rainfall frequency; (ii) 30% of a change in  from its baseline value was attributed to changes in rainy season length, whereas the remainder was caused by a change in rainfall frequency; and (iii) 60% of a change in  from its baseline value was attributed to changes in rainy season length, whereas the remainder was caused by a change in rainfall frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not attribute more than 60% of variations in  to rainy season length because that would result in unrealistically low rainy season values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the simulations used the same model parameters and simulation setup as the simulations of the field sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the effect of differentiated water use strategies, we also conducted simulations under different rainfall regimes in which water use strategies were swapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations, physiological parameters were all exchanged between trees and C4 grasses (columns 2 and 3 in SI Appendix, Table S1), although trees can still shade grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium wet season LAI for trees was calculated as an indicator of maximum tree abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The computer codes for all of the numerical simulations are included in Dataset S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tree_Cover_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Potential tree cover (PTC in %) under a given rainfall regime was calculated using reported relations derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) remote-sensing data (7):PTC=801+e4×s80×(PP50),[2]s=0.21+0.005×,[3]P50=308+21.8×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24, P denotes mean annual precipitation (mm) and  denotes rainfall intensity (mm d1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ESS_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under a given rainfall regime, we carried out simulations with different combinations of tree and grass rooting depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rooting depth of both trees and grasses were allowed to vary from 20 cm to 200 cm with a step of 20 cm (100 different combinations in total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium (defined as the last 50 y of 200-y simulation) LAI of trees and grasses was derived for each rooting depth combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESS rooting depth is the combination for which neither trees nor grasses can attain significantly higher (5%) LAI by only changing their own rooting depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted 25 ensemble simulations for each rainfall regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensemble-mean ESS rooting depth and LAI were then computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the possible carbon cost associated with increasing rooting depth, we compared two ESS analyses, one with strong cost and one with no cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the analysis with strong cost, root mass ratio (rmrcost) increases with rooting depth (RD):rmrcost=[1+(RDRD0)×Imargin]×rmr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5, RD0 is the rooting depth at which rmrcost is equal to rmr given in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imargin denotes the marginal relative increase of rmrcost associated with increase of rooting depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD0 is set to 80 cm and Imargin is set to 5% per 20 cm for both trees and grasses based on the observed ranges of root mass ratio in nature (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  lmr is modified accordingly to balance the changes of rmrcost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the analysis with no cost, the tree and grass rmr values were set to those given in SI Appendix, Table S2 and do not change with rooting depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computer codes for ESS analysis are included in Dataset S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
