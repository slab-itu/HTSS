Nitro-fatty acids are formed in response to virus infection and are potent inhibitors of STING palmitoylation and signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several chronic inflammatory conditions have recently been shown to depend on abnormally high activity of the signaling protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions include examples from systemic lupus erythematosus, AicardiGoutiéres syndrome, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of STING in these diseases points to an unmet demand to identify inhibitors of STING signaling, which could form the basis of anti-STING therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this report, we identify distinct endogenously formed lipid species as potent inhibitors of STING signalingand propose that these lipids could have pharmaceutical potential for treatment of STING-dependent inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The adaptor molecule stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is central to production of type I IFNs in response to infection with DNA viruses and to presence of host DNA in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive release of type I IFNs through STING-dependent mechanisms has emerged as a central driver of several interferonopathies, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), AicardiGoutières syndrome (AGS), and stimulator of IFN genes-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of STING in these diseases points to an unmet need for the development of agents that inhibit STING signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that endogenously formed nitro-fatty acids can covalently modify STING by nitro-alkylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nitro-alkylations inhibit STING palmitoylation, STING signaling, and subsequently, the release of type I IFN in both human and murine cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treatment with nitro-fatty acids was sufficient to inhibit production of type I IFN in fibroblasts derived from SAVI patients with a gain-of-function mutation in STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, we have identified nitro-fatty acids as endogenously formed inhibitors of STING signaling and propose for these lipids to be considered in the treatment of STING-dependent inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

NO2-FAs_Are_Formed_in_Response_to_Infection_with_Virus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As HSV infections are associated with release of high levels of reactive nitrogen species (25, 26), we tested if NO2-FAs were formed in a model of vaginal HSV-2 infection, which induces a strong expression of iNOS (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of iNOS was most profoundly induced in leukocytes (CD45+ cells) at day 2 postinfection with HSV-2 (SI Appendix, Fig S1); thus, plasma and vaginal lavages were collected at this time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found formation of the NO2-FA species NO2-cLA in response to HSV-2 infection in plasma (Fig 1B) and in vaginal lavages after cLA inoculation (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite biological variation between individual mice, the observed NO2-cLA formation was significantly higher during HSV-2 infection in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we report potent endogenous NO2-FA formation after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the concept of NO2-FA generation being dependent on iNOS, a robust increase in NO2-cLA formation was found in WT mice but not in mice deficient in the NO-forming enzyme iNOS (nos2/) (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did observe elevated basal levels of NO2-cLA in plasma from nos2/ mice, pointing to a compensatory but HSV-2insensitive release of NO species by other enzymes (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of NO2-cLA was also observed in vitro when infecting WT RAW264.7 cells with HSV-2 in the presence of the parent nonnitrated unsaturated lipid (cLA) serving as a template for NO2-FA formation (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, RAW264.7 cells (empty vector) (Fig 1E) or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from WT mice (Fig 1F) likewise formed NO2-cLA in response HSV-2 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no NO2-cLA formation was observed in iNOS-deficient RAW264.7 cells or BMMs (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the in vitro release of NO2-cLA required the presence of IFN- (Fig 1 E and F) beside iNOS-dependent NO formation (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the combination of LPS and IFN- induced the highest in vitro release of both NO-derived species (SI Appendix, Fig S2) and NO2-cLA formation (Fig 1 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that NO2-cLA formation is occurring naturally in response to in vivo HSV-2 infection and after in vitro stimulation with LPS/IFN- and HSV-2/IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO2-FAs_Inhibit_Release_of_Type_I_IFN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since NO2-FAs have previously been reported to possess antiinflammatory properties (19), we next sought to test if various NO2-FA species (NO2-cLA, 9-NO2-OA, and 10-NO2-OA) could affect the release of type I IFNs to HSV-2 and HSV-2derived stimuli as cytosolic dsDNA and cGAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that pretreatment with NO2-FA led to highly reduced induction of type I IFNs in response to HSV-2 in both THP-1 cells (Fig 2A) and BMMs (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable reduction was observed after NO2-FA treatment before stimulation with dsDNA in THP-1 cells (Fig 2B) and in BMMs (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with NO2-FA species after HSV-2 infection also led to reduced release for the IFN-induced cytokine CXCL10 (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was likewise decreased on NO2-FA treatment in various cell types (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO2-FA treatment also reduced the release of other proinflammatory cytokines induced via Toll-like receptor-dependent and RIG-Ilike receptor-dependent pathways (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, type I IFN release was largely unaffected after treatment with the nonnitrated parent lipids linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of NO2-FAs on cytokine production was independent of Nrf2 activation (SI Appendix, Fig S6) and PPAR pathway (SI Appendix, Fig S7), as the NO2-FAs retained their inhibitory effect in various Nrf2-deficient cells and in the presence of two different PPAR inhibitors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of type I IFNs by infection with DNA viruses, such as HSV-2, and by stimulation with dsDNA is highly dependent on the cGAS-STING pathway (10, 11, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, hypothesized that NO2-FAs could possibly inhibit signaling through this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By immunoblotting, we showed that treatment with NO2-FA species led to reduced phosphorylation of STING, TBK1, and IRF3 as well as to reduced formation of STING and IRF3 dimers after stimulation with either cGAMP (Fig 2 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig S8) or dsDNA (Fig 2 E and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that NO2-FAs are able to reduce type I IFN levels prominently by affecting the cGAS-STING signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO2-FAs_Bind_STING_and_Block_STING_Palmitoylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, we noticed a subtle but consistent mobility shift of STING monomers under nonreducing conditions (Fig 2 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation could implicate STING as an NO2-FA target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this further, cells were treated with biotinylated forms of one NO2-FA species, 10-NO2-OA, and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitingly, biotinylated 10-NO2-OA readily precipitated STING, indicating a possible direct modification of STING (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Encouraged by these results, human STING-transfected HEK293T cells were treated with 10-NO2-OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitated and eluted STING protein was analyzed for NO2-OA modifications by mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this method, three sites of STING nitro-alkylation were identified: two adjacent cysteine residues at positions 88 and 91 in addition to a histidine residue at position 16 (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common for all three sites is their location in close proximity to the predicted transmembrane helices of STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other than NO2-OA, we observed NO-OA and NH2-OA as additional modifications at cysteine residues due to reduction and laser desorption ionization, and we found one of the peptides partially and fully reduced and the other partially and nonreduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these modified peptides were observed in the untreated sample (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is supported by experiments conducted with synthetic peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously described, no such reductions occurred at histidine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we investigated the previously described modification of 200 Da (29), which confirmed our findings (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In resting state, STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, but binding to cGAMP initiates its translocation to Golgi membrane (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palmitoylation of STING at Cys88/91 recently has been shown to be essential for STING clustering in the TGN and for the downstream STING signaling (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, speculated if the underlying mechanism for NO2-FAmediated inhibition of STING signaling could occur by preventing STING palmitoylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detection of palmitoylation, STING-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) expressing STING-EGFP were cultured in the presence of radio-labeled palmitate (3H-palmitate) before stimulation with the mouse STING agonist DMXAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using GFP-specific antibodies, we precipitated STING and subsequently determined palmitoylation by measuring 3H-palmitate using an autoradiograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported (18), treatment with DMXAA led to an increase in incorporation of 3H into STING (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, pretreatment with 10-NO2-OA, but not with OA, considerably inhibited this process (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that NO2-FAmodified STING was unable to be palmitoylated after DMXAA stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the palmitoylation of Cys88 and Cys91 of STING is stimulation dependent and likely occurs in the Golgi (18), Cys88 and Cys91 may be in the reduced form when STING is in the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that treatment of cells with NO2-FA before stimulation modifies Cys88 and Cys91 of STING through nitro-alkylation in the ER, preventing the normal palmitoylation process that occurs on these Cys residues at the Golgi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palmitoylation of STING is important for STING clustering at the TGN and for phosphorylation of TBK1 at this location (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detailed investigation, we used STING-KO MEFs expressing STING-EGFP and stimulated with DMXAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Costaining for pTBK1 and for TGN in the cells expressing STING-EGFP allowed us to test whether 10-NO2-OA affected STING translocation to the TGN and/or phosphorylation of TBK1 by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, DMXAA stimulation induced translocation of STING to the perinuclear compartments, and STING colocalized with a TGN protein TGN38 (Fig 3F, vehicle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pTBK1 signal showed up and partly colocalized with STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On NO2-FA treatment, in 30% of the cells, the perinuclear translocation of STING was unaffected, whereas this was markedly reduced in the remaining 70% of cells (Fig 3F, 10-NO2-OA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, phosphorylation of TBK1 was inhibited regardless of whether STING translocated to the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OA treatment, as a vehicle treatment, did not affect the perinuclear translocation of STING and the emergence of phosphorylated TBK1 (Fig 3F, OA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, NO2-FAs directly modify and nitro-alkylate STING at Cys88 and Cys91, resulting in inhibited palmitoylation and leading to the suppression of phosphorylation of TBK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO2-FAs_Inhibit_Release_of_Type_I_IFN_in_SAVI-Derived_Fibroblasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding STING (TMEM173) have been shown to drive pathology through excessive release of type I IFNs in SAVI (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since NO2-FAs have been reported to be a well-tolerated treatment in humans (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02460146 and NCT02313064), we wanted to determine if NO2-FAs could decrease type I IFN responses in three SAVI patient-derived fibroblast cell lines, all bearing the N154S mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed that release of type I IFN in response to stimulation with dsDNA was greatly inhibited in all three patients on treatment with NO2-FA species (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line, the expression of IFN- as well as the expression of the two IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFIT1 and ISG15, were likewise suppressed with NO2-FA treatment (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, pTBK1, which was highly induced in the SAVI fibroblasts in response to cGAMP stimulation, was almost completely abolished by NO2-FA treatment (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As basal IFN- production in fibroblasts was below the detection limit (Fig 4 AC), we used expression plasmids harboring gain-of-function STING mutants previously reported to cause SAVI (V174L, N154S, and V155M) to further test the treatment potential of NO2-FAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, NO2-FA treatment could dampen the STING-dependent release of type IFN in a ligand-independent manner in this setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these results imply the therapeutic potential of NO2-FAs by dampening type I IFN levels in SAVI patient fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gain-of-function mutations in STING can lead to a neonatal-onset systemic inflammatory condition characterized by severe cutaneous vasculopathy with extensive tissue loss and interstitial lung disease (SAVI) (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment options for SAVI patients or for patients with other STING-dependent inflammatory diseases are very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly due to the absence of therapies that directly target STING signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This report identifies naturally occurring NO2-FAs as potent inhibitors of STING signaling in human cells, including fibroblasts from SAVI patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data suggest that NO2-FAs could be considered for trials aimed at treating patients with STING-dependent interferonopathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further encouraged by the fact that NO2-FAs are currently used in phase II trials for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension and are here reported to be well-tolerated by the patients (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02460146 and NCT02313064).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our discovery that endogenous concentrations of NO2-FAs are increased in response to virus-induced inflammation in mice together with the previous detection of NO2-FA species and their adducts in human plasma and urine indicate that NO2-FAs act as natural antiinflammatory mediators (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing this hypothesis is challenged by the difficulty to specifically eliminate NO2-FAs from humans and even from mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiinflammatory effects of the parent nonnitrated unsaturated lipids are widely reported (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If part of these antiinflammatory effects is owing to the conversion into NO2-FAs remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the parent nonnitrated unsaturated lipids have been documented to activate the PPAR pathway (34)also a known NO2-FA target (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea that highly inflammatory NO-derived radicals, produced during inflammation, react with polyunsaturated lipids to form bioreactive antiinflammatory compounds is an attractive model for a built-in mechanism to counteract excessive inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by our demonstration that NO2-FAs are formed in response to HSV-2 infection and in line with reported detection of NO2-FAs formation in the peritoneum of mice after LPS injection (21, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research may focus on the importance of endogenous formation of NO2-FAs to control inflammatory conditions in the context of either infection or noninfectious inflammatory disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Great advances have been made in understanding the structural basis for STING signaling in response to cytosolic dsDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data expand on this knowledge by identifying palmitoylation of STING (18) as a modification that can be targeted to inhibit STING signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has considerable medical potential, as NO2-FAs might either be used directly as antiinflammatory drugs or be used as a tool for designing highly efficient drugs that specifically target STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, our study opens up for embracing the functionality of the transmembrane helices of STING as targetable in future attempts to design antiinflammatory drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have discovered that endogenously formed NO2-FAs can target STING signaling and reduce release of type I IFNs in both murine and human cellsincluding fibroblasts from patients with the STING-dependent interferonopathy SAVI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, suggest that these lipids can be considered in the treatment of STING-dependent inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
