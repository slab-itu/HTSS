Dendritic transport of tick-borne flavivirus RNA by neuronal granules affects development of neurological disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flaviviruses represent a significant threat to public health worldwide, and several cause severe neurological disease in humans and animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no specific treatment has been developed, due to the lack of information about their detailed pathogenic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we reveal that the transport of viral RNA of tick-borne flavivirus in neuronal dendrites is involved in the development of neurological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus hijacked the transport system of host mRNA in dendrites, which is important for neuronal functions such as neurogenesis and the plasticity of the synaptic communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of this unique virushost interaction will promote the study of neurodegenerative diseases caused by disruption of dendritic mRNA transport and the development of their treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurological diseases caused by encephalitic flaviviruses are severe and associated with high levels of mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenicity in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we reported that the genomic RNA of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is transported and replicated in the dendrites of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we analyzed the transport mechanism of the viral genome to dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified specific sequences of the 5 untranslated region of TBEV genomic RNA that act as a cis-acting element for RNA transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutated TBEV with impaired RNA transport in dendrites caused a reduction in neurological symptoms in infected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that neuronal granules, which regulate the transport and local translation of dendritic mRNAs, are involved in TBEV genomic RNA transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBEV genomic RNA bound an RNA-binding protein of neuronal granules and disturbed the transport of dendritic mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated a neuropathogenic virus hijacking the neuronal granule system for the transport of viral genomic RNA in dendrites, resulting in severe neurological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

5_UTR_of_TBEV_Is_a_cis-Acting_Element_Important_for_RNA_Transport_to_Neurites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PC12 cells differentiate into neuronal phenotypes and form neurites in the presence of neuronal growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether the genomic RNA of TBEV is transported to neurites in differentiated PC12 cells, as observed in primary neurons (10, 17), PC12 cells were infected with TBEV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulations of viral antigen and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signal for TBEV genomic RNA were observed in neurites (Fig S1), as seen in the dendrites of primary neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the RNA region required for transport, plasmids expressing RNA for a luciferase CDS fused with partial sequences of TBEV were constructed (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressed RNA with TBEV UTRs was detected in neurites but RNAs with any of the CDSs for the viral proteins were not (Fig 1 B and C), indicating that the UTRs of TBEV, but not viral proteins, were important for the transport of mRNA to neurites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our previous study, we observed the viral antigen accumulations in dendrites of cells infected with tick-borne flaviviruses but not in those infected with mosquito-borne WNV (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that this difference could be caused by differences in the UTRs, and constructed plasmids expressing luciferase mRNA with the UTRs of TBEV or WNV (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNAs expressed with the 5 UTR of TBEV were localized to neurites, while those with the 5 UTR of WNV were not, regardless of the 3 UTR sequences (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete deletion of the 3 UTR drastically reduced the expression of the RNAs in the reporter assay, indicating that the 3 UTR was involved in the stability of the RNAs (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the 5 UTR of TBEV contains a motif required for the transport of mRNA to neurites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two stem-loop (SL) structures (SL-1, nucleotides 4 to 103; SL-2, nucleotides 107 to 128) predicted in the 5 UTR of TBEV (18) (Fig 2A and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plasmid with a deletion of SL-1 or SL-2 in the 5 UTR was constructed to analyze the importance of these structures in transport (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA with deletion of SL-1 was still detected in the neurites, while deletion of SL-2 abolished the localization (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that the SL-2 region of TBEV 5 UTR is required for mRNA transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further analyze the role of SL-2, we introduced mutations into the SL-2 region of pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV/3 TBEV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations of SL-2 loop G-U and C-U were designed without affecting formation of the stem structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations of the SL-2 stem were designed to dissociate the stem structure (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfection of PC12 cells, the mutation of SL-2 loop G-U or SL-2 stem slightly decreased the signals in the neurites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mRNAs with the mutation were still detected in the neurites, and showed no significant difference from those of TBEV wild type (WT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNAs with the SL-2 loop C-U mutation were not detected in the neurites completely (Fig 2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indicated that C at nucleotide position 120 in SL-2 is the most important in the transport of mRNA to neurites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutation-Impeding_Genome_Transport_to_Dendrites_Attenuated_the_Neurological_Symptoms_of_TBEV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To construct a mutant TBEV lacking the ability to transport the genome in dendrites, a C-to-U mutation at nucleotide position 120 in the 5 UTR was introduced into the infectious clone of TBEV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovered mutant virus (SL-2 loop C-U) grew relatively more slowly until 24 h postinfection (h.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), but caught up with that of TBEV WT by 48 h.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in primary cultures of mouse neurons (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral genomic RNA was detected in dendrites infected with TBEV WT, but the signal in dendrites was weak in SL-2 loop C-Uinfected cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of viral antigen accumulation in the dendrites also decreased significantly in cells infected with SL-2 loop C-U (Fig 3 A and B), indicating that the C-U mutation of the SL-2 loop significantly decreased the transport of genomic RNA to dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the effects of TBEV genome transport on pathogenesis in mice, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with TBEV WT or SL-2 loop C-U intracerebrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences in morbidity or mortality were observed between the two groups (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slightly prolonged survival time [TBEV WT, 7.9 ± 0.46 d postinfection (d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ); SL-2 loop C-U, 8.9 ± 0.68 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; P less_than 0.02] was observed in the mice infected with SL-2 loop C-U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of mice showing severe neurological symptoms was reduced (TBEV WT, 70%; SL-2 loop C-U, 30%), and the level of cerebellar ataxia of infected mice was scored and found to be significantly lower from 5 to 7 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in mice infected with SL-2 loop C-U (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus titer was lower in the brain infected with SL-2 loop C-U at 3 d.p.i., but caught up with TBEV WT at 6 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No reversion or compensatory mutation in the 5 UTR was found in the mice infected with SL-2 loop C-U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, preventing the transport of the genome did not affect the lethality after viral multiplication, but attenuated the neurological symptoms of TBEV in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Neuronal_Granules_in_Viral_Genome_Transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuronal granules have been shown to regulate the transport of mRNAs and local protein translation in neuronal dendrites (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that neuronal granules are involved in the transport of TBEV genomic RNA and local viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization of viral proteins and RNA to RBPs in neuronal granules, such as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), RNA granule protein 105 (RNG105), and Staufen, was analyzed in primary neurons infected with TBEV WT or SL-2 loop C-U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral antigen accumulation, viral RNA, and RBPs were detected in the same neurites infected with TBEV WT (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6), suggesting that TBEV genomic RNA was transported via the neuronal granule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their detailed localizations varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FMRP colocalized with viral antigen and was recruited to the site of the viral antigen in the dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals of FMRP in the neurites increased significantly in neurons infected with TBEV WT (Fig 4 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RNG105 surrounded the accumulation of viral antigen but did not completely colocalize with the viral protein (Fig 4 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further analyze the interaction of the neuronal granule RBPs and viral genomic RNA, binding of FMRP to the genomic RNA of TBEV was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro synthesized RNAs of the full-length TBEV genome were mixed with Flag-tagged FMRP expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAs that coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP were detected by reverse transcription (RT-)PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAs for TBEV WT coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP, while RNAs with C-to-U mutation at nucleotide 120 in the SL-2 region showed decreased binding (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A missense mutation (I304N) was identified in the second K homology domain of the FMRP gene of a fragile X syndrome patient and shown to be involved in altered RNA binding and transport (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation was found to drastically reduce the binding of FMRP to TBEV genomic RNA (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that the SL-2 region of the TBEV 5 UTR, important for transport, is also critical for binding to an RBP of a neuronal granule, FMRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also shown that the transported TBEV genomic RNA altered the distribution of bound FMRP in neuronal granules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the effect of TBEV genome transport on neuronal function, the distribution and expression of host mRNAs for Arc, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII) were examined in primary neurons infected with TBEV WT or SL-2 loop C-U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA signals in dendrites, especially the mRNA of BDNF, decreased significantly in neurons infected with TBEV WT but not in those infected with SL-2 loop C-U (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the mRNAs was reduced more by infection of TBEV WT than SL-2 loop C-U (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the transport of TBEV genomic RNA disturbed that of host dendritic mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transport of TBEV genomic RNA occurred independent of viral proteins and differed from that of other neurotropic viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic and axonal transport of viral genomes has been reported in several neurotropic DNA and RNA viruses (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic DNA of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (Herpesviridae) undergoes anterograde or retrograde transport through the binding of viral proteins with host motor proteins (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virions of poliovirus (Picornaviridae) are known to be incorporated into synaptic vesicles during anterograde transport (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complexes of nucleoprotein and genomic RNA of rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae) are transferred via retrograde processes (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomes of these viruses require their viral proteins for transport, while our data showed that the transport of TBEV genomic RNA in dendrites occurs independent of the viral proteins and is regulated by the UTR of the genomic RNA itself (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, the viral genome of reported neurotropic viruses usually replicated in the neuronal cell body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, transported TBEV genomes replicate locally in the dendrites, which has not been reported in other neurotropic viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 5 UTR of TBEV was demonstrated to have a function in RNA transport in addition to protein translation and genome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UTRs of flaviviruses are important for many functions in viral multiplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complementary sequences in the 5 and 3 UTRs cyclize the viral genome, which is essential for viral genome replication (2, 3, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SL-1 in the 5 UTR is thought to recruit nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) for genome replication (3, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loop C-U mutation introduced into the recombinant TBEV overlapped with the cyclization sequences and therefore may affect genome cyclization, resulting in delayed viral growth and decreased neurological symptoms (Fig 3 D and E and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RNA with the TBEV 5 UTR and WNV 3 UTR, which could not cyclize the RNA, was efficiently transported to the neurite, indicating that transport was independent of the TBEV 3 UTR and genome cyclization (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, reporter assays revealed that, regardless of the transport of the genome, the mutations introduced into the 5 UTR did not affect RNA stability or translation efficiency, but the deletion of the 3 UTR drastically reduced stability (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that genome transport via the SL-2 region is independent of other known functions of the 5 UTR and that the TBEV 3 UTR was not directly involved in the transport, although it stabilized the RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SL-2 in the 5 UTR of TBEV genomic RNA was shown to be a unique viral cis-acting element important for the transport of mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant RNA that cannot form the stem structure (SL-2 stem) was still transported to dendrites (Fig 2 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation in the SL-2 loop region that reduced transport also resulted in reduced binding to an RBP in neuronal granules (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that the transport signal may be regulated by the intact sequence of the SL-2 region via the binding to RBPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have reported signals of transport and recognition by an RBP(s) of some dendritic mRNAs, such as CaMKII (26), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) (27), and BDNF (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the consensus sequence or motif for mRNA transport has not been elucidated, and the SL-2 sequence does not contain sequences similar to known transport signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transport of TBEV genomic RNA reduced the transport of dendritic mRNA, especially BDNF mRNA (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic RNA of TBEV and dendritic mRNA may share competing RNA sequences or structures required for transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information regarding the viral signal element will contribute to further understanding of the transport mechanism of dendritic mRNA, which is important for neuronal functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RBPs, such as FMRP (14, 29), Staufen (12), and RNG105 (13), are primary components of the neuronal granule and regulate RNA transport and local translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data showed that FMRP interacted with the genomic RNA of TBEV and accumulated at the site of local TBEV replication (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6), while Staufen and RNG105 did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this unusual localization of FMRP disrupted the local translation of host dendritic mRNAs bound to FMRP in dendrites, resulting in the development of neurological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neurological symptoms of TBEV in mice were exacerbated by genome transport and local replication in dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The defect of the transport of the TBEV genomic RNA did not affect the lethality after viral encephalitis, but was involved in the attenuation of neurological symptoms (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurological symptoms caused by the RNA transport might be somehow independent of the lethality of encephalitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have shown that disruption of the transport and local translation of dendritic mRNAs is involved in many neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fragile X syndrome, mutations and silencing of the FMRP gene caused dysregulation of the local translation of dendritic mRNAs such as the metabotropic glutamate receptor and CaMKII, resulting in abnormalities of morphology and dendritic function (14, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF mRNA and its signaling pathway in dendrites have been shown to be involved in Alzheimers disease (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that TBEV infection caused the unusual localization of FMRP in dendrites (Fig 4) and that TBEV genomic RNA transport reduced the expression and transport of host dendritic mRNAs by neuronal granules (Fig 6 and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that neuronal RNA granules and FMRP were involved in mRNA stability (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that TBEV genomic RNA disturbed the binding of FMRP to dendritic mRNAs, and that the unbound RNAs were not transported by neuronal granules, resulting in their degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that the disturbed transport of host dendritic mRNA by TBEV caused neuronal dysfunction, exacerbating the neurological symptoms in TBEV-infected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous report (10) showed that the local replication of TBEV altered the membrane structure in dendrites, suggesting that dendritic degeneration caused by this membrane alteration may also be involved in neuronal dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequence of the SL-2 region is completely conserved among tick-borne flaviviruses but not among mosquito-borne viruses (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous study showed that various tick-borne flaviviruses replicate locally in dendrites (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the transmission cycle of tick-borne flaviviruses, ticks get infected through the blood sucking of viremic mammals or cofeeding of infected ticks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral infection and replication in the central nervous system of mammals are considered nonessential processes for transmission (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that the UTR sequence that regulates the innate immune system was important for the epidemiological fitness of dengue virus in a human epidemic (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been suggested that the tick FMRP ortholog is involved in the tick RNAi pathway (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of SL-2 to the tick FMRP or a related protein might be important for tick-borne flaviviruses to evade the RNAi pathway, resulting in conservation of the sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we revealed the mechanism of transport of TBEV genomic RNA in neuronal dendrites and demonstrated the involvement of this transport in the development of neurological diseases caused by TBEV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model of viral replication and neuronal dysfunction in dendrites caused by TBEV infection (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic RNA of TBEV is transported with RBPs in a neuronal granule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transport of the viral RNA disturbed that of the host dendritic mRNAs and disrupted the distribution of the components of neuronal granules, such as FMRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local replication of the viral genomic RNA in dendrites causes degeneration of the dendrites, as shown in our previous study (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transport and local replication of the viral RNA may result in neuronal dysfunction, leading to the neurological symptoms observed with TBEV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrated the hijacking of the neuronal granule system by a neuropathogenic virus for the transport of viral genomic RNA in dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The description of this unique virushost interaction will improve further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and the pathogenicity of neurotropic viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also promote the study of neurodegenerative diseases caused by disruption of dendritic mRNA transport, and could lead to the development of treatment options with virus-based vectors that can transport and express target genes locally in dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK-21) cells were cultured at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 8% (vol/vol) FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PC12 cells were purchased from DS Pharma Biomedical and grown at 37 °C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) containing 10% (vol/vol) horse serum, 5% (vol/vol) FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuronal cultures of the cerebral cortex were prepared from brains of Slc:ICR mouse embryos (Japan SLC) at embryonic day 16 to 18, as described previously (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the cerebral cortex was dissected from embryonic brains in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were treated with a Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and gently dissociated via trituration in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 6 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1× B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated cells were seeded onto 8-well glass chamber slides (Matsunami Glass) or 12-well plates (Corning) coated with cell matrix type IC (Nitta Gelatin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were propagated at 37 °C and used after 6 to 7 d of culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recombinant viruses of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) Oshima 5-10 strain (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AB062063.2) (35) were recovered from infectious cDNA clones (Oshima-ICs) as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct the TBEV SL-2 loop C-U mutant, a C-to-T mutation was introduced into the Oshima-ICs at nucleotide position 120 by PCR and subcloning in a stepwise manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Working stocks of the viruses were propagated once in BHK-21 cells and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments using live TBEVs were conducted in Biosafety Level 3 or Animal Biosafety Level 3 facilities located at the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine at Hokkaido University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pCMV-TBEV REP plasmid was constructed from the pCMV-TBEV REP-GFP plasmid (kindly provided by T. Igarashi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) by deleting the inserted GFP gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor, this plasmid was designed to transcribe a replicon RNA of the TBEV Oshima 5-10 strain in which most of the coding sequences (CDSs) for the viral structural proteins (nucleotides 239 to 2291) had been deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme sequence and a polyA signal were inserted after the replicon sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For construction of the other RNA-expressing plasmids, PCR fragments were synthesized by standard fusionPCR and subcloned into pCMV-TBEV REP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To construct pCMV-Luc, the luciferase gene of pGL4.0 (Promega) was inserted between the CMV promoter and the HDV ribozyme sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial CDSs for the capsid protien (nucleotides 132 to 244), the NS1 and NS2A proteins (nucleotides 2292 to 4304), the NS2B, NS3, and NS4A proteins (nucleotides 4206 to 7007), or the NS4B and NS5 proteins (nucleotides 6909 to 10373) of the TBEV Oshima 5-10 strain were inserted into pCMV-Luc to construct plasmids expressing TBEV CDS with the luciferase sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids expressing flavivirus untranslated regions (UTRs) with the luciferase gene were constructed by inserting the 5 and 3 UTRs of the TBEV Oshima 5-10 strain or the WNV 6-LP strain (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AB185914.2) into the pCMV-Luc plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of stem-loop (SL)-1 (nucleotides 4 to 103) and SL-2 (nucleotides 107 to 128) were deleted from the pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV/3 TBEV) plasmid to construct the pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV dSL-1/3 TBEV) and (5 TBEV dSL-2/3 TBEV) plasmids, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G-to-T mutations at nucleotide positions 114, 115, and 117 were introduced into pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV/3 TBEV) to construct the pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV SL-2 loop G-U/3 TBEV) plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV SL-2 loop C-U/3 TBEV) plasmid was constructed by introducing a C-to-T mutation (120 nt) into pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV/3 TBEV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four mutations (G109U, C110A, G125A, and C126U) were introduced into pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV/3 TBEV) to construct the pCMV-Luc (5 TBEV SL-2 stem/3 TBEV) plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To construct pCXSN-Flag-FMRP, the CDS of the FMR-1 gene from 293T cells was cloned into the pCSXN-Flag plasmid (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct pCSXN-Flag-FMRP (I304N), a T-to-A mutation at nucleotide position 911 was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Infection_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For neuronal differentiation, 1.0 × 104 PC12 cells per well were seeded on eight-well glass chamber slides with RPMI medium 1640 containing 0.5% (vol/vol) horse serum, 0.25% (vol/vol) FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following overnight incubation, the medium was changed to medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL 2.5S Neuronal Growth Factor (Cosmo Bio), and the cells were incubated for 6 to 7 d until neurites developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiated PC12 cells were infected with TBEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or transfected with the plasmids by using X-tremeGENE HP Transfection Reagent (Hoffmann-La Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animal_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ten 5-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice (Japan SLC) were divided randomly into two groups and inoculated with 100 PFUs of virus (TBEV WT or SL-2 loop C-U) intracerebrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morbidity was defined as the appearance of 10% weight loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surviving mice were monitored for 14 d to obtain survival curves, mortality rates, and body weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was repeated twice (total n = 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No statistical method was used to estimate the sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no mice excluded from the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The president of Hokkaido University approved all animal experiments after review by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University (approval no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Levels of paralysis and neurological symptoms of the infected mice (n = 5) were evaluated every day as described previously (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, four tests (ledge test, hind limb clasping, gait, and kyphosis) were conducted and scored individually on a scale of 0 to 3; a score of 0 represented an absence of the relevant phenotype, and a score of 3 represented the most severe manifestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ledge test, the mouse was placed on the ledge of the cage and the state of movement was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate hind limb clasping, the tail of the mouse was grasped near its base, the mouse was lifted, and the hind limb position was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the mouses gait, the mouse was placed on a flat surface and observed from behind as it walked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of kyphosis was observed while the mouse walked after being placed on a flat surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One mouse infected with TBEV WT and one mouse infected with SL-2 loop C-U were excluded from the analysis at 8 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  due to death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The brains of the mice were collected at 3 and 6 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n = 3) for viral titer analysis and sequencing analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were weighed and homogenized as 10% suspensions (wt/vol) in PBS with 10% FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and titrated by plaque-forming assay in BHK-21 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNAs of the brains of the dead mice were extracted with ISOGEN II (Nippon Gene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following amplification by RT-PCR with SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with TBEV-specific primers, the SL-2 region was sequenced with the 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a one-way analysis of variance test, the TukeyKramer test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in the mean values of the fluorescent signals in neurites (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 C and F, 2 C and F, and 4B), fluorescent signals in the AOIs (Fig 6B), and luciferase activity (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the F test to analyze variances, the unpaired two-sided Students or Welchs t test was used to determine statistical significance between the TBEV WT and SL-2 loop C-U mutant at each time point (Fig 3 B, D, and E and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4, S5B, and S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KaplanMeier survival curves and log-rank test were used to evaluate the survival of the infected mice (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Days until onset and average survival time were expressed as 95% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analysis was performed with SAS University Edition software (SAS Institute).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
