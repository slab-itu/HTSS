Mapping membrane activity in undiscovered peptide sequence space using machine learning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use machine learning on membrane-permeating -helical host defense peptides to study the nature of their functional commonality and sequence homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Machine learning is combined with calibrating experiments to show that the metric in our support vector machine model correlates not with antimicrobial activity but with a peptides ability to generate the negative Gaussian membrane curvature necessary for membrane permeation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we use the classifier reflexively to map the undiscovered sequence space of antimicrobial peptides and identify taxonomies of peptides with similar topological membrane remodeling activity, including endogenous neuropeptides, viral fusion proteins, topogenic peptides, and amyloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are some 1,100 known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which permeabilize microbial membranes but have diverse sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier to investigate -helical AMPs and the interrelated nature of their functional commonality and sequence homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SVM is used to search the undiscovered peptide sequence space and identify Pareto-optimal candidates that simultaneously maximize the distance  from the SVM hyperplane (thus maximize its antimicrobialness) and its -helicity, but minimize mutational distance to known AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By calibrating SVM machine learning results with killing assays and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we find that the SVM metric  correlates not with a peptides minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but rather its ability to generate negative Gaussian membrane curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This surprising result provides a topological basis for membrane activity common to AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we highlight an important distinction between the maximal recognizability of a sequence to a trained AMP classifier (its ability to generate membrane curvature) and its maximal antimicrobial efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mutational distances are increased from known AMPs, we find AMP-like sequences that are increasingly difficult for nature to discover via simple mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the sequence map as a discovery tool, we find a unexpectedly diverse taxonomy of sequences that are just as membrane-active as known AMPs, but with a broad range of primary functions distinct from AMP functions, including endogenous neuropeptides, viral fusion proteins, topogenic peptides, and amyloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SVM classifier is useful as a general detector of membrane activity in peptide sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SVM_Model_Development__Monte_Carlo_Sampling__and_Pareto_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We constructed a linear SVM classifier to predict whether a candidate peptide is likely to be antimicrobial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SVM was trained by cross-validation over a balanced training set comprising 243 -helical AMPs and 243 -helical decoy peptides derived from natural and synthetic sources and a variety of microbial and multicellular species, and a balanced blind test set of 43 AMP and 43 decoy -helical peptides (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variable selection was used to identify from a library of 1,588 physicochemical descriptors (SI Appendix, Table S1) a subset of 12 descriptors used to make classifications (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classifier demonstrated excellent performance against the blind test set, with a prediction accuracy of 91.9%, specificity of 93.0%, and sensitivity of 90.7% (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trained SVM enables rapid computational screening of peptides for antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of the 12 descriptors and classification of all 572 AMPs and decoy peptides in our training and test sets required only 80 s on a 2.13-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, equal to 0.14 s per peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, comprehensive screening of all 1078 peptides of length 860 residuesthe size range of training peptidesis intractable, so we instead traversed sequence space via a directed search according to the following four criteria: (i) Defined peptide length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general mechanism of -helical AMPs involves a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with negatively charged bacterial cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical AMPs have a length of 2025 amino acids, and generally generate membrane deformation by spanning the lipid bilayer and inducing opposite membrane curvature in orthogonal directions (2, 6, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we restrict our screen to 2025-residue peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Homology with a known AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classifier accuracy is expected to diminish in regions of sequence space far from the AMP sequences upon which it was trained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we control within our screen peptide homology to known AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Large positive distance from the SVM hyperplane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This criterion favors sequences for which the classifier possesses high positive predictive value (the expected proportion of positive results that are true positives) and specificity at the expense of sensitivity (left side of the receiver operating characteristic curve, right side of the precision-recall curve in SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In driving the false-positive rate toward zeroat the expense of a high false-negative ratewe focus our screen toward the most promising candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) High helical content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trained on -helical peptides, classifier accuracy is expected to diminish for peptides with nonhelical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we seek candidates that are predominantly helical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [We note that certain -helical AMPs only adopt a helical structure upon interacting with the cell membrane (2, 6), and this criterion will necessarily disfavor such candidates.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these criteria, we performed a guided search of sequence space to generate a subsampling of 242,110 candidates using two complementary approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To traverse the sequence space with close homology to existing AMPs, we generated 33,079 sequences corresponding to all one-point mutants of the 76 AMPs in the database within the size range 2025 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the sequence space of AMPs that are less likely for nature to discover via simple mutation, we generated 208,955 additional sequences from Monte Carlo sampling by initializing 10 independent Monte Carlo chains with a randomly selected AMP in the size range of interest, and ran 25,000 rounds of random point mutation, insertion, and deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 12 bagged descriptors were generated for each new trial sequence and the distance from the classifier hyperplane  computed using the SVM classifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating () as an effective energy to bias the search towards promising candidates, trial sequences are accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion pacc=min{1,exp(/T)}, where =trialcurrent and T is an effective temperature (4042).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we found that T = 0.8 provides a good compromise between focusing the search toward large  candidates while also providing good sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All unique candidates were saved for the computational screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the helical content of all 242,110 candidates was evaluated using the ab initio secondary structure prediction algorithm PSIPRED (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) (43, 44) implemented in PROTEUS2 (www.proteus2.ca/proteus2/) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not actively direct sampling toward high helical candidates, but identify them post hoc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that more comprehensive sampling of design space could be achieved using umbrella sampling in our Monte Carlo procedure (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After conducting this directed search, we wished to identify optimal sequences within our candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we borrowed the concept of Pareto optimality from microeconomics (37, 38) and used multiobjective optimization to determine the Pareto optimal sequences that dominate all other candidates in simultaneously maximizing the distance from the SVM hyperplane and the degree of -helical secondary structure, and minimizing the mutational distance to a known AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sequences are optimal in the sense that no other candidates exist for which any one criterion can be improved without degrading at least one other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We term this Pareto frontier physicochemically unrestricted because we place no restriction on the value of the 12 bagged descriptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this Pareto set may contain candidates with descriptor values far outside the range of the training data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we constructed a physicochemically restricted Pareto frontier constrained such that none of the 12 descriptors could lie more than 10% outside the range observed in the training set (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these two frontiers serve as guides for our exploration of the sequence space, and our subsequent interpretation of discovered sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present a 3D scatterplot of all 242,110 candidate sequences (gray crosses) plotting the distance to the SVM hyperplane , minimum JukesCantor distance to a known AMP minHomologyAMP, and predicted fractional helicity (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional projections of the point cloud are presented in SI Appendix, Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The candidate sequences partition into two point clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloud at low minHomologyAMP corresponds to candidates most homologous to known AMPs comprising the 76 AMPs in the database within the size range of interest plus all of their point mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cloud at high minHomologyAMP corresponds to sequences generated by the directed Monte Carlo search biased toward candidates with a large distance from the SVM hyperplane .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the latter may contain sequences with divergent physicochemical properties from known AMPs that are nonetheless predicted by our classifier to possess antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We highlight the 13 sequences residing on the Pareto frontier of physicochemically restricted sequences (green diamonds, SI Appendix, Table S4), and the 85 sequences residing on the Pareto frontier of physicochemically unrestricted sequences (orange diamonds, SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also indicate 16 peptides (red stars, SI Appendix, Table S6) close to both Pareto frontiers that we selected to synthesize and test with SAXS and killing assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distance_to_Hyperplane_of_Known_AMPs_Does_Not_Correlate_with_Antimicrobial_Efficacy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To engage the question of whether our SVM model can predict the efficacy of known AMPs, we analyzed a standardized database of MIC values of 478 known AMPs against Staphylococcus aureus collated from the literature (https://www.antistaphybase.com/index.php), and calculated their distance to the SVM hyperplane  (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plotted their reported MIC values against  and found poor and statistically insignificant correlation (RSpearman = 0.060 [0.154, 0.034], P = 0.187).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the literature suggests that the majority of the known AMPs that we tested are compounds with multiplexed activities in addition to membrane penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation highlights a generic problem with machine-learning approaches: High classification accuracy does not necessarily imply understanding or even amenability to traditional forms of understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is known that AMPs can have immunologically relevant activity outside of membrane activity, there is currently no general way to identify AMPs with additional functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a way to identify candidate sequences with multiplexed functions in the next section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predicted_Distance_to_Hyperplane_of_Synthesized_Test_Peptides_Correlates_with_Strength_of_Negative_Gaussian_Curvature_Generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distance from hyperplane  possesses a clear mathematical interpretation as the distance of a candidate peptide from a hyperplane in the 12-dimensional space of the bagged descriptors (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the high dimensionality of the space, opaque nature of some descriptors, and absence of a mechanistic model linking peptide sequence to function makes it challenging to assign physical interpretability to this discriminatory metric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To glean physical understanding, we synthesized peptide sequences with defined values of  and assayed the peptidemembrane interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we selected for synthesis 16 candidate sequences identified by the directed search procedure according to the following criteria: they did not feature in the AMP database, were classified by the SVM as antimicrobial, were predicted to have 50% -helical content by the secondary structure prediction algorithm PSIPRED (4345), and were confirmed to possess antimicrobial activity in vitro (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a common contribution to antimicrobial activity is membrane permeation, we investigated this aspect using SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our prior work, we have shown that the ability of a peptide to generate NGC in model membranes is an excellent proxy for antimicrobial activity through membrane-permeating properties (7, 11, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We incubated these test sequences with small unilamellar vesicles mimicking bacterial membranes {compositions 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (PS)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE) = 20/80 and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (PG)/PE = 20/80} under physiological salt and pH (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) at specific peptide-to-lipid charge ratios, and measured the resulting peptide-induced membrane curvature quantitatively using SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that 14 of the synthesized peptides reorganize membranes into cubic phases rich in NGC [Fig 3 A (Inset), C, and D].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show representative SAXS patterns for four of the test peptides, with labeled Bragg peaks corresponding to their cubic phases (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-fit lines to determine the lattice parameter a of the cubic phases are shown, along with the Miller indices (hkl) of each cubic reflection (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find these peptides typically reorganize model membranes into either Pn3m or Im3m cubic phases (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of induced membrane curvature in these phases can be directly compared via calculation of the NGC from the lattice parameter and the Euler characteristic (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same procedure was carried out for the other 10 sequences that generated cubic phases in these membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also generated either Pn3m or Im3m phases (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NGC values calculated from SAXS data (SI Appendix, Table S6) indicate that these peptides generate similar quantities of NGC as natural AMPs, which already strongly suggest that these predicted peptides permeabilize membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that our classifier can also recognize decoy peptides that do not generate NGC, we selected three negatively classified peptides to synthesize and test with SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that none of them generates NGC-rich cubic phases in the same membranes tested with the 16 test peptides (SI Appendix, Fig S8 and Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the ability of our classifier to detect peptide sequences lacking antimicrobial activity, we also screened five nonactive granulysin fragment peptides from the literature (SI Appendix, Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that these peptides have low or negative values of  and are far from the Pareto frontier, which is consistent with their inability to generate NGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our algorithm also correctly classifies the two active granulysin fragments (47), which are known to be membrane permeating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that the SVM classifier has learned to discriminate peptides based on their capacity to generate NGC, we computed the Spearman rank correlations of the magnitude of NGC calculated from the SAXS data for the 16 selected peptides with metrics used in the SVM classification algorithm (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked whether the magnitude of NGC correlates with the homology to known AMPs and/or the distance to hyperplane  (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that there is no significant correlation (RSpearman = 0.155 [0.425, 0.736], P = 0.565) between the magnitude of NGC generated by a peptide and its homology to a known AMP (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implies that sequence homology to a known AMP is not a necessary requirement to generate NGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, sequences that are far from known AMPs via simple mutation have potential to generate membrane curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this result, we ask whether there is a correlation between  and NGC (|less_thank|).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S4, we showed that  correlates poorly with antimicrobial efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we observe a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between the distance to hyperplane of a peptide, and its ability to generate NGC (RSpearman = 0.653 [0.234, 0.891], P = 0.006) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides strong support for the hypothesis that our SVM classifier has learned to discriminate peptides based on their capacity to generate NGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the distance to hyperplane  also provides a measure of the confidence of the algorithm P(+1) in whether or not a sequence is antimicrobial, we conjecture that a higher confidence in classification may correlate with an enhanced ability to generate NGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking at the 16 sequences that were identified by the SVM as high-probability hits [P(+1)  0.95], we find a strong positive and statistically significant correlation between the confidence in the prediction of the SVM P(+1), and the magnitude of NGC (RSpearman = 0.653 [0.231, 0.896], P = 0.006) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result makes sense because P(+1) and  are monotonically but nonlinearly related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result has strong implications for the utility of our SVM classifierwe can now stratify the predicted quality of sequences by using the -metric as a surrogate for expected NGC generating ability to efficiently explore sequence space and predict peptides with high membrane activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, sequences less homologous to known AMPs with large values of  that fall near, but not necessarily on, the Pareto frontier can generate the same level of membrane curvature expected of prototypical -helical AMPs (such as Magainin, |less_thank| = 2.536 × 104Å-2), and candidate AMPs spanning a large range of helicities and homologies to known AMPs can also generate magnitudes of NGC similar to those of known AMPs (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we expect to be able to use  to predict the membrane activity of peptide families that may be very dissimilar from AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the relationship between amphiphilicity and ability to generate curvature in membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we find that 4 out of the 12 descriptors in our final SVM model enforce amphiphilicity in positively classified peptides (#2, 3, 6, 8 in SI Appendix Table S2, and Fig S9A), suggesting that the SVM encodes amphiphilicity implicitly in its selection criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively compare amphiphilicity with |less_thank|, we calculate the mean hydrophobic moment of the test peptides and find that they compare favorably to known helical AMPs (SI Appendix, Fig S9B) despite having large mutational distances from known AMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that amphiphilicity is highly correlated with the ability to generate NGC (RSpearman = 0.680, P = 0.0038).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings strongly support the hypothesis that our SVM classifier has learned to distinguish membrane-permeating from nonmembrane-permeating -helical peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result illustrates a simultaneous potentiality and deficiency of our SVM, and of QSAR approaches in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our classifier has discovered membrane permeation activity as a highly recognizable feature of AMPs within the training set, and used it to identify such AMPs with high accuracy and efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limitation of the classifier is that it is therefore capable of identifying and indexing membrane activity, but not necessarily antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this result may at first blush appear to be a shortcoming of our QSAR approach, it emphasizes the transformative potential of the SVM classifier: It yields combinations of physicochemical properties that describe any peptide that can mediate membrane activity through induction of NGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using -helical AMPs as a bootstrap dataset to learn about membrane curvature generating sequences in general, regardless of their primary known function, we now have a general tool for screening peptides for membrane crossing or permeating activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Directed_Search_of_the_Sequence_Space_of_Physicochemically_Restricted_and_Unrestricted_Peptides_Discovers_Diverse_Families_of_Membrane_Curvature-Generating_Peptides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the capacity of our SVM classifier to identify peptide sequences with membrane activity, we compiled from the Protein Data Bank 31 peptides belonging to diverse families of known and unknown function including viral peptides that attack membranes, intrinsically disordered peptides, and exocytosis/endocytosis related sequences, and used our SVM classifier to project them into our sequence map (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a number of sequences were found to reside near the Pareto frontiers, suggesting the existence of membrane activity within these candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found several neuropeptides (purple stars), calcitonin peptide hormones (black stars), viral fusion proteins (yellow stars), membrane anchor proteins (green stars), membrane-permeating protein fragments (blue stars), and topogenic peptides (pink stars) proximate to the Pareto frontiers (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is exciting for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several neuropeptides have been shown to be antimicrobial in vitro (4850), but this is an indication that many members of the family can generate the kind of membrane curvature required for permeabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alludes to possible intracellular targets of these neuropeptides and receptor-independent mechanisms of signal transduction in addition to their regular mode of activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation reinforces a previously known structural tendency of AMPs, because several of them are known to have endocrine and homeostatic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, hepcidin permeates membranes but is also involved in regulation of iron (51), whereas -melanocyte stimulating hormone has antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects in addition to its signaling properties (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcitonin is a peptide hormone involved in calcium homeostasis, but is also a known amyloid that deposits in medullary thyroid carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies of amyloid proteins have demonstrated the ability to increase membrane permeability (53), and may provide a physicochemical basis for this observation (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also previously described the role of the M2 proton channel in budding and scission of the influenza virus (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this algorithm, we find that a variety of other viral fusion proteins likely share similar characteristics, including peptide domains from medically relevant viruses like ebolavirus, HIV, coronavirus, and hepatitis C. Other diverse discovered proteins include membrane-permeating protein fragments from enzymes, DNA-binding proteins, and prion precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis also identified helical membrane-active sequences from topogenic peptides, which are known membrane curvature-generating proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These special signal sequences present at the N-terminal portions of newly translated proteins help target and translocate large proteins across intracellular membranes (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, it can be shown that the sequence content of the Pareto-optimal and peptide sequences from the newly identified taxonomies follow the same sequence trends as existing AMPs (SI Appendix, discussion section, and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that our algorithm can efficiently and effectively identify candidates that can reorganize bacterial membranes from a large sequence space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have trained an SVM classifier to recognize membrane activity and experimentally calibrated the recognition metric by peptide synthesis and characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results, which highlight the difference between the efficacy of an antimicrobial and its recognizability as such, are surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An SVM classifier trained only on physicochemical information can effectively recapitulate geometric and topological principles required for membrane permeation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use machine learning not only to predict unknown membrane-active peptides from known ones, but also reflexively to identify peptides with multiple functions and to discover previously unknown interrelations between existing peptide classifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the SVM classifier as a discovery tool to map the sequence space of AMPs, we find a diverse taxonomy of sequences that are expected to be just as membrane-active as known AMPs, but with a broad range of primary functions outside of immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show how our SVM classifier can be generalized to other fields and used as a search engine for membrane activity in peptide sequences and a detector of AMPs with multiplexed functions beyond membrane activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We trained and validated an SVM classifier to distinguish membrane-active sequences from nonmembrane-active sequences using the Python packages propy (57) and scikit-learn (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used variable selection to train a classifier based on 12 physicochemical descriptors, and used this model to perform a directed search of peptide sequence space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal candidates were identified using a Pareto analysis, and 16 test peptides were validated for membrane activity using SAXS and antimicrobial assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthesized peptides were incubated with model membranes and the magnitude of negative Gaussian curvature was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full materials and methods are found in the SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
