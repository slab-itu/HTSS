Systemic, postsymptomatic antisense oligonucleotide rescues motor unit maturation delay in a new mouse model for type II/III spinal muscular atrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most frequent infantile genetic diseases and impairs breathing and locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promoting RNA splicing of one of the genes involved in SMA leads to spectacular improvements in laboratory models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splicing modulators such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) therefore come to the forefront of therapeutic candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, timing of delivery and route of administration still need to be optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Do ASOs have to be delivered into the central nervous system, and are ASOs still efficient if administered late after disease onset?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a new mouse model for SMA, we show that ASOs were efficacious when delivered outside of the spinal cord and late after the onset of the symptoms of the animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical presentation of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) ranges from a neonatal-onset, very severe disease to an adult-onset, milder form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMA is caused by the mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, and prognosis inversely correlates with the number of copies of the SMN2 gene, a human-specific homolog of SMN1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite progress in identifying potential therapies for the treatment of SMA, many questions remain including how late after onset treatments can still be effective and what the target tissues should be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These questions can be addressed in part with preclinical animal models; however, modeling the array of SMA severities in the mouse, which lacks SMN2, has proven challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created a new mouse model for the intermediate forms of SMA presenting with a delay in neuromuscular junction maturation and a decrease in the number of functional motor units, all relevant to the clinical presentation of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this new model, in combination with clinical electrophysiology methods, we found that administering systemically SMN-restoring antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) at the age of onset can extend survival and rescue the neurological phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these effects were also achieved by administration of the ASOs late after onset, independent of the restoration of SMN in the spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by adding to the limited repertoire of existing mouse models for type II/III SMA, we demonstrate that ASO therapy can be effective even when administered after onset of the neurological symptoms, in young adult mice, and without being delivered into the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present here an intermediate mouse model for SMA made by genetic titration of SMN levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overt features of this model include tail necrosis and cardiac abnormalities, however SMA-like defects were also found in the neuromuscular system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASO therapy did improve the cardiac phenotype and, most likely as a consequence, extend survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the cardiac defect has little relevance to the clinical presentation, we also focused our analyses on the rescue of the neurological phenotypes that we had identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Burgheron mouse presents with a congestive heart failure phenotype, and we have provided several lines of evidence that indicate that this is the likely cause of premature death in the mutants: (i) Animals die abruptly, rather than with a progressive neurological decline, and (ii) significant changes in heart rate, LVM:BW ratio, and EF occur immediately before death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instances of congenital heart defects have been reported in SMA patients, including heart malformation features (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have also been reports of patients exhibiting bradycardia (45) and a single case of necrosis of the digits and vascular thrombosis (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although involvement of the autonomic nervous system and other organ systems in the pathogenesis of SMA have been called into question (30), cardiac defects are seldom part of the clinical presentation of SMA types I, II, and III (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac defects are, however, the cause of death in both the severe SMA mouse models (29, 48) and milder models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a limitation of SMA mouse models that is well recognized (19), and caution should be used when circulatory phenotypes or survival in SMA mouse models are used as outcome measures of efficacy testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they can be a readout for target engagement of SMN-restoring compounds, they are likely not informative of the window of opportunity and tissue requirement of SMN that are relevant to clinical testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, although we did not study the cardiac phenotype in ASO-treated mice, the extended survival and increased levels of SMN in the myocardium after treatment suggest that ASO therapy improves heart function in this mild SMA model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more severe mouse models, systemic ASO delivery has also been shown to reverse the cardiac phenotype (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Burgheron mutants, therefore, like other long-lived SMA models, could be used to further elucidate how low SMN levels affect either the sympathetic nervous system or the circulatory system, but relevant neurological phenotypes had to be identified and used as outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Burgheron mutants present a delay in the structural maturation of the NMJ endplates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reminiscent of the absence of perforation of the endplates in the 2B/ model (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, postsynaptic maturation delay was also observed in more severe SMA models and consisted in the abnormal persistence after birth of embryonic (type gamma) AChR subunits at the NMJ (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This delayed maturation calls for further investigation of the mechanisms driving the refinement of the endplates from the postnatal to the adult stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agrin, a major synaptic organizer, has been found to be less active in SMA models, and this partial loss of function could account for the maturation phenotype (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, synaptogenic agrin is transcribed in the motor neurons (51); we found that ASOs could restore the NMJ maturation independently of increasing SMN levels in the spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that NMJ maturation in SMA relies in part on muscle- or Schwann cell-derived factors that remain to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mice, surface electromyography, including MUNE, has been seldom used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such tests were initially introduced to follow the progression of the denervation of leg muscles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models (5254), and only recently, MUNE was applied in the severe 7 SMA model (55) and the very mild C/C mouse (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the ALS and 7 models, NMJ abnormalities have been observed, as well as a moderate (in 7 mice) to severe (in G93A mice) loss of peripheral axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrophysiology phenotypes that were documented reflect the ability of this approach to detect major changes in the motor unit structural integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether CMAP measurement and MUNE are sensitive enough to detect milder motor unit defects in the mouse and whether mild SMA mouse models do display electrophysiological deficits have been little documented before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mild Smn1C/C mouse, CMAP, but not MUNE, was found to be reduced at 1 y of age (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides the illustration of a MUNE deficit in a mild SMA model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In type 2 and type 3 SMA, decreased MUNE is often found (41, 42) along with a decreased CMAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased SMUP size has been reported in at least one study (41), suggesting that a compensatory reinnervation of denervated muscle fibers takes place in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions of the CMAP and MUNE in the Burgheron mice are reminiscent of the human symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMUPs were not increased, which suggests that the compensatory motor unit enlargement observed in some patients does not occur in the Burgheron mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be a consequence of the absence of frank denervation of the endplates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of nerve pathology in the Burgheron mice, combined with their neurophysiology phenotype, points toward a pathology mechanism affecting either the NMJs, which could be silenced; the nerves, whose conduction could be blocked; or the postsynaptic muscle fibers, whose excitability could be reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our findings suggest that anatomically normal motor units are silenced in the SMA mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reminiscent of our previous finding that 815% of NMJs are structurally intact, yet silent, in the splenius capitis muscles of the Smn1C/C mouse at PND 90 and PND 350, respectively (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we explored the window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention in a mild SMA model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic delivery at PND 0 and PND 3 of an ASO promoting the inclusion of SMN2s exon 7 has proven spectacularly efficient in extending the median survival (from PND 10 to PND 108), as well as the NMJ maturation phenotype observed at PND 9, of a severe mouse model (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mice that received only two injections at PND 1 and PND 3 developed necrosis, repeated s.c. injections also prevented this necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported a postsymptomatic therapeutic window in the severe 7 mouse model, where restoration of SMN expression via a tamoxifen-inducible genetic rescue allele provided the greatest benefit with respect to survival if it was induced before PND 8 (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the 7 mutants have a mean survival of 17 d, the Burgheron mutants, with a mean survival of 89 d, offered an unprecedented opportunity to test the efficacy of restoring SMN levels much later after the onset of the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we found that late administration, in a milder model, also improves survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, necrosis was stopped by only two successive administrations, either at PND 10 or PND 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we observed that ASO efficiency was age-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When injected at PND 10, the ASO caused a noticeable, although not significant, recovery of the CMAP amplitude at both PND 25 and PND 60; but when injected at PND 25, the ASO had a more spectacular effect and significantly increased the CMAP recorded 10 d postinjection, at PND 35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation of the ASO biological effects with age could be related to changes in targeting efficiency or target abundance, as both the full-length and 7 mRNA expression change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an age dependency of ASO efficacy has been observed in another study with a different ASO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in exon 7 inclusion in the liver, 2 d after injection, was found to be greater for injections performed at PND 8 or PND 13 than for injections performed at PND 2; later in age, the efficacy decreased for injections at PND 18 (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ASOs used in our study, the age-dependent results seem to be shifted toward older ages, with efficacy being higher for injection in early adult (PND 25) than in younger mice (PND 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be due to a critical treatment period (that remains to be defined) around PND 25, at a time when the PND 10 injection begins to wane, as ASO half-life in liver is 21 d (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To answer whether therapeutic ability is limited to presymptomatic stages or if it extends to a later time after the onset of the symptoms, the Burgheron model demonstrates here that treatment at the postsymptomatic age of PND 25, when NMJ maturation and electrophysiology of the motor unit are already affected, resulted in a robustly increased life span, arrested the necrotic phenotype, and restored a normal motor unit supply to the muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clinical trials for gene replacement and ASO therapies for SMA have begun, and drugs are being delivered systemically or in the central nervous system, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprising evidence in mouse models, including this study, that peripheral ASOs can rescue the lethality and electrophysiology phenotypes raises the possibility that an alternative or additional delivery route could still be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also question in which cell type SMN levels need to be restored in SMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although evident neuron loss is observed in type I SMA, supporting the role of SMN as a survival factor for motor neurons, it has been harder to identify in later-onset forms of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In type II/III SMA, the role of glial cells and muscle cells in the maintenance and function of the motor unit remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few studies have focused on the role of the muscle, glial cells, and motoneurons themselves in the overall function of the motor units in SMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the glial-specific restoration of SMN in mice with reduced SMN levels was found to be necessary to restore part of the motor unit function in a severe mouse model (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, peripheral administration of an ASO that rescues the SMA-like phenotypes of the NMJ and motor unit coincides with a better correction of SMN2 splicing in the muscle than in the spinal cord and to a greater increase of SMN protein in the heart than in the brain or the spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the known inability of ASOs to cross the bloodbrain barrier supports, which limits their effect, in our model, to the periphery of the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies and our present findings suggest at least two possible ways for peripheral ASOs to rescue SMN deficiency in the motor unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, SMN is known to regulate, in the liver, the secretion of Igf1, which does cross the bloodbrain barrier and has a trophic function on spinal cord motoneurons (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, peripheral ASOs would restore SMN in the liver and restore motoneuron function via the restoration of normal systemic growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, glial cells (and maybe muscle cells) are suspected to require a normal level of SMN to support the function of the motorunit (59); in this alternative but not exclusive scenario, peripheral ASOs would restore SMN in the Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves and restore the motor unit function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this hypothesis is verified and translates to the human pathology, the skeletal muscle or the peripheral glia being involved in the disease would indicate that they may be target tissues for therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are warranted to determine if these findings translate to SMA patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generation_of_the_Animal_Model_and_Husbandry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SMA mutants (referred to here as Burgheron mutants) were created by crossing fully FVB/NJ congenic severe Burghes model female SMN2+/+; Smn1+/ mice (JAX stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  007949) with fully FVB congenic males heterozygous for the previously described Smn1C/ allele (JAX stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  008604) (14) (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the protocols described in the National Institutes of Healths Guide for the Care and Use of Animals (60) and were approved by The Jackson Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASO_Administration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesis and purification of all chemically modified oligonucleotides were performed as previously described (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASO 1029, 5-ATTCACTTTCATAATGCTGG-3, is uniformly modified with 2-O-methoxyethyl nucleotides and a phosphorothioate backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It targets the ISS-N1 site (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASOs were dissolved in sterile PBS and injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at a dose of 80 g/g BW twice, either at PND 10 and PND 12 or PND 25 and PND 27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicitys sake, the experimental cohorts are referred to as injected at PND 10 or PND 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Survival_and_Phenotypic_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Burgheron mutants were monitored for survival from birth through 6 mo of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants were weighed daily until weaning and once weekly thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cardiac_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Echocardiograms were recorded from anesthetized mice using a Vevo770 high-frequency ultrasound machine (VisualSonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were first anesthetized with 5% (vol/vol) isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen at a flow of 1.0 L/min and were then maintained under anesthesia with a flow of 1.5% isoflurane/oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ophthalmic ointment was placed on the eyes to prevent drying of the cornea during anesthesia and ultrasound examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse heart rate and body temperature were monitored continuously during the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After anesthetic induction, the animals were placed on a thermostatically controlled heated platform where isoflurane anesthesia was maintained by delivery through a close-fitting face mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heart rate was monitored through use of an electrocardiograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fur was removed from the ventral surface of the mouse torso with clippers and Nair (Church & Dwight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D (B-mode), M-mode, and Doppler images were acquired from modified parasternal long-axis view, parasternal short-axis view, suprasternal notch view, and apical three-chamber view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heart rate, fractional shortening, EF, stroke volume, and cardiac output were obtained for cardiac function assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative and quantitative measurements were made postimaging using VevoStrain analytic software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMJ_Phenotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMJ imaging was performed as described previously (61, 62) and as detailed in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NMJs were analyzed across three areas of the TVA or TA muscle endplate from three to six mutants and controls at PND 10, 25, and 60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were analyzed at 20× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMJs within each section were defined as on their side (noninformative), plaque (less_than2 perforations), or pretzel (numerous perforations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maturation index was calculated as the percentage of immature (plaque-like) NMJs over the total number of informative NMJs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Peripheral_Axon_Counts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For peripheral axon counts, the sensory and motor branches of the femoral nerve were dissected above the medial quadriceps femoris and fixed in 2% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde, 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, and 0.1 M cacodylate buffer overnight at 4°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both nerve branches were embedded in plastic, and 0.5-m sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photomicrographs were analyzed semiautomatically as described previously (60) with the ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counts of myelinated axons in the motor and the sensory branches were reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surface_Electromyography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For surface electromyography, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance), and internal body temperature was maintained at 37° with a homeothermic controller and plate (AD Instruments, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ML295/m) coupled to a rectal probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method previously described (53) was adapted as described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SMN_Alternative_Splicing_Quantitative_Real-Time_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from diaphragm and spinal cord tissue samples with the Zymo Research Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep Kit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R2052), and 800 ng of diaphragm RNA or 400 ng of spinal cord RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers with the Life Technologies High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4368813).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA yields and quality were assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following standard protocols, quantitative real-time PCR was performed with custom-designed assays (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold changes to control samples were calculated in the mutants using the Ct method for full-length and 7 mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GAPDH was used as the reference gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length 7 ratios were calculated with these fold changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SMN_ELISAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SMN levels were assessed in the indicated tissue homogenates using a commercially available SMN ELISA Kit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADI-900209; Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ELISA was developed by the SMA community as an improved alternative to Western blots (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kit detects both human and mouse SMN protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, tissues were disrupted using a mechanical homogenizer, cellular debris was pelleted via centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and assayed for protein concentration using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  500011EDU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein lysates were prediluted before assaying according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical significance of Student t test, ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and post hoc multicomparison Dunnetts and Sidaks tests is indicated on the graph as follows: *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generation_of_the_Burgheron_Model_and_Husbandry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resulting mutants harbored one copy of the SMN2 transgene consisting of a 35.5-kb BamHI genomic fragment encoding the human SMN2 promoter and gene (derived from genomic clone PAC215P15) made by Dr. Arthur Burghes (64) and were compound heterozygous at the murine SMN locus for the targeted knockout made by Dr. Michael Sendtner (referred to as Smn1tm1Msd) (65) and the C allele made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter allele encodes two coding sequences: The first is a hybrid gene in which a 2.2-kb segment of mouse genome containing exons 7 and 8 of the mouse Smn1 gene was replaced with a 1.3-kb fragment of human genomic DNA containing exons 7 and 8 of the human SMN2 gene, and the second is a full 42-kb copy of the human SMN2 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were genotyped at the Smn1 locus for the targeted mutations using the following assays: Smn1tm1Msd:WT, F 5-TTT TCT CCC TCT TCA GAG TGA T-3; WT, R 5-CTG TTT CAA GGG AGT TGT GGC-3, MUT, F 5-CTC CGG GAT ATT GGG ATT G-3, and MUT, R 5-GGT AAC GCC AGG GTT TTC C-3; and for Smn1C, MUT, F 5-GGA TGC CAC CAT AGC ATT TTG-3, and MUT, R 5-CGG TCC TAA GGT AGC GAG TGA-3, with WT F, 5-GTC CCT GGT CGA CAA GAA CAG-3, and WT, R 5-ACG CTC TGC TGC TGA CTT AGG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were housed in individually and positively ventilated polysulfonate cages with high-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filtered air at a density of 34 adult mice per cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal room was lighted entirely with artificial fluorescent lighting, with a controlled 12 h light/dark cycle (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM light).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal temperature and relative humidity ranges in the animal rooms were 2026 °C and 3070%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal rooms were set to have up to 15 air exchanges per hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filtered tap water, acidified to a pH of 2.53.0, and normal rodent (LabDiet 5K52) chow were provided ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For survival studies, mice were followed up to 180 d of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice that reached this age were humanely euthanized, due to the advanced necrosis of the paws and ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMJs_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscles were dissected and fixed in cold 2% (wt/vol) buffered paraformaldehyde (prepared fresh) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leg muscles were embedded in 3% (wt/vol) agarose in PBS and sectioned (100-m-thick sections) with a vibratome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flat TVA muscle was processed whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then incubated overnight in primary antibodies (a mixture of mouse monoclonal antineurofilament 2H3 and anti-SV2 from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), washed the following day, and incubated overnight with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated BTX (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscles were mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO, S3023) and imaged on a Leica SP5 laser confocal microscope at 20× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microphotographs were acquired from three different endplate areas on each muscle, and at least 40 NMJs were scored in each area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMJs whose orientation was perpendicular to the slide were scored as noninformative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMJs oriented parallel to the slide with three or more perforations of the BTX-positive area were scored as mature; NMJs with less than three perforations were scored as immature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assays for full-length SMN (forward primer, 5-ATTTCATGGTACATGAGTGGCTATCAT-3; reverse primer, 5-CTTTAGTGGTGTCATTTAGTGCTGCTC-3; probe/56-FAM/ATGCCAGCA/Zen/TTTCTCCTTAATTTAAGGA/3IABkFQ/) and 7 SMN (forward primer, 5-TGGACCACCAATAATTCCCC-3; reverse primer, 5-ATGCCAGCATTTCCATATAATAGCC-3; probe/56-FAM/ACCACCTCC/Zen/CATATGTCCAGATTCTCTTGATG/3IABkFq/) were custom-made by IDT; an inventoried Life Technologies TaqMan gene expression assay for GAPDH (Mm03302249_g1 PL VIC) was used as an endogenous control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were not multiplexed, and all samples were run in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probe efficiencies for all assays were determined by generation of a standard curve (full-length SMN slope, 3.403; r2, 0.9998; 7 SMN slope, 3.474; r2, 0.9954).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surface_Electromyography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CMAP responses were recorded from the proximal hind limb using either two fine pregelled, self-adhesive silver/silver chloride ring recording electrodes (MVAP Medical Supplies, EMG electrodes, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  019435500) cut to a length of 1.5 cm and a width of about 0.5 cm or two fine wire ring electrodes (Alpine Biomed, 9013S03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active (E1) electrode was positioned around the lower hind limb, over the bellies of the gastrocnemius and TA; the reference (E2) electrode was positioned around the metatarsal region of the foot of the same limb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supramaximal stimulation of the sciatic nerve was elicited via two monopolar 10-mm-length, 30-gauge (0.25 mm in diameter) platinum subdermal needle electrodes (Grass Technologies, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-E2-30) placed s.c. over the sacrum (anode) and the sciatic notch (cathode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that electrodes would be ideally located but not in direct contact with the nerve, the position of the stimulating electrodes was adjusted so that stimulations of 0.7 mA would reproducibly elicit a potential but stimulations below 0.3 mA would not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulations were delivered through a Stimulus Isolator (FE180, AD Instruments) and consisted of monophasic pulses of a constant current of 0.1 ms in duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMAP amplitude (and area) was recorded through a signal amplifier (FE132 Bio Amp, AD Instruments) to give a measure of the output of the intact motor neurons, motor axons, synapses, and innervated muscle fibers within the sciatic-innervated muscle groups of the hind limb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation intensity and potential recordings were controlled by a software (LabChart, AD Instruments) run on a single personal computer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitive CMAP responses were obtained with trains of 10 supramaximal stimuli at 3, 10, 20 (or 30), and 50 (or 60) Hz stimulation rates to assess NMJ transmission function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each repetitive CMAP response was expressed as a percentage of the amplitude of the first response recorded for each frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak-to-peak amplitude of the CMAPs was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For MUNE with the incremental technique, a total of 10 incremental responses were recorded and stored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak-to-peak amplitude of each individual motor unit response was calculated by subtracting the amplitude of the prior response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10 incremental values were averaged to estimate an average SMUP size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was divided into the amplitude of the maximum CMAP to yield the MUNE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mice older than 10 d, SMUPs of an amplitude greater than 1 mV were not used for the calculation of the average SMUP size; instead, they were subtracted from the maximum CMAP amplitude, and the resulting CMAP was used for the MUNE calculation, an approach used previously in statistical MUNE (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
