Superresolution intrinsic fluorescence imaging of chromatin utilizing native, unmodified nucleic acids for contrast  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence photoswitching of native, unmodified deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using visible light facilitates the label-free nanoscale imaging of chromatin structures based on the principle of single-molecule photon localization microscopy (PLM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a demonstrated sub20-nm resolution, DNA-PLM provides an ideal technique to visualize the spatial organization of single or groups of nucleosomes and quantitatively estimate the nucleosome occupancy level of DNA in unstained chromosomes and nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study paves a way for revealing nanoscopic features of chromatin without the need for exogenous labels and could substantially expand our understanding of the structurefunction relationship of chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Visualizing the nanoscale intracellular structures formed by nucleic acids, such as chromatin, in nonperturbed, structurally and dynamically complex cellular systems, will help expand our understanding of biological processes and open the next frontier for biological discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditional superresolution techniques to visualize subdiffractional macromolecular structures formed by nucleic acids require exogenous labels that may perturb cell function and change the very molecular processes they intend to study, especially at the extremely high label densities required for superresolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite tremendous interest and demonstrated need, label-free optical superresolution imaging of nucleotide topology under native nonperturbing conditions has never been possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate a photoswitching process of native nucleotides and present the demonstration of subdiffraction-resolution imaging of cellular structures using intrinsic contrast from unmodified DNA based on the principle of single-molecule photon localization microscopy (PLM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using DNA-PLM, we achieved nanoscopic imaging of interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes, allowing a quantitative analysis of the DNA occupancy level and a subdiffractional analysis of the chromosomal organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study may pave a new way for label-free superresolution nanoscopic imaging of macromolecular structures with nucleotide topologies and could contribute to the development of new DNA-based contrast agents for superresolution imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fluorescence_and_Photoswitching_of_Nucleotides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although nucleic acids have significantly weaker absorption in the visible versus UV spectrum, they exhibit low, but detectable (29), absorption due to the electron delocalization effect, in part arising from the aromatic ring (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence emission in the visible range is significantly enhanced when the concentration reaches the level of that in interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes (see detailed discussion in SI Appendix and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the long-lived fluorescence indicates the origin of observed fluorescence under visible light illumination is possibly related to intermolecular interactions, such as excimer/exciplex formation (32, 33) or charge separation/recombination (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we chose short single-stranded polynucleotides (20-bp poly-A, G, C, and T, IDT) as model systems to investigate the fluorescence excitation and photoswitching of DNA molecules during visible excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1A, the fluorescence spectra of the four types of polynucleotides indicate peak emissions near 580 nm under 532-nm excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured spectra were consistent with the emission spectrum of chromosome samples studied in parallel (see sample preparation in Materials and Methods and corresponding discussion regarding Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4), which demonstrates that we are exclusively capturing fluorescence from DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Integration of intrinsic fluorescence with PLM requires the ability to achieve blinking single-molecule emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fully mapping the electronic states in DNA molecules is a decades-old challenge (35), there is evidence indicating the existence of long-lived dark and triplet states with lifetimes as long as a few hundred milliseconds in nucleotides (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These states can serve as primary candidates for photoinduced switching of nucleic acids by leveraging GSD with dark-state shelving and stochastic return.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon has previously been exploited for superresolution microscopy with exogenous dyes (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding photochemical process can be described by a system of three differential equations (see detailed discussion in SI Appendix, Fig S6) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the dark states have a lifetime  much longer than that of fluorescence, the majority of molecules are shelved to their long-lived dark (triplet) states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few molecules may return to their ground state at any given time, with the average rate of k=1/, where they can then be repeatedly excited to the fluorescent state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process creates the on and off periods, or blinking, yielding the required stochastic activities for precisely locating molecules with PLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of the long-lived dark state of polynucleotides was validated by a pumpprobe method as previously discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 (see details in Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1B, the theory of GSD predicts that once GSD has been induced by a strong pump excitation (Ipump up to 24 kWcm2 for 100 ms) the fluorescence induced by a weaker probe beam (Iprobe = 0.3 kWcm2) will follow the exponential time course of the repopulation of the ground state with recovery lifetime .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that recovery lifetimes of polynucleotides are at the hundred-millisecond level (Fig 1B), which is consistent with the typical lifetime of the dark states for traditional fluorescent probes (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further validation of the GSD mechanism was achieved by varying Ipump and estimating the population of ground state  as the ratio of fluorescence at the beginning of the recovery to the steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected,  was inversely related to Ipump (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 D and E further shows comparisons of the recovery lifetime and population of ground state between polynucleotides using a beam fluence of 24 kWcm2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery lifetimes of the four polynucleotides are within the same order of magnitude, which facilitate PLM with stochastic photon switching of all four types of nucleotides simultaneously in DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, different polynucleotides have distinct  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, nucleotides containing purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine) have similar  and , respectively, likely due to the similarity of their molecular structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Molecule_Imaging_of_Nucleotides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the imaging capability of DNA-PLM, we further performed single-molecule imaging of 20-bp poly-G DNA (see detailed preparation in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly-G DNA has a high dark-state shelving probability and a relatively shorter recovery lifetime compared with other investigated polynucleotides, making it ideal for demonstration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imaging, we excited Poly-G DNA samples using a 532-nm laser with a fluence of 3 kWcm2, which is a lower level of excitation that balances the switching rate and the rate of photobleaching (which can turn the molecules irreversibly dark).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acquired movies consisting of 5,000 frames at exposure times of 10 ms per frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, the averaged wide-field fluorescence image shows only diffraction-limited features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the stochastic nature of photon emission and dark-state transition, the number of photons detected from a single molecule fluctuates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows a histogram of detected photon counts from each stochastic emission event, which shows a peak at 250 counts and an average at 550 counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the Nyquist criterion (38), DNA-PLM can theoretically achieve a spatial resolution of 22 nm due to the emission characteristics of polynucleotides (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we investigated the temporal characteristics of the stochastic fluorescence emission, as shown in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of stochastic emission events shows a temporal decay, which is characteristic of the exponential decay of photobleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the temporal decay stage, the stochastic emission reached an equilibrium state, with relatively stabilized stochastic emission frequency, lasting for more than 10 min before all molecules were photobleached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focusing on an individual molecule (as denoted by the arrow in Fig 2A), we further studied the temporal properties of stochastic onoff switching from the time trace of the fluorescence signal (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average on-times were a few tens of milliseconds, whereas the off-times were significantly larger (ranging from several hundred milliseconds to 10 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the investigated molecule, the number of photons detected per fluorescence on event has an average of 500 counts but can burst up to 1,900 counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dramatic variation may be due to the natural complexity of the electrical structure in a DNA strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reconstruction of all stochastic fluorescence events, we generated a PLM image by plotting their centroids (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centroids approximately follow a Gaussian distribution with a full width at half maximum of 18 ± 2 nm and 20 ± 2 nm in the horizontal and the vertical axis, respectively (Fig 2F), suggesting DNA-PLM achieves an imaging resolution of 20 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is consistent with our previous estimation based on the Nyquist criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, it has been reported that long-lived states in DNA base pairs joined by hydrogen bonds decay with essentially identical kinetics as those seen in single-strained polynucleotides (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that double-stranded DNA molecules with double helix should have similar photophysical properties as the single-stranded polynucleotides being examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_DNA-PLM_Imaging_with_Labeled_DNA_Fibers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the capability of DNA-PLM for imaging native nucleic acids structures, we used linearly deposited unlabeled single-stranded DNA fibers (a DNA purity standard, Sigma-Aldrich) as a model system (see detailed preparation in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using 532-nm excitation, DNA-PLM produces the characteristic linear features of the DNA fibers, the origin of which is due to the nucleic acids as confirmed using two DNA specific fluorescence probes, Syto-13 and Hoechst 33342 (Thermofisher), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3 A and B, the colocalized DNA-PLM image and diffraction-limited wide-field Hoechst fluorescence image of a single DNA fiber demonstrates the capability of DNA-PLM to image DNA structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, conventional STORM imaging of Syto-13 stained DNA fibers performed in parallel shows the same topology captured by DNA-PLM, as shown in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging resolution of DNA-PLM is demonstrated as 20-nm resolution (Fig 3D), which is comparable to images produced by conventional STORM imaging using Syto-13 dye (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Superresolution_Imaging_of_Interphase_Chromatin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the label-free imaging of DNA topology in cells, we imaged the nanoscale structure of interphase chromatin (see detailed preparation in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A shows the wide-field fluorescence image of an isolated, unstained interphase HeLa cell nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated in Fig 1A, the fluorescence spectrum of the sample is identical to that of polynucleotides, which demonstrated that the contrast is mostly from nucleic acids rather than proteins in the nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 B and C shows the corresponding DNA-PLM images at different scales (also see Movie S1 for raw images and the DNA-PLM reconstruction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the macromolecular organization of nucleic acid structures is arranged in discrete nanoclusters in interphase nuclei, which is consistent with previous reports (9, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further plotted the density image by defining the density as the number of stochastic emission events per pixel (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density image was then converted into a binary image and segmented by grouping the emission events based on their proximity (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanocluster size and the number of emission events in each nanocluster, N, was plotted in Fig 3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a quantitative analysis revealed the size distributions of nanoclusters (Fig 4G) and the number of emission events per nanocluster (Fig 4H), which can be useful in understanding the nanoscale organization of chromatin (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Investigation of chromatin organization and structure in interphase nuclei is important for gene function and activity (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, superresolution studies of chromatin with extrinsic labeling are accompanied by major drawbacks such as a limited ability to reveal the spatial organization of single or groups of nucleosomes and quantitatively estimating the nucleosome occupancy level of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By imaging nucleic acid molecules using intrinsic contrast, we provide a method to visualize the native structure of chromatin with nanoscale resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the conventional STORM in which the number of stochastic emissions could reflect the number of fluorophores, counting the number of emissions in DNA-PLM could potentially allow a quantitative estimate of the relative number of nucleotides per nanocluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By plotting the size of the chromatin structure with respect to the number of emission events (Fig 4F), a power-law scaling behavior with a scaling exponent of 0.28 ± 0.03 can be clearly observed, which is consistent with the earlier proposed chromatin organization as a fractal globule with a fractal dimension of 3 (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests, even at these deeply subdiffractional length scales (2060 nm), the topology of nucleic acids within the nucleus follows the same power-law structure as that observed at higher length scales (100250 nm) (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these length scales, one possible explanation is that individual genes self-assemble into discrete clusters that maximize their surface area while minimizing their volume occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, transcription or replication of genes could only occur on the surface of the cluster (46), as the interior would be tightly packaged with nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, larger clusters could be more diffuse owing to the presence of active polymerases or replicases (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further exploration of this topology of chromatin could only be revealed by label-free techniques such as DNA-PLM, as extrinsic labels could have nonlinear penetrance in such dense clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, we observed a median cluster size of 30 nm (Fig 4G), which is consistent with other studies in fixed cells showing 30-nm structures in hypotonic conditions (41, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore whether these structures form in vitro in chromatin, we performed a colocalization study on methanol fixed HeLa cells using conventional STORM immunofluorescent imaging with an Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated primary antibody targeting histone H2B and DNA-PLM (see detailed methods and results in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S9, clusters observed by DNA-PLM frequently colocalize with the anti-histone H2B antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not every cluster colocalizes with the anti-histone H2B antibody, this could be in part the result of either steric hindrance of the antibody at these length scales or the presence of different molecular epiptopes and regulators of the cluster topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As DNA-PLM captures the nanoscale structures formed by nucleic acids, the molecular regulators of these cluster domains could be studied in the future using novel small-molecule imaging dyes including nanobodies (47) or point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (48) that could be less sensitive to steric limitations to differentially label various molecular regulators, including nucleosomes, RNA and DNA polymerases, the polycomb and cohesion complexes, and long noncoding RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies could illuminate for the first time the in vitro regulatory organization of chromatin in situ, providing both information on nucleic acid distribution and the local molecular functional states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas we have demonstrated that DNA-PLM is ideal for studies of chromatin organization in fixed nuclei, as a noninvasive optical technique, DNA-PLM could potentially be suitable for nanoscopic imaging of chromatin in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this extension, DNA-PLM would be the only technique capable of definitively answering lingering questions about the presence of the elusive 30-nm fiber in living eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Superresolution_Imaging_of_Metaphase_Chromosomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we used DNA-PLM to image the structure of isolated metaphase chromosomes (see detailed preparation in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we focused on imaging autofluorescence of isolated X chromosomes from HeLa cells, which can be readily observed under a wide-field microscope (Fig 5A), however, with diffraction-limited resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using DNA-PLM, we conducted superresolution imaging of X-chromosomes, as shown in Fig 5B (also see Movie S2 for raw images and the DNA-PLM reconstruction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From higher magnified images shown in Fig 5 CE, we can clearly see variations in nucleotide density in the thick chromatids and additional fine features which were not resolvable in the wide-field image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segment stretched from the chromatid has a similar morphology to previously observed chromosomal fragile sites, which are specific heritable points on metaphase chromosomes that tend to form a gap, constriction, or break when cells are exposed to a perturbation during DNA replication (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragile sites frequently occur in the human genome and are classified as either common or rare based on their observed frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed common fragile sites are part of the normal chromosome architecture in all individuals and are of considerable interest in human diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, common fragile sites are frequently transformed during tumorigenesis resulting in the loss of tumor suppressor genes or the formation of oncogenes (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, rare fragile sites are seen in a small proportion of individuals, and are often associated with genetic disorders, such as fragile-X syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fragile sites are susceptible to spontaneous breakage during replication, and as such their identification and study is important to understanding diseases, including cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cellular autofluorescence is a widely observed phenomenon which commonly complicates immunofluorescence labeling studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, many conventional and superresolution imaging protocols use the use of reducing agents such as sodium borohydride before imaging to eliminate the intrinsic autofluorescence within the sample (7, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without the use of these reducing agents, autofluorescence can be greatly reduced simply by continuous visible light exposure of the sample before imaging (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the visible-lightinduced autofluorescence of nucleic acids has likely been overlooked due to the broad availability of the nuclear counter stains Hoechst 33342 and DAPI, the ability to quickly eliminate the intrinsic autofluorescence within samples, and the common misperception that nucleic acids do not fluoresce within the visible range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical implication is that macromolecules, which are widely perceived as dark, may be excited for superresolution imaging under different illumination conditions (27, 28, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical element in such an approach would depend on the capacity to ascertain molecular information from the intrinsic emissions of endogenous biological molecules (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas we clearly observed the chromatin structure derived from nucleic acids, we also acknowledge that there could be some nonspecific emission events from other molecules present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary nucleic acid within the nucleus is DNA; however, as RNA exists within the nucleus, it may contribute to the observed blinking and the measured topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, local conjugate proteins (e.g., histones, chromatin remodeling enzymes, transcription factors, and polymerases, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  may also generate blinking or nonblinking background fluorescence within the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 1A, the fluorescence observed in our cellular samples is consistent with that in the ex vivo models of pure nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that intranuclear proteins may not be efficiently excited at the wavelengths used in imaging or the amount of them that can be excited is not significant to influence the imaging results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, given the observations ex vivo, the predominant source of the signal we collected is from nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we note that similar switching processes can be observed under other excitations with different wavelengths (tested by 488-, 445-, and 405-nm laser illuminations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, image quality usually suffered due to the stronger background autofluorescence and more rapid photobleaching observed at shorter wavelengths (see detailed analysis in SI Appendix, Fig S10), which limited the number of stochastic emission events acquired for image reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these different wavelengths likely excite different singlet electronic states they can, however, be used to create new switching events or to return molecules from dark states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is of particular use when emission events become rare due to photobleaching under prior excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, specific imaging buffers, additives, or chemical methods used in chromatin fixation may vary the electronic state of DNA molecules and possibly be useful for suppressing the photobleaching or accelerating the switching of nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow-up studies are merited to fully understand the photophysics of DNA molecules under various conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have investigated the photoswitching process of native, unmodified DNA molecules and demonstrated the superresolution imaging capability of DNA-PLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using DNA-PLM we can achieve sub20-nm resolution with unmodified DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique is particularly suitable for imaging chromatin structures and may allow insight into native structures of DNA organization in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding and controlling the mechanisms for photoinduced dark-state formation in DNA molecules is important to develop better switching, to optimize the imaging parameters, and to apply DNA-PLM to study chromatin organization in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With further development, combined with temporal and spectral characterization, DNA-PLM can feasibly identify highly specific molecular fingerprints, leading to in situ label-free sequencing of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, topological and chemical alterations in highly condensed DNA strains can result in various additional photophysical interactions, as has been studied in polymer molecules, including energy transfer (5557), ground- or excited-state aggregate formation (58, 59), and charge transfer (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These photophysical processes can significantly modify the molecular optical properties, allowing us to further capture functional information about the chromatin nanoarchitecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For studying the fluorescence characteristic of polynucleotides, we built an integrated optical imaging and spectroscopy system based on an inverted microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 532-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser with 300-mW maximum output was passed through the microscope body (Nikon, Eclipse Ti-U) and was focused by an objective lens (Nikon, CFI Apo TIRF 100×, 1.49 N.A.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity and beam size of the illumination beam fluence were controlled by a linear polarizer and a dual lens assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For spectral characterization, the signal was routed to a spectrometer (Princeton, SP2150i) with a 150 lines per millimeter diffraction grating and an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD, Princeton Instruments, ProEM512B Excelon), giving a maximum 0.6-nm spectral resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long-pass filter (BLP01-532R-25, Semrock) was used to reject the reflected laser beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary fluorescence image was collected through a 550-nm long-pass filter before video acquisition by an EMCCD (Andor, iXon 897 Ultra) at a frame rate of 100 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the fraction of residual singlet-state molecules using a pumpprobe mode with a constant probe (0.3 kWcm2) and pump pulses of varying intensity (100 ms, 125 kWcm2) for shelving the molecules into dark states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence recovery was monitored for calculating the recovery lifetime by applying an exponential fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The detailed preparation of single-stranded DNA sample can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate DNA-PLM imaging of unlabeled DNA fibers, the nucleic acid origin of fibers was confirmed by staining using two DNA specific fluorescence probes, Hoechst 33342 and Syto-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed staining protocol can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chromosome_Preparation_from_Cultured_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The detailed preparation of chromosome and nuclei isolation can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation was performed as described previously (61) with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to imaging, 5 µL nuclease-free water (IDT) was dropped at the center of a freshly cleaned glass slide, and the sample on the coverslip was mounted on the glass slide and sealed with dental cement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA-PLM_Imaging_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chromosome samples were placed on the microscope stage and imaged using a high-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TIRF objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before acquiring DNA-PLM images, we used relatively weak 532-nm light (0.3 kWcm2) to illuminate the sample and recorded the conventional fluorescence image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used a 532-nm laser with constant beam fluence of 3 kWcm2 to switch a substantial fraction of DNA molecules to their off states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded images using the EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration time and the frame rate of image acquisition were carefully selected to provide optimal signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless specifically noted, 10,000 frames were recorded for PLM reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imaging of isolated chromosomes and nuclei isolated from HeLa cells, a preexposure using the same laser illumination may be required to reduce the background autofluorescence from residual organic compounds; images were then recorded in the stabilized switching stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal time duration of the preexposure process is highly sample-dependent and should be carefully adjusted according to the imaging conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
