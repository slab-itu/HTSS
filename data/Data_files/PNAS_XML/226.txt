Sustained eruptions on Enceladus explained by turbulent dissipation in tiger stripes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eruptions on the ice moon Enceladus provide access to materials from Enceladus ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions is unclear, and it is also not known what sets the rate of volcanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a simple model in which the erupting fissures are underlain by slots that connect the surface to the ocean can explain the observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, the slots are mostly filled with water, and Saturn tides drive turbulent water flow in the slots whose dissipation produces enough heat to keep slots open.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, long-lived water-filled slots drive a volcano-tectonic feedback that buffers the rate of volcanism to approximately the observed value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the oceansurface connection on Enceladus may be sustained on million-year timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spacecraft observations suggest that the plumes of Saturns moon Enceladus draw water from a subsurface ocean, but the sustainability of conduits linking ocean and surface is not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations show eruptions from tiger stripe fissures that are sustained (although tidally modulated) throughout each orbit, and since the 2005 discovery of the plumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak plume flux lags peak tidal extension by 1 rad, suggestive of resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a model of the tiger stripes as tidally flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain the persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that eruptions are maintained over geological timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delay associated with flushing and refilling of O(1)-m-wide slots with ocean water causes erupted flux to lag tidal forcing and helps to buttress slots against closure, while tidally pumped in-slot flow leads to heating and mechanical disruption that staves off slot freezeout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much narrower and much wider slots cannot be sustained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of long-lived slots, the 106-y average power output of the tiger stripes is buffered by a feedback between ice melt-back and subsidence to O(1010) W, which is similar to observed power output, suggesting long-term stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turbulent dissipation makes testable predictions for the final flybys of Enceladus by Cassini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model shows how open connections to an ocean can be reconciled with, and sustain, long-lived eruptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turbulent dissipation in long-lived slots helps maintain the ocean against freezing, maintains access by future Enceladus missions to ocean materials, and is plausibly the major energy source for tiger stripe activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The erupted flux from Enceladus (blue arrows) varies on diurnal timescales, which we attribute to daily flexing (dashed lines) of the source fissures by Saturn tidal stresses (horizontal arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such flexing would also drive vertical flow in slots underneath the source fissures (vertical black arrow), which through viscous dissipation generates heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heat helps to maintain the slots against freezeout despite strong evaporitic cooling by vapor escaping from the water table (downward-pointing triangle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vapor ultimately provides heat (via condensation) for the envelope of warm surface material bracketing the tiger stripes (orange arrows; IR corresponds to infrared cooling from this warm material).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tidal flexing cycle for interacting slots assuming two inboard (ib) and two outboard (ob) slots, E = 6 GPa, and L = 100 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slot half-width W0 = 1 m, wall roughness k = 0.01 m. Wm is maximum width change, V/V is fractional change in slot water volume, and n is extensional stress to 90% of its own peak amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Turbulent dissipation that can account for the observed power output of Enceladus (red bar; blue bar includes the additional power inferred for reheating of cold ice at depth) can also match the observed phase lag of Enceladus (thick black horizontal line shows phase lag relative to a fiducial model; gray lines show 1 error in observed phase lag).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curves correspond to time-averaged power for (left curve) four slots of equal length of 100 km, and (right curve) 93-km length outboard slots and 151-km length inboard slots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dot color corresponds to the fractional change in aperture (max/min) during the tidal cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each curve, initial (tidal-stressfree) half-width is sampled at 0.125 m (uppermost dots), and then at 0.125-m intervals up to 2 m (lowermost dots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half-widths that best fit both the phase delay and power constraints are 0.3750.625 m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
