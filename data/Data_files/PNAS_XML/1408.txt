Origin of the emergent fragile-to-strong transition in supercooled water  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon cooling, the liquid dynamics generally slow down, with a rate that either keeps constant for a strong liquid or monotonically increases for a fragile one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, water, silica, and some metallic liquids do not obey this general rule and the rate exhibits a maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual phenomenon is known as the fragile-to-strong transition and its origin remains very controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the fragility of water is only apparent and that it originates from a crossover between a high-temperature liquid without locally favored structures and a low-temperature one full of them, both of which have Arrhenius dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its generality, this explanation of dynamic anomalies may be common to any liquids having a tendency to form locally favored structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Liquids can be broadly classified into two categories, fragile and strong ones, depending on how their dynamical properties change with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of a strong liquid obey the Arrhenius law, whereas the fragile one displays a super-Arrhenius law, with a much steeper slowing down upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, however, it was discovered that many materials such as water, oxides, and metals do not obey this simple classification, apparently exhibiting a fragile-to-strong transition far above Tg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a transition is particularly well known for water, and it is now regarded as one of waters most important anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon has been attributed to either an unusual glass transition behavior or the crossing of a Widom line emanating from a liquidliquid critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here by computer simulations of two popular water models and through analyses of experimental data, we show that the emergent fragile-to-strong transition is actually a crossover between two Arrhenius regimes with different activation energies, which can be naturally explained by a two-state description of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding provides insight into the fragile-to-strong transition observed in a wide class of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Waters local structures and their correlations to local density and mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) Typical snapshots of waters local structures for  and S states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted red lines represent H bonds and the solid blue lines show the tetrahedral structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (CF) Different fields for a sample configuration for the TIP5P water at 0.1 MPa and 250 K. All molecules (only oxygen atoms are shown) are colored in red if the field is low or blue if it is high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C)  field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Inverse local density field (6Nfs, where Nfs is the number of first-shell neighbors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) CG field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (F) Inverse mobility field (1rmax(4)), where rmax(4) is the maximum distance one molecule travels during a time period of 4 (4: dynamic heterogeneity time scale) (SI Appendix, sections VI and VII).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CE a simple low-pass filter by performing a rolling time average of each field over 4 is used to remove thermal fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C, D and E, F, 58% and 26% of molecules with a higher field are colored in blue, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(AC) Two-state scenario for the fragile-to-strong transition in TIP5P (A), ST2 (B), and real water (C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (AC, Upper) The reorientational time 2 (in picoseconds) and inverse diffusion coefficient 1/D (in 106sm2) in log scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid curves are fits to the two-state model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (AC, Lower) The curvature K [in units of 160 (kcal/mol)2 for models and 40 (kcal/mol)2 for real water], the rate R (in units of 40 kcal/mol for models and 25 kcal/mol for real water) of ln(D/D0), and the fraction sD of slow water as a function of inverse temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A and B, T and CP maximum lines were taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C, the T maximum line was taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16, black circles are from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17, and red squares are from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see by comparing AC that the width of the dynamic transition is much narrower for water models than for real water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This originates from the fact that these water models, although they capture the essential features of real water, have a much stronger tendency to form locally favored structures than real water, as can be seen in the two-state model parameters listed in SI Appendix, Tables S1S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A and B) Dynamic heterogeneity in TIP5P (A) and ST2 (B) water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both translational (black circles) and rotational (red squares) four-point susceptibilities 4T,R(4) maximize around TsD=12 in the DS band (dark green region), providing strong evidence of the two-state behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stretching parameter  (blue triangle), which is determined by fitting the stretched exponential function to the second Legendre polynomial of the time correlation function of the molecular dipole moment (SI Appendix, section IV), also shows a minimum around TsD=12 in the DS band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations of heat capacity maxima of the two water models are indicated by arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A and B) Breakdown of the StokesEinsteinDebye relation in TIP5P (A) and ST2 (B) water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid and dotted lines represent the two-state and individual fast-water contributions, respectively, indicating that the growth of slow water upon cooling results in the breakdown of the StokesEinsteinDebye relation in supercooled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective hydrodynamic radius a=1.3 Å and 1.2 Å was estimated from the high-temperature data for TIP5P and ST2 water, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Angell plot of experimental liquid diffusivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Waters diffusion slows down rapidly when entering the two-state mixture regime (Tmix+TTmix) from high temperature, showing its apparent fragile nature far above Tg compared to a normal fragile liquid, o-Terphenyl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the Widom line (T max), waters diffusion apparently follows the Arrhenius law (curvature k0), but deviates from the typical strong behavior of SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water shows its inherent strong nature like SiO2 when leaving the two-state mixture regime and entering the slow-water dominant regime (Tless_thanTmix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T maximum line of water was taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16, oxygen diffusivity in SiO2 from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, o-Terphenyl diffusivity from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52 and 53, and water diffusivity from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 and 39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
