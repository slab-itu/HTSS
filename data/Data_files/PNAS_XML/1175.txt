Temperature accelerates the rate fields become forests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition of abandoned fields into forests (secondary succession) has long informed ecologists understanding of community assembly and species interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, rates of secondary succession show a striking latitudinal pattern, with dominance by woody species (50% cover) taking less than a decade in the southern United States, and up to 60 years in New England.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a large-scale experimental network to test how multiple drivers (climate, soils, and the identity of dominant species) influence field-to-forest transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found consistent evidence that climate is the strongest driver of tree establishment, suggesting that temperature limitation of succession in northern latitudes is likely to be reduced under future warming, potentially increasing rates of carbon uptake on abandoned agricultural land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Secondary succession, the postdisturbance transition of herbaceous to woody-dominated ecosystems, occurs faster at lower latitudes with important ramifications for ecosystem processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern could be driven by the direct effect of temperature on tree growth; however, an alternative mechanism is treeherb competition, which may be more intense in more fertile northern soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated soil fertility and herbaceous species composition in identical experiments at six sites spanning the Eastern United States (3043° N) and monitored the growth and survival of four early successional trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tree seedling mass 2 years after sowing was strongly associated with site differences in mean growing season temperature, regardless of species or soil treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of temperature was twofold: seedlings grew faster in response to warmer site temperatures, but also due to the reduction of competitive interference from the herbaceous community, which was inhibited in warmer sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that increasing temperatures will promote a faster transition of fields to forests in temperate ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all tree species, seedling growth and survival were significantly greater in southern sites (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although initial seed germination was driven in part by soil fertility and herbaceous composition, and was substantially lower for hardwoods (SI Appendix, Fig S7 and Table S4), variation in seedling performance was dominated by differences across sites (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survivorship models fit separately by season showed that winter mortality was low overall except for the two southern trees in the three northern sites (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5), suggesting lack of cold tolerance rather than soil or biotic factors as drivers of the northern range limits for these two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, growing season temperature also had the largest positive effect size on summer survival, although of marginal significance (SI Appendix, Table S5) and driven largely by the southern pine, P. taeda (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herbaceous composition and soil fertility were significant, but less influential, drivers of winter and summer survival, including a consistent role of higher survivorship under the more continuous forb canopy of S. altissima, which may have acted as a nurse plant for both cold and drought protection, as indicated by interactions with both site temperature and plot sand content (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total seedling mass per plot is an integrated measure of tree recruitment that incorporates germination, seedling survival, growth rates, and differences across tree species, and was several-fold higher in southern sites after 2 y (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half (45%) of the variation in seedling mass was attributed to site differences; of this variation, nearly all (90%) was explained by growing season temperature (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within-site variation in seedling biomass was related to herbaceous biomass (SI Appendix, Fig S9), which also decreased with site temperature (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the effect size of temperature on seedling biomass was about three times that of herbaceous biomass (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To isolate the direct and indirect effects of climate, soil, and biotic variables on tree seedling growth, we created a Bayesian hierarchical model (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Appendix S1) that distinguished: (i) the effects of climate and experimental treatments on herbaceous communities; (ii) the effects of climate and herbs on available resources [light, soil moisture, and soil nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)]; and (iii) the effects of climate and resources on seedling height increment, which is a strong indicator of the rate of woody dominance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedling growth was driven primarily by warmer growing season temperatures and light, and secondarily by soil moisture and, marginally, N availability (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedling light levels, in turn, were significantly lower in plots of high herbaceous biomass, which was reduced in warmer sites but also influenced by herbaceous composition, soil treatments, and interactions between herbaceous composition and climate (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found other effects of experimental treatments on resource availability, including strong effects of soil treatments on moisture and both N and P availability, but plot- and site-level variation in these resources were minor contributions to seedling growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the light response was common to all species when assessed in species-specific growth models, the temperature effect was driven by the response of the two conifer species that accounted for a large proportion of total seedlings (J. virginiana and P. taeda; SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our hypothesis that tree recruitment during early succession is driven by the composition of herbaceous communities was not supported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast spreading, clonal forb S. altissima did not outperform the more stress tolerant bunchgrasses in fertile plots, nor did it prefer northern sites (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although herbaceous root mass was greater in S. altissima plots compared with bunchgrasses, the lower nutrient levels associated with high herbaceous biomass did not have a strong effect on tree seedling growth in comparison with temperature and light (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decline of herbaceous biomass in warmer sites is consistent with the greater predominance of productive herbaceous meadows in northern landscapes (10), but its stronger response to site climate variables than soil fertility or herb composition (SI Appendix, Fig S10) suggests herbs experienced stress or disturbance unrelated to nutrients, such as water availability or herbivory (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our model does suggest that herbaceous abundance plays a strong role in limiting tree establishment, and that this effect, combined with temperature-related constraints on tree seedling growth, is a primary driver of the persistence of northern old fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What remains unresolved is whether herbaceous communities will respond predictably to climate warming, or whether additional factors, and particularly increased atmospheric CO2, preclude simple predictions of old field compositional change (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our study concerns only the initial stages of secondary succession, it captures the critical period during which tree seedling growth and survival is most likely to be affected by competition with the herbaceous layer, as at the southern locations multiple seedlings had already exceeded the height of the herbaceous canopy after 2 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The faster growth of early successional tree species in warmer sites, even when in competition with potentially fast growing herbaceous perennials, is consistent with a metaanalysis documenting a larger impact of warming experiments on woody species compared with herbs (26), and suggests that even relatively small increases in growing season temperature and duration will accelerate the transition of old fields to forested stands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of further resource limitation from warming (e.g., drought), both longer growing seasons (27, 28) and the temperature dependency of assimilation rate in trees (12) suggest later stages of forest succession in the temperate zone will also accelerate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the results of this and a prior study (23) confirm the widely held view that the northern range limits of many southern trees is determined by cold temperatures (29); to the extent that these species are inherently faster growing (23), further increases in the rate of secondary succession will occur as southern species move northward (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As warm-temperate, early successional conifers, including many species of Pinus, are increasingly dominant in postdisturbance landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere and widely invasive in the Southern (31), it is likely that the temperature-based acceleration of forest development we report here applies globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experimental_Design_and_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2012, we established identical experiments at six locations (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each site contained 72 experimental units consisting of circular, freely draining plastic pools 1.52-m inner diameter and 28-cm soil depth separated by 1-m walkways, placed on top of landscape fabric in full sun and fenced to exclude deer herbivory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a randomized block design, we established six replicates each of 12 treatments, consisting of four soil types crossed with three levels of herbaceous composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four soil types included 100% topsoil and three homogenized mixtures of topsoil and coarse sand (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 topsoil:sand, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transport limitations required the use of locally sourced commercial topsoil and sand for each site, with the result that mean soil pH varied by site, although not with respect to latitude (SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical analyses are described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three types of herbaceous composition included: (i) a grass community of a 1:1 mixture of the bunchgrasses Andropogon virginicus L. and Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nash; (ii) a forb community planted with rhizomes of the common goldenrod S. altissima L. ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  altissima; and (iii) bare control plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added the same mixture of tree seeds to all plots in the experiment, once in October 2013 and once in May 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mix included 2 g dry mass of J. virginiana (approximately 300 seeds), 2 g L. styraciflua (300 seeds), 5 g P. taeda (200 seeds), and 12 g P. serotina (175 seeds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the potential for local adaptation to climatic or edaphic factors in widespread species, we included both northern and southern seed sources for all tree and herbaceous species except the southern endemic P. taeda (Georgia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. altissima and S. scoparium plants were collected in New York and North Carolina, and A. virginicus from Missouri and North Carolina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tree seeds for J. virginiana were collected from Nebraska and Louisiana; L. styraciflua from Missouri and Louisiana; and P. serotina from Pennsylvania and Florida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climates of seed sources were similar to average temperature regimes of our northern and southern experimental locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant effects of tree population provenance in a related previous study (23), using the same provenances and five of the same sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In spring and fall 2014, we counted the number of all germinated seedlings in all plots, and randomly tagged up to 10 seedlings per species per plot for subsequent survival and height measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fall 2014, spring 2015, and fall 2015, we measured the status and height of tagged seedlings and randomly added new living seedlings as needed to maintain a sample size of 10 per species per plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All seedlings were harvested in fall 2015, separated into above- and belowground components, and dried for 48 h at 70 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Covariate_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the start of the experiment in 2012, 25 g of soil was collected from each soil mixture from each site (n = 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These samples were analyzed for organic matter content, pH, and concentrations of P, K, Ca, and Mg. We measured plant-available nutrients in all plots in June/July 2014 with plant root simulator (PRS) ion exchange probes (Western Ag Innovations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herbaceous biomass was sampled at the same time as tree seedling harvest in fall 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated site water balance as the difference between water supply (rainfall) and climatic demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), assuming a negligible soil storage component (32), using daily temperature and rainfall data from 2013 to 2015 obtained from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Climatic Data Center weather stations in close proximity to each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses_of_Tree_Recruitment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed tree seed germination at the plot level in response to experimental treatments (percent sand and herbaceous composition: forbs = 1, grasses = 0) and 2014 climate summaries across sites (mean MayOctober monthly temperature and water balance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed seedling survival at the plot level in two models distinguishing winter (201415) and summer (2015) climate drivers, along with plot-level treatment effects of herbaceous composition (forbs = 1, grasses = 0) and soil fertility (%sand).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two models to examine patterns of total harvested seedling biomass per plot, involving a 336-plot dataset that excluded 96 control plots from four sites (NY2, NJ, GA, and FL) that were not monitored in 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first model examined effects of only the experimental treatments (soil fertility, represented by a percent sand gradient of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%; and a three-category herb composition factor of grass/forb/control) and two climate factors (mean MayOctober daily temperature, and site water balance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second model retained the climate variables but replaced experimental treatments with realized herbaceous biomass (continuous).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the influence of climate, soil, and vegetation variables on resource availability (light, moisture, and nutrients), and the subsequent response of tree seedling growth to variation in these resources, we created a hierarchical model of relationships in a Bayesian framework using JAGS (33) and the R2jags package (34) in R. The model had a three-level structure (Fig 3), including (i) the response of seedling height increment in 2015 to seedling-level photosynthetically active radiation, plot-level soil moisture and nutrients (N and P), and site-level temperature; (ii) the response of light, soil moisture, and nutrients to the herbaceous community, soil treatments, and climate; and (iii) the response of herbaceous community performance (above- and belowground mass) to climate and experimental treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
