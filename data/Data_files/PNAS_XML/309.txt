Temperaturefield phase diagram of extreme magnetoresistance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has been recently discovered in a number of seemingly unrelated materials with diverse crystalline and electronic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we use lanthanum monopnictides, LaBi and LaSb, as simple platforms to reveal a common triangular Temperaturefield phase diagram for XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we show that, in the electronic structure of both materials, lanthanum d orbitals mix with the pnictogen p orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we find that both the triangular phase diagram and the orbital texture exist in all families of semimetals with XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that XMR is a ubiquitous phenomenon with a universal phase diagram that goes beyond certain material specifications; it is not a rare commodity of topological materials or noncentrosymmetric structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent discovery of extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) in LaSb introduced lanthanum monopnictides as a new platform to study this effect in the absence of broken inversion symmetry or protected linear band crossing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we report XMR in LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a comparative study of magnetotransport effects in LaBi and LaSb, we construct a temperaturefield phase diagram with triangular shape that illustrates how a magnetic field tunes the electronic behavior in these materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the triangular phase diagram can be generalized to other topological semimetals with different crystal structures and different chemical compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing our experimental results to band structure calculations, we suggest that XMR in LaBi and LaSb originates from a combination of compensated electronhole pockets and a particular orbital texture on the electron pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such orbital texture is likely to be a generic feature of various topological semimetals, giving rise to their small residual resistivity at zero field and subject to strong scattering induced by a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Temperature_Dependence_of_Resistivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 A and B shows the temperature dependence of resistivity in LaSb and LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At H=9 T (black curves), with decreasing temperature, resistivity decreases initially until a minimum at Tm, then increases until an inflection at Ti where it gradually saturates to a plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B, Inset shows that the resistivity upturn is absent at zero field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is switched on with a small magnetic field Honset =0.4±0.1 T and becomes more prominent as the field increases, promising applications such as low-temperature magnetic switches and sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2C is a plot of /T versus T for LaBi that marks Tm as the temperature where /T changes sign and Ti as the temperature where /T shows a peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing field, Tm increases but Ti remains unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2D is an Arrhenius plot of log() versus T1 for LaBi showing that, in the narrow region between Tm and Ti, resistivity fits to (T)exp(Ea/kBT) where Ea is the activation energy and kB is the Boltzmann constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ea is plotted as a function of field for LaSb and LaBi in Fig 3 C and D. At first, such analysis may suggest a metalinsulator transition (MIT) at Tm, but, as we explain later, this is certainly not the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phase_Diagram  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By plotting Tm and Ti as a function of magnetic field, we construct the temperaturefield phase diagram of XMR in LaSb and LaBi (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both systems, Tm increases with increasing field whereas Ti stays unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded triangle between Tm and Ti marks the region of MR where /Tless_than0 (Fig 2C, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silver area above the triangle (T greater than  Tm) in Fig 3 A and B is the region of metallic conduction where /T greater than 0 with negligible MR which is quadratic in field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gold area below the triangle (Tless_than Ti) is the plateau region where /T0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward the end of the paper, we will show that the triangular phase diagram is universal to all semimetals with XMR (see Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 shows that LaSb and LaBi have comparable Ea but different Tm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If an MIT was responsible for the resistivity upturn, then the smaller Tm in LaBi should have translated to a smaller Ea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evidence against an MIT comes from a comparison of the electronic specific heat in H=0 and in an applied field of H=9 T (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work on another XMR material, WTe2, has also ruled out field-induced MIT at Tm through a scaling analysis and the use of Kohlers rule (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of an MIT, the resistivity upturn at Tm must result from a strong field-induced scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will elaborate on such scattering process after discussing the band structure of LaBi and LaSb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_Dependence_of_Resistivity_and_XMR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 A and B shows MR = 100×[R(H)R(0)]/R(0), as a function of magnetic field from H=0 T to 9 T at several temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black and the yellow curves at T = 2 K and 5 K superimpose because both curves are in the plateau region where MR reaches its extreme limit in excess of 105%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing Fig 4 A and B with the phase diagram Fig 3 A and B shows that MR is small in the conventional metallic region at T greater than Tm, it starts to increase in the region of field-induced scattering at Tiless_thanTless_thanTm, and it reaches the extreme limit in the plateau region at Tless_thanTi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 shows that the magnitude of XMR is sensitive to the residual resistivity ratio (RRR), i.e., to the sample quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quote RRR values for the LaSb and the LaBi samples in Fig 4 A and B to prevent the reader from taking away the wrong conclusion that the XMR in LaSb is smaller than in LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4C is a plot of MR as a function of RRR for several LaSb and LaBi specimens with different RRR values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MR in both materials follows the same quadratic dependence on RRR, showing a comparable XMR in both compounds given comparable sample quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar quadratic dependence of XMR on RRR is reported in the flux-grown WTe2 samples (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ripples in the resistivity at higher fields in Fig 4 A and B are Shubnikovde Haas (SdH) oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purely oscillatory part of resistivity (H) is obtained by subtracting a smooth H2 background from (H) in the range from H=69 T.  is periodic in H1 as seen in Fig 4D, Inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of these data gives a peak at F0=271±5 T in Fig 4D for LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar analysis gives F0=212±5 T for LaSb (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal frequencies for LaSb and LaBi do not match the known frequencies of tin and indium, ruling out flux inclusion (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Angle_Dependence_of_XMR_and_SdH_Oscillations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5 A and B shows the angle dependence of XMR in LaSb and LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of magnetic field H and electrical current I with respect to [100] crystal plane is shown schematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XMR is maximum when HI and minimum when HI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains positive at all angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5 C and D shows that the principal frequency in LaSb and LaBi has the following angle dependence:F=F0cos(n2)[1]where n is an integer,  is the angle, and F0 is the principal frequency at =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such angle dependence describes either a strictly 2D Fermi surface such as TI surface modes (2527) or a quasi-2D bulk state such as the prolate ellipsoidal geometry of the electron pocket in lanthanum monopnictides (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5C shows perfect agreement between our data and prior studies of magnetic oscillations (gray symbols) (23, 24, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Band_Structure_and_the_Orbital_Texture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 6 A and B shows the results of our band structure calculations on LaSb and LaBi with the WIEN2k code using the full relativistic treatment of spinorbit coupling (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both systems, two hole bands at the  point and one electron band near the X point cross the Fermi level EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6 C and D visualize the corresponding Fermi surfaces with the two hole surfaces at the center of the Brillouin zone and the ellipsoidal electron pockets crossing the faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies of quantum oscillations in the magnetic and acoustic channels have mapped these hole and electron Fermi surfaces in both materials in detail (23, 24, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal SdH frequencies that we observe in LaSb (F0=212 T) and LaBi (F0=271 T) match the cross-sectional area of the electron pocket at the X point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We plot Antimony p states as thick bands and lanthanum d states as thin bands in Fig 6 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice the crossing between these bands near the X point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spinorbit coupling opens a small gap as shown in Fig 6 A and B, Insets to form the electron pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orbital character of momentum states changes from d to p as they wind around this electron pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such winding of the orbital quantum number around the electron pocket could translate to a pseudospin that can interact with a magnetic field, giving rise to strong scattering and a large (H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological protection due to band inversion results in a remarkably small residual resistivity, as low as (0)=30 ncm, at H=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is a very large (H)/(0) known as XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar mechanism seems to be responsible for XMR in graphene, where the pseudospin originates from the mixing between valley degrees of freedom instead of orbital degrees of freedom (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effective_Mass_and_Dingle_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the Onsager relation, F=(0/22)Aext and Aext=kF2, we extract the Fermi wave vector and the density of carriers on the ellipsoidal electron pocket from the frequency of SdH oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, 0, Aext, and kF are the quantum of flux, the extremal orbit area, and the Fermi wave vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SdH frequencies and the corresponding values of kF and ne are summarized in Table 1 for LaSb and LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of oscillations damps with increasing temperature and with decreasing magnetic field (Fig 4D) according to=RLRDsin(2FH+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]RL is the LifshitzKosevich factor that captures damping with increasing temperature,RL=Xsinh(X),X=TmH[3]where =22kBme/e is a constant containing Boltzmann factor kB, bare electron mass me, electron charge e, and reduced Plank constant .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, m is the effective electron mass in units of me.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD is the Dingle factor that captures damping with decreasing field,RD=exp(XD),XD=TDmH[4]where TD is the Dingle temperature from which the relaxation rate , the mean free path , and the mobility  of charge carriers can be determined usingkBTD=2,=vF,=em[5]with the Fermi velocity vF=kF/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 7 A and B shows the LifshitzKosevich fit (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) to the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting effective masses are m=0.22me for LaSb and m=0.35me for LaBi, in agreement with calculations and previous works (23, 24, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 C and D shows the Dingle fit (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) to the field dependence of the oscillation amplitude that determines , , and  for the electron pockets in LaSb and LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 summarizes all of the parameters from SdH oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hall_Effect_and_ElectronHole_Compensation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 8 shows the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient RH=xy/H at H=9 T in LaSb (red) and LaBi (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both materials show signatures of electronhole compensation that results in a sign change in LaBi with positive RH above T20 K and negative RH of comparable magnitude below T20 K. LaSb shows a lesser degree of compensation, with a strong negative RH signal below T40 K and a weak positive signal above T40 K that undergoes a second sign change at T170 K. Although LaBi has better compensation, its XMR is typically smaller than LaSb, showing that the degree of compensation does not determine the magnitude of XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key factor in determining the magnitude of XMR is the small residual resistivity that minimizes the denominator in the ratio (H)/(0) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our hypothesis is that the orbital texture of electron Fermi surfaces results in the small (0) due to topological protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also results in the large (H) due to the interference of magnetic field with dp mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronhole compensation is certainly beneficial to XMR, but it only contributes to the large (H), not to the small (0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small (0) is observed in all XMR materials such as WTe2 or Cd3As2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These metals are typically prone to disorder due to their large and complex unit cells, yet they have some of the smallest residual resistivity known to metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of such small 0 (high mobility) is not clear, and it is perhaps the key to understanding the origin of XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 8, Inset shows power law fits of the form =0+AT4 to the resistivity data at low temperatures from which we extract residual resistivity 0=0.1 cm in LaBi and 0=0.6 cm in LaSb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the T=0 limits of RH and 0 from Fig 8, we estimate the Hall mobility from the single-band expression Hall=RH/0=3.2×104 cm2V1s1 in LaSb and Hall=2.5×104 cm2V1s1 in LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-band estimates need to be taken with caution due to the multiband nature of these materials, but, qualitatively, they show extremely high mobility in all XMR materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supporting Information, we show two-band model fits to the field dependence of RH in both materials, from which the mobility and concentration of holes and electrons are extracted (Fig S2 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results in LaSb and LaBi can be summarized as follows: (i) The (T) at zero field shows a nearly perfect metal with very small 0 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The (T) in field shows strong field-induced scattering below Tm and a plateau below Ti (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The field dependence of Tm and Ti constructs a triangular phase diagram (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) The strong field-induced scattering results in XMR that correlates with RRR (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (v) Angle dependence of SdH oscillations fits the ellipsoidal geometry of the electron Fermi surfaces (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (vi) From the band structure, these electron surfaces have a mixed dp orbital texture (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XMR is possibly the consequence of disturbing such orbital texture with a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (vii) The temperature and the field dependence of the Hall Effect fit to a two-band model with near compensation, but the degree of compensation does not justify the magnitude of XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results suggest that XMR in LaSb and LaBi originates from a combination of compensated band structure and a mixed orbital texture on electron pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (T) and (H) profiles of XMR in seemingly different topological semimetals show similar features, with a resistivity minimum at Tm and inflection at Ti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the existing transport data in NbSb2 (15), PtSn4 (16), and WTe2 (12), we extract Tm and Ti, construct their T-H phase diagrams, and compare with the triangular phase diagram of LaBi in Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the triangular phase diagram is universal to all materials with XMR, despite their chemical and structural differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the fundamental energy scales related to Tm and Ti in the universal phase diagram of XMR remains an interesting open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 10 shows another universal feature: The same dp orbital texture exists in the Fermiology of other semimetals with XMR including NbSb2, PtSn4, and WTe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent observations of circular dichroism by ARPES confirm such orbital mixing in WTe2 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 9 unifies the phenomenology of XMR in various semimetals, and Fig 10 links XMR to a combination of electronhole compensation and mixed orbital texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To emphasize the role of orbital texture, we highlight observations of XMR in single-band semimetals such as Cd3As2 and Pb1-xSnxSe that, by definition, cannot be compensated (8, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both systems show large degrees of orbital mixing in their electron pockets that can interact with a magnetic field and result in the XMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extremely small residual resistivity of these systems (0=1 ncm in Cd3As2) despite their intrinsically disordered lattices is consistent with the topological protection proposed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that two recent works have reported XMR in LaBi (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their data are in agreement with ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single crystals of LaBi were grown using Indium flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting elements La:Bi:In = 1:1:20 with purity 99.999% were placed in an alumina crucible inside an evacuated quartz tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was heated to 1,000 °C, slowly cooled to 700 °C, and finally decanted in a centrifuge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar procedure was used to grow single crystals of LaSb from tin flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on each sample confirmed a 1:1 ratio of lanthanum to pnictogen with ±1% error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder X-ray diffraction for both systems are presented in Supporting Information and Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistivity measurements were performed in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System using a standard four-probe method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hall voltages were measured with transverse contacts in negative and positive fields, with the data antisymmetrized to calculate the transverse resistivity xy and the Hall coefficient RH=xy/H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LaSb single crystal had residual resistivity 0=0.6 cm and RRR =(300K)/0= 170.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LaBi crystal had 0=0.1 cm and RRR = 610.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Low-Temperature_Heat_Capacity_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rule out an MIT at Tm, we measured the heat capacity of LaSb down to 0.5 K in a Helium 3 fridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C/TN(EF)T2, where N(EF) is the density of states at the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1 shows no difference between C/T as a function of T2 at H = 0 and at H = 9 T; therefore, the magnetic field does not change the density of states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rules out the opening of a field-induced gap that would result in a significant drop in N(EF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Band_Model_Fit_to_Hall_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S2 shows the temperature and field dependence of RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 A and B restates the temperature dependence of RH and resistivity as given in Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 C and D shows the field dependence of xy with fits to the two-band model according toxy=B|e|(npp2nee2)+(npne)(pe)2B2(npp+nee)2+(npne)2(pe)2B2xx=1|e|(npp+nee)+(npe+nep)(pe)B2(npp+nee)2+(npne)2(pe)2B2.We forced the fit to capture both xy and xy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting values for electron and hole concentration and mobility are given in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the parameters from the fit could differ from the more accurate results we report in Table 1 from quantum oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, in fact, three bands in LaSb and LaBi, so the fit may not be completely accurate, but it certainly shows that (i) both systems are fairly compensated and (ii) compensation is better in LaBi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, XMR does not rely on the degree of compensation as discussed in the main text (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It mainly relies on how small (0) is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
