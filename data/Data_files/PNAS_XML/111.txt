Gut bacteria mediate aggregation in the German cockroach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is great interest in elucidating the diverse roles of microbes in biology, in general and, specifically, in mediating animal communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the gut bacterial community plays a pivotal role in production of aggregation pheromones in the German cockroach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feces of normal and gut bacteria-inoculated cockroaches emits highly attractive volatile carboxylic acids (VCAs) that elicit aggregation whereas bacteria-free feces contains few VCAs and is relatively unattractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VCAs may reflect the gut microbiota and, in turn, the cockroach's local environment, explaining why divergent chemical structures have been proposed as aggregation pheromones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new insight emphasizes the importance of gut microbes in insectinsect communication and highlights the plasticity of the chemistry and function of fecal aggregation pheromones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aggregation of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is regulated by fecal aggregation agents (pheromones), including volatile carboxylic acids (VCAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the gut microbial community contributes to production of these semiochemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical analysis of the fecal extract of B. germanica revealed 40 VCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feces from axenic cockroaches (no microorganisms in the alimentary tract) lacked 12 major fecal VCAs, and 24 of the remaining compounds were represented at extremely low amounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olfactory and aggregation bioassays demonstrated that nymphs strongly preferred the extract of control feces over the fecal extract of axenic cockroaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, nymphs preferred a synthetic blend of 6 fecal VCAs over a solvent control or a previously identified VCA blend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether gut bacteria contribute to the production of fecal aggregation agents, fecal aerobic bacteria were cultured, isolated, and identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inoculation of axenic cockroaches with individual bacterial taxa significantly rescued the aggregation response to the fecal extract, and inoculation with a mix of six bacterial isolates was more effective than with single isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that the commensal gut microbiota contributes to production of VCAs that act as fecal aggregation agents and that cockroaches discriminate among the complex odors that emanate from a diverse microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the pivotal role of gut bacteria in mediating insectinsect communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, because the gut microbial community reflects the local environment, local plasticity in fecal aggregation pheromones enables colony-specific odors and fidelity to persistent aggregation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Environmental_Microbes_Contribute_to_Feces-Associated_Aggregation_Agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used first and fifth instar nymphs in behavioral assays because they are highly motivated to aggregate during the photophase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First instar nymphs sheltered equally under two water-treated filter papers in a Petri dish, but these stimuli failed to elicit upwind orientation in older nymphs in an olfactometer (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both young and older nymphs were significantly attracted to, and arrested in a dose-dependent manner by, extracts of adult female feces and in orientation assays that required walking toward the stimulus and choosing between it and sterile water (solvent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water extracts of feces stimulated significantly more fifth instar nymphs to walk upwind and to prefer the extract over the sterile water (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the aggregation response was influenced by bacteria associated with feces, we generated sterile and control (nonsterile) feces (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Egg cases were (i) surface-sterilized and maintained under axenic conditions with sterilized cockroach feces, food, and water (axenic group) or (ii) maintained with nonsterile feces and food and water (control group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sterilization procedure eliminated environmental bacteria but not vertically transmitted endosymbiotic (intracellular) bacteria in the fat body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second procedure, cockroaches could ingest environmental bacteria, including the fecal bacteria excreted by their colony members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both groups reached the adult stage approximately at the same time, it seemed that environmentally acquired microbes did not contribute significantly to cockroach nutrition and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two-choice sheltering assays, first instar nymphs sheltered under extracts of control feces (CF) and axenic feces (AF) more than in shelters treated with sterile water (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when given a choice between the control and axenic feces, they significantly preferred the extract of control feces (Fig 2 A and B), and they responded to this extract faster than to the axenic feces (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth instar nymphs also preferred the control over the axenic feces in olfactometer tests (Fig 2C), and odors of control feces stimulated significantly more nymphs to respond than odors emanating from axenic feces (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that attractants and arrestants that mediate aggregation in the German cockroach are associated with fecal microbes and that the feces of axenically reared cockroaches is much less attractive than feces of cockroaches with an active gut microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VCAs_in_Feces_Act_as_Aggregation_Agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore candidate compounds in feces that mediate aggregation behavior, we analyzed VCAs by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and GC-MS. VCAs have been suggested as aggregation pheromones in the German cockroach (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 and 32), but results have been disparate and inconclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 40 VCAs identified in control nonsterile feces, 31 were found in lower amounts ( greater than twofold difference) or were not detected at all in the axenic group; 15 of these compounds occurred at  greater than 20-fold higher amounts in nonsterile feces (Fig 3 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only three related compounds, decanoic acid, 4-methoxybenzoic acid, and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid, were found in considerably larger amounts in sterile feces (less_thanonefold difference) (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conjectured that the most underrepresented VCAs in axenic feces contribute most as aggregation agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A blend of six major compounds (Tables S2 and S3 and Fig 3), designated Mix-NCSU, was significantly preferred over the solvent vehicle control and increased the number of nymphs that responded in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also prepared Mix-G, a previously reported effective blend of six fecal VCAs (32) (Tables S2 and S3 and Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, three of these compounds were not detected in our control group, heptanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid occurred in low amounts, and only 3-phenylpropanoic acid was well represented in both blends (Tables S2 and S3 and Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the highest dose (10 µg) Mix-G stimulated nymphs to walk upwind in the olfactometer, but they had no preference for this blend at any dose (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a direct comparison of the two six-compound blends, 100% of the nymphs responded with a significant preference for Mix-NCSU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inoculation_of_Axenic_Feces_with_Bacterial_Isolates_from_Control_Feces_Rescues_the_Aggregation_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because fecal VCAs are common metabolites of gut microbial communities (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38 and 39), we hypothesized that bacterial inoculation of sterile feces would rescue the aggregation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria from feces of the control colony were cultured and identified by PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although aerobic bacteria were found in the control feces, none were detected in the feces of the axenic cockroaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of bacteria (cfu per mg) was 7.87 ± 0.38 × 106 on trypticase soy agar (TSA), 2.56 ± 0.21 × 103 on MacConkey agar (MAC), and 5.15 ± 0.17 × 106 on modified Enterococcus agar (mENT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected six bacterial species in four genera (Enterococcus, Weissella, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter), all of which represent environmental and commensal bacteria (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the bacterial community was dominated by Enterococcus avium, and no typical enteric bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low cfu count on MacConkey agar represented Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two-choice olfactometer assays, 90% of the nymphs were stimulated to walk upwind, and they significantly preferred the control nonsterile feces extracts (CF) over the fecal extracts of cockroaches inoculated with a mix of six bacterial isolates (In-Mix6) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mix, however, effectively rescued the aggregation response in comparison with the extract from axenic feces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, the In-Mix6 feces was preferred by nymphs over the single inoculates, including In-1 (E. avium) and In-2 (Weissella cibaria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feces containing E. avium was more attractive to nymphs than feces containing W. cibaria (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in no-choice olfactometer bioassays, the highest responses were to the control feces, and the lowest to the axenic feces (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three bacterial inoculations significantly increased the numbers of responding nymphs, but not to the level of response to the control feces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that various bacterial species contribute to the production of fecal aggregation agents, but multiple species in the gut additively or synergistically contribute to the potency of cockroach aggregation agents under natural conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VCAs_Act_as_Fecal_Aggregation_Agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The excreta of animals contain blends of species-typical compounds (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40 and 41) and compounds that reflect the health (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42), habitat, and diet (1, 43, 44) of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsets of these chemicals can serve as conspecific signals demarcating territories (16) or as aggregation signals, as observed in bark beetles (45), locusts (37), bed bugs (46), firebrats (47), and cockroaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All life stages of the German cockroach are attracted to conspecific feces, and various chemical constituents of feces have been implicated as aggregation pheromones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrated that fecal VCAs act as cockroach aggregation pheromones and that many of the bioactive VCAs are likely of microbial origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Various VCAs have been considered cockroach semiochemicals in several contexts, including as aggregation agents (31, 32), repellents (35), necromones (48), and food attractants (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broad disparities among studies as to which chemicals guide aggregation behavior in cockroaches suggest that aggregation agents likely operate differently from sex pheromones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species specificity is encoded in sex pheromones by chemical components and their overall blend ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cockroach fecal VCAs that serve as aggregation agents, on the other hand, seem much less species-specific (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50), and variation in their quality and quantity may depend to a large extent on environmental factors such as food quality, ingested microbes, and the cockroach strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, some VCAs were found in relatively large quantities in our investigation (e.g., butanedioic acid) but were not detected in other studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, some carboxylic acids [e.g., 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid)] were previously described as prominent aggregation agents (51) but were not detected in our GC-MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In support of the idea that the composition of aggregation signals is plastic was the observation that synthetic blends consisting of equal amounts of VCAs (i.e., Mix-NCSU and Mix-G) elicited aggregation activity in cockroaches regardless of the blend ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, cockroaches in our assays preferred a mix of six VCAs that reflected abundant compounds in their own colony feces over six VCAs (Mix-G) reported from another cockroach colony (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it still remains unclear whether the variation in VCAs indicates that VCAs act as pheromones with intraspecific variation or as signature mixtures, as in ant colony odors (16), these results strongly suggest that the fecal VCAs act not only as aggregation agents, but also as a means for cockroaches to discriminate their own colony from other colonies that emit unfamiliar VCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gut_Bacterial_Community_Influences_Fecal_VCA_Profiles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that VCA emissions are related to the gut/feces microbiota and that across-colony variation in VCA profiles could be the result of differences in environmentally acquired gut microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because elimination of horizontally acquired gut microbes did not affect the period of nymphal development, these microbes do not seem to have major short-term effects on nutrition or performance (the sterilization procedure did not eliminate vertically transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, elimination of gut microbes dramatically diminished the attractiveness of their feces in aggregation bioassays, and the feces of axenically reared cockroaches had much lower amounts of VCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, inoculation of axenic cockroaches with bacteria isolated from cockroach feces rescued the attractiveness of feces in aggregation bioassays, and this response intensified with the complexity of the bacterial inoculate: A mix of six bacterial isolates was significantly more attractive than single species inoculates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cockroach feces likely contains other bacteria that did not grow aerobically and on TSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation reflects the fact that fresh cockroach feces stimulated aggregation significantly more than fresh axenic feces inoculated with the mixture of six bacterial isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At least three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms could function in the bacteria-dependent production of VCAs: Commensal bacteria may stimulate the cockroach to produce VCAs, they may function within a consortium of other microorganisms that produce VCAs, or the gut bacteria unaided produce the VCAs either before or after feces is excreted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These diverse mechanisms of semiochemical production have not been uncoupled in insects (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some bacteria (e.g., Pantoea agglomerans and other Enterobacteriaceae) have been shown to produce guaiacol as an aggregation pheromone component of the locust Schistocerca gregaria (37), and metabolites associated with Enterobacter cloacae and the fungus Mycotypha microspora stimulate aggregation behavior in the firebrat Thermobia domestica (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cockroach feces contains highly volatile constituents yet it remains attractive to nymphs long after it is excreted, it is likely that bacteria in feces continue to produce VCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial isolates tested in our study, including E. avium, W. cibaria, Pseudomonas sp., and Acinetobacter sp., are tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions and would be capable of continued metabolism in the excreted feces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolates that we tested individually, E. avium and W. cibaria, have fermentative metabolism and are capable of producing various VCAs (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest that the VCAs that serve as aggregation agents in the German cockroach are not endogenously produced by the cockroach but rather are produced by commensal gut bacteria obtained from the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, the gut microbiota of the German cockroach has been characterized (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The embryo contained only vertically transmitted maternal Blattabacterium (Bacteroidetes) endosymbionts and no gut bacteria, but diverse environmental bacteria colonized the gut of first instar nymphs and the bacterial load increased 100-fold in the second instar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial community remained largely stable through the rest of nymphal development and in the adult male although gradual changes in the microbial diversity resulted in significant differences between nymphs and adult males (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with our results and extensive evidence of coprophagy, especially in neonates (24), the German cockroach most likely acquires bacteria through its diet and by ingesting conspecific feces in aggregations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The omnivorous and coprophagous habits of cockroaches are expected to generate highly variable gut microbiomes that emit highly variable blends of fecal VCAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within aggregations, however, it is possible that coprophagy promotes a preference for VCAs produced by the local gut bacterial community and thus may drive preference and fidelity to specific aggregation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not surprising, therefore, that nymphs in our study were attracted more to VCAs from their own colony (Mix-NCSU) than to VCAs that had been reported as aggregation agents in another colony (Mix-G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in odor preference suggests that nymphs may discriminate familiar from unfamiliar odors, as do members of social insect colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Information_Content_of_Aggregation_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aggregation stimuli guide the accumulation and persistence of individuals at a fixed location, and semiochemicals that influence aggregation can operate differently in different ecological and evolutionary contexts (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregation signals are pheromonal in nature and mediate communication between proper signalers and proper responders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregation cues, on the other hand, may be used by conspecifics to eavesdrop on inadvertently emitted cues for their own benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gregarious and social insects, for example ants, use both aggregation cues (e.g., colony odor, signature mixtures) and signals (e.g., queen pheromones) in different contexts (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that cockroach fecal VCA profiles act as highly variable signature mixtures because they are produced by a locally determined and highly variable gut microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability of a signature mixture is in stark contrast to the much less variable species-specific pheromones, such as queen pheromones in ants and sex pheromones in moths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VCAs might provide the German cockroach with explicit information about the physiological status of the colony (health, infections, demography) and environmental conditions, such as population density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, when these emissions are associated with feces, they can convey information about food quality and the associated microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young nymphs are especially dependent on such information because they need to colonize their gut with beneficial microbes and they are more susceptible to abiotic and biotic hazards, such as desiccation and predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study tested only a mixture of six VCAs selected by their relative representation in normal and axenically produced feces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the axenically produced feces did not completely lose its attractiveness to first instar nymphs in aggregation bioassays (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibilities that some VCAs are produced by the cockroach itself or by nonbacterial gut microbes that were not eliminated by our sterilization procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other fecal components, such as by-products of nitrogen metabolism, have been suggested as aggregation pheromones (33), and it is possible that ammonia and related compounds convey reliable information about nitrogen availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins are a limited resource for cockroaches, and this lineage of insects evolved diverse and highly efficient strategies to acquire, preserve, and recycle nitrogen (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the gut microbiota likely play prominent roles in producing and emitting these cues as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define the function of fecal VCAs and the contribution of the gut microbial community, future work will need to determine whether the six VCAs of Mix-NCSU are necessary and sufficient and in what ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative studies of fecal VCAs of cockroach colonies with different gut microbiota will reveal whether fecal odors mediate colony and site recognition and fidelity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Insects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A laboratory strain of B. germanica (Orlando Normal, collected in a Florida apartment  greater than 60 y ago; American Cyanamid) was reared on water and food pellets (Purina No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5001 Rodent Diet; PMI Nutrition International) at 27 ± 1 °C, 4070% relative humidity, and light:dark = 12:12 photoperiod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fecal_Materials_from_Control_and_Axenic_Cockroaches  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the control groups of cockroaches, three egg cases (each containing about 40 eggs) were separated, and the nymphs that emerged received 100 mg of feces from the original colony, in addition to food and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the axenic groups of cockroaches, the surface of three egg cases was sterilized with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min and 70% (vol/vol) ethanol for 1 min and then rinsed three times with sterile water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nymphs that emerged were reared on sterile (autoclaved) food, water, and 100 mg of autoclaved feces in sterilized cages with double filters to prevent contamination from air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the axenic bacteria-inoculated groups, axenically reared first instars were exposed to sterile food inoculated with individual or a mix of bacterial isolates in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three inoculated groups were prepared using six bacterial isolates from the original colony (Table S4): A mix of six isolates (In-Mix6), E. avium (In-1) and W. cibaria (In-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculated nymphs were reared under axenic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feces from each colony was aseptically collected within 4 d of emergence of the first adult females and mixed in sterile water for species identification, cfu determinations, GC-MS analysis, and behavioral tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ten milligrams of feces were homogenized in 10 mL of PBS, serially diluted, and spread-plated in triplicate on trypticase soy agar (TSA), MacConkey agar (MAC), and modified Enterococcus agar (mENT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSA was incubated in 26 °C for 72 h, MAC in 37 °C for 24 h, and mENT in 37 °C for 48 h. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted and calculated per mg of fresh feces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically different colonies were isolated on TSA and identified by amplification and sequencing of 800 bp of the 16S rRNA gene with universal eubacterial primers 8F (5-AGAGTTTGATCC TGGCTCAG-3) and 806R (5- CTACCAGGGTATCTAAT-3) following standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were manually edited in CodonCode Aligner (version 1.3.4) (CodonCode Corporation) and identified by a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search of the GenBank database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Chemical_Analysis_of_VCAs_in_Control_and_Axenic_Feces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the determination of VCAs, diethyl ether solutions of axenic and control feces were individually prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feces (100 mg each) was soaked in 1 mL of diethyl ether for 1 h in a 2-mL glass vial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yellow supernatants were decanted into new vials, and the diethyl ether solutions were extracted with a 5% NaOH aqueous solution and shaken vigorously (3× 1 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water layers were separated and combined, and the NaOH aqueous solutions were then acidified to pH 1 with 2 M HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acidified solutions were extracted with diethyl ether (3× 1 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined diethyl ether solutions were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to 100 µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the diethyl ether extracts of the axenic and control feces was further divided into two equal samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first sample (50 µL) was analyzed directly as free acids (peaks 112), and the second sample (50 µL) was derivatized with 10 drops of diazomethane and analyzed as methyl esters (peaks 1340).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative analysis was conducted by GC-FID (5890; Hewlett Packard), and qualitative analysis was conducted by GC coupled with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector using the same DB-WAXetr columns (J&W Scientific Inc.) (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness; temperature programmed at 50 °C for 2 min, then to 250 °C at 25 °C/min and held for 15 min) in splitless mode with hydrogen (FID) or helium (MS) as carrier gas and linear velocity of 36 cm/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 70-eV electron beam was used for MS sample ionization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectra and retention times were compared with authentic carboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Choice_and_No-Choice_Olfactometer_Bioassays_with_Fifth_Instar_Nymphs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
xEach olfactometer consisted of a Plexiglas tube (54.5 cm long, 3.2 cm i.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with a 15-cm-long divider sealed vertically in the upwind end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tube cage (15 cm long, 3.2 cm i.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with a swivel metal screen gate was used to introduce a single nymph into the downwind end of the olfactometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each olfactometer was connected to a vacuum pump that provided a linear air velocity of 25 cm/s through the tube; the tubes were exhausted outside the building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent lights covered with red photographic safety filters placed 60 cm below and above the olfactometers facilitated observation in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single fifth instar nymph was allowed to acclimate to the airflow for 5 min, and only quiescent insects were used in the assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filter papers (FP1 and FP2, 1 × 3 cm) were impregnated with 20 L of solvent or test sample and placed in the upwind end of the olfactometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the two treatments were randomly switched between the left and right sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a nymph was quiescent, the gate was opened carefully, filter paper stimuli were introduced at the upwind end of the olfactometer, and the nymphs response was noted by visual observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive response was scored when the insect approached the filter paper within 3 min and remained on the filter paper for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A preference index was calculated for fifth instars using the same approach as for the first instar aggregation index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses to FP1 and FP2 were compared by 2 test (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same apparatus was used in no-choice assays, but with only one stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
