Stability of Ar(H2)2 to 358 GPa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pressure-induced metallization of solid hydrogen is a problem of certain prominence in high-pressure physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is extremely challenging to be achieved experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was proposed that chemical precompression (introducing impurity atoms or molecules into hydrogen) may facilitate metallization under pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we selected Ar(H2)2 as a model system and explored the intermolecular interactions of H2 molecules and the metallization of hydrogen in the presence of a weakly bound impurity (Ar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining our experimental data and theoretical calculations, we found that Ar does not facilitate the molecular dissociation and bandgap closure of H2, moreover it works in the opposite direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides a solid basis for future searches of hydrogen-rich materials which facilitate metallization of hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemical precompression through introducing impurity atoms into hydrogen has been proposed as a method to facilitate metallization of hydrogen under external pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we selected Ar(H2)2, a hydrogen-rich compound with molecular hydrogen, to explore the effect of doping on the intermolecular interaction of H2 molecules and metallization at ultrahigh pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ar(H2)2 was studied experimentally by synchrotron X-ray diffraction to 265 GPa, by Raman and optical absorption spectroscopy to 358 GPa, and theoretically using the density-functional theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements of the optical bandgap and the vibron frequency show that Ar(H2)2 retains 2-eV bandgap and H2 molecular units up to 358 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is attributed to reduced intermolecular interactions between H2 molecules in Ar(H2)2 compared with that in solid H2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A splitting of the molecular vibron mode above 216 GPa suggests an orientational ordering transition, which is not accompanied by a change in lattice symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental and theoretical equations of state of Ar(H2)2 provide direct insight into the structure and bonding of this hydrogen-rich system, suggesting a negative chemical pressure on H2 molecules brought about by doping of Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A gas mixture of Ar and H2 with a volume ratio of 1:3 and purity 99.9% was compressed to 0.17 GPa and loaded into DACs for measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XRD experiments were conducted at beamline 13-IDD of GeoSoilEnviroCARS (GSECARS) and beamline 16-IDB of High Pressure Collaborative Access Team (HPCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressures were measured using the gold standard (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XRD data were recorded using Mar165 CCD detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman and optical absorption measurements were conducted using confocal micro-Raman systems at High Pressure Synergetic Consortium at the Advanced Photon Source (HPSynC) (659.5 nm) and HPCAT (532.1 nm) with the backscattering geometry and CCD cameras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressures were measured using the diamond Raman edge (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT-based calculations with PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchangecorrelation functional were performed under generalized gradient approximation (44, 45) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plane-wave cutoff of 700 eV was used in our calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations of PDOS and charge analysis were performed using the SIESTA (47) and Gaussian 09 programs (48), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
