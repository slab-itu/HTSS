A versatile nanobody-based toolkit to analyze retrograde transport from the cell surface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retrograde transport from the cell surface to intracellular compartments is essential for homeostasis and cell physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed derivatized nanobodies to follow proteins from the cell surface to endosomes and the trans-Golgi network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobodies are an emerging class of protein binders with many advantages over conventional antibodies: they are small and noncross-linking, and can be produced in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a nanobody against GFP, our tool is widely applicable to any GFP-tagged protein of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It allows the quantitative analysis of endocytic and retrograde transport biochemically, by fixed- and live-cell imaging and by electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proof-of-principle, we applied them to determine the contribution of adaptor protein-1/clathrin in retrograde transport of the mannose-6-phosphate receptors to the trans-Golgi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retrograde transport of membranes and proteins from the cell surface to the Golgi and beyond is essential to maintain homeostasis, compartment identity, and physiological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study retrograde traffic biochemically, by live-cell imaging or by electron microscopy, we engineered functionalized anti-GFP nanobodies (camelid VHH antibody domains) to be bacterially expressed and purified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosine sulfation consensus sequences were fused to the nanobody for biochemical detection of trans-Golgi arrival, fluorophores for fluorescence microscopy and live imaging, and APEX2 (ascorbate peroxidase 2) for electron microscopy and compartment ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These functionalized nanobodies are specifically captured by GFP-modified reporter proteins at the cell surface and transported piggyback to the reporters homing compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an application of this tool, we have used it to determine the contribution of adaptor protein-1/clathrin in retrograde transport kinetics of the mannose-6-phosphate receptors from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments establish functionalized nanobodies as a powerful tool to demonstrate and quantify retrograde transport pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Functionalized_Nanobodies_to_Track_GFP-Tagged_Receptors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate retrograde transport from the plasma membrane, we took advantage of the anti-GFP nanobody VHHGFP, a camelid single-chain antibody specifically recognizing folded GFP in a 1:1 stoichiometry with nanomolar affinity (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nanobody can bind any protein of interest with an extracellular GFP or related fluorescent protein tag (such as YFP and mCerulean, but not mCherry or RFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 1A, the VHH domain was fused in its standard derivatized form (VHH-std) to a T7 and an HA epitope tag for subsequent detection by specific antibodies, to a carboxyterminal hexahistidine-tag for purification, and a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) sequence for biotinylation and high-affinity avidin pull-down experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional variants were generated with one or two tyrosine-sulfation (TS) sequences of rat cholesystokinin precursor (VHH-1xTS and VHH-2xTS) to be potentially sulfated in the TGN, with mCherry (VHH-mCherry) to directly visualize the nanobody, or with a modified soybean ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 (VHH-APEX2) for ultrastructural visualization by cytochemical staining and compartment ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These constructs were expressed in bacteria also producing the biotin ligase BirA in the presence of excess biotin and purified by Ni-NTA (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate) chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were all isolated at high yield (2030 mg/L) and high purity (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only VHH-mCherry showed minimal clipping between the VHH and the mCherry domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were all efficiently detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA, anti-His6, and anti-T7 antibodies, as well as with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylation was indeed complete, because the nanobodies from a 1:1 mixture with BSA were fully recovered by streptavidin-agarose (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test our nanobody toolkit for retrograde transport studies, we prepared stable HeLa cell lines expressing either cytosolic EGFP as a negative control or EGFP-tagged surface proteins with different intracellular itineraries: the TfR, cycling between the plasma membrane and early (sorting and recycling) endosomes; TGN46, between the plasma membrane and the TGN via early endosomes; and the MPRs, between the TGN, plasma membrane, and early and late endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP was fused to the extracellular end of each protein (i.e., between the signal peptide and the receptor sequence of CDMPR, CIMPR, and TGN46) and to the carboxyterminus of the TfR, leaving the cytoplasmic domains containing all known sorting signals unobstructed (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CIMPR, the very large extracellular domain was truncated in the same way that was previously shown to retain normal trafficking behavior (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stable cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction followed by FACS of homogeneous cell pools of moderate and comparable expression levels (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only EGFP-CDMPR appeared as a double band on immunoblots (as is also the case for the endogenous receptor) (35), indicating heterogeneous glycosylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare the steady-state distribution of the EGFP fusion proteins and expression levels with those of the endogenous counterparts, stably expressing cells of each kind were mixed with parental HeLa cells and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same distribution was observed for the EGFP signal as for the immunostaining of the endogenous proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, CDMPR, CIMPR, and their EGFP fusions were predominantly found in the perinuclear region reflecting their TGN and late endosome localization and additionally in peripheral endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP-tagged and endogenous TGN46 localized almost exclusively to the perinuclear region of the TGN, whereas the TfR proteins showed the typical early endosome pattern of peripheral sorting and perinuclear recycling endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the antibodies recognized both forms of each protein except in the case of CIMPR, the staining was not visibly stronger in cells expressing both forms, indicating that the fusion proteins were not strongly overexpressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Kinetic_Analysis_of_Internalization_and_Recycling_of_EGFP-Reporters_Using_Nanobodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon incubation of standard or mCherry-containing nanobodies for 1 h at 37 °C with HeLa cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins, considerable amounts of nanobodies were found associated with the cells (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no signal was observed with cells expressing cytosolic EGFP, indicating that there is negligible nonspecific binding or uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because nanobodies were detected by fluorescence microscopy closely colocalizing with the respective reporter protein (Fig 2A), they were indeed internalized by the EGFP-tagged surface proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To biochemically measure the kinetics of nanobody binding and uptake, 0.1 µM VHH-std was added to the HeLa cell lines in full medium at 37 °C for different times before washing the cells with cold buffer, lysis, and immunoblot analysis (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobody uptake showed reporter-specific kinetics to steady state with TfR-EGFP displaying the fastest, with an apparent half-life of 13 min and reaching saturation at 20 min, consistent with previous measurements using iodinated or fluorescently labeled Tf (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36 and 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP-CDMPR and -CIMPR showed slower uptake with apparent t1/2 of 810 min and saturation after 4045 min, in agreement with their distribution to more distant compartments in the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slowest uptake with apparent t1/2 of 2530 min and saturation after more than 60 min was measured for EGFP-TGN46, which is most strongly localized to the TGN and least to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To biochemically distinguish between intracellular and surface-bound nanobodies, we produced VHH-tev, a derivative of the standard nanobody with an additional cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease inserted between the VHH domain and the HA-BAP-His6 tags (SI Appendix, Fig S1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h of VHH-tev uptake by TfR-EGFP, 15% of cell-associated nanobody was sensitive to TEV protease (purified as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein) at 4 °C on the surface (SI Appendix, Fig S1D), in agreement with the established steady-state distribution to the TfR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, nanobody binding at 4 °C to cells expressing TfR-EGFP at 4 °C amounted to 15% of the steady-state value, all of which was sensitive to subsequent protease incubation (SI Appendix, Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VHH-tev can also be used to monitor the kinetics of nanobody-bound reporter proteins recycling back to the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After VHH-tev uptake by EGFP-CDMPR or TfR-EGFP for 1 h, cells were quickly washed and incubated further at 37 °C with TEV protease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probing for cell-associated nanobodies by anti-HA immunoblot analysis showed their uptake kinetics as before, followed by the inverse loss of the signal due to protease cleavage upon their reappearance at the cell surface (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent half-lives of 12 min and 5 min for recycling of nanobodies by EGFP-CDMPR and TfR-EGFP, respectively, are slightly higher than the corresponding half-lives of uptake of 10 min and 3 min, most likely because TEV cleavage is slower than nanobody binding at the chosen protease concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Live-Cell_Imaging_of_VHH-mCherry_Uptake  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using mCherry-tagged nanobodies, retrograde transport of EGFP-tagged reporter proteins can also be monitored by live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we used as examples cells expressing EGFP-CDMPR and TfR-EGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were imaged over time with an inverted widefield fluorescent microscope upon addition of VHH-mCherry to the medium (Movies S1 and S2, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still images at various time points are shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uptake was quantified by measuring the signal in the mCherry channel, subtracting the autofluorescence background, and normalization to the EGFP signal to eliminate fluctuations due to the movement of labeled compartments or small shifts in the focal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence of VHH-mCherry in the medium at 25 nM was negligible and did not interfere with the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of transport of the reporters from the cell surface to their intracellular compartments, to the steady-state distribution, yielded the same kinetic results as the biochemical experiments shown in Fig 2, with apparent half-lives of uptake of 9 min for EGFP-CDMPR and 4 min for TfR-EGFP, and saturation after 43 min and 20 min, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, kinetics of transport into subcellular regions of interest, such as the perinuclear region of highest concentration of MPRs, can also be analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the perinuclear region contains not only Golgi/TGN, but is also enriched in late endosomes and recycling endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetics of nanobody uptake into the perinuclear region is not sufficiently specific to analyze retrograde transport to a defined organelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrastructural or functional analysis would be required for this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Retrograde_Transport_by_Peroxidase_Labeling_Using_APEX2-Nanobodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frequently, EM will be required to morphologically identify the compartments to which nanobodies are transported from the cell surface by a protein of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is an anti-myc antibody we successfully used before for immunogold EM (38), we constructed and produced VHH-myc, a version of VHH-std with an additional myc epitope (SI Appendix, Fig S2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells expressing TfR-EGFP loaded to steady state with VHH-myc were prepared for immunogold EM using anti-GFP and anti-myc antibodies with secondary antibodies coupled to 20- and 10-nm colloidal gold, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endosomal compartments positive for both markers could be detected in this manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An alternative to immunogold staining with potentially higher sensitivity is peroxidase-mediated compartment labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRP was frequently used for this in the past coupled to antibodies or receptor ligands (e.g., Tf-HRP) (39) and internalized by their target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peroxidase catalyzes H2O2-dependent polymerization of diaminobenzidine (DAB) into local precipitates that recruit osmium tetroxide for EM contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our purpose, we took advantage of the improved soybean ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 (40), which, unlike HRP, is relatively small and monomeric and lacks disulfide bonds and calcium binding sites, allowing the protein to be expressed in the reducing and low-calcium environment of the bacterial cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VHH-APEX2 nanobodies were produced in bacteria and purified (Fig 1 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon incubation with the EGFP-reporter cell lines for 1 h at 37 °C, they were internalized and colocalized with EGFP fusion proteins (SI Appendix, Fig S3) just like the other nanobodies (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VHH-APEX2 incubated with control HeLa cells did not produce staining upon DAB/H2O2 incubation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon internalization by TfR-EGFP, however, DAB precipitations were found in peripheral endosomal compartments, vesicles, and plasma membrane invaginations (Fig 4E), similar to what had been observed before with Tf-HRP (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VHH-APEX2 imported by EGFP-CDMPR, -CIMPR, and -TGN46 in addition stained the TGN (i.e., tubulo-vesicular structures next to the Golgi) (Fig 4 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APEX2 nanobody thus can be used to morphologically detect the retrograde target compartments of EGFP-tagged proteins of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemical_Compartment_Ablation_by_APEX2_Nanobodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On a biochemical level, DAB/H2O2 cytochemistry can be used for the ablation of compartments containing peroxidase activity (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAB polymerization traps the proteins within the organelle to make them unavailable for immunoprecipitation and even gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity of marker proteins to DAB polymerization thus provides evidence for colocalization with the peroxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells expressing TfR-EGFP or EGFP-CDMPR were loaded for 1 h at 37 °C with VHH-APEX2 nanobodies to reach steady state, washed, and incubated with DAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, hardly any VHH-APEX2 could be recovered after DAB polymerization with H2O2 (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, TfR-EGFP was almost entirely lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of EGFP-CDMPR, the larger glycoform was completely eliminated, while the smaller one was only partially affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resistant molecules of both reporters most likely represent the newly synthesized population present in the early secretory pathway (mostly in the ER).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility directly for EGFP-CDMPR, standard nanobody VHH-std was either mixed with total cell lysate for binding to all cellular EGFP-CDMPR or incubated with intact cells to only capture receptor appearing on the cell surface during 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobodies were then purified on Ni-NTA-beads (Fig 4G, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the larger form of EGFP-CDMPR, but only a fraction of the lower band, were recovered from nanobodies taken up by intact cells and thus correspond to mature protein in post-ER compartments, suggesting a significant amount of biosynthetic precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further confirmed by endoglycosidase H (EndoH) digestion (Fig 4G, Right): the upper band of EGFP-CDMPR and a fraction of the lower one were partially sensitive, as previously shown for purified CDMPR (35), while the rest of the lower band was fully deglycosylated by EndoH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated a pool of precursors in the ER that is not conspicuous in fluorescence microscopy and not affected by ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, calnexin and mannosidase II, markers for ER and medial-Golgi, respectively, were also resistant to VHH-APEX2mediated ablation, as were the cytosolic proteins actin and Rab5 and the lysosome marker LAMP1 (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both EGFP-tagged proteins mediated ablation of endosomes, because endogenous TfR and CIMPR were both strongly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endosomal SNARE protein Vti1a was also affected, even though it presents only approximately five residues into the endosomal lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TfR-EGFP did not notably impact the TGN markers TGN46, galactosyltransferase (GalT), or the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2), indicating that it does not return to the TGN from its plasma membrane/endosome pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to EGFP-CDMPR, which mediated an obvious loss of these markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of elimination was highest for TGN46 and TPST2, and lower for GalT, suggesting differences in the localization of these proteins with respect to that of CDMPR within the trans-Golgi/TGN compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that VHH-APEX2 nanobodies with DAB/H2O2 cytochemistry can be used to identify the compartments reached by a protein of interest in retrograde transport from the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nanobody_Sulfation_to_Determine_Kinetics_of_Retrograde_Transport_to_the_TGN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To be able to also determine kinetics of retrograde transport to the TGN, we took advantage of tyrosine sulfation, a posttranslational modification restricted to the trans-Golgi/TGN (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, VHH-1xTS and -2xTS were produced containing one or two tyrosine sulfation sequences (Fig 1 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanobodies (just like VHH-std, -mCherry, and -APEX2 shown above) were taken up specifically by the EGFP-tagged surface receptors to colocalize with their steady-state distribution (shown for VHH-2xTS in SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VHH-1xTS and -2xTS were radioactively labeled, when uptake was performed in the presence of [35S]sulfate for 60 min and was mediated by EGFP-CDMPR, -CIMPR, or -TGN46, but not by TfR-EGFP, even though the amount of imported nanobodies was the highest for TfR-EGFP (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment confirms again that the MPRs and TGN46, but not the TfR, are retrogradely transported from the cell surface to a compartment of sulfation (i.e., the TGN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sulfation signal was proportional to the number of TS sequences within each cell line, but differed between uptake receptors: nanobodies taken up by EGFP-TGN46 showed considerably higher specific sulfation, then those captured by the EGFP-MPRs, most likely reflecting the residence time of these membrane proteins in the sulfation compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To simultaneously determine the kinetics for nanobody uptake and sulfation, cells expressing EGFP-CDMPR or -CIMPR were incubated with VHH-2xTS for various times up to 75 min while labeling with [35S]sulfate (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generally disturb membrane traffic, the same experiment was also performed in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; mainly GBF1 and BIG1/BIG2) of several Arf GTPases involved in vesicular transport and other functions (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of BFA, sulfation started only after a lag time of 15 min and had not yet reached saturation after 75 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uptake and sulfation curves appeared shifted by almost 30 min, reflecting the transport time to the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both MPR fusion proteins behaved in a very similar manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of BFA, sulfation was completely abolished, while uptake remained unaffected both in kinetics and in extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a strong effect of BFA on transport of MPRs from endosomes to the compartment of sulfation, consistent also with previous observations for a CIMPR construct and cholera toxin (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Uptake and sulfation of VHH-2xTS by EGFP-TGN46 were both slower, but similarly separated by 30 min (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of sulfation, as apparent in Fig 5A (lanes 9 and 12), is considerably higher in absolute terms than that with the EGFP-MPRs, most likely reflecting a prolonged residence time in the sulfation compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rapid_Depletion_of_AP-1_Affects_Retrograde_Transport_Kinetics_of_MPRs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an application of this tool of derivatized nanobodies, we analyzed the contribution of AP-1/clathrin coats to retrograde transport of the MPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than measuring transport kinetics in normal cells vs. cells after knockdown or knockout of AP-1 subunits that might lead to compensatory effects of long-term protein silencing as documented before, we employed rapid AP-1 depletion using the knocksideways approach (20, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recreated the AP-1 knocksideways system as described by Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) in HeLa  cells by stably expressing -adaptin of AP-1 with FKBP inserted into the hinge region between the trunk and ear domains (-FKBP) and with a Mitotrap protein consisting of the signal and transmembrane domain of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom70p, FRB, and a triple-FLAG epitope tag (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression of recombinant -FKBP with or without siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous -adaptin did not affect the protein levels of clathrin and AP-2 (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Mitotrap always colocalized with mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig S6C), -FKBP (in the absence of endogenous ) showed the expected distribution of AP-1 (perinuclear TGN region and peripheral endosomal structures) in the absence of rapamycin, but redistributed entirely to a mitochondrial pattern within 10 min of rapamycin addition (SI Appendix, Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential centrifugation and immunoblot analysis confirmed that most -FKBP/AP-1 was rerouted away from cytosol and light membranes to mitochondria after only 10 min of rapamycin treatment (SI Appendix, Fig S6E), while AP-2 and clathrin were not affected, in agreement with Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effect of rapamycin treatment on mTOR activity, we immunoblotted after different times of rapamycin addition for the mTOR kinase substrate S6 ribosomal protein, both total S6 and the phosphorylated form S6-P (phosphorylated at Ser235/236).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While parental HeLa cells showed complete loss of S6 phosphorylation within 75 min, mTOR activity in HeLa-AP1ks cells was largely resistant to rapamycin (SI Appendix, Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likely explanation is that endogenous FKBP12 was also rerouted to mitochondria by Mitotrap efficiently competing with mTOR for binding to the rapamycinFKBP12 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, effects of rapamycin via mTOR inhibition are not a concern within the time course of our transport experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the functionality of the knocksideways system, HeLa-AP1ks cells stably expressing either EGFP-CDMPR or -CIMPR and silenced for endogenous -adaptin were incubated with or without rapamycin for 1 h (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of rapamycin, recombinant -FKBP showed the expected distribution of AP-1 on the TGN in the perinuclear region and on endosomes in the periphery, largely together with the MPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After rapamycin treatment, it was relocalized to mitochondria and the EGFP-MPRs showed an altered localization with an increased peripheral to juxtanuclear distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This redistribution of MPRs matches previous observations after AP-1 knockout (16, 49), knockdown, or knocksideways (20), thus confirming AP-1 inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the analysis of retrograde transport with and without rapid AP-1 inactivation, HeLa-AP1ks cells stably expressing EGFP-CDMPR or -CIMPR were incubated with VHH-2xTS while simultaneously labeling them with [35S]sulfate in the presence or absence of rapamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobody uptake and sulfation kinetics in knocksideways cells without rapamycin were virtually identical to those in normal HeLa cells (Fig 6 C and D, square symbols, compared with Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of rapamycin, nanobody uptake was not affected at all, but the sulfation kinetics were significantly reduced to a similar extent for both MPRs (round symbols in Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate a significant, but not exclusive, contribution of AP-1/clathrin in retrograde transport of MPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because nanobodies are small, stable, monomeric, and thus noncross-linking, can be selected for high affinity, andlacking disulfide bondscan be expressed in the cytosol, they are beginning to be used in a growing range of applications in cell culture systems and organisms (26): for example as chromobodies to visualize intracellular target proteins in vivo (30), in deGradFP to inducibly and rapidly direct intracellular GFP fusion proteins to degradation [within 23 h of induction (50)], as Morphotrap on the cell surface to capture and thus block spreading of GFP-tagged morphogens (51, 52), or in the fluorescent three-hybrid system to assay in vivo interaction of fluorescently tagged proteins (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently, a comprehensive set of anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG nanobodies have been generated to be produced in bacteria as improved secondary antibodies (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we have developed functionalized nanobodies produced by bacterial expression as tools to study retrograde traffic by different methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an anti-GFP nanobody to make the tool versatile, able to target fusion proteins with extracellular GFP, YFP, or mCerulean that may already be available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionalization can of course be similarly applied to the rapidly growing number of nanobodies directed against untagged target proteins generated by immunization of camelids or by phage-display selection of synthetic VHH libraries (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested our tools first on cells expressing TfR-EGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TfR is the best-characterized receptor cycling between plasma membrane and endosomes because of the unique properties of its ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It binds as ferro-Tf to the receptor and only releases the iron ion in acidic endosomes, but stays bound as apo-Tf, until it dissociates only after return to the neutral medium (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake kinetics we determined biochemically with VHH-std or by live-cell imaging with VHH-mCherry were in close agreement with the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using VHH-tev containing a TEV protease cleavage site to cut off an epitope tag even allowed the reverse experiment of monitoring reappearance of intracellular receptor to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake kinetics determined with our tools for EGFP-MPRs and -TGN46 reflected their characteristics of intracellular distribution and for TGN46 its long residence time in the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used stable cell lines to avoid gross overexpression of the EGFP reporters as produced by transient transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sensitive cases, however, genome editing will be an ideal way to produce GFP-tagged reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By light microscopy, localization to the TGN is not easily distinguished from recycling and late endosomes that also accumulate in the same perinuclear region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our nanobodies are biotinylated, they can be easily modified by coupling of commercially available fluorescent streptavidin conjugates expanding the range of fluorescent colors for various costainings, but also for specific requirements, such as in superresolution microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make the step to the ultrastructural level, we generated a VHH-APEX2 fusion to use with DAB cytochemistry and EM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though HRP is more active and more stable to DAB cytochemistry (40), APEX2 nanobodies proved to be sufficient for localization in intracellular compartments by EM and for biochemical colocalization by ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To go beyond localization to kinetic analysis of retrograde transport to the TGN, we produced nanobodies containing sulfation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ricin and Shiga toxin subunits had previously been modified with sulfation sites to demonstrate a transport route through the TGN (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5658).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TS peptides had also been chemically coupled to antibodies to assay retrograde transport of GFP-CIMPR and endogenous TGN46 to the TGN (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VHH-2xTS nanobodies have the advantage of easy and reproducible production and of a 1:1 stoichiometry with the target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their high sensitivity upon longer labeling times is an excellent tool to test for retrograde transport of a protein of interest to the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, they allow us to determine kinetics of transport and therefore direct analysis of the effects of chemical inhibitors or genetic manipulations on transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As proof-of-principle, we applied VHH-2xTS nanobodies to study the role of AP-1 in retrograde transport of MPRs by direct kinetic analysis of nanobody sulfation in knocksideways cells in parallel with and without rapamycin-induced AP-1 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobody sulfation and thus retrograde transport of EGFP-MPRs was partially, but not completely blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results support the notion that AP-1/clathrin contributes to MPR transport from early endosomes to the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus also agrees with the conclusion derived from proteomic data of CCV contents upon AP-1 or GGA2 depletion by knocksideways (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further consistent with other evidence of transport from late endosomes in a Rab9-dependent mechanism and from tubular early endosomes by SNX-BAR/retromer complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is possible that the reduction of retrograde transport as observed by sulfation is underestimated, because nanobodyMPR complexes that entered the sulfation compartment in the presence of rapamycin by whichever mechanism likely stayed there longer before exiting again, and thus accumulated more radioactivity, because the exit route by AP-1/clathrin was inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we present a powerful and versatile nanobody-based tool to analyze GFP-reporter proteins from the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobodies with other specificities may similarly be derivatized and alternate functionalization may allow the study of transport to other intracellular destinations beyond the TGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
