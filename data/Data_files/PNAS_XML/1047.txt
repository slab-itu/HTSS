Multiple pathways in pressure-induced phase transition of coesite  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coesite is an important geological mineral, yet it presents complicated phase transformations under compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier reports of pressure-induced amorphization have been later refined showing formation of various crystalline structures, including a high-pressure octahedral phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the complicated structure nature of coesite, we need to represent the system in a relatively large box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous first-principles calculations are limited, as only a small unit cell was employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations based on an ab initio parameterized polarizable force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows us accurate simulations with relatively large system sizes, which eventually enables us to provide a theoretical identification of multiple transformation pathways that have been discovered so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction method with precise control of hydrostatic conditions, typically with helium or neon as the pressure-transmitting medium, has significantly changed our view on what happens with low-density silica phases under pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coesite is a prototype material for pressure-induced amorphization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was found to transform into a high-pressure octahedral (HPO) phase, or coesite-II and coesite-III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the pressure is believed to be hydrostatic in two recent experiments, the different transformation pathways are striking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on molecular dynamic simulations with an ab initio parameterized potential, we reproduced all of the above experiments in three transformation pathways, including the one leading to an HPO phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This octahedral phase has an oxygen hcp sublattice featuring 2 × 2 zigzag octahedral edge-sharing chains, however with some broken points (i.e., point defects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It transforms into -PbO2 phase when it is relaxed under further compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the HPO phase forms through a continuous rearrangement of the oxygen sublattice toward hcp arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-pressure amorphous phases can be described by an fcc and hcp sublattice mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the sake of clarity, previous experiments are summarized as Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three experiments show that coesite is metastable until 22 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compressibility of two recent measured data is similar, but differs from the earlier one (16, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference can be explained by the improvement on the precise control of hydrostatic conditions, and availability of a large single crystal in the latter two experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations with different settings lead to the same results, that is, the coesite is metastable until 22 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we could obtain a P21/c (Z = 32) phase at 300 K by a large size of supercell (i.e., 512 SiO2 formula units) [see the V(I) curve in Fig 1B], which is in excellent agreement with the experiments by ernok et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This monoclinic phase has a unit cell doubled along the b axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereafter, we call it P21/c(I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success to reproduce the P21/c(I) is regarded as a natural result resulting from a large cell simulation and the high accuracy of the force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase transforms into a triclinic P-1(I-1) phase at 28 GPa (without any silicon coordination changes), followed by a series of symmetry-degenerated phases P-1(I-2) with further enlarged unit cells, for example, P-1(Z = 256) at 32 GPa, and ultimately into the amorphous state (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the system transforms into the P-1(I-2) phase at 30 GPa, some silicon atoms begin to be more than 4-coordinated, which corresponds to the drastic drop of volume shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, our results show that the XRD of the triclinic phases P-1(I-2) with enlarged unit cells are very similar to that of the amorphous state (SI Appendix, Fig S1), which is also consistent with the marked drops of XRD peaks just above 30 GPa in experiment (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the hydrostatic pressure as it is from PR pressure control, we observed the pressure-induced amorphization at 36 GPa [see the V(I) curve in Fig 1B], which is very close to the experimental result 34 GPa reported by Hemley et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, when we compress a small supercell (i.e., 64 SiO2 formula units) at 300 K, it transforms into P-1(II-1) at 24 GPa, then into P-1(II-2) at 28 GPa, and finally into amorphous phase A(2) at 48 GPa, following the V(II) curve in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, all of the unit cells of P-1(II-1) and P-1(II-2) phases are not doubled along the b axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the system transforms into the P-1(II-2) phase at 28 GPa, the normal vectors of the faces start to deviate from the Cartesian axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the angles between the normal vector of the face OBC and ex (i.e., x axis), between the normal vector of the face OAC and ey, and between the normal vector of the face OAB and ez are, respectively, 2.08°, 1.49°, and 2.61° in the P-1(II-1) phase at 26 GPa, but they are, respectively, 6.08°, 6.16°, and 1.85° in the P-1(II-2) phase at 28 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a large angle change may not correspond well to the experimental hydrostatic well-constraint conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, in the PR pressure control method, the motion of the cell is fictitious, defined as h¨=1/W(P), where ={a×b,b×c,c×a}, h={a,b,c} of the cell matrix, W is cell mass,  is the stress tensor of the system, and P is the external pressure (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An orthorhombic cell is favorable for the PR method, and can be better linked with hydrostatic pressure (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, particular attention was paid to the shape of supercells in simulations at finite temperature: After a pressure-induced phase transition if the supercell was too far from orthorhombic, another trial simulation was performed under an ad hoc isobaricisothermal (NPT) ensemble by constraining the off-diagonal variables of the stress tensor not in function, that is, by a constrained diagonal compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will show below that it is of particular importance when we simulate a first-order phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We gradually perform the constrained diagonal NPT compression at 300 K on the small supercell in P-1(II-1) phase at 26 GPa, until the system is in P-1(III) phase at 36 GPa; in the later gradual compression course above 36 GPa, at each pressure a full structural relaxation at 0 K is subsequently performed after the diagonal NPT compression at 300 K, and eventually we obtain an HPO phase at 50 GPa, as shown by the V(III) curve in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along path III, the system maintains in P-1(II-1) phase (i.e., the same phase as that in path II) and meanwhile silicon atoms preserve 4-coordinated up to 32 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the pressure range 2832 GPa, the system in the P-1(II-1) phase has a much higher enthalpy than in P-1(II-2), and the minimum difference, 4.97 kJ/mol, is at 28 GPa as shown in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we perform conventional NPT simulations at 300 K on a system in P-1(II-1) in the pressure range 2832 GPa, it soon transforms into P-1(II-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the P-1(II-1) phase is simply an intermediate phase and metastable only at constrained conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 34 GPa in the P-1(III) phase, the coordination of some silicon atoms increases, that is, three-eighths of silicon atoms are 5-coordinated, which corresponds to the drastic drop of V(III) in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our diagonal NPT simulations, the P-1(III) phase is observed in the pressure range of 3446 GPa, which can revert to coesite at 0 GPa after gradual decompression at 300 K. Hence, the P-1(III) phase [probably a mixture with the P-1(II-2) phase] might correspond to the intermediate-phase coesite-III in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the system transforms into a triclinic phase [P1(2)] at 50 GPa, all O ions are in hcp sublattice, while all silicon ions are sixfold coordinated (filled in one-half of these octahedral interstices of O sublattice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering this structural feature, this triclinic phase belongs to a large class of energetically competitive HPO phases suggested by Teter et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A presents the relative enthalpies of the phases in the pressure range of 2236 GPa along paths I, II, and III, in which coesite is set as the reference state (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it can be seen, the system in the P21/c(I) phase has lower enthalpy than in the P-1(II-1) phase at 24 and 26 GPa, which also supports the recently discovered coesite-II phase (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that it was possible to recover the HPO phase to 0 GPa by decompression at 300 K. Similar to the previous work (21), the HPO phase presents much lower enthalpy than all of the other intermediate phases in the pressure range of 2236 GPa (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows the relative enthalpies of the phases in the pressure range 3054 GPa; the enthalpy of the HPO phase (that we obtained from our simulations) resembles all of the other octahedral phases, including stishovite, CaCl2, and -PbO2 phases, but is completely different from those amorphous phases A(1) and A(2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that this HPO phase has favorable structure to be a high-pressure crystalline phase: The arrangement of O atoms in hcp sublattice leads to the minimum volume, and the eutectic ordering of Si and O layers leads to the minimum Madelung energy (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the HPO phase can transform into -PbO2 phase by further compression (Fig 2C), which implies an inherent similarity between the two crystalline structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated the Raman spectra of P21/c(I) and P-1(II-1) phase at 24 GPa and 300 K by MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, there is very good consistency in intensity between the double peaks at 573.7 and 593.6 cm1 of experimental Raman spectra and the superposition of the theoretical double peaks at 575.6 and 603.8 cm1 of P21/c(I) and the peak at 603.8 cm1 of P-1(II-1) phase at 24 GPa, which indicates that the two transient phases were both produced in the compression experiments of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the P-1(II-2) phase at 28 GPa, one-quarter of silicon ions are fivefold coordinated and one-eighth are sixfold coordinated, which corresponds to the drastic volumetric drop of the V(II) curve in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculations indicate that the Raman spectrum of P-1(II-2) phase at 28 GPa with part of silicon atoms more than fourfold coordinated is largely dispersed with many more peaks and the intensity is considerably decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the experimental Raman spectrum at 27.9 GPa in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 mainly displays a feature of the P-1(I-1) phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now, we further discuss the HPO phase (as obtained in our simulations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A presents a simple A-B stacking layered structure of oxygen atoms at 52 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 B and C shows the configurations of SiO6 octahedral edge-sharing chains at two adjacent layers, respectively, which include two perfect 2 × 2 zigzag octahedral chains besides other imperfect ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4D shows a simple A-B stacking layered structure of oxygen atoms of -PbO2 phase at an equivalent pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the HPO phase, Fig 4 E and F displays perfect 2 × 2 zigzag octahedral chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, during the phase transition from this HPO phase to -PbO2 phase, only three Si atoms change their places from the initial octahedral interstices to those in the final phase, which indicates the configuration of Si atoms in this HPO phase is very close to that in -PbO2 phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although the unit cell of this HPO phase has 64 SiO2 formula units in a low symmetry, the calculated XRD of this phase clearly presents a crystalline feature, as shown in Fig 4G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, the calculated XRD of this triclinic phase shows a small peak around 6.0°, which perfectly corresponds to the experimental peak (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the calculated angle-dispersive XRDs of both -PbO2 and P2/c phases lack the peak at 6.0°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly supports the HPO phase (as obtained in our simulations) as a reasonable candidate for the crystalline phase discovered by Hu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
So far, we could obtain all of the crystalline phases, including the P21/c (Z = 32) [i.e., P21/c(I)] reported by ernok et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) and the HPO phase reported by Hu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21), as well as amorphous phases (1618).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is noted that the success in obtaining the HPO phase is very sensitive to the scheme that we used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained the HPO phase by gradually compressing a small supercell of coesite (starting from 26 GPa) by the constrained diagonal NPT compression at 300 K in combination with a full structural relaxation at 0 K. However, we did not succeed in reproducing the HPO phase starting from the P21/c(I) phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2 shows the SiOSi angle changes (for those oxygen atoms with SiOSi angle equal to 180° in coesite) along three different paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is found that the SiOSi angles are separated into two angles, and remain as two in the high-pressure intermediate phases until 46 GPa, which eventually transform into HPO phase with a constrained diagonal pressure control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the SiOSi angle has very broad distribution at 30 GPa for the crystalline phase in path I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It looks reasonable to regard the SiOSi angle as one measure of order parameter proceeding to the amorphous or HPO phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we remark that the constrained diagonal compression is a useful protocol for describing the structural changes during or immediately after the first-order transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S3, the off-diagonal stresses are comparably large at 24 GPa above those two first-order transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is negligible when the first-order transition is completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, full optimization will not change the final structures (e.g., the HPO phase) obtained by the constrained diagonal pressure control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As pressure increases, both -quartz and -cristobalite transform into high-pressure structures with body-centered cubic (bcc) oxygen sublattice (27, 32, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in SI Appendix, Fig S4, a complete bcc oxygen sublattice never forms in the system under high pressures along all three paths (42), which might be owing to the complex structure of coesite in C2/c phase: there are five nonequivalent O atoms in a unit cell (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along path III, when the system is compressed to 40 GPa, nearly one-half of O atoms are arranged in layers, and as pressure increases to 48 and then to 50 GPa, the hcp oxygen sublattice gradually forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the oxygen sublattice (SI Appendix, Fig S4) and snapshots (SI Appendix, Fig S5) at different pressures, it is suggested that the HPO phase forms through a continuous rearrangement of the oxygen sublattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the high-pressure amorphous phases can be described by a mixture of fcc and hcp sublattices (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we presented three phase-transition pathways of coesite under high pressure: two leading to amorphous structures and one leading to an HPO phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This octahedral phase transforms into -PbO2 phase when it is relaxed under further compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated enthalpies of intermediate phases suggest that it is easy for coesite to follow the first path to be amorphized, and far more difficult for it to follow the third one to transform into the HPO phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It indicates the very low efficiency of the HPO phase transformed from coesite under high pressure even with good hydrostaticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unusual pressure-induced amorphization phenomenon has been studied for about 30 y (16, 43); however, recent experiments have added some insights (and doubts) on the amorphous structure by a conception on the basis of coexistence of the low-symmetry crystalline phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as it is shown here and also in our previous work on quartz (32), a completely disordered phase can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrangement of O atoms in hcp sublattice is very important to describe the high-pressure silica polymorphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HPO phase, as discovered recently (21), has thus been better understood in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All MD simulations were carried out based on an ab initio parameterized polarizable force field, which is parameterized by best fit to forces, stresses, and energies obtained by ab initio methods on selected configurations in the liquid (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential describes the thermodynamic stability of the crystalline polymorphs of silica at the same level of ab initio simulations (27), including the pressure dependence of the lattice constants (28), the phonon softening across the rutile-to-CaCl2 transition (29), and the stacking fault energy surfaces of coesite (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimized lattice constants of coesite at 0 GPa are a = 7.112 Å, b = 12.366 Å, c = 7.154 Å, and  = 119.80°, which are very close to those experimental results (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Verlet algorithm was used to integrate Newtons equations of motion with a time step of 0.723 fs (30 a.u.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradual compression and decompression courses at finite temperature were carried out every 2 GPa with 30,000 steps at each pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate compression and decompression courses at 0 K, we employed the PR barostat and steepest descent method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore the phase-transition nature of the obtained HPO phase, we carried out the following compression simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system in triclinic phase was compressed from 50 to 160 GPa every 10 GPa with NPT ensemble at 300 K for 30,000 steps at each pressure; from 170 to 200 GPa, a structural optimization is performed after NPT simulation at each pressure, and, ultimately at 210 GPa, NPT simulation of 150,000 steps at 4,000 K was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated the Raman spectra of tetrahedral phases by MD simulations with the scheme of bond polarizability model (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectra of nontetrahedral phase (at 28 GPa) were calculated within density-functional theory by the Quantum ESPRESSO package (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exchange and correlation functions were taken in a form within local density approximation and norm-conserving pseudopotentials were adopted (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an energy cutoff of 90 Ry for the plane-wave expansion of wave functions and a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point mesh for Brillouin zone sampling according to a MonkhorstPack scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atoms were relaxed and lattice constants were tuned with fixed shape so that the external pressure is 28.04 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed methods for calculation of Raman spectra are according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
