Local protein solvation drives direct down-conversion in phycobiliprotein PC645 via incoherent vibronic transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To harness sunlight for growth, plants and algae rapidly convey absorbed excitation energy from antennae pigments to a reaction center, where the excitations convert to chemical energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In deep water environments, cryptophyte algae survive by using the molecular motion of phycobiliprotein antennae to funnel excitations to low-energy pigments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of down-conversion in phycobiliproteins remains controversial: Could specific vibrations resonant with pigment energy gaps support coherence between excited states and thereby enhance the rate of transport by transient delocalization?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that down-conversion in a specific phycobiliprotein, PC645, is both incoherent and enhanced by a broad range of high-frequency vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that a similar incoherent mechanism is appropriate across phycobiliproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms controlling excitation energy transport (EET) in light-harvesting complexes remain controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the observation of long-lived beats in 2D electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the delocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant vibration, has been proposed to enable direct excitation transport from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy pigments, bypassing a collection of intermediate states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we instead show that for phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) nuclear dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental observations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales and selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We construct a general model for vibronic dimers and establish the parameter regimes of coherent and incoherent vibronic transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that direct down-conversion in PC645 proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large reorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that a similar incoherent mechanism is appropriate across phycobiliproteins and represents a potential design principle for nanoscale control of EET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ab_Initio_Simulations_of_Protein_Solvation_Reproduce_Linear_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the role of the local pigment environments in controlling EET, we first characterize the atomistic origin of the bilin solvation dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation energy of a pigment bound in a protein pocket, given as the energy difference between the ground and first excited state, fluctuates due to the nuclear motions of the chromophore, the surrounding protein residues, and the proximate water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulating excitation energy fluctuations requires performing nuclear dynamics that sample the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) and calculating the excitation energy at regular intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fluctuations can be characterized by a spectral density that describes coupling of the electronic excited state to a continuous distribution of vibrational modes (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the significant computational cost of obtaining nuclear forces quantum mechanically (QM), previous calculations have always used classical or semiempirical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields to propagate nuclear dynamics for entire LHCs (2023, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in many cases, the MM PES sampled during nuclear dynamics differs substantially from the QM PES on which excitation energies are defined, causing the calculated spectral densities to report incorrect vibrational frequencies and coupling amplitudes (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We construct spectral densities using nuclear dynamics calculated on an ab initio QM/MM PES that combines bilin nuclear gradients calculated using DFT with an MM force field to treat the surrounding protein environment (Fig 1B), thereby resolving the mismatch between nuclear dynamics trajectories and excited-state calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 provides an overview of our procedure for constructing spectral densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each bilin, we construct energy-gap trajectories (Fig 1C) by calculating excitation energies with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) on 20,000 geometries extracted at 2-fs intervals from our 40-ps QM/MM production runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier transforms of the two-time correlation functions of the energy-gap trajectories define unique spectral densities that characterize individual bilin environments (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that while TDDFT often incorrectly predicts absolute excitation energies, cancellation of error results in good descriptions of the curvature of the potential energy surface that we depend on here (2831).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectroscopic signals and EET dynamics depend intimately on the solvation dynamics of individual chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solvation capacity of the local vibrational environment is quantified by the total reorganization energy () of the spectral density which measures the energy dissipated as the chromophore relaxes following excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have assumed that all bilins have identical spectral densities and assigned a reorganization energy of 260 cm1 (24), 314 cm1 (10), or 480 cm1 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our spectral densities, shown in gray in the subpanels of Fig 2, reveal larger reorganization energies ( = 909 cm1) and significant variations between different bilins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spread in our reorganization energies ( = 6271,414 cm1) is consistent with the presence of three chemically distinct bilins with different conjugation lengths and either one or two covalent protein linkages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability of the reorganization energies between chemically identical bilins bound in distinct protein environments (e.g., MBVA and MBVB) demonstrates the importance of the protein scaffold in determining the local solvation dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, all eight bilin spectral densities show a peak near 1,650 cm1 which is consistent with the assignment of a long-lived 1,580-cm1 mode as intramolecular C = C or C = N vibrations in broad-band transient absorption measurements (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incorporating the ab initio QM/MM spectral densities into absorption and fluorescence simulations (solid black lines) results in excellent agreement with experimental spectra (open gray circles), as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the negative features observed in simulated spectra are unphysical but do not impact the quality of the lineshapes (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for both the large reorganization energies and the multiple timescales of vibrational relaxation encoded in the structure of our spectral densities, we use numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) (32, 33), as implemented in QMaster (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEOM has been shown to yield realistic simulations of exciton dynamics in LHCs (3537), but its computational complexity limits our spectral densities to including a total of 24 DrudeLorentz peaks for full-system simulations, each representing a distributions of bath modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We construct four classes of abridged spectral densities for each bilin, starting with class 1 (eight or nine peaks per bilin) and successively coarse graining to incorporate fewer peaks until we reach class 4 (two peaks per bilin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak parameters for all spectral densities are given in SI Appendix, Tables S1S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abridged spectral densities used for spectroscopic calculations are shown with our consistent bilin color scheme in the subpanels of Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We justify our abridged spectral densities by comparing simulated monomer absorption and fluorescence spectra, as described in SI Appendix, section 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, section 2 discusses the system Hamiltonian while SI Appendix, section 3 covers ab initio transition dipole moments, details of the fluorescence simulations, and inhomogeneous broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We validate our spectral densities by comparing them to two features of the experimental spectra: the Stokes shift, defined as the frequency difference between the highest-energy fluorescence peak and the lowest-energy absorption peak, and the overall width of the absorption spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observables are quite sensitive to the distribution of reorganization energies between the different bilins of PC645.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the lowest-energy bilin spectral density for all pigments, such as would be extracted from a fluorescence line-narrowing experiment, results in an absorption spectrum with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) that is 25% too small (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption spectrum contracts in this case because we underestimate the reorganization energies of the PCB158s and MBVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we instead use the average of the eight bilin spectral densities for all pigments, we obtain an absorption spectrum with a Stokes shift that is 55% too large (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Stokes shift expands because we substantially overestimate the reorganization energy of the PCB82s that dominate the fluorescence and low-energy absorption features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 18% error between the experimental and simulated Stokes shift and very good agreement with the overall absorption linewidth in the absence of free parameters represent a strong validation of the solvation dynamics encoded in our atomistic spectral densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Solvation_Drives_Down-Conversion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spectral density connects the atomistic dynamics of the bilin vibrational environment to both spectroscopic lineshapes and EET pertinent to light harvesting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having validated our atomistic QM/MM spectral densities against absorption and fluorescence spectra, we now confirm that they also describe the experimental observables associated with direct down-conversion in PC645.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental transient absorption measurements, combined with global kinetic analysis, indicate that initial excitation of the DBV core is followed by direct transport to the low-energy PCB82 pigments with a rate of 1.7 ps1 (10, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the rates nor selectivity of direct down-conversion have been successfully reproduced using previously estimated unstructured spectral densities (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that numerically exact HEOM simulations combined with our spectral densities predict pathways and rates of down-conversion that reproduce experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The large reorganization energies of our QM/MM spectral densities are essential for correctly predicting the selectivity of transport from the DBV core to the low-energy PCB82s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulated EET pathways following photoexcitation of the DBV core are shown in Fig 3 A and B. Arrow thickness in Fig 3 is proportional to exciton flux, the net amount of excitation that is transferred from the DBVs to an acceptor pigment in a 1.0-ps interval following photoexcitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform exciton flux calculations using class 2 spectral densities for the MBVs and class 4 spectral densities for the remaining pigments (SI Appendix, section 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3A we rescale the spectral densities to match the average magnitude of reorganization energy used in previous simulations ( = 260 cm1, labeled 30%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of a smaller average reorganization energy, the more weakly solvated DBV core primarily transports excitation to the energetically adjacent MBVB, qualitatively reproducing previous results (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EET simulations using the full reorganization energy (Fig 3B, labeled 100%), however, show enhanced direct transfer to the low-energy PCB82s, in reasonable agreement with global kinetic analysis of transient absorption measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to influencing selectivity, the large reorganization energies also increase the rate of direct down-conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEOM is a non-Markovian theory, and as a result, the rates of transport vary as a function of time in response to changes in the vibrational energy distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract a best-fit rate of down-conversion from HEOM simulations using class 1 spectral densities with a four-site model containing only the core DBVs and the low-energy PCB82s (SI Appendix, section 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class 1 spectral densities (e.g., SI Appendix, Fig S1A) explicitly incorporate the high-frequency mode (1,650 cm1) previously assigned to an intramolecular bilin vibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rescaled spectral densities (Fig 3A, 30%) result in a transport rate of 0.8 ps1, substantially slower than the experimentally observed 1.7 ps1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using the full reorganization energy of our spectral densities (Fig 3B, 100%), we find the simulated rate of transport to be 1.6 ps1, within 8% of the experimental value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Down-Conversion_Occurs_via_an_Incoherent_Vibronic_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that HEOM simulations using our atomistic spectral densities reproduce both the linear spectra and the rate of direct down-conversion in PC645.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the question remains: What are the mechanistic principles connecting bilin vibrational environments to regulation of EET pathways?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the relative importance of short-lived, low-frequency, intermolecular motions vs. long-lived, high-frequency, intramolecular vibrations remains controversial (1, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this section, we assess how the mechanism of EET in PC645 arises from the interplay of electronic couplings between pigments with structured spectral densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we introduce the simplest representative model system that captures the essential features of vibronic transport in the presence of a long-lived high-frequency vibration and distinguish between the coherent and incoherent transport regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we demonstrate that PC645 experiences an incoherent vibronic mechanism and that the long-lived near-resonant vibration assigned to support vibronic coherence is not essential for efficient transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that generalized Förster theory (3841) explains the mechanism of transport in PC645, consistent with recent work on other PPC aggregates (34, 4245), and that local protein solvation enables direct down-conversion by controlling Förster spectral overlaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition from coherent to incoherent vibronic transport is governed by the ratio of the vibronic coupling (Vvib) to the rapidly relaxing component of the pigment reorganization energy (deph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A depicts an energetically detuned dimer with a long-lived resonant high-frequency vibration on the low-energy acceptor pigment (further details in SI Appendix, section 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, we define the basis as a direct product of three indexes: the electronic state of the acceptor (|ga, |ea), the electronic state of the donor (|gd, |ed), and the vibrational state of the acceptor on either the ground- or excited-state harmonic oscillator (|0g, |0e, |1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the energy gap between the donor (|ga, ed, 0g) and the acceptor (|ea, gd, 0e) is large compared with deph, rapid excitation transport cannot occur (Fig 4B, purple line) unless a vibrationally excited acceptor state (|ea, gd, 1e) is generated by a bridging high-frequency mode (Fig 4B, black line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibronic coupling (Vvib, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) between the nearly degenerate states relevant for vibronic enhancement (Fig 4B, gray area) is described by the product of the electronic coupling (V) with the FrankCondon factor (46):Vvib=V1e|0gVvibvib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]The vibronic coupling facilitates delocalization between the donor and the vibrationally excited acceptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the component of the pigment reorganization energy that relaxes faster than the timescale of transport (deph) drives excitations to localize on individual pigments (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, when Vvibdeph, transport is coherent (i.e., aided by delocalization) and initial dynamics rise and oscillate (Fig 4C, blue/green lines) on a timescale determined by Vvib (Fig 4C, black dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when dephVvib (Fig 4C, orange line), dynamic localization inhibits the initial coherent rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, when dephVvib (Fig 4C, red line), complete localization results in incoherent hopping that can be described by Förster theory,Kad=|V|22Re[0Aa(t)Fd(t)dt],[2]where Aa(t) is the absorption lineshape of the acceptor and Fd(t) is the fluorescence lineshape of the donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the incoherent regime (deph  Vvib) HEOM and Förster theory predict identical transport rates (Fig 4B, red dashed line) and dynamics (Fig 4C, gray dashed line), assuming vibrational relaxation is not too slow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of a resonant, intramolecular vibration can enhance incoherent transport by providing a vibronic sideband that increases the absorption/fluorescence overlap (14, 46) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the general conclusions drawn from this model hold whether the vibration is placed on the acceptor, the donor, or both (SI Appendix, section 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that direct down-conversion in PC645 occurs in the incoherent regime of vibronic transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited delocalization between the DBVs due to their strong electronic coupling and the many timescales of vibrational relaxation complicates the assignment of deph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short-timescale (less_than200 fs) dynamic Stokes shift of the DBV core provides a lower bound on deph of 125 cm1, as described in SI Appendix, section 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic coupling between the delocalized DBV state and the PCB82 pigments is estimated to be 50 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the FrankCondon factor of 0.25 for the high-frequency vibration, the pertinent vibronic coupling is 12 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, find that the ratio of deph to the vibronic coupling in PC645 has a lower bound of 10, indicating the dominance of an incoherent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, since the energy gap between the DBV fluorescence and PCB82 absorption maxima is larger than their peak widths (SI Appendix, section 6), we find that direct down-conversion in PC645 occurs in the incoherent vibronic regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the order of magnitude difference between the lowest estimate of deph and the vibronic coupling, our assignment of incoherent vibronic transport is robust to even substantial variation in Hamiltonian parameters (SI Appendix, section 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of long-lived oscillations in nonlinear spectroscopic measurements led to the suggestion of functionally relevant vibronic coherence in PC645 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent work has demonstrated that oscillatory vibronic signatures in 2D electronic spectra do not necessarily imply a role of vibronic coherence in excitation energy transfer (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We directly probe the role of vibronic coherence in PC645 by manipulating the high-frequency vibration previously assigned to support vibronic signatures and demonstrate that it is not required for efficient transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coherent vibronic transport is known to exhibit a sharp resonance condition as a function of the vibrational frequency (7, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonance condition arises because vibronic delocalization between the donor and the vibrationally excited acceptor occurs only when the energy gap is smaller than, or the same order of magnitude as, the vibronic coupling (i.e., Vvib 12 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of PC645, partial delocalization in the DBVs means that there are two possible resonance conditions to consider, depending on whether the DBV core eigenstates or pigment states act as the donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the possible resonance conditions, we examine population dynamics calculated in a four-site model containing only the DBVs and PCB82s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use class 1 spectral densities with four possible positions of the high-frequency mode (Fig 5A): (i) the original positions (1,650 cm1), (ii) the the energy difference between the DBVD and PCB82C sites, (iii) the energy difference between the low energy DBV exciton and the PCB82C site, and (iv) the complete removal of the high-frequency peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe minimal differences in the resulting population dynamics (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional exhaustive scan of the peak position between 1,100 cm1 and 1,800 cm1 shows no greater variations in population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have therefore demonstrated the absence of a sharp resonance condition, further supporting our assignment of incoherent vibronic transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with the incoherent transport regime, Förster theory captures the dominant contributions to the rate of down-conversion in PC645.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To describe incoherent transport in the presence of strong coupling between DBVs, we use a generalization of Förster theory (38) that treats excitations within the DBV core as delocalized but assumes transport out of the core can be described as an incoherent hop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to rapid exciton relaxation within the DBV core, the rate of transport out of the core is determined by the overlap between the lowest-energy DBV exciton fluorescence and the absorption spectra of the remaining pigments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate absorption spectra for the non-DBV pigments using Kubo lineshapes, which are exact for local excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate the low-energy DBV exciton fluorescence using an extension of Kubo theory (38, 42, 43), which neglects the localization of excitons resulting from vibrational fluctuations (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generalized Förster theory predicts a rate of 1.4 ps1, within 15% of the HEOM result (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using generalized Förster theory, we can explain the relative mechanistic role of low-frequency, intermolecular vibrations and high-frequency, intramolecular vibrations in controlling direct down-conversion in PC645.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the impact of bilin vibrational environments on transport rates and pathways, we examine the absorption/fluorescence overlap between the DBV core (Fig 5 D and E, gray lines) and either PCB82C (Fig 5E, cyan) or MBVB (Fig 5D, magenta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Stokes shift of the DBV core (280 cm1) enhances the energetic overlap with the lower-energy pigments and dramatically increases the overall rates of transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite almost perfect alignment of the DBV fluorescence with the MBV absorption spectra, excitation is preferentially transported to PCB82s due to the presence of broad vibronic sidebands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the narrow resonance condition associated with coherent vibronic transport (width on the order of |V1|e0g|), the existence of wide absorption and fluorescence features allows for incoherent vibronic enhancement with a broad resonance condition (width on the order of the homogeneous linewidth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that given the importance of the Stokes shift in determining the rate and pathways of excitation transport, the demonstration of modified local solvation dynamics for chemically identical bilins within PC645 represents a potential design principle for nanoscale control of EET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have demonstrated how specific features of the pigment vibrational environments in PC645 exert nanoscale control of EET pathways and enable direct down-conversion from the DBV core to the low-energy PCB82s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accessed the atomistic origin of local solvation for each bilin, using ab initio QM/MM nuclear dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the previous assumption of identical baths, our simulations identified substantial disparities between bilin vibrational environments which were essential to reproducing the experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we have determined that down-conversion in PC645 proceeds via an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism where (i) excitations are localized on individual bilins (except for the DBV core) and transport occurs via incoherent hops and (ii) direct down-conversion is enhanced by large reorganization energies and the presence of a wide collection of high-frequency vibrations that induce broad vibronic sidebands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given similar bilin flexibility and weak electronic couplings generally reported for biliproteins, our findings suggest that vibronic transport in cryptophyte algal antenna complexes proceeds incoherently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The incoherent vibronic mechanism assigned here to PC645 is far more robust to imperfections than its coherent counterpart and could act as a blueprint for the design of artificial excitonic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in biomimetic light-harvesting technologies have demonstrated novel architectures, e.g., metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (51) and DNA origami (52), that can precisely place pigments within a hierarchically organized assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully realize nanoscale control of EET, we must iteratively simulate and design the local vibrational environments of pigment-scaffold architectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the complexity of our current procedure is infeasible for high-throughput application, pointing toward the need for new and more efficient computational strategies and approximations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We perform eight QM/MM nuclear dynamics simulations where the forces on one bilin are constructed from ground-state DFT calculations for each trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin each QM/MM trajectory with 10 ps of equilibration followed by 40 ps of production run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We construct energy gap trajectories for each bilin, using TDDFT calculations on geometries sampled every 2 fs, for a total of 20,000 geometries per bilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the energy gap trajectories to construct two-time correlation functions and then Fourier transform to obtain the spectral density for each bilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the eight 50-ps QM/MM trajectories took over 9 mo to run and cost more than 2 million central processing unit (CPU) hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the initial geometry preparation, separation of the quantum from classical regions, excited-state energy calculations, and the construction of the spectral densities are described in SI Appendix, section 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exciton dynamics simulations were performed with the QMaster software package (34) that provides a high-performance implementation of HEOM, which runs flexibly on both graphics processing unit (GPU) and CPU architectures (13, 34, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEOM fluorescence calculations used a development version of QMaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All HEOM results presented were run at a hierarchy depth of six except for rate calculations, which were run at a hierarchy depth of five (SI Appendix, section 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
