Synchronous circadian voltage rhythms with asynchronous calcium rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mammalian master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), contains a network composed of various neuron types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SCN network plays critical roles in expressing robust circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior, such as sleepwake cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular clock in individual SCN neurons controls membrane excitability, and sends output signals to various organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the SCN neurons transmit output signals remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a genetically encoded voltage sensor, we directly measured the circadian rhythms of membrane voltage in the SCN network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the circadian voltage rhythms are synchronous across the entire SCN network, whereas simultaneously recorded Ca2+ rhythms are asynchronous in the dorsal and ventral SCN regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the SCN network produces coherent output signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, contains a network composed of multiple types of neurons which are thought to form a hierarchical and multioscillator system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular clock machinery in SCN neurons drives membrane excitability and sends time cue signals to various brain regions and peripheral organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how and at what time of the day these neurons transmit output signals remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we successfully visualized circadian voltage rhythms optically for many days using a genetically encoded voltage sensor, ArcLightD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the voltage rhythms are synchronized across the entire SCN network of cultured slices, whereas simultaneously recorded Ca2+ rhythms are topologically specific to the dorsal and ventral regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found that the temporal order of these two rhythms is cell-type specific: The Ca2+ rhythms phase-lead the voltage rhythms in AVP neurons but Ca2+ and voltage rhythms are nearly in phase in VIP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that circadian firing rhythms are also synchronous and are coupled with the voltage rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that SCN networks with asynchronous Ca2+ rhythms produce coherent voltage rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression_Patterns_of_a_Genetically_Encoded_Voltage_Sensor__ArcLightD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of membrane potentials in SCN neurons, ArcLightD was transfected in cultured SCN slices of newborn mice [postnatal day (P) 46] using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) under a neuron-specific promoter, human synapsin I (hSynI) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A shows representative expression patterns of ArcLightD fluorescence in the SCN prepared from C57BL/6J mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression pattern of ArcLightD in the SCN network was distinct from that of the Ca2+ probes, such as Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (7, 28) and GCaMP6s (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ArcLightD signals were detected in the plasma membrane of soma and fibers (i.e., axon and dendrites) but not in the cytosol or nucleus (Fig 1A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because ArcLightD is expressed throughout the plasma membrane, including the axon and dendrites, it is difficult to identify the origin of the signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this difficulty, the SCN slices from VIP- and AVP-Cre mice were transfected with AAV-encoding hSynI-Flex-ArcLightD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-typespecific expression of ArcLightD allowed us to identify the VIP (Fig 1B) and AVP (Fig 1C) neurons separately and to estimate the distribution of fluorescence in dendrites and axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VIP neurons whose cell bodies were localized in the ventral SCN sent fibers to the dorsal SCN region (Fig 1B), whereas the AVP neurons with cell bodies located mostly in the dorsal SCN sent fibers to the entire SCN (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-typespecific expressions of ArcLightD in the VIP and AVP neurons were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining against VIP and AVP neuropeptides, respectively (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simultaneous_Recording_of_Circadian_Rhythms_in_Voltage_and_Intracellular_Calcium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using ArcLightD together with RGECO, we successfully detected the circadian rhythms in membrane potential (voltage rhythm) and intracellular Ca2+ levels (Ca2+ rhythm) simultaneously in the SCN (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we found that the voltage rhythms were synchronous throughout the entire SCN network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the rhythms at the level of the SCN network, we created acrophase (peak phase) maps using a pixel-based analysis program as described previously (7, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acrophase maps, expressed relative to the slice mean, showed that the voltage rhythms were nearly in phase throughout the entire SCN region (shown in yellow-green colors) (Fig 2B, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the Ca2+ rhythms were topologically specific, with an advanced phase in the dorsal region (shown in cold colors) and a delayed phase in the center and ventral regions (shown in warm colors) (Fig 2B, Right), as previously reported (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We statistically compared the regional difference between representative areas (each 100 × 100 m) in the dorsal and ventral SCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean acrophase of the voltage rhythm was not significantly different in these areas, indicating that they were synchronous (12.4 ± 0.5 h and 12.0 ± 0.5 h, respectively; n = 6; P = 0.61) (Fig 2C, Left), whereas the mean acrophase of the Ca2+ rhythm in these areas was significantly different, indicating topological specificity (9.1 ± 0.3 h and 13.6 ± 0.4 h, respectively; n = 6; P less_than 0.001) (Fig 2C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the phase difference between the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms in these regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ca2+ rhythm was phase-advanced relative to the voltage rhythms in the dorsal region (2.6 ± 0.4 h) (P less_than 0.001), but these two rhythms were nearly in phase in the ventral region (0.3 ± 0.3 h) (P = 0.62) (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Signal_Origin_of_ArcLightD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the signal origin and dynamic range of ArcLightD fluorescence in our experimental conditions, we manipulated the membrane potentials of SCN neurons by changing extracellular concentrations of potassium ion (0.5, 0.3, 5.4, and 10 mM KCl), as reported previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded the resting membrane potentials and action potentials by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from single SCN neurons (23 neurons in six slices) and detected the fluorescence changes in ArcLightD in six SCN slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that ArcLightD reports changes in the membrane potentials with a dynamic range from 50 mV to 30 mV under this condition (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean membrane potentials were almost identical with or without firings (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated range of circadian oscillation was 6.26 ± 1.43 mV in the dorsal region and 6.35 ± 1.36 mV in the ventral region, a difference that was not statistically significant (P = 0.96) (Fig S3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that ArcLightD signals reflect the change in the resting membrane potential, not the firing level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell-TypeSpecific_Recording_of_the_Voltage_Rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simultaneous_Recording_of_the_Voltage_and_Firing_Rate_Rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the synchronization of the voltage rhythms in the SCN, we performed simultaneous recordings of ArcLightD and neuronal firing using a MED with 8 × 8 planar electrodes (each, 20 × 20 m) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cultured SCN slice transfected with AAV encoding hSynI-ArcLightD was flipped over and placed on the MED probe (Fig S1, Protocol 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ArcLightD signals were measured by a highly sensitive CCD camera mounted on an upright microscope, and multiunit spontaneous firings were measured by the MED system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The voltage and firing rhythms were analyzed in 20 × 20 m regions of interest (ROIs) on each MED electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical example is shown in Fig 5D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of acrophase on pixel or ROI level was unimodal in the respective voltage and firing rhythm, indicating synchronization of the circadian rhythms throughout the SCN (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the phase relationship between the firing and voltage rhythms in 39 electrodes (three slices) and found that the firing rhythms were significantly phase-advanced (by 3.9 ± 0.3 h) relative to the voltage rhythms (Fig 5E, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant regional difference in phase difference between the dorsal (4.1 ± 0.5 h) and ventral (3.8 ± 0.4 h) SCN regions (P = 0.644) (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that the voltage and firing rhythms are synchronous throughout the entire SCN network and are coupled to each other with a phase difference of 4 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Voltage_and_Ca2+_Rhythms_During_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we observed that 10% of MED electrodes demonstrated firing rhythms that were antiphasic to the majority rhythms (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the firing rhythms were synchronous in all MED electrodes in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the SCN slices in this study were cultured for longer periods of time than in previous studies, we tested the possibility of developmental changes in the SCN network for synchronization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To this end, we performed simultaneous recordings of the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms for more than 10 d starting at an early developmental stage (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SCN slice was prepared from mice at day P1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entire SCN neurons were transfected with two AAVs, one encoding ArcLightD and the other RGECO, on days P2 and P3, and confocal recordings were started 1 wk later, on corresponding (cP) day 10 (Fig S1, Protocol 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the topological patterns of the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms in the SCN were similar in both the early and late recording stages (Fig 6A) (n = 6 slices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, judging from the SD, the voltage rhythms were more synchronized at the late stage (SD = 3.0 ± 0.1 h) (days cP2122) than at the early stage (SD = 4.0 ± 0.3 h) (days cP1011) (P = 0.038) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the Ca2+ rhythms were not significantly different between the early (4.7 ± 0.1 h) and late (4.8 ± 0.03 h) stages (P = 0.87) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the phase difference between the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms separately in the dorsal (3.2 ± 0.2 h vs. 3.9 ± 0.5 h) and ventral SCN (1.3 ± 0.6 h vs. 0.9 ± 0.4 h) at both the early and late stage and found no significant regional difference between the two stages (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the coherence of voltage rhythms, but not of the Ca2+ rhythms, is developmentally regulated in the SCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we found cell-typespecific couplings of circadian rhythms, the synchronous circadian voltage rhythms as well as the firing rhythms in the entire SCN, despite topologically specific Ca2+ rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that ion channel blockers had differential effects on the amplitude of voltage and Ca2+ rhythms in the AVP neurons but not in the VIP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are explained by assuming an interaction between an intrinsic cellular oscillation and the inputs from the SCN neural network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-Type_Specificity_of_the_Circadian_Functions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circadian rhythms in the expression of clock genes, such as Per1 and Per2, have been reported to have topological patterns similar to those of Ca2+ rhythms (6, 7); thus the rhythms in Ca2+ and clock gene expression and the rhythms in voltage and firing behave similarly (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply that SCN neurons have two functionally coupled oscillatory components: One is composed of the voltage and neuronal firing rhythms, and the other is composed of Ca2+ and PER2 rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two oscillatory components might interact directly or through the core molecular loop for circadian oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase relationship of the circadian PER2 and Ca2+ rhythms is not different in VIP and AVP neurons, and the same is true for the circadian voltage and firing rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the phase relationship between the former component and the latter was substantially different in the two neurons (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D, 3G, and 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the voltage rhythms were synchronous throughout the entire SCN, the cell-specific difference is ascribed to the oscillatory component of circadian Ca2+ and PER2 rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TTX changed the phase relationship between the two components in the AVP neurons (Fig 4G), suggesting that the SCN neural network is involved in the coupling between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTX did not affect the coupling in the VIP neurons (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the phase relationship of two oscillatory components was changed between the AVP and VIP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings are consistent with our previous report that TTX desynchronizes the circadian Ca2+ rhythms between the dorsal and ventral regions of the SCN (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Signal_Origin_of_the_Voltage_Rhythm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The voltage rhythms were synchronous throughout the entire SCN (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding is unique in the face of regional differences in the circadian phase of other measures such as clock gene expression in the SCN (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used pixel-level analysis using time-series CCD images (7, 30, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each pixel size is smaller than the average size of the cell body of a single SCN neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not able to exclude the possibility that some pixels represent the soma of a certain cell and other pixels represent the processes of different cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such compartmentalization cannot explain the synchrony of the voltage rhythms throughout the entire SCN (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed the synchronization of the voltage rhythms in the same group of SCN neurons (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B and 4B), including the regions where the somas and processes exist intermixed (Fig 1 B and C and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dendrite is known as the major target of synaptic inputs in a variety of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage changes in the dendrites propagate in the process and soma within a few second, based on the cable properties of the dendrite (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synchrony of voltage rhythm throughout the SCN might be caused by a rapid propagation of a subcellular voltage change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neural_Network_and_Intracellular_Couplings_of_Circadian_Rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Application of the channel blockers for either fast Na+ or l-type Ca2+ channels reduced the amplitude of both the Ca2+ and voltage rhythms in the VIP neurons but only diminished the amplitude of the Ca2+ rhythm in the AVP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of the circadian voltage rhythm in the AVP neurons persisted without damping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neuron-specific differences suggest the impairment of a specific pathway from the intrinsic circadian oscillation to both overt rhythms and/or desynchrony among cellular rhythms rather than a loss of cell-intrinsic rhythms in particular types of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a significant change in the phase difference between the Ca2+ and voltage rhythms indicates desynchrony between them and suggests that the two circadian rhythms are regulated by different mechanisms or at least through different pathways from the core molecular loop of circadian oscillation in the AVP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the theory of a multioscillator system (43), the phase of an intrinsic cellular circadian oscillation is affected by but is not completely in phase with the system oscillation in which the cell involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circadian voltage and firing rhythms may represent the system oscillation in the SCN, and the circadian Ca2+ and PER2 rhythms may represent the intrinsic cellular oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interruption of the inputs from the neural system by TTX may release the intrinsic oscillation from the impact of system oscillation to change the characteristics of cellular oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present findings are adequately explained by this theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Possible_Mechanisms_of_Intra-_and_Intercellular_Couplings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the present findings, we advanced a model in which the cell-type specificity of circadian rhythms is explained by asymmetric impacts from the VIP to AVP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the SCN neural network differentially influences the two oscillatory cell components in which the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms are involved separately (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notion is based on the differential effects of TTX and nimodipine on the amplitude of voltage rhythms in the two neuron groups (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3F and 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural network sensitive to TTX or nimodipine has a much greater influence on the Ca2+ rhythms than on the voltage rhythms in the AVP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SCN, neuronal firings and Ca2+ conductance contribute the membrane potential (34, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTX blocks fast Na+ channels and neuronal firings, and it also suppresses the neuronal inputs from network (Fig 7 C, 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nimodipine inhibits l-type Ca2+ channels, thus suppressing Ca2+ and voltage rhythms in the AVP and VIP neurons (Fig 7 C, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of either fast Na+ or l-type Ca2+ channels enhances the amplitude of the voltage rhythm in AVP neurons, probably by disinhibiting the coupling from the VIP to AVP neurons (Fig 7 C, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, other ion channels, such as the calcium-activated BK potassium channel (5, 44, 45), which is more abundant in the AVP neurons than in the VIP neurons, might be involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of rhythm amplitude may weaken the coupling between the two oscillatory components, thereby changing the phase relationship of the rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible explanation is a change in the threshold for generating neuronal firings by modulating the ion channel activation or inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The firing rhythms phase-lead the voltage rhythms by nearly 4 h. This lead is not predictable from the experiments in molluscan clock neurons (46) or the HodgkinHuxley model in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum level of depolarization was associated with a decline in the firing rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization block is a possible explanation of this phase difference but is unlikely, considering that the estimated amplitude of the voltage rhythm was as small as 6.3 mV on average (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unknown circadian mechanisms, such as activation of a calcium-activated BK-type potassium channel and a change in action potential threshold might account for this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Developmental_Regulation_of_the_Voltage_Rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the voltage rhythms became coherent during the course of recordings (Fig 6), possibly as the result of the maturation of the SCN network during the development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support this idea, we recently found VIP and AVP signaling differentially integrated in the SCN neural network during development (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the amplitude of the voltage and Ca2+ rhythms became larger during culturing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhythm amplitude could be reinforced by intercellular coupling during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coherent and robust voltage rhythms would lead to stable output signals and ultimately would sustain coherent and robust rhythms in animal behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function is of special importance in maintaining activityrest cyclicity under perturbing influences such as transmeridian flights and extreme photoperiods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physiological_Roles_of_Differentially_Phased_Voltage_and_Ca2+_Rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physiological roles of the synchronous voltage and asynchronous Ca2+ rhythms are unknown, but it is surmised that the SCN uses two rhythms differentially for the circadian clockwork: the voltage rhythms for uniform sensitivity to environmental stimulation and the Ca2+ rhythms for the regional-specific responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, in vivo recording using stationary electrodes showed that the peak phase of the firing rhythms was similar in the dorsal and ventral SCN (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a fixed phase relationship between Per1 and firing rate has been reported in the SCN slices; however, the spatial pattern and regional specificity were not reported (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, differential responses in the firing and Per1 rhythms to a shifted lightdark cycle have been reported both in vivo and in vitro (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase shift was large and persistent in the Per1 rhythm but was transient in the firing rhythm in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SCN network may keep the sensitivity of circadian clock through the circadian voltage rhythm and respond rapidly to environmental stimulation through the Ca2+ rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be required to clarify the physiological roles of the synchronous voltage rhythms in the SCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animal_Care  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6J mice (Clea Japan), AVP-Cre mice (12), and Viptm1(cre)Zjh/J mice (Jackson Laboratory) on the C57BL/6J background were used for the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were born and bred in our animal quarters under controlled environmental conditions (temperature: 22 ± 2 °C, humidity: 60 ± 5%, 12-h light/12-h dark, with lights on from 0600 to 1800 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light intensity was around 100 lx at the cage surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were fed commercial chow and tap water ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were conducted in compliance with the rules and regulations established by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University under the ethical permission of the Animal Research Committee of Hokkaido University (approval no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15-0153).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SCN_Slice_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were decapitated in the middle of the light phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brains of neonate (1-d-old or 4- to 6-d-old) male and female mice were removed rapidly and dipped in an ice-cold balanced salt solution comprising 87 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM glucose, 10 mM Hepes, and 75 mM sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 200-m coronal brain slice containing the mid rostrocaudal region of the SCN was carefully prepared using a vibratome (VT 1200; Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bilateral SCNs were dissected from the slice using a surgical knife and were explanted onto a culture membrane (Millicell CM; pore size, 0.4 m; Millipore) in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 1.0 mL of DMEM (Invitrogen) and 5% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the recordings, the membrane containing the cultured SCN slice was cut out, flipped over, and transferred to glass-bottomed dishes (35 mm, No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1-S; AGC Techno Glass) or MED probes (20 × 20 m) that were collagen coated (Cellmatrix type 1-C, Nitta Gelatin; Wako) and supplemented with 180250 L DMEM containing 5% supplement solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED dishes were sealed with O2-permeable filters (High-Sensitivity Membrane Kit; YSI) using silicone grease compounds (SH111; Dow Corning Toray).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Aliquots of the AAV (1 L) harboring hSyn1-jRGECO1 (37), hSyn1-ArcLightD, hSyn1-Flex-ArcLightD (produced by the University of Pennsylvania Gene Therapy Program Vector Core), and custom-made Elongation Factor 1 (EF1) -RGECO were inoculated onto the surface of the SCN cultures on day 46 of culture (Protocol 1) or on day 2 of culture (Protocol 2) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When multiple sensors were transfected in the SCN, AAVs were transfected on two subsequent days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infected slices were cultured further for at least 14 d before confocal imaging (Protocol 1) or for 7 d before CCD/MED imaging (Protocol 2) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The titers of hSyn1-jRGECO1, hSyn1-ArcLightD, and hSyn1-Flex-ArcLightD vector were 1.1 × 1013, 2.4 × 1013, and 1.2 × 1013 genome copies/mL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To make AAV encoding EF1-RGECO, the AAV-2 inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-containing plasmid pAAV-EF1-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP (provided by K. Deisseroth, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) was modified to construct pAAV-EF1-RGECO1 by replacing DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP cDNA with the RGECO1 cDNA fragment from the plasmid CMV-RGECO1 (provided by T. Nagai, Osaka University, Osaka).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV-RGECO with a mutant form of the AAV-2 cap gene (provided by A. Srivastava, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) (48) was produced using a triple-transfection, helper-free method and was purified as described previously (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The titer of RGECO vector was 9.8 × 1012 genome copies/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Resolution_Confocal_Imaging_of_ArcLightD_and_RGECO  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence images were captured at an exposure of 25 s. Images of 100-m depth in the z axis were obtained at 2-m z-steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging system was composed of a Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscope (X-Light; Crest Optics), a NEO sCMOS CCD camera (2,560 × 2,160 pixels, 0.325-m resolution) (Andor Technology) or an iXon3 EM-CCD camera (1,024 × 1,024 pixels, 0.8125-m resolution) (Andor Technology), a Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon), Plan Apo VC dry objectives (20×, 0.75 NA) (Nikon), a TIXHB box incubator (Tokai-hit), and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ArcLightD was excited by cyan color (475/28 nm) with an LED light source (Spectra X Light Engine; Lumencor, Inc.), and the fluorescence was visualized with 495-nm dichroic mirror and 550/49-nm emission filters (Semrock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGECO/jRGECO was excited by green color (542/27 nm), and the fluorescence was visualized with 593-nm dichroic mirror and 630/92-nm emission filters (Semrock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression patterns of ArcLightD fluorescence were visualized using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (1,024 × 1,024 pixels) (A1R-FN1; Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed at 36.5 °C and 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simultaneous_Recording_of_the_ArcLightD_and_Spontaneous_Firing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SCN slice was cultured in 100% air at 36.5 °C on an MED probe with 64 electrodes (20 × 20 m) arranged in an 8 × 8 grid with a distance of 100 m between electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the recording, the MED dish was placed in a mini-incubator installed on the stage of a microscope (Eclipse 80i; Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ArcLightD fluorescence and spontaneous firing were recorded simultaneously while culturing in culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence was recorded with a cooled CCD camera at 80 °C (ImagEM; Hamamatsu Photonics) every 60 min with an exposure time of 23 s. ArcLightD was excited with an LED light (Light Engine; Lumencor, Inc.) at cyan color (475/28 nm), and the fluorescence was visualized with 495-nm dichroic mirrors and 520/35-nm emission filters (Semrock).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from cultured SCN slice neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were visualized with a 60× water-immersion objective lens (LumPlanFL N, 1.0 NA; Olympus) using an upright microscope (BX50WI; Olympus) equipped with infrared/differential interference contrast systems and an EM-CCD camera (ImagEM; Hamamatsu Photonics) and a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU10; Yokogawa Electric).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole-cell electrodes (resistance of 57 M) were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (GD-1.5; Narishige Scientific Instruments) and were pulled on a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made with an internal solution containing the following: 140 mM K-gluconate, 4 mM KCl, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgATP, 0.2 mM NaGTP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices were continuously superfused with a physiological recording solution containing the following: 0.81 mM MgSO4, 5.36 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 1.26 mM CaCl2, 136.9 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 4.17 mM NaHCO3, and 5.55 mM d-glucose, at flow rates of 23 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed at 32 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses were recorded using a MultiClamp700B amplifier, Digidata 1550A, and pClamp10.5 (Molecular Devices), filtered at 10 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For validation of ArcLightD signals, current-clamp recordings were obtained in solutions containing 0.5, 3, 5.36, and 10 mM KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean membrane potentials were calculated using 1-s data from individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SCN slices expressing ArcLightD were incubated in DMEM containing 50 g/mL colchicine for 24 h and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 60 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by 60-min incubation with skim milk at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For labeling AVP and VIP neurons, the SCN slices were stained using mouse anti-AVP monoclonal antibody (generous gift of H. Gainer, NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda) (1:1,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-VIP polyclonal antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Peptide Institute), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days later, Alexa 594-conjugated goat IgG (1:200 dilution; Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody for mouse IgG (AVP) and rabbit IgG (VIP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were mounted on a glass-bottomed dish with Prolong Gold-DAPI (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence was visualized using an iXon3 Nipkow spinning disk confocal and EM-CCD camera (Andor Technology) and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis_and_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism GraphPad (GraphPad Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group mean was presented as the mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The t test was used when two independent group means were compared, and the MannWhitney u test or Welchs t test was used when the variances of two group means were different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A paired t test or a one-sample t test was used when two dependent group means were compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak phases of the rhythms were estimated by the midpoint of the rising and falling limbs of detrended circadian rhythm that intersected the x axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For regional comparison of the rhythms, 100 × 100 m ROIs in the upper third (near the third ventricle) and in the bottom two-thirds (near the optic chiasma) were selected as the dorsal and ventral regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the rhythms at the SCN network, we used a custom-made program for the creation of acrophase maps as described previously (7, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, fluorescence images were smoothed with the median filter (one pixel) and converted to eight-bit intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background signals were selected from a region where no cells were found (referred to as the background region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean + 5 SDs of the signal intensity of the background region was set as the cutoff level of the signal and background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time series of the images in each pixel [Yj (ti); ti = 1, 2, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ., N (h)] was fitted to cosine curve yj(t) = yj (t; Mj, Aj, Cj, Tj) = Mj + Aj * cosine [2pi (t  Cj)/Tj] using a least-square regression method, where yj(t) is the signal intensity at time t (h), Mj is the mesor, Aj is the amplitude, Cj is the acrophase, and Tj is the period of the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goodness of fit was statistically evaluated by the percent of rhythm accounted for by the fitted cosine wave (Pearson product-moment correlation analysis) at a significance level of P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all figures, acrophase maps are shown by pseudocolor, and pixels with unfitted rhythms and background level signals are shown by white color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean acrophase of the entire SCN regions is separately normalized to zero for voltage and Ca2+ rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the rhythmicity in the ROIs, fluorescence signals in each ROI were fitted to cosine curves using a least-square regression method, and the goodness of fit was evaluated by cosine curve fitting and percent rhythm (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
