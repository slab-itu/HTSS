Evaporation-induced stimulation of bacterial osmoregulation for electrical assessment of cell viability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conventional bacterial viability assays rely on cell multiplication until they are detectable by optical, electrical, or other sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the assay time of classical growth-based techniques ranges from hours to weeks depending on bacteria type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we present a fundamentally different paradigm based on bacterial osmoregulation to identify viable cells in minutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our label-free platform relies on two key advances: (i) the fact that osmoregulation is as universal as cell division and (ii) the ability to create a microliter-sized environment on a specially designed multifunctional structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our contribution advances the field with a collage of ideas from diverse disciplines (e.g., biology, microfluidics, surface energetics, and impedance spectroscopy) and therefore, will attract a broad audience of physicists, material scientists, biologists, and engineers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacteria cells use osmoregulatory proteins as emergency valves to respond to changes in the osmotic pressure of their external environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of these emergency valves has been known since the 1960s, but they have never been used as the basis of a viability assay to tell dead bacteria cells apart from live ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we show that osmoregulation provides a much faster, label-free assessment of cell viability compared with traditional approaches that rely on cell multiplication (growth) to reach a detectable threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells are confined in an evaporating droplet that serves as a dynamic microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaporation-induced increase in ionic concentration is reflected in a proportional increase of the droplets osmotic pressure, which in turn, stimulates the osmoregulatory response from the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By monitoring the time-varying electrical conductance of evaporating droplets, bacterial cells are identified within a few minutes compared with several hours in growth-based methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show the versatility of the proposed method, we show detection of WT and genetically modified nonhalotolerant cells (Salmonella typhimurium) and dead vs. live differentiation of nonhalotolerant (such as Escherichia coli DH5) and halotolerant cells (such as Staphylococcus epidermidis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the growth-based techniques, the assay time of the proposed method is independent of cell concentration or the bacteria type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed label-free approach paves the road toward realization of a new class of real time, array-formatted electrical sensors compatible with droplet microfluidics for laboratory on a chip applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

1_Bacterial_Cells_Under_Osmotic_Shock  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To maintain their rigidity, bacteria cells develop a natural turgor pressure (0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turgor pressure is the difference of osmotic pressure across cell wall and defined as=cytout,[S1]where cyt and out are the osmotic pressure inside (i.e., cytoplasm) and outside the cell, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osmotic pressure is proportional to the concentration of all of the osmolytes in the solution and is given bycRT,[S2]where c is the effective concentration of the existing osmolytes (in osmolar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R and T are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depending on the osmotic pressure of the external solution, out, three conditions are defined: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the external osmolarity is in such a way that 0, the solution is isotonic to cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Escherichia coli, 0  25 atm (22, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a cells surrounding solution has a lower solute concentration (therefore, lower osmotic pressure) than cells cytoplasm, water molecules diffuse inward to compensate for the osmotic pressure difference across the cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a solution is called hypotonic to the cell ( greater than 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the external osmolarity is larger than the cytoplasms osmolarity (i.e., less_than0), the medium is called hypertonic to cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation could occur in the case of draft or evaporation of the external solution, which results in increase of the concentration of the osmolytes (including ions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When a cell is caught in the rain or after laboratory dilution, the inward diffusion of water through the lipid bilayer generates a huge osmotic pressure that can rise to hundreds of atmospheresfar beyond what the cell envelope (peptidoglycan network) can withstand (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria subjected to a hypotonic shock release internal ions and also metabolites (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell integrity is maintained through the interplay between the peptidoglycan cell wall, which provides a constraining force, and MS channels that modulate the turgor pressure (10, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any increase in the turgor pressure beyond 0 causes the MS channels to open up and pump the osmolytes out without lysis of the cells (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2_Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used Lysogeny broth as the growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysogeny broth was prepared in house by dissolving 10 g tryptone (Sigma Aldrich Co.), 10 g yeast extract (Sigma Aldrich Co.), and 1 g NaCl (Sigma Aldrich Co.) in 950 mL deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lysogeny broth flask was then autoclaved on liquid cycle for 20 min and stored at 4 °C for future use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare live and dead samples, we performed the following procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the original samples (both live and dead), the cells were serially diluted in the TM at concentrations ranging from 15 × 104 to 15 × 108 cells per milliliter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the end of the incubation to the impedance measurement, the solutions were kept at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate that cells are intact in DI water, we checked their shape and motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1A shows live cells with a concentration of 3 × 108 cells per milliliter in DI water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen, the cells have maintained their rod-shaped structure and have not been lysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, Movie S1 shows that cells are moving around and therefore, alive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to confirm that our approach is nondestructive, we performed plate counting on samples in our TM and compared it with samples in Lysogeny broth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S1B, there is insignificant change in the cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are the average of four independent reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an aside, we should mention that there are several reports on bacteria sensing, including those on live/dead detection assays, that are done in DI water without any lethality being reported (1, 30, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3_Quantification_of_the_Concentration_of_the_Ions_Released_from_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the density of ions released from cells, we performed separate conductance measurements on live and heat-treated samples after removing the cells from the solution (to eliminate any contribution from the cells in the conductance) and prepared the respective solutions as Sl and Sd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare Sl and Sd, the following steps are carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

4_Comparison_of_This_Platform_with_Standard_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed serial dilution followed by colony counting after 1 d of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 plots the results by performing plate counting (after 1 d of incubation at 37 °C) on different samples (L2L5 with tot=107,106,105,and104cfu/mL, respectively) with  as the x axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live and dead (heat-treated) solutions are prepared following the same steps that we used for preparing our ready to measure samples (SI Text, 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample Preparation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples with 0less_thanless_than1 are prepared by mixing the corresponding portions of live and dead solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate counting method provides an excellent counting of live cells (comparable with our approach) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the colony counting experiment took 24 h, whereas Fig 3B was generated in 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

5_Detection_of_Halotolerant_Cells__Staphylococcus_epidermidis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were initially incubated overnight in Lysogeny broth medium at 37 °C in a shaking incubator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then washed and resuspended in DI water to remove the residual components from the growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead samples were prepared by high treatment as mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By serial dilution, samples with tot  0.81 × 105 and 0.81 × 106 cells per milliliter (determined by plate counting) were prepared for the impedance sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, shown in Fig S4A, show that our assay can detect these cells unambiguously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also electrically validated the larger turgor pressure of S. epidermidis cells than E. coli cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After resuspension of cells in DI water, we performed impedance monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown in Fig S4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In live cells, because of the hypotonic shock, MS channels open up and eject some of the cytoplasmic content to the external solution, which in turn, results in an increase of the electrical conductance; the larger the turgor pressure, the larger the conductance increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, S. epidermidis cells generate larger conductance than E. coli cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Fig S4 shows that, as expected, dead cells have a larger conductance than live ones, because their cell envelope becomes fully permeable after the heat treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1 illustrates the experimental protocol used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live samples are prepared from overnight cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate the parasitic effects of the growth medium on the conductance signal, these cells are resuspended in deionized (DI) water (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a reference, dead cells are prepared by heating an aliquot of live samples at 80 °C for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we intentionally did not lyse the cells but just damaged their protein channels by heat to impair cells ability to osmoregulate (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the sample preparation are given in SI Text, 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample Preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that resuspension of cells in DI water or the testing medium (TM) used in this work does not cause noticeable damage to cell integrity and viability, as confirmed by optical imaging and colony counting results, respectively shown in Fig S1 A and B, and also by their motion as observed in Movie S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After resuspension of cells in the TM, droplets of 3-µL volume are deposited on a pair of specially designed superhydrophobic electrodes (that hold the shape of the droplets), and the droplet conductance is monitored as it evaporates from ti* to tf* (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 C and D plot conductance signals as a function of evaporation time, G(t*), for live and dead samples with concentrations ranging from 104 to 107 cells per milliliter; t* is the time normalized to the total evaporation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, live and dead samples have different conductance values as explained in Discussion, Conductance Increases with Cell Concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will discuss in Discussion, Repeated Sampling During Evaporation Significantly Improves the Accuracy, the sampled data will be used to extract the unknown parameters [i.e., the total cell concentration (tot) and the ratio of live cells () in a given sample].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Design of the superhydrophobic electrodes is critical for creating droplets with a highly reproducible geometric shape, which is essential for high-precision measurement of impedance of evaporating droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained in detail elsewhere (25, 28), there is a universal behavior of the sensor signal with respect to the initial droplet volume and total evaporation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method only relies on the normalized differential conductance (correlated to the ionic modulation), and therefore, the experimental results are insensitive to evaporation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the technique is simple and inexpensive: apart from the initial cost of fabrication, a sensor can be reused hundreds of times with no loss in performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conductance_Increases_Because_of_Activation_of_MS_Channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As illustrated in Fig 2, when cells are initially resuspended in DI water at t0*, out=DI0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, they experience a significant turgor shock beyond the natural turgor pressure, 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To restore the natural turgor, the MS channels open up and pump out the cytoplasmic osmolytes, including ionic entities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gating process (opening and closing of the MS channels) and restoring of 0 happens in less than a millisecond (tMS*) (10, 11, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Release of ions from cytoplasm to the external solution results in a conductance increase with respect to the analyte-free solution, consistent with our results in SI Text, 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the Concentration of the Ions Released from Cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cells_Steal_Ions_from_the_Droplet_as_It_Evaporates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When exposed to an increase in out, during droplet evaporation from ti* to tf* (see Fig 2), bacteria respond by uptake of osmolytes either from the environment or by synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fastest response involves the uptake of K+ ions from the environment through turgor-responsive transport systems, such as TrK (12, 21, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake of ions from the droplet is reflected in an effective decrease in ionic contribution of each cell (*; defined as per-cell conductivity) with time as schematically shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stealing of ions from droplet reduces solution conductance over time compared with the scenario where cells are irresponsive to the modulation of osmotic pressure (dashed and dotted line in Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Discussion, Electrical Probing of Physiological Processes, we will use the time-dependent conductance data to calculate the rate of ion stealing by cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our preliminary studies on different mutants of S. typhimurium show that, depending on the osmoregulatory channels present, cells respond differently to droplet evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conductance_Increases_with_Cell_Concentration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plotted in Fig 3A are the time-averaged signals Yl and Yd as a function of tot down to 104 cells per milliliter for live and dead E. coli samples, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define Yj=1kG(tj)Gref(tj)/Gref(tj), where k is the total sampling number during droplet evaporation (here, k=9), and Gref is the conductance of cell-free droplets; Yl and Yd are calculated from the plots shown in Fig 1 C and D, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows that (i) samples with dead cells generate larger electrical conductance and (ii) conductance increases with cell concentration, tot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results can be explained as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Repeated_Sampling_During_Evaporation_Significantly_Improves_the_Accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a given sample, the numbers of live and dead cells are nl (lnl/V0) and nd (dnd/V0), respectively, with V0 being the initial droplet volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of live cells to the total number of cells is, hence,ltot(=l+d)=nlntot(=nl+nd),where totntot/V0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By assuming that the total conductance, Gm(t), is a linear combination of conductance of live and dead cells, we write Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 asGm(t)=(l(t)+d(t))Hzg(t)=V0HztotV(t)g(t)[l(tot,t)+(1)d(tot,t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]Here, l(t) and d(t) are the contributions of individual live and dead cells, respectively, to the total conductivity, and Hz represents the time-invariant length of the deposited droplet; g(t) is the geometry factor defined exclusively by the (time-) evolving shape of the droplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details on the droplet circuit model and conductance formulation can be found elsewhere (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the viability ratio () of a sample, we conducted a pair of impedance measurements as follows (Fig 3A, Inset): (i) on the sample as prepared, Gm(t), and (ii) after heating the sample at 80 °C for 20 min, Gh(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating step kills all of the cells and pins  to zero (independently verified by the colony counting method).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Gh(t) is given by setting =0 in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1:Gh(t)=V0Hztot*V(t)g(t)[d(tot*,t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]To estimate tot in an unknown sample, we need to predetermine two calibration curves for Y(tot,) [e.g., live (1) and dead (0)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the results for E. coli samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the unknown sample is heated and bacterial cells are heat-killed, the time-averaged signal shifts up from Ym to Yh, such as in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersection of Yh [average of Gh(t) over t] with Yd gives the estimated total cell concentration, denoted by tot*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows tot* vs. the prepared cell concentration tot (independently determined by standard plate counting) for five different E. coli samples: S#1S#5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between the estimated and actual values is strong, and tot* differs from tot by less than a factor of two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excellent reproducibility is attributed to (i) the time-multiplexing aspect of droplet-based sensing and (ii) sampling a small volume (microliter droplets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By inserting tot* into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, we obtain(t)=[1Gm(t)Gh(t)][1Gl(t)Gd(t)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]Fig 4A plots (t) for the same samples discussed in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define the estimated  as estimt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B shows estim vs.  (the ratio when live and dead cells were mixed manually) for these samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By averaging the data points obtained in a single run (nine points in this report), the noise in the data is reduced dramatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plots confirm that different responses of osmoregulatory live and dead cells to the dynamic microenvironment enable their identification with a very high precision (1015%) down to 20% (comparable with the colony counting method as shown in Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to E. coli (nonhalotolerant), we have shown the versatility of our technique by analyzing halotolerant cells, such as Staphylococcus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results for S. epidermidis cells (SI Text, 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of Halotolerant Cells: Staphylococcus epidermidis) confirm that the proposed osmoregulation-based method successfully differentiates between live and dead S. epidermidis cells (Fig S4A), and also, the electrical conductance data confirms that S. epidermidis has higher turgor pressure compared with E. coli cells (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it is important to realize that there are several excellent techniques for detection of bacterial viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques can be broadly divided into growth-based vs. nongrowth-based assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth-based techniques [such as colony counting (14), impedance microbiology (1619), monitoring the resonance frequency (32), etc.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rely on cell division to reach a threshold level so that the signal becomes detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical incubation time can vary from hours to days depending on the cell type and initial cell concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach provides accuracy and dynamic range comparable with the colony counting method (Fig S3) or impedance microbiology, but is several orders of magnitude faster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, unlike growth-based methods, detection time of our assay is independent of the initial cell density and cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second category (i.e., nongrowth-based methods) includes (i) dye-based staining [dynamic range of 104108 cells per milliliter and detection time of approximately minutes (15, 33)], (ii) molecular-based methods [involving antibody-based ELISA or fluorescent readout of amplified DNA or mRNA with dynamic range of 104108 cells per milliliter and detection time of approximately minutes to 1 h (3436)], (iii) dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based differentiation [dynamic range of 105106 cells per milliliter and detection time of approximately minutes (3, 17, 37)], and (iv) light-addressable potentiometric sensors [dynamic range of 104105 cells per milliliter and detection time of approximately minutes (38)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with these assays, our technique offers similar dynamic range (105108 cells per milliliter) and detection time (approximately minutes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared with the classical techniques, the new approach has two advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, this label-free technique reduces the time for sample preparation and cost/complexity of attaching labels to analyte molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, its small size and compatibility with standard microfabrication techniques suggest opportunities of massive parallelization (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have proposed a fundamentally different route for label-free determination of bacterial viability based on stimulating their osmoregulatory response in an artificially created microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is based on the idea that confining cells in a dynamic environment with varying osmotic pressure would trigger their osmoregulatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the osmoregulatory emergency valves results in exchange of solutes with the external environment, which in turn, is reflected in modulation of the solution conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to the conventional growth-based assays, the proposed method has a much shorter assay time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The techniques are not mutually exclusive: the sensitivity/selectivity of the current approach can be further improved with a pregrowth step (as an initial selective preamplification) that precedes the droplet-based assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although a systematic statistical analysis is required for its adoption as a clinical technique, the proposed label-free miniaturized assay could find broader application as a fast, nondestructive, electrical characterization technique of various biophysiological processes in microorganisms, such as in studying different classes of proteins responsible for ionic exchange of cells with their extracellular environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Preparation_of_Bacterial_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E. coli DH5, S. epidermidis cells, and S. typhimurium mutants (provided as a gift from Laszlo Csonka at Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN) were collected from a frozen stock maintained at 80 °C and cultured in Lysogeny broth nutrient broth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial suspensions were prepared by following the procedure described in SI Text, 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample Preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after overnight incubation in Lysogeny broth medium prepared in house, density of the grown cells was determined through OD reading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then washed and resuspended in DI water to remove the residual components from the growth medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat-treated cells were then obtained by heating an aliquot of live cells for 20 min at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By serial dilution, different samples with varying cell concentrations were prepared for the impedance sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the tests presented here, the bacteria were incubated off chip in a macroscale volume before deposition on the sensing electrode array for impedance measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference medium in our experiments (TM), the medium mixed with cells before the impedance measurements, is composed of 1 µg/mL tryptone, 1 µg/mL yeast extract, and 0.1 µg/mL NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Device_Structure_and_Testing_Apparatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fabrication procedure of superhydrophobic nickel microelectrodes is explained in detail in our previous papers (25, 26, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biosensor has a two-electrode configuration, with each electrode being an array of electroplated nickel fins (microscale structures) with width of a=10µm, height of H=10µm, spacing of b=20µm, and in-plane length of Hz=4mm patterned and deposited on a glass substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each impedance measurement, we took out a 3-µL droplet of the sample using a micropipette and deposited it on the electrode array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terminal pads are electrically connected to an HP-A4280 LCR Meter, where the impedance is measured by application of a 50-mV ac signal at frequencies ranging from 120 Hz to 1 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results shown in this work are measured at f=600Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
