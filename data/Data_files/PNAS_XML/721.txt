title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photoacoustic trace detection of gases at the parts-per-quadrillion level with a moving optical grating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The photoacoustic effect refers to the generation of sound through a process of optical heat deposition followed by thermal expansion, resulting in a local pressure increase that produces outgoing acoustic waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the linear acoustic regime, a unique property of the photoacoustic effect in a geometry with symmetry in one dimension is that when the optical source moves at the speed of sound, the amplitude of the acoustic wave increases linearly in time without bound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the application of this effect to trace gas detection is described, using an optical grating that moves at the sound speed inside of a resonator equipped with a resonant piezoelectric crystal detector, yielding detection limits in the parts-per-quadrillion range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amplitude of the photoacoustic effect for an optical source moving at the sound speed in a one-dimensional geometry increases linearly in time without bound in the linear acoustic regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, use of this principle is described for trace detection of gases, using two frequency-shifted beams from a CO2 laser directed at an angle to each other to give optical fringes that move at the sound speed in a cavity with a longitudinal resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoacoustic signal is detected with a high-Q, piezoelectric crystal with a resonance on the order of 443 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoacoustic cell has a design analogous to a hemispherical laser resonator and can be adjusted to have a longitudinal resonance to match that of the detector crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grating frequency, the length of the resonator, and the crystal must all have matched frequencies; thus, three resonances are used to advantage to produce sensitivity that extends to the parts-per-quadrillion level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematic of the experimental apparatus used for high-frequency photoacoustic trace detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two light paths from the acousto-optic light modulators (AOM) are matched to ensure that the two 10.6-m laser beams are phase coherent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beams intersect in the acoustic cell (AC) with the power monitored by a thermal detector (TD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersection angle can be tuned by Mirror 1 (M1), which is mounted on a motorized precision rotation stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference to the lock-in amplifier is generated by feeding the outputs from the two function generators (FG) to a mixer and using a low-pass filter (LPF) so that only the difference frequency from the mixer is sent to the lock-in amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transducer voltage output vs. incremental cell length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell length was continuously increased using a micrometer attached to a motorized rotation stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lock-in amplifier output vs. mole fraction for three gases in N2 and for SF6 in Ar (top curve, SF6 I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection limit for SF6 in ultrahigh-purity Ar is 750 parts per quadrillion using the -BiB3O6 crystal and 10 parts per trillion for SF6 in N2 using the LiNbO3 transducer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Voltage output in arbitrary units (a.u.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vs. grating frequency for the -BiB3O6 crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -BiB3O6was chosen for the experiments because of its combination of a high quality factor and large value of the charge per unit force applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first part of this section, we present details of the calculation of the photoacoustic pressure; then we show that when the expression for the pressure is substituted back into the original wave equation, a series expansion can be used to prove its validity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show explicitly the resonance conditions implied in the solution for the photoacoustic pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the same variables are used here as in the main text, and thus no further identification of the variables is given.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reader is referred to the theory part of the main text for the meanings of the different variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Solution_to_the_Wave_Equation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The photoacoustic pressure, when the heat conduction and viscosity are ignored, obeys the following wave equation:(21c22t2)p(,t)=CpH(,t)t.[S1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Fourier transform of the above equation into the frequency domain gives(2+k2)p(,)=iCpH(,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the moving optical grating investigated here, the heating function can be written asH(,t)=¯I¯(1+cos(t)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Thus the source term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, expressed in the frequency domain, iss(z,)=i¯I¯Cpeitcos(qzt)dt=i¯I¯2Cp[ei(qztt)+ei(qzt+t)]dt=i¯I¯Cp[eiqz(+)+eiqz()].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Greens function for a one-dimensional longitudinal resonator of length L is given byG(z,z,)=2Ln=1cos(knz)cos(knz)k2kn2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The integration of the Greens function G with the source term s gives the pressure in the frequency domain asp(z,)=0LG(z,z,)s(z,)dz=i2¯I¯CpLn=1cos(knz)k2kn2[(+)0Lcos(knz)eiqzdz+()0Lcos(knz)eiqzdz].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we denote p1(z,)=cos(knz)/(k2kn2)0Lcos(knz)eiqzdz and p2(z,)=cos(knz)/(k2kn2)0Lcos(knz)eiqzdz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is easy to show that p1 and p2 are complex conjugates of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first of these, p1, can be evaluated asp1(z,)=12icos(knz)k2kn2[eiL(q+kn)1q+kn+eiL(qkn)1qkn].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transformation of the pressure back into the time domain yieldsp(z,t)=12p(z,)eitd=i¯I¯CpL[p1(z,)(+)eit+p2(z,)()eit]d=i¯I¯CpL[p1(z,)eitp2(z,)eit].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then denote p1=i¯I¯/(CpL)p1(z,)eit and p2=i¯I¯/(CpL)p2(z,)eit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that p1 and p2 are also complex conjugates of each other so that p=p1+p2=2Re(p1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The real part of p1 can be readily calculated to give the photoacoustic pressure distribution within the resonator asp(z,t)=¯I¯Cpn=1cos(knz)(c)2(nL)2{sinc(L(q+kn)2)×sin[tL(q+kn)2]+sinc(L(qkn)2)×sin[tL(qkn)2]}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By expanding the terms sin[t±L(q+kn)2], Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 can be rewritten asp(z,t)=¯I¯Cpn=1cos(knz)(c)2(nL)2{cos(t)[cos[(kn+q)L]1(kn+q)Lcos[(knq)L]1(knq)L]+sin(t)[sin[(knq)L](knq)L+sin[(kn+q)L](kn+q)L]}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Verification_of_the_Solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We substitute the solution Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 back into the original wave equation Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 to giveLHS=(2z21c22t2)p(z,t)=¯I¯Cpn=1cos(knz){sinc(L(q+kn)2)sin[tL(q+kn)2]+sinc(L(qkn)2)sin[tL(qkn)2]},[S11](LHS, left-hand side), which essentially indicates a summation of an infinite series of standing waves in the resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The source term on the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 givesRHS=¯I¯Cpsin(tqz),[S12]which indicates a traveling wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find its relationship with the LHS, we expand the RHS in the following way:sin(tqz)=n=1fn(t)2Lcos(knz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S13]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the basis function gn(z)=2Lcos(knz) satisfies the orthonormality condition; that is,0Lgn(z)gm(z)dz=nm,[S14]where nm is the Kronecker delta function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, the coefficient fn is given byfn=2L0Lsin(tqz)cos(knz)dz=L2{sinc(L(q+kn)2)sin[tL(q+kn)2]+sinc(L(qkn)2)sin[tL(qkn)2]}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S15]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is finally found that LHS=RHS, which validates the above solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Resonance_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As has been discussed in the main text, two resonance conditions are implied in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9, the first one being /c=n/L and the second one kn=q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two conditions can be rewritten asL=n2cTg,[S16a]L=n2,[S16b]where Tg and  are the period and wavelength of the moving optical grating, and c is the sound speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the above two equations yieldsc=Tg,[S17]which implies that at the resonance condition the optical grating moves at the sound speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Also note that at resonance the frequency of the acoustic wave fa must be matched with the frequency of the optical grating fg; that is, fa=fg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we have the second resonance conditionL=na2,[S18]where a is the wavelength of the photoacoustic wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18 is the typical resonance condition of a longitudinal resonator, which states that at resonance the cell length is an integral number of half wavelengths of the standing wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resonance_Modes_of_the_Acoustic_Cell  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As predicted by Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S18, a series of longitudinal resonances exists in the acoustic cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiments, one side of the acoustic cell was a concave reflector attached to a micrometer which could be used to adjust the length of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the longitudinal resonances of the acoustic cell, the micrometer was bonded to a motorized rotation stage (Newport, Inc.; model 495CC) such that the controlled rotation could be transformed into the translation of the concave reflector with a resolution of 0.025 mm, which enabled investigation of the signal dependence on cell length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that the pressure amplitude at the end of the cell varies sinusoidally as the cell length changes, and the distance between adjacent amplitude peaks is well matched to the half wavelength of the acoustic wave, which is around 0.36 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that the peak pressure amplitude decreases with increasing cell length, which can be ascribed to a decreased acoustic energy density within the cell and increased acoustic damping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_the_Equivalent_Absorption_Coefficient  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The detection limit that was obtained from the experiment was expressed in units of mole fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is common practice to express the detection limit in terms of the absorption coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find the corresponding absorption coefficient, the infrared spectrum for an SF6/Ar mixture with a mole fraction of 0.1% and a total pressure of 1 atm was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transmittance of 50% is observed at 943 cm1, which is the wavenumber of the CO2 laser output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The molar absorption coefficient can be calculated based on the BeerLambert law, which states thatI=I010cl,[S19]where I and I0 are the intensities of the transmitted and incident light,  is the molar absorption coefficient, c is the molar concentration, and l is the medium path length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SF6 the molar absorption coefficient at 943 cm1 was calculated to be 2,655 L/(cmmol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity expressed in terms of the absorption coefficient  can then be evaluated through=c,[S20]where c is related to the mole fraction by c=Px/(RT) with x being the mole fraction at the detection limit, P the mixture pressure, R the gas constant, and T the temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detector_Noise_Spectrum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To record the noise spectrum of the detector, the cell was first evacuated and filled with pure Ar to 1 atm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acousto-optic modulators were scanned near the resonance frequency of the -BiB3O6 crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the laser power adjusted to 1 W, the voltage output from the transducer was recorded and averaged for 10 scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen from Fig S2 that a peak appears near the resonance frequency of the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the magnitude of the noise peak remained the same with the laser either turned on or turned off, this peak is ascribed to the thermal noise of the crystal itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
