Ballistic thermophoresis of adsorbates on free-standing graphene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In thermophoresis, temperature gradients in a fluid cause a proportional force on a body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasonably, a small physisorbed cluster on a membrane-like system such as a graphene sheet suspended between temperatures T apart should do just thatexcept it doesnt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations show for submicrometer sheet length a phoretic force proportional to T but independent of length and thus of gradient, disclosing a regime of ballistic thermophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soft flexural phonons, ballistic in this regime, are responsible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anharmonic mechanism by which they carry real momentum, some of which is given to the adsorbate, involves longitudinal phonons that permit a mass accumulation moving with the flexural group velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance independence of ballistic thermophoretic force could be important in nanomanipulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The textbook thermophoretic force which acts on a body in a fluid is proportional to the local temperature gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same is expected to hold for the macroscopic drift behavior of a diffusive cluster or molecule physisorbed on a solid surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question we explore here is whether that is still valid on a 2D membrane such as graphene at short sheet length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By means of a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics study of a test systema gold nanocluster adsorbed on free-standing graphene clamped between two temperatures T apartwe find a phoretic force which for submicron sheet lengths is parallel to, but basically independent of, the local gradient magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This identifies a thermophoretic regime that is ballistic rather than diffusive, persisting up to and beyond a 100-nanometer sheet length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis shows that the phoretic force is due to the flexural phonons, whose flow is known to be ballistic and distance-independent up to relatively long mean-free paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ordinary harmonic phonons should only carry crystal momentum and, while impinging on the cluster, should not be able to impress real momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that graphene and other membrane-like monolayers support a specific anharmonic connection between the flexural corrugation and longitudinal phonons whose fast escape leaves behind a 2D-projected mass density increase endowing the flexural phonons, as they move with their group velocity, with real momentum, part of which is transmitted to the adsorbate through scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting distance-independent ballistic thermophoretic force is not unlikely to possess practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

System_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the physical results to be reached in this work are entangled with technical aspects of the simulation, we find it best to describe the system and methods first here, rather than letting the reader wonder about them until later chapters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Graphene is described by a CC Tersoff potential, reparametrized to better reproduce the experimental phonon spectrum (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gold cluster (N = 459) with internal fcc structure and truncated-octahedral shape was described with AuAu interactions of the embedded atom method (EAM) type, modified through a smooth cutoff (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster 36-atom (111) facet is physisorbed on graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction between gold and graphene atoms is assumed to be of LennardJones type with =22 meV and =2.74 Å, as parametrized by Lewis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28), a choice meant to reproduce the goldgraphite corrugation, rather than the adhesion energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulate a suspended graphene sheet of x length L and y width w 6.5 nm, with periodic boundary conditions along y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first C-atom row (x=0) and the last one (x=L) are frozen, thus clamping the graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A leftright temperature difference is introduced by coupling the first and the last 40 mobile atomic rows (x4.5 nm) of the graphene sheet to two Langevin thermostats at temperatures Thot and Tcold, respectively (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We typically use Thot475 K, Tcold325 K, and a Langevin damping coefficient of 10 ps1 strictly limited to the two thermostatted regions, leaving the largest middle part of the graphene sheet (and the cluster when present) unthermostatted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All initial equilibrium and subsequent NEMD simulations are conducted by using our home-developed code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two main approximations are the neglect of quantum effects and of the finite-size acoustical phonon gaps at k=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantum effects are absent in our entirely classical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that very reason (besides practical ones, including experimental accessibility), we choose to work at T400 K, a temperature that compromises between three constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) It is well above the temperature where the quantum effects of ZA flexural phonons (the dominant thermophoresis agent) become irrelevant (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) It is 1/5 of the LA (and TA) Debye temperatures (30), so that their specific quantum effect, although not irrelevant, are at least not dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LA and TA modes will anyway turn out not to contribute to thermophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) It is still below the higher temperature regimes where some phonon MFPs get anharmonically shorter than the system size (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finite-size acoustical phonon gaps at k = 0, on the other hand, would be a problem if their magnitude came close to our working temperature T = 400 K. Even for the smallest size considered, L = 30 nm, however, the LA phonon gap vLA/2L is only 1.4 meV, or 16 K (for vLA 22 km/s); the ZA gap  C/4L2 is for graphene 5×103 meV or 60 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At T400 K, both finite-size gaps are therefore irrelevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The adsorbate-free graphene sheet is simulated first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an approximate evaluation of the local temperature T(x), we subdivide the graphene sheet in slices of 0.5 nm along the gradient direction x, averaging the steady-state atomic temperatureobtained by the equipartition theorem, T=(2/3)NEkin/kBover the atoms in the slice and over a simulation time of at least 15 ns; Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cluster is then deposited near the center of the graphene sheet, following the adiabatic procedure described in Cluster Adsorption as a Function of Alignment, Effects of Constrained Angular Motion on Cluster, Free Energy Contribution to Thermophoresis, and Fig S1, a protocol which also permits the direct calculation of the (temperature-dependent) adsorption free energy in thermal equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these equilibrium conditions, the cluster undergoes thermal diffusion, both positional and angular (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the temperature difference T=ThotTcold is turned on, the cluster is observed to drift from hot to cold, as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The approximate uniformity of the cluster center-of-mass (CM) motion indicates that the clustergraphene friction is viscous (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an average thermophoretic force Fth and assuming a viscous friction coefficient , the equation of motion for the average CM velocity v isMdv(t)dt=Fthv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]Assuming the thermophoretic force to be sufficiently large to dominate fluctuations, the force can be extracted from the initial acceleration of the cluster from a rest condition with v(0)0 (Measuring the Thermophoretic Force from Acceleration at Small v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, once both the heat flow and the adsorbate drift reach the steady-state regime, the mean velocity v(t)=Fth/ can be extracted (2, 3, 7, 9, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neither method is very precise, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past work (32) showed that (T) is, in the diffusive regime, the time-averaged result of a sequence of cluster jumps, rotations, and pinning events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster needs a thermal fluctuation to misalign relative to the graphene lattice, and then it will positionally diffuse only when misaligned, events which occur stochastically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such erratic behavior, interesting as it is, requires very long simulation times, complicating the estimate of , and thus of Fth in our case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some improvement can be obtained by artificially locking the cluster orientation  relative to the underlying graphene lattice into a poorly commensurate state (e.g., at  = 30°) so as to obtain an artificially small but well-defined  and a large and smooth steady-state speed suitable to an accurate extraction of Fth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clear difference between the two phoretic regimes is visible in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different  values would lead to a different  and v. Ignoring a possible angular dependence of momentum pickup rate by the cluster from the sheet, their product Fth should be relatively independent of  as desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all cases, however, the extraction of Fth from the cluster trajectory is indirect, and thus tricky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore more convenient and immediate to measure directly the thermophoretic force Fth from the NEMD simulation, by harnessing the mobile object, as also done by others (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We artificially tie a spring to the cluster CM by means of a potential term (1/2)ksX2, where X is the cluster CM coordinate relative to the center of the sheet, and ks0 is a spring constant, strong enough to restrict the cluster motion to the most representative central (unthermostatted) part of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical trajectories of the harnessed cluster CM are shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, this kind of harnessed geometry might possibly be reproduced by an AFM tip, playing the role of our cluster, kept in place by a soft cantilever spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Owing to the modest cluster displacement permitted by the spring, Fth can be obtained with the desired accuracy within a much shorter simulation time, Fth=ksX, where X is the average cluster CM displacement along the gradient direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further reduce the error and accelerate the averaging, the cluster alignment angle  can be kept fixed by constraining =30°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before systematically doing that, we checked that the angular constraint does not influence the calculated thermophoretic force (see Effects of Constrained Angular Motion on Cluster and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3 for more information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The statistical error affecting our results can be estimated both by the fluctuations of Fth itself, SX=ks(XX)2, and additionally checked by the fluctuations of the force along the direction perpendicular to the thermal gradient, SY=ksY2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the position of the cluster has large autocorrelation times due to the slow dynamics, a block analysis has been performed (see Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our overall error in this procedure is estimated to be Ferr0.51.0 pN, compared with Fth2.010 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance the resolution on the calculated average force, we set the spring constant ks=0.001 meV/Å2 16 N/m, a value much smaller than the typical 1 N/m of AFM cantilevers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note that for a stiffer spring, the same resolution could be achieved by just increasing the simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cluster_Adsorption_as_a_Function_of_Alignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The static and dynamic properties of a gold cluster on graphene depend on the respective alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oscillations of the adhesion energy as a function of , visible in Fig S1, reflect a nanoscale remnant of the underlying moiré pattern connected with the incommensurability between the triangular Au(111) contact face and the honeycomb graphene lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the symmetric local minima at =± 9° are found by increasing cluster sizes (as shown here in Fig S1 for Au1358) to get deeper and converge toward a smaller value, foreshadowing the emergence of a spontaneous NovacoMcTague misalignment (61, 62) for infinite contact size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Au459, the six fully aligned orientations =0, ± 60°, ± 120°, 180° correspond to a pinned state, where the cluster has an energy barrier against both rotations and translations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the rotational energy barrier is smaller than the translational one (32, 42), thermal rotations are the first to be excited upon heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their effect is to make the interface misaligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this incommensurate state, the translational barrier drops dramatically, allowing positional diffusion to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall diffusive motion of the cluster consists therefore of an alternation of locked states at specific angles where only vibrations take place, and of diffusive states where the rotationally depinned cluster executes fast translations (32, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_Constrained_Angular_Motion_on_Cluster  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report in Fig S2 the convergence of the measured thermophoretic force for an Au459 cluster, with and without an applied constraint on the angular position , deposited on a 50 × 7 nm2 graphene layer subject to a thermal gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Fth are of 8.4±1.0 pN (unconstrained ) and 8.9±0.5 pN (constrained =30), well matching within the calculated uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the large difference in the required time for convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A more rigorous approach to the error estimate can be achieved with block analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure is simple: From the trajectories, we collect N values of the thermophoretic force Fth,i=Kxi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can then obtain the variance to the average Savg=1N1N1i=1NK(xixavg)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is an underestimate of the error, since it implies that all N points of the trajectory are completely uncorrelated in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is not our case since the motion of the cluster is dominatedat small timescalesby the oscillations of the dynamometric spring attached to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this issue, we group (or block) the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point xM is now the average of the force in M consecutive frames of the original trajectory (or equivalently in a section of the trajectory of total time M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance to the average is then obtained by: SavgM=1M1M1i=1N/MK(xMxavg)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For uncorrelated data, this value should be constant for all values of M. In our case instead SavgM does reach a plateau only for M large enough so that M is larger than the typical autocorrelation time of the cluster motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From such block analysis, we measure a correlation time of  3.5 ns for the unconstrained case, and  1 ns for the constrained case (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The much larger  in the former case is clearly related to the large sticking periods of the cluster when it becomes aligned with the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the much smaller  resulting from the angular constraint clearly reflects on the computational speed-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Free_Energy_Contribution_to_Thermophoresis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main result of our work is that the thermophoretic force arises as a scattering effect between ballistic flexural modes and the adsorbed cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the scattering process, some of positive physical momentum from the flexural phonon is transferred to the adsorbed cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is also a second contribution to the thermophoretic force of purely thermodynamic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A freestanding cluster in equilibrium at a temperature T has a free energy GAu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same applies to a freestanding graphene layer, having a free energy Ggr when in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature T. When the cluster is physisorbed on the graphene sheet, at equilibrium, it has a different free energy GAuC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference of free energy G=ETS, where E=EAugrEAuEgr and S=SAugrSAuSgr, is the adsorption free energy and will depend in general on temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a substrate endowed with a slowly varying temperature gradient, we can therefore define an adiabatic thermophoretic force asFthad=d(G)dx=d(G)dTdTdx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]This force acts on the cluster in the direction where the adsorption is stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, as occurs for most interfaces, the adsorption free energy deepens at lower temperatures, this thermodynamic force will push from hot to cold, as expected in thermophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated such thermodynamic force contribution by evaluating G as a function of T by means of thermodynamic integration (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the total potential energy is expressed in terms of separated contributions from graphene (CC), cluster (AuAu), and mixed (AuC) interactions:Utot()=Ugr+UAu+4UAugr,[S2]where  is a tunable parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, U(=1) describes the physisorbed cluster on graphene, whereas U(=0) describes noninteracting cluster and graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of 4 instead of a simple  is a convenient way to deal with divergences in the LennardJones interactions (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ThenG=01ddUd=01d43UAuC,[S3]where  is an equilibrium average under potential Utot(), to be estimated by standard MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting G(T) for the Au459 cluster on a 10×9 nm2 graphene sheet is 7.81±0.03 eV at 350 K and 7.63±0.03 eV at 450 K. These values correspond to an adiabatic thermophoretic force with the same direction as from simulations (i.e., from hot to cold), but a much smaller magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a typical thermal gradient of 1 K/nm, the calculated force is Fthad = 0.3±0.1 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such thermodynamic force is very small, in fact smaller than the estimated error on the thermophoretic forces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
obtained in the previous sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can therefore be safely neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measuring_the_Thermophoretic_Force_from_Acceleration_at_Small_v  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A first measure of the thermophoretic force can be obtained by studying the initial acceleration of a cluster, free to move over the graphene sheet, after the thermal gradient is switched on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a linear fit of the evolution of the cluster CM velocity, returns a value F=mdv/dt that suffers of poor precision, as shown in Fig S6, where transient acceleration is shown along with linear fit for three repeated runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting forces are F1= 8.9 pN, F2 = 6.7 pN, and F3 = 9.3 pN, which are roughly compatible with the value of F=8.9±0.5 pN obtained with the AFM-like setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temperature_Profile_and_Heat_Flux  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us begin with the results of an NEMD simulation of the free graphene sheet with the temperature imbalance, but without the adsorbed cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows the typical average steady-state temperature profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal gradient that will become relevant later is the slope, obtained as a linear fit, in the central region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steep temperature jumps near the two thermostatted regions are a common feature found in all NEMD simulations (8, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reasonable explanation generally offered for the jumps is the same as the Kapitza resistance jump (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constrained left and right borders are mechanically different from the inside, and a traveling wave through that interface is partially reflected, causing a thermal resistance similar to that at the interface between two different materials (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In reality, the temperature jumps and their magnitude contain a much more interesting underlying source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work by Maassen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25) has shown that near-border jumps in the effective temperature profile are present even for ideal contactswhere no reflection occurswhen at least some of the thermal current is ballistic, in the following sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In standard Boltzmann theory of thermal transport, the net heat current is the difference between forward and backward currents, IQ = IQ+  IQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following McKelvey (38) and Shockley (39), the scattering between forward and backward currents is controlled by a parameter, , roughly reflecting the phonon MFPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, the evolution of the heat currents inside the sample depends on the scattering probability between the two opposite currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering only phonons with a given energy ,dIQ+(x)dx=dIQ(x)dx=IQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]The temperatures of the two thermostats enter as boundary condition in the values of the two currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an assumed ideal nature of the contacts, the right-flowing current through the left contact is in equilibrium with the left thermostat at Thot, and similarly the left-flowing current through the right contact is in equilibrium at temperature Tcold, thenIQ,0+=Mhn(Thot)[5]andIQ,0=Mhn(Tcold),[6]where M() is the distribution of modes of the thermal conductor at energy , h is Plancks constant, and n(T) is the BoseEinstein function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupled Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6 for the currents can be solved to yield a value for the thermal gradient T which is not, in general, equal to T/L=(ThotTcold)/L, thus implying the two temperature jumps at the two thermostatted regions with ballistic transport variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ballistic thermal resistance equals in fact Rball=IQ/2T, where T is the temperature jump between thermostattedunthermostatted regions, assumed to be the same at left or right contacts since the thermostat efficiency is fixed (given by the Langevin damping rate and by the extent of the thermostatted area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this resistance is present even for ideal, nonreflective contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summing up, the border temperature jumps represent the prime evidence for at least some ballistic heat transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all of the heat current was transported ballistically, with zero dissipation from hot to cold, then both temperature jumps would be (in a symmetric case) T/2, and T = 0 in between.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, on the contrary, the heat flux was completely diffusive, then the jumps would disappear, Fouriers law would be obeyed throughout, and T = T/L everywhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature profile and the jumps in our simulated graphene are intermediate (see Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jumps are sizable, indicating a large amount of ballistic transport, besides some back-reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jumps are clearly smaller than T/2, so that the average gradient T is nonzero, corresponding to some amount of dissipation taking place in the middle region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig S5, the border jumps decrease consistently for increasing L, so that they will vanish for L. With the new nanothermometric techniques (40), it should be possible to verify this behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In view of the above, the nonlocality of heat conductivity (xx), very appropriately introduced by Allen (19) to account for the nonlinear temperature distribution in a thermal heterocontact turns out in our case to be connected with the ballistic fraction of the heat flow: the range of (xx) varying from infinity to zero (i.e., locality) from the ballistic regime at small L to the diffusive limit at very large L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cluster_Adsorption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we adsorb on graphene the close-packed facet of a truncated octahedral Au459 cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before studying its thermophoretic motion, it is of interest to consider the adsorption thermodynamics and to characterize its thermal diffusion in full equilibrium, at zero temperature gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following early experimental studies (41), previous simulations of the diffusion of such gold clusters on graphene or graphite found a strong correlation between the rotational and translation degrees of freedom of the cluster (28, 32, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At some angular orientations of the cluster, the goldgraphene interface shows a strong interlocking, generally corresponding to minima of the zero-temperature adhesion energy (a more detailed discussion is reported in Cluster Adsorption as a Function of Alignment and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a majority of other orientations, there is no interlocking, the adhesion is worse, and the cluster is much more mobile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this incommensurate state, the translational barrier drops dramatically, allowing positional diffusion to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall diffusive motion of the cluster consists therefore of an alternation of locked states at specific angles where only vibrations take place, and of diffusive states where the rotationally depinned cluster executes fast translations (32, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second feature of the adsorbed cluster to be understood before turning on thermal gradients is the clustergraphene interface free energy G(T), measuring the cluster adhesion as a function of temperature, in full thermal equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike bulk free energies, the (negative) interface free energy may upon heating either rise (commonest) or drop (rare, but possible).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, should G happen to depend strongly enough upon T, that dependence would in itself provide a source of thermophoretic force, once a spatial temperature gradient was introduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract G(T) from thermodynamic integration of simulation data, by the standard method of gradually removing the graphenecluster interaction, passing from a fully interacting system to a purely free-standing cluster (more information is provided in Free Energy Contribution to Thermophoresis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adsorption free energy G(T), a negative quantity, is found here to weaken in magnitude with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to this dependence of G on temperature, a thermodynamic force is calculated as Fad = dG/dx = dG/dTT 0.29 pN for T = 1 K/nm, a result that includes the small additional detachment of the cluster at higher temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it turns out, this is 1540 times smaller than the value necessary to account for the actual phoresis, to be described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without any pretense to accuracy, this is far too small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this contribution to the thermophoretic force scales by construction as T, which as we shall see is not compatible to our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the main thermophoretic force must therefore be different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cluster_Thermophoretic_Motion_and_Force  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By turning on the leftright temperature difference T across graphene, we simulate thermophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, as a purely visual and extreme illustration, we present in Fig 5 a few snapshots where a thermal corrugation front, starting from TL = 700 K, TR = 0 K, hits the cluster from the hot region, carrying it along as if swept along by a tidal wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unrealistic as this sketchy situation is, it does provide an initial suggestion that the ZA flexural vibrations are responsible for the thermophoretic motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More realistic simulations carried out by the standard protocol of Temperature Profile and Heat Flux confirm the thermophoretic cluster drift, the X-distance as a function of time shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on that drift we estimate, by using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, the thermophoretic force obtained from the evolution of the cluster velocity, with T=150 K and with =30° constrained so as to improve lubricity, as explained earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting the initial acceleration of the cluster (Measuring the Thermophoretic Force from Acceleration at Small v and Fig S6), we obtain estimates of Fth in the range 6.79.3 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This direct approach is rather hard to converge for small sizes and not ideal for quantitative and accurate purposes, and as anticipated we proceed in the following to measure directly the average force by harnessing the cluster motion by a harmonic spring ks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring, as in a dynamometer, the mean displacement X from the rest position at the midpoint of the sheet, the average thermophoretic force is extracted as Fth=ksX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After choosing a convenient ks value which roughly optimizes the time needed to determine the cluster displacement, we carry out a systematic series of harnessed cluster simulations for increasing graphene sheet size L, two different temperature differences T, and two different graphene orientations, obtaining the spring-constrained thermophoretic forces reported in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The thermophoretic force Fth displays, within tolerable errors, a linear dependence on the overall temperature difference T, but, remarkably, no dependence on the local gradient T as would be expected from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, which is valid in the diffusive regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a striking hallmark of ballistic behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at our largest graphene sheet size L = 150 nm, the expected decline of Fth is still insignificant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that up to at least the sizes considered in this work, the thermophoretic force on absorbed nanoobject on graphene remains largely ballistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, this matches our previous observation that heat flux has a large ballistic component as indicated by the graphene temperature profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of the force on T generally invoked in literature even for nanoscale sizes is therefore not borne out here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The close parallel with ballistic heat transport of graphene suggests that the ZA flexural vibrations are the actors responsible for the thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check that, we repeat simulations by artificially freezing the out-of-plane graphene motion, only allowing in-plane LA and TA vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case we obtain, for L = 50 nm and T0 = 150 K, a thermophoretic force of 0.5 ± 0.7 pN, negligible in comparison with the force found with unconstrained graphene, and more comparable to the error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that the flexural ZA vibrations of graphene are the main source of thermophoretic force on the adsorbed cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion now invites a more detailed analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We need to qualify the role of phonons in the observed ballistic thermophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connection between the thermophoretic force and the atomic vibrations which transport the heat is direct at the nanoscale sheet size, where phonons, whose MFP is larger, remain sufficiently well defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature difference gives rise to a net imbalance of phonon population between the two sides, nhot and ncold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In coaxial nanotubes, Prasad et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (12) showed how a phonon wave packet traveling in the outer (longer) tube scatters at the edges of the inner (shorter) tube, exchanging energy and momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This push from a single wave is felt identically whether it comes from the hot reservoir or from the cold reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the phonons that constitute the wave packets from the two opposite regions have different populations a net phoretic force arises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ballistic transport regime, where Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 is violated and n dominates, the latter is a function only of T, and so is the thermophoretic force resulting from this unbalanced population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, the ballistic propagation of flexural phonons is identified as the source of the thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harmonic phonons, however, should carry crystal momentum but no physical momentum: How then can the flexural phonons cause a net force?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We address this issue by simulating the time evolution of nearly monochromatic flexural phonon wave packets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phonon is injected in a free graphene sheet by applying an external vertical force on the left side of the nonthermostatted region, shaking along z a single column of carbon atoms with a force Fex = F0sin(t)z^ for a certain number of cycles nc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaking produced two symmetric flexural wave packets, a left-traveling one which enters the left thermostat and gets dissipated, and another right-traveling across the graphene sheet, finally absorbed by the right thermostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring the heat W absorbed by the right thermostat, alternatively without and with the adsorbed cluster, we calculate the variation of transmitted energy W() caused by the cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each flexural frequency  the heat transmission coefficient T = Wcluster/Wclean is extracted in this manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for a computationally viable and sufficiently precise calculation we study running waves of just a few (nc = 35) oscillations, so as to avoid interference with the backscattered wave, identifying the transmitted and reflected parts, finally absorbed by the opposite thermostats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ideally one could in the same way measure the flux of momentum besides energy, that is in practice substantially more difficult, and not really necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, by injecting a small number of oscillations, the resulting force on the cluster is often insufficient to overcome the static friction, and the cluster just oscillates around its average position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the oscillation is related to the momentum transfer between the wave packet and the cluster, but the net momentum transfer Pavg=MvCM is zero, absorbed in this regime by the lattice underneath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the flux of energy and its variation are well defined, even in the absence of adsorbates, and can always be measured with good precision, unlike the total momentum flux, which, as we will show in the following, has multiple components and cannot be measured with the same precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will therefore stick to the energy transmission, whose analysis is nonetheless quite informative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phonon-resolved energy transmission of graphene sheets of transverse size w = 9 nm and lengths in the range L = 5388 nm is shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At frequencies larger than 500 GHz, the transmittance increases smoothly from 0.80 to 0.97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of transmission can be attributed to all processes that produce backscattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the low-frequency region, two transmittance dips are visible, approximately at 1 = 49 GHz and 2 = 175 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two features are connected with resonances between cluster-induced local vibrational modes and the incoming wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first mode, 1, coincides with the natural frequency of out-of-plane vibration of the cluster as a whole on the graphene substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frequency depends on the AuC interaction and on the cluster size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming 1K/M, a cluster mass M and effective spring constant K scaling proportional to N and N2/3, respectively, one obtains 1N1/6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the value obtained for N=459, we obtain 1=139N1/6 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The validity of this estimate is well verified for gold-truncated octahedra clusters up to N=5,635, where it yields 1=33 GHz, close to the 31-GHz value obtained in simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster z-mode 1 has the same symmetry as the ZA flexural modes of graphene, and is therefore linearly coupled to that continuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupled problem actually provides an example of Fano resonance (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmittance at a Fano resonance at  = i is of the general formT()=(+q)2(1+q2)(1+2),[7]where  = (i)/,  being the width of the resonance and q an asymmetry parameter, ranging from infinity [when T() has a symmetric peak at  = 0] to zero [when T() has a symmetric dip at  = 0].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ZA phonon transmittance near 1 can be fitted with q 0.0 and  5 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the second resonance, we recall that adsorption of the cluster on graphene is accompanied at T = 0 by a local dimple of the graphene sheet under the cluster contacting face (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the dip frequency 2 corresponds to a wavelength which is about twice the size of this dimple under the cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when the wavelength matches the size of the cluster contact facet, the flexural phonon can more effectively set it into oscillation, and the increased scattering maximum is reflected in a transmittance minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of process may be connected to the recent observation that the fast diffusion of water drops on graphene is dominated by the graphene thermal ripples which have wavelengths large enough to contain the drops (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At both dips in the transmission spectra, therefore, the resonant coupling between the incoming phonon and the cluster enhances the scattering process, contributing to the overall increase of the cluster-induced thermal resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interesting as it is, quantitative analysis, however, shows that the contribution of these resonances to the thermal resistance, and as a consequence to the thermophoretic force, is minor, compared with the remaining integrated continuum contribution over the whole frequency spectrum, which dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating the two on-resonance parts, we find that resonances only contribute 1.5% of the total cluster-induced reduction of the transmitted energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, all of the thermally excited flexural wavelengths, especially the longest, low-frequency ones, contribute to the transmitted heat flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same occurs to the momentum transfer to the cluster, which we describe next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_Momentum_of_Flexural_Traveling_Waves  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The energy-reflecting (and momentum-reflecting) nature of the cluster is first of all visible in the temperature profile shown in Fig 2: The cluster acts as a localized thermal resistance, resulting in a minute drop of 2 K in the temperature profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster acts as a scatterer for the incoming phonon packets, and picks up momentum that way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, as anticipated, we face a problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a completely harmonic setting, phonons carry crystal momentum, but not physical momentum (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the harmonic level, there should therefore be zero net momentum exchange with the cluster, even in presence of scattering, and zero ballistic thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not the case, and anharmonicity must be involved in the thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indeed, according to standard theory, a phonon q is associated to a physical momentum pq (different from crystal momentum q) due to anharmonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If =dln/dlnV is the anharmonic Gruneisen parameter, where V is the volume, then pq=q (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the flexural phonons of graphene, the Gruneisen parameter is indeed large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alas, it is negative (48), which at first is puzzling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While of course contained in the full derivations that can be found in the literature (49), the physical reason underlying the negative Gruneisen parameter of graphene, or any other membrane, is actually simple and transparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermally excited flexural phonons increase the total length of a clamped membrane, causing a state of tension, therefore pulling the boundaries inwardsthe contrary of normal bulk materials where temperature causes expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This connection between the negative Gruneisen parameter and the negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene is well established (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If applied blindly to our case, standard theory would thus suggest that flexural phonons carry a negative physical momentum, at odds with the positive thermophoretic force observed in simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution of this puzzle is, as it turns out, quite interesting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a localized wave packet of flexural phonons in graphene conveys in reality a net positive physical momentum, part of which is communicated to the adsorbate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not violate, as it would seem at first, the Gruneisen requirement because of the anharmonic association of the ZA phonon with a LA phonon of double frequency, longer wavelength, and much larger group velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined total momentum of the ZALA phonon pair is negative as in Gruneisen theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the two wave packets separate, and the flexural phonon, the only one that scatters the adsorbate, carries a positive physical momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish that, we apply a vertical, time-dependent force Fz=F0sin(t) to the row of graphene carbon atoms at position X 20 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This localized force creates two opposite-moving traveling flexural packets, whose oscillating parts are respectively of the form z+ = Asin(qZAxt) and z = Asin(qZAx+t) for x0 and xless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider now the forward-traveling phonon (the backward one behaves in exactly the same manner).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anharmonically associated with this harmonic ZA phonon, there is an increase of the CC bond lengths along x, since the ZA corrugation extends the effective length of clamped graphene by L/L(qZA2A2/2)cos2(t) (assuming qZAA1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This forced bond length modulation gives rise to a LA phonon wave packet of double frequency  = 2, which travels away from X with velocity vLA and a small wave vector qLA, such that vLAqLA=2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LA phonons are orders of magnitude faster than ZA phonons, and in extremely short times (t1 ps) the LA phonon carries away all longitudinal perturbations, leaving the remaining flexurally corrugated graphene with equilibrium CC bond lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of corrugation and equilibrium bond length produces a 2D projected density excess in the xy plane , and therefore a positive physical momentum density associated the slow flexural phonon p = vZA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 8 show as an example the case of =80 GHz and a z-shaking force F0=30 pN applied at X20 nm of the suspended graphene sheet (no adsorbed cluster for now).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon increasing the intensity F0, it is verified that the ZA corrugation A scales linearly with F0, accompanied by an LA excitation amplitude, which scales like A2, as expected for its anharmonic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first picoseconds after switching on of the force, we monitor the projected bond length, defined as the distance between carbon atoms projected on the xy plane, and the true CC bond length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 7 the in-plane projected CC bond lengths are reported as a function of position and time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagating flexural ZA phonon involves a projected bond length which is shorter than the static equilibrium value, indicating that graphene is slightly overdense under the slowly moving mode of velocity v0.9 km/s, close to the theoretical value dZA/dqZA=1.06 km/s (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for that higher density is clarified in Fig 8, where the true bond lengths are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At very short times there are compensating underdense modulations (bonds longer than the equilibrium value) which move away from the excitation point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their apparent speed is v22 km/s, close to the experimental speed of sound for LA phonons vLA21 km/s (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the scale difference of the two pictures: While the true bond length modulation is of 0.03%, the projected length shrinks by as much as 2%; and this for all ZA frequencies z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The explanation for this mismatch lies in the fact that the modulations in the ZA and LA phonons are diluted over the relative wavelengths, which are very different: Indeed, LA138nm and ZA7.9 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better compare the two contributions, we can estimate the momentum of the two modulations produced in a cycle of the vertical force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio, for the simulation discussed above, can be calculated as PLA/PZA(2LAvLALA)/(ZAvZAZA)12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the total momentum is indeed negative as Gruneisens theory indicates (the factor 2 in the formula above comes from the double frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations thus confirm that the longitudinal modulation, although anharmonically created together with the flexural mode, moves away and separates very quickly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining flexurally corrugated graphene has an increased mass density per unit projected area and its associated physical momentum is positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism bears a resemblance with the picture by Bassett et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51), who investigated the physical momentum of localized running waves for 1D systems; to the best of our knowledge, no further investigation of this mechanism was done following that work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consider now the interaction of these artificially excited phonons with the gold cluster adsorbed in the middle of the graphene sheet (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster produces intense scattering of the flexural wave packets, as visible from the projected bond lengths (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, it picks up positive physical momentum, which explains the thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, there is no visible cluster-related scattering of the fast-moving longitudinal phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LA cross-section on the cluster is very small, as can be seen, comparing the evolution of the true bond length in simulations without and with the adsorbed cluster (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 and 10): Indeed, the presence of the cluster has little effect until the ZA wave packet hits the cluster and additional anharmonic effects take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the negative LA momentum is not transferred to the cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phoretic_Force_by_a_Flexural_Phonon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We are now in a position to present the resulting formulation for the phoretic force caused by a single injected flexural phonon in graphene, valid also for a more general membrane-like 2D material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While (predominantly) propagating from hot to cold, each flexural phonon en route impinges on the adsorbed cluster, which picks up momentum by partly reflecting it backward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be described as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The excess density embedded in a traveling ZA wave moves with its phase velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excess projected density C isC/C=(leq/lx1),[8]where lx is the projection along x of the average carboncarbon bonds length whose equilibrium length is leq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical momentum density p per unit area is therefore:pq=vqC(leq/lx1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [9]It should be stressed again that this physical x momentum is not directly produced by the external force which generates the flexural phonon, a force that acts only along z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The momentum is an anharmonic effect, proportional to the square of the ZA phonon amplitude A, and the result of the anharmonic pairing of the ZA and an LA phonon of very different wavevector and velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phoretic force Fth=dPdt produced by partial back-reflection by the adsorbate of contact y width h of a wave packet of wave vector q, phase velocity vq, amplitude A, and transmission coefficient 1q, isFth2q(hvq)pq=2qhC(leq/lx1)vq2,[10]where the factor 2 accounts for backward reflection of the scattered phonon (1D behavior assumed for simplicity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To check this result in a specific case, we carry out a specific simulation of the suspended graphene sheet of L=85 nm with the adsorbed cluster at X50 nm by applying a z-shaking force F0=50 pN applied at X20 nm and frequency =80 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we can compare the above prediction with the phoretic force as measured by the initial acceleration of the free cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From an independent, cluster-free simulation with the same z-shaking force F0=50 pN we extractafter reaching steady statean average C/C = 1.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the momentum transmission coefficient 1q to be well approximated by the energy transmission coefficient extracted earlier on, q = 0.28 = 1T(=80GHz), we obtain a phoretic force of Fth 20 pN, in reasonably good agreement with the actual force acting on the cluster of 25 ± 2 pN, directly obtained in simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, by repeating the procedure for all ZA modes and integrating over the thermal distribution with its leftright imbalance, one will approximate the total thermophoretic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That, however, would demand a massive effort which we do not undertake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the single phonon force calculation works, there is no reason to doubt that the overall integrated thermophoretic force would also work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An externally imposed temperature difference T between the extremes of a vacuum suspended graphene sheet is predicted to push thermophoretically an adsorbed cluster from hot to cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For submicrometer nanoscale sheet sizes, the theoretical thermophoretic force is proportional to T, but independent of sheet length L and thus independent of the thermal gradient T, a key evidence of ballistic phoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main agents of this effect are the flexural phonons, whose long MFP and ability to transport heat ballistically are well known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides heat, flexural phonons also carry physical momentum, owing to their membrane-like increase of projected density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, that is associated with the special anharmonic coupling to a longitudinal phonon that takes the compensating density decrease away from the scattering region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexural phonon flux flowing from hot to cold cedes some of its physical momentum by scattering onto the adsorbed cluster, which is ballistically transported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously known examples of ballistic phoresis include the Knudsen force exerted by gas particles on tips, described by Passian et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52) and observed by Gotsmann and Dürig (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon-induced ballistic thermophoresis described here is specific to submicrometer sheet sizes and will eventually disappear as flexural phonons evolve from ballistic to diffusive once the sheet length L is large enough, a crossover which our simulations do not yet detect at L150nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below that crossover size, the possibility to realize a distance-independent ballistic force is remarkable, and not unlikely to find practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, the ballistic character of thermophoresis on graphene could allow long-range, noncontact action by a moving heat source such as a hot cantilever (54) on adsorbed clusters or molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other current uses of the thermophoretic effect at microscale and nanoscale [i.e., particle separation (55) or evaluation of molecular interactions (56)] could also benefit from the ballistic regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitive tools such as so-called pendulum atomic force microscopes (57, 58) or quartz crystal microbalances (59, 60) should be able to detect this effect and to characterize the expected ballisticdiffusive crossover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comments_on_Temperature_Profile_in_Ballistic_and_Diffusive_Regimes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temperature profile along graphene is the first evidence of a ballistic thermal flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical profiles for purely ballistic and purely diffusive transport in the case of ideal contact resistances are depicted in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practical situations, the observed profile lies somewhere in between the two ideal cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report in Fig S5 the temperature profile for a set of graphene sheets of L = 30150 nm with an applied T0 = 150 K. Note that the temperature jumps decrease for larger L, marking the transition from ballistic to diffusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measure_of_Ballistic_Conductance_of_Graphene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MD simulations, although neglecting all quantum effects, allow us to give an estimate of the thermal conductance A, where A is the cross-section of the graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we consider sizes still in the ballistic regimes, it is more indicative to report the value of A/L[WK1m2] (i.e., the ratio of the thermal conductance over size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For L = 30 nm, we obtain A/L 9 ×109WK1m2, in excellent agreement with the calculations of Mingo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (64) and Muñoz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (65), respectively, 6 ×109 and 10 ×109WK1m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental values reported for suspended graphene are about one order of magnitude smaller (30), but that is probably due to the larger sizes L used in experiments, increasingly comparable or even smaller than the MFP of some of the acoustical phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
