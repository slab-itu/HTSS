-Actinin/titin interaction: A dynamic and mechanically stable cluster of bonds in the muscle Z-disk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscle is the tissue in our body experiencing most extreme mechanical forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of active force generation has been investigated for more than 50 y and is fairly well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite its physiological significance, it is still unknown what mechanical linkages hold together the muscle machinery under passive stretching forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we show with direct mechanical single-molecule measurements that an array of titin/-actinin bonds composes a dynamic network that can provide stable anchoring, maintaining the integrity of the muscle Z-disk even under load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dynamic network explains how components of the Z-disk are able to rapidly rearrange and, at the same time, form a long-term stable mechanical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stable anchoring of titin within the muscle Z-disk is essential for preserving muscle integrity during passive stretching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main candidates for anchoring titin in the Z-disk is the actin cross-linker -actinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calmodulin-like domain of -actinin binds to the Z-repeats of titin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanical and kinetic properties of this important interaction are still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a dual-beam optical tweezers assay to study the mechanics of this interaction at the single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single interaction of -actinin and titin turns out to be surprisingly weak if force is applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the direction of force application, the unbinding forces can more than triple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest a model where multiple -actinin/Z-repeat interactions cooperate to ensure long-term stable titin anchoring while allowing the individual components to exchange dynamically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Interaction_Between_-Actinin_and_Titin_Z-Repeat_7_(PullA-T7_Geometry)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To probe the mechanical strength of the interaction between -actinin and titin Z-repeat 7 (T7), we prepared a construct where 23 residues of T7 (21) were fused to the C terminus of EF3-4 of the CaMD of -actinin 2 via a 4 × (GGS) linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To apply load to this fusion construct we tethered dsDNA linkers to cysteine residues at the termini (Fig 1C) that could be attached to 1-m-sized beads in the optical tweezers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details on the assay Materials and Methods and SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in this construct the force propagates through both the -actinin EF3-4 domain and the T7 peptide, mimicking how force propagates in the Z-disk (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore called this construct PullA-T7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When force is applied to PullA-T7, unbinding/unfolding transitions occur already at surprisingly low forces, as shown in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the low pulling speed of 10 nm/s, only transitions between the fully folded/peptide-bound state and the unfolded/peptide-unbound state can be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is corroborated by worm-like chain (WLC) fits revealing a contour length increase of 34 ± 1 (SEM) nm, which corresponds to both detachment of the peptide (assuming that it is unstructured after unbinding) as well as unfolding of the EF3-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reveal more details of the force-induced unbinding/unfolding kinetics, we performed a series of time traces, measuring force fluctuations while keeping the distance between the two trap centers fixed (passive-mode assay with preload around 35 pN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time trace excerpt of 5 s is shown in Fig 1E, together with a schematic of the expected unbinding/unfolding pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close inspection of the time traces revealed short dwells (green spikes; see also the zoom in Fig 1E) in addition to the folded/bound (purple, hereafter named FB) and unfolded/unbound state (red, UU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This third state is consistent with a conformation where -actinin is folded and T7 unbound (green, FU), because it also shows up in a mutant without ligand, where we only pull on EF3-4 (PullA construct; details in Fig S2 and SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm (23) to identify the transitions between this three-state system on the unfiltered traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the dwell-time distributions we calculated transition rates assuming the transition network shown in Fig 1E with the FU state as an obligatory on-pathway intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1F shows force-dependent folding (red) and unfolding (green) rates of EF3-4, and Fig 1G shows binding (green) and unbinding (purple) rates of T7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed discussion about the extraction of the unbinding rates of T7 in Fig 1G is presented in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force dependence of the unbinding rate is weak, as can be seen by an increase of only one order of magnitude within about 10 pN of force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This weak force coupling is a consequence of the transition states being close (2 nm) to the bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the unbinding rate of T7 at zero force is 0.6 ± 0.1/s (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Force-dependent population probabilities (Fig 1H) allow the extraction of free-energy differences between the three states using a model (fitting curve) (24) explained in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the UU state has a free-energy difference of 0.5 kBT with respect to the FU state, and 4.7 kBT to the FB state (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The measurements shown so far, using the PullA-T7 construct, do not allow the measurement of solution binding rates or the dissociation constant, because the T7 peptide is tethered to the EF3-4 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we used a competition assay with free T7 peptide in solution as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the T7 peptide (650698) to the solution now establishes a competition between the tethered and the solution peptides (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from the three states already discussed above, a new long-lived state (cyan) arises at a contour length identical to the green state (see the contour length vs. dwell-time scatter plot in Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this state, a peptide from solution has bound, thus blocking the rebinding of the tethered peptide and stabilizing the folded conformation of EF3-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no force is applied to the free peptide, it will only dissociate at rates similar to the force-free case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, from the dwell times of the cyan states, we find a zero force off-rate koff= 1.3 ± 0.5/s, within a factor of two from the extrapolated zero force value of the purple branch in Fig 1G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the pseudo first-order on-rate of the peptide to kon = 17 ± 6/s by summing up the total time the molecule spends in the green state between two subsequent cyan events (see also SI Materials and Methods and Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation constant KD, with 52 µM of T7 was estimated to 4 ± 2 µM, using the relationKD=koffkon[Psolution].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interaction_of_EF3-4_with_Other_Target_Peptides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a second set of experiments, we measured the mechanical strength of other titin Z-repeats with the -actinin 2 C-terminal EF3-4 domain, fusing together the proteins in analogy with the PullA-T7 construct (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison with T7, we investigated T1 (Fig 2A), T2, T3 (Fig 2B), and T5 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could measure binding for repeats T1 and T3, but T2 and T5 showed no detectable binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constant-velocity traces (top row) depict unbinding/unfolding forces for the T1 fusion construct similar to T7, whereas T3 forces are lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is confirmed by passive-mode traces (middle row), where the lifetimes of the peptide-bound state are much longer for T1 than for T3 (T5 data resemble those of the PullA construct in Fig S2, where no peptide is tethered).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In analogy with Fig 1 FH, we analyzed both the probability (bottom row) as well as the dwell time distributions of passive-mode traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force-dependent kinetics were estimated (Fig S6) and zero-force rates konF=0 (FU to FB) and koffF=0 (FB to FU) extracted (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The general behavior of the T1 and T3 constructs under force is similar to that observed for T7, as shown in the lower row of Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force-probability plot is slightly shifted toward higher forces for T1, and to lower forces for T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is related to a higher free energy G0=GUU0GFB0 for T1 and a lower for T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 summarizes both energetic as well as kinetic parameters of the different tethered titin Z-repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we directly measured the solution affinity of T7 in the competition assay described above, KD values for the other peptides can now directly be obtained from the free-energy values measured for the tethered peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed the constructs to have the same effective concentration of the tethered peptides, by using the same linker length of PullA-T7 (for details SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each repeat Ti, we can therefore relate the measured binding/folding free energy GTi0 directly to its dissociation constant KDTi usingGTi0GT70=ln(KDT7KDTi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]Finally, we investigated the interaction of EF3-4 with the neck region of -actinin 2 (G258M283), which is crucial for the regulation of -actinin during sarcomere assembly and regulation (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only is the neck region unstructured in absence of a substrate (18, 19), but also no interaction of the peptide lacking the neighboring domains was ever observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data (Fig S8 and Table 1) show that in the fusion construct the neck peptide binds EF3-4, albeit with very low affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed discussion of these experiments is presented in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PullT7_Geometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the tethered constructs (e.g., PullA-T7) used in the above experiments allow precise characterization of the unbinding rates, they may not precisely mimic the way those molecules refold/rebind in the Z-disk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, owing to the direct tethering of T7 and EF3-4, the latter is subjected to load even after the bond has broken, leading to rapid unfolding of the domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In muscle, after unbinding of T7, EF3-4 will not be under load and, hence, will not experience forced unfolding (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low midpoint force we measure for the PullA-T7 construct (3.5 pN, Fig 1H) results from the difficulties of unfolded EF3-4 to refold under force, as can be seen from Fig 1E, where the bound state is populated only about half of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To avoid forced unfolding of EF3-4 and getting more realistic rebinding kinetics, we designed a new construct, PullT7, where the points of force application are changed, such that force is only applied to the tethered peptide (Fig 3A, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constant-velocity curves (Fig 3A) already show a notable increase in the forces required to stretch and unbind the tethered peptide from the EF3-4 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detectable unbinding events start at 8 pN and reach as high as 18 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in passive-mode experiments (Fig 3B) binding/unbinding forces are higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force-dependent population probabilities (Fig 3D) show the midpoint for the unbinding force at 13 pN, whereas the associated free energies are similar to the ones measured in the PullA-T7 construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, binding/unbinding kinetics in this geometry (Fig 3C) extrapolate to zero-force values similar to those of the PullA-T7 construct (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A competition assay with T7 solution peptide similar to the one of Fig 1I yields identical solution binding and unbinding kinetics (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cloning_and_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All constructs were cloned in pet28a vectors harboring a C-terminal his6-tag and transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at OD600 = 0.6, at 37 °C for 2 h in 500 mL LB0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA column, followed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For further conjugation with DNA and beads, two cysteines were added, one at each terminus of the construct, with the exception of PullT7, because of its special pulling geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent disulfide bonds, a ubiquitin domain between the construct and each cysteine was inserted (not shown in Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitins do not interfere with the measurements because they unfold at higher forces than those applied here (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An internal cysteine present in the EF3-4 domain of human -actinin (cys862) was mutated to a structurally similar serine to prevent coupling with DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same reason, a cysteine in the neck region (cys270) was mutated to a valine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both cases it was possible to prepare and measure a PullA-T7 construct with cys862 and a PullA-neck with cys270, and no difference in mechanical stability was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To be able to compare the results with previous publications, the rabbit titin sequences of Z-repeats were used (residue numbers from UniProtKB O97791), which are highly homologous with the human orthologs (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that peptides T1, T5, and T7 used in the fusion constructs are identical in the two species, whereas T3, T2 (used in the fusion construct), and T7long (used in the competition assay) differ by one, two, and five amino acids, respectively, although not in the key binding positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequences used for the single domains and peptides were the following:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fusion constructs were built using the following combinations (A is short for -actinin):  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quality of the constructs was confirmed by SDS/PAGE and mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dumbbell_Assay_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After purification, the protein was incubated (in some cases with addition of 0.5 mM TCEP) with 3-maleimide modified oligonucleotides of 34 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction took place for 2 h at room temperature, and thereafter the solution was purified using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column to isolate the fraction corresponding to the protein with two bound oligonucleotides, which can be shock-frozen and kept at  80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This construct was incubated with 175-nm-long dsDNA handles with a single-stranded overhang complementary to the oligonucleotides at one end and two different modifications at the other end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the handles were biotin-modified, and the other half were digoxigenin-modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction proteinoligoshandles was then incubated with 1-µm-sized streptavidin beads (Bang Laboratories), and after addition of antidigoxigenin-coated beads the dumbbell was formed in a dual-beam optical trap by bringing the two beads into contact (see more details in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38 and 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All measurements were performed at 23 °C in 10 mM PBS, 2.7 mM KCl, and 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, with the addition of an oxygen scavenger system consisting of 26 U/mL glucose oxidase, 1,700 U/mL catalase, and 0.66% glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measuring chambers were made by attaching Parafilm (Bemis Company) between two 170-m-thick coverslips (Carl Roth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent beads from sticking to the surface, the chambers were passivated with 10 mg/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Constant-Velocity_Traces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If not specified, from here on only folding/unfolding events will be mentioned, but the theory is applicable to bindingunbinding events of the tethered peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The force-extension graphs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1D and 3A and top row of Fig 2) are called constant-velocity traces because they are obtained by moving the beads apart at a constant speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphs were interpolated using WLC models that describe polymer elasticity well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the curves at lower extensions (before unfolding events) is dominated by the DNA handles behavior under load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is well approximated by the extensible WLC model (40), which takes into account an additional elastic stretch modulus K. The other free DNA parameters are the persistence length LD and the contour length pD, and the temperature T was kept constant at 293 K. The force F is related to the extension x byFeWLC(x)=kBTpD(14(1xLD+FK)214+xLDFK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]After unfolding of a part of the amino acid chain, the mechanical parameters will be a combination of the DNA and the unfolded part of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fit at higher extension is obtained by the combination of the previous equation and a classic WLC term due to the unfolded protein chain, with the contour length LP and the persistence length pP, where the latter was kept fixed at 0.7 nm:FWLC(x)=kBTpP(14(1xLP)214+xLP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]The contour length increases LP obtained by the fits can be compared with those measured from the PDB structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formula used to calculate the expected contour length increase upon unfolding/unbinding can be found, for example, in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_the_Free_Energy_from_Force-Probability_Plots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The population probabilities of the different states (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H and 3C and bottom row of Fig 2) were calculated by summing up the total time spent in each state for each passive-mode trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of populating the different states is linked to their energy difference Gij(Fi,Fj)=Gj(Fi)Gi(Fj) by the Boltzmann distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between the probability Pi(Fi) of finding the system in the state i at force Fi and the probability Pj(Fj) of finding the system in the state j at force Fj isPj(Fj)Pi(Fi)=exp(Gij(Fi,Fj)kBT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]The free energy associated with a certain state Gi(Fi) depends on the energy Ei of the protein in that state, but also on the other elements of the system (e.g., beads, DNA, and unfolded protein regions) (24):Gi(F)=Ei+Gbead(F)+GDNA(F)+Gunf_prot(F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]The single contributions are listed below: The DNA and unfolded protein energies are related to the force-extension Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2, and the free energy of the bead is the one of a Hookean potential:Gbead(F)=12xi(Fi)Fi;[S5]GDNA(F)=0xeWLC(F)FeWLC(x)dx;[S6]Gunf_prot(F)=0xWLC(F)FWLC(x)dx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]Because at a fixed trap distance (passive mode) the system explores different states at different forces, a state transition is associated with an energy change of all aforementioned elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A global fit of the probability vs. force plots was carried out, which simultaneously interpolates all of the data points with the only free parameters being the energy differences Gj0Gi0 between each state pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the other elastic parameters had already been estimated from the force calibration or from the WLC fits to the constant-velocity traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_Force-Dependent_Binding_Folding_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition rate constants at different forces koff (in this section koff is not the unbinding rate of the peptide but the total off-rate of a certain state analyzed using the HMM algorithm) were obtained by computing the integrated normalized lifetime distributions p(t) and interpolating them with single exponential fits (Fig S3C) that consider a cutoff for the shortest detectable events min (ranging from 0.5 to 1 ms, depending on the applied force) and the longest observable event max (defined by the total length of the time trace):p(t)=exp(kofft)exp(koffmin)exp(koffmax)exp(koffmin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]The states that showed a double exponential distribution (FB purple state of PullA-T1 and PullA-T7, Fig S3 D and E) were fitted with the sum of two exponentials with amplitudes A and B and rate constants koffA and koffB:p2exp(t)=A(exp(koffAt)exp(koffAmin))+B(exp(koffBt)exp(koffBmin))A(exp(koffAmax)exp(koffAmin))+B(exp(koffBmax)exp(koffBmin)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]If the system is in the states FB or UU, the only possible transition is toward the state FU (see schematic in Fig 1E), and thus the off-rates obtained from the previous fit are already the transition rates kFBFU(F) and kUUFU(F) at force F. From the FU state the system can undergo a transition toward two states, FB and UU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because at a given force the off-rate is the sum of the transition rates into all other states, the number of transitions FUFB and FUUU was counted and the transition rates were obtained by multiplying the off-rate with the transition frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The errors were estimated using the jackknife method (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_Zero-Force_Binding_Folding_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The force dependence of the transition rates kij(Fi) from state i to state j were interpolated using an extension of the Bell model introduced by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 that takes into account the energetic contribution GiT(Fi,FT) of the complete system (discussed above) between the state i to the transition state T:kij(Fi)=kij(Fi=0)exp(GiT(Fi,FT)kBT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]The fitting parameters are the contour length distance xiT from state i to state T and the zero-force rate constant kij(Fi=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all fusion constructs of Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, the following fitting procedure was performed for each transition (e.g., the pair of state UU/FU in Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interpolation of the branch UU to FU was performed first, using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 with both parameters maintained free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the zero-force folding rate and the contour length distance between UU and the transition state xUU,T can be estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contour length distance between FU and the transition state should be the difference with the folding contour length, that is xFU,T=xFU,UUxT,UU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other branch FU to UU was fitted by keeping fixed xFU,T, calculated as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the FU/FB pair, the FB branch was fitted first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequential procedure was applied because the determination of the longer FB and UU dwell times is more robust than that of the shorter FU events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_T7_Unbinding_Rates__Double_Exponential_Behavior_of_Peptide-Bound_State_(Fig_S3)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dwell times extracted from passive-mode experiments (a long trace in Fig S3A) using the PullA-T7 and PullA-T1 constructs show a single exponential distribution of the UU and the FU states (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other side, the bound state (FB) exhibits a double exponential distribution across all measured forces (Fig S3 D and E), including those probed using the jump assay (discussed in the next section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a single exponential distribution was observed for the PullA-T3, PullA-neck, and PullT7 constructs, as well as in the competition experiment using the peptide T7 in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double exponential dwell time distribution means two different binding modes with the same contour length increase but with two different stabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect may be due to chemical properties of the peptidedomain interaction (two different binding sites, for example) that cannot be separated in bulk experiments, or alternatively to two different binding modes to the same binding site that can exchange only slowly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example for the latter hypothesis could be different binding geometries introduced by the peptide linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the linker allows two different binding configurations (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these two binding modes the entropy of the linker (more or less stretched) is different, affecting the binding free energy of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the competition experiment shows a single binding mode (there is no linker in this case) seems to support this hypothesis, but one would have expected the PullT7 construct to also show a double binding mode, which it does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas T1 and T7 interact strongly, the T3 and the neck are much weaker and the short-lived second binding mode may not be detectable in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two lines of evidence support the conclusion that the strong binding mode is the physiologically relevant mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the measured off-rates for the free solution peptide in the competition assay (Fig 1I) agree with the zero-force off-rates extrapolated from the stable mode (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the PullT7 construct (Fig 3C) exhibits single exponential kinetics with a zero-force off-rate identical within error to the stable mode of PullA-T7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For extracting the peptide unbinding rates (purple transition rates in Fig 1G), the slow (more stable) phase of the double exponential kinetics was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extraction_of_T7_Unbinding_Rates__Square_Dots_in_Fig_1G_by_the_Jump_Assay_(Fig_S4)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To increase the range of accessible forces for the unbinding rate constants, a double-jump assay was performed (Fig S4), in which the system was rapidly and repeatedly driven between low-force conditions, facilitating peptide rebinding, and a high-force state (715 pN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to study the lifetime of the bound state at those elevated forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A jump assay is performed by rapidly driving one laser beam with the AODs between a low and a high trap distance (referred to as low and high positions), as shown in Fig S4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all experiments, the position of the laser was changed every 10 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high position is chosen at a high force not accessible to passive-mode experiments, where the refolding time is very long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the jump assay, the protein can rapidly refold at the low-force position and unfold at the high-force position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data recorded at each trap position were merged together to obtain two time traces that resemble those measured in passive mode (upper level shown in Fig S4B), thus enabling an HMM (23) analysis to detect the different states explored by the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the rise time of an AOD jump is fast (less_than10 s), in these experiments it is possible to observe the hydrodynamic relaxation of the trapped bead (spikes in Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recorded force signal is proportional to the difference between the trap position and the bead center, which implies that a spike exponentially decreasing to the steady-state force is recorded (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to this effect, one has to be careful not to confuse hydrodynamic relaxation with unfolding events, especially if the state assignment is automated by the HMM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S4B, after each jump the first 150 µs (four to five points) are assigned from the HMM to the FB purple state: Even if the time scale of these spikes is shorter than the minimal cutoff (500 µs), the HMM detects them because the apparent force value of the first points is higher than the force level of the folded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has to be noted that upon jumping, until the steady state is not reached, the force signal is not corresponding to the load acting on the tether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the bead of the AODs trap is subjected to real higher forces, the load acting on the tether settles to the new force in a monotonic way (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By averaging the force signal of 50 jumps (Fig S4E) that end up in either the UU (red) or the FB (purple) state, the relaxation time c can estimated fitting an exponential function, which resulted to be 65 µs for FB and 87 µs for UU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The safe upper limit of 100 µs was considered for the bead relaxation time, which implies that the signal is expected to be at the steady state after 3 c = 300 µs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hence, a correction was included in the first 300 µs after each jump (which corresponds to nine data points at the sampling frequency of 30 kHz), copying the following nine data points to the first ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, information is lost in this time range, artificially introducing a cutoff on the shortest detectable events, but unfolding events that take place after 300 + 300 µs from the beginning of the jump are detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in passive-mode traces the shortest events that can be correctly assigned range from 500 to 1,000 µs, so this correction does not decrease the performance of the algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once the data are corrected for the hydrodynamic effect, from the high position level (Fig S4C) it is possible to extract the unfolding rate constant (square dots in Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach works with the assumption that the unfolding rate is negligible at the lower position level, which is here at zero load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption could be checked a posteriori after the fit to the whole rates vs. force plot was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the construct under study, the unfolding rate constants extracted from jump experiments are at least four times faster than the extrapolated zero rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Competition_Experiments_(Fig_S5)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HMM algorithm assigns a certain state to each point based on the emission distribution (force levels) and the transition probabilities, and thus it cannot separate different states according to the dwell time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the different binding states can be easily separated by the lifetime (clusters in Fig S5B, referred to the trace in Fig 1I), the separation of the solution peptide bound (cyan) state from the tethered peptide bound (green) state was carried out by introducing a time threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the separation, the off-rates of the binding events can be estimated as explained above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculation of the on-rates was carried out by summing up the lifetimes of all of the FU green events between two subsequent bindings of the peptide in solution (cyan events), because the FU state is the one competent of binding the peptide (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additionally implies that every cyan event is in fact anticipated and followed by a short green event, which cannot be distinguished because of the same force level of the two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the estimation of both the on- and off-rates was corrected by subtracting twice the average lifetime of the green states to the off-rates, and adding it to the on-rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The addition of the T7 peptide in solution allows for the estimation of the dissociation constant of the EF3-4/T7 interaction, as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this assay the full-length 49 aa T7 peptide was used, because the 23-aa interacting sequence used in the tethered construct has a very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, and thus the measurement of the concentration has a higher uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 23-aa T7 peptide was tested in a competition experiment and showed a comparable off-rate, as expected from the fact that the last 26 aa are not supposed to affect the interaction with the EF3-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PullA_Construct_and_the_FU_State_(Figs_S2_and_S7)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are some lines of evidence that the short-lived additional green state corresponds to FU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, and probably most important, the same state shows up in a construct without tethered ligand (named PullA) where force is applied on EF3-4 only (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in constant-velocity traces it is very difficult to observe refolding events (top row), in passive mode they show up with the same frequency observed in fusion constructs at the same force (bottom row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding rules out that the new state is some early intermediate where parts of the EF3-4 form a structure with the tethered ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Also in this construct, added T7 ligands to solution stabilize the folded state (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some constant-velocity traces it is possible to observe the binding of the T7 in solution (top row): The measured contour length increase is in agreement with the unfolding of the EF3-4 (22 nm), which is the only transition associated with a length change in such an assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Passive mode (middle row) shows the expected cyan events, allowing us to validate the contour length of the folded EF3-4 (bottom row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that it is possible to observe binding of T7 in solution under constant-velocity measurements also using the PullA-T7 construct (Fig S5C), where the WLC fits allows a precise control of the contour length difference between the FU and FB states (12 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S7 are shown similar competition experiments (always with T7 in solution) with the other fusion constructs tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of them show the short-lived green states at the contour length expected for the FU state, together with long-lived cyan states corresponding to binding of T7 from solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that even though the FU state is treated as an obligatory on-pathway intermediate also a model allowing direct transitions from UU to FB would not substantially change binding/unbinding rates and/or affinities extracted from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As detailed above, the PullA-T7 construct is important for describing the force-dependent unbinding rates that do not depend on the pathway model but are directly accessible through the lifetimes of the purple state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rebinding information is given by the PullT7 construct that does not distinguish between FU and UU states because only the T7 peptide is under force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Properties_of_the_Interaction_Between_the_-Actinin_EF3-4_and_the_-Actinin_Neck_Region_(Fig_S8)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the interaction between the -actinin neck and the EF3-4, the two domains were fused together, in analogy to the several titin Z-repeats discussed in the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8A shows typical traces obtained at constant velocity (first row) and in passive mode (second row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very short binding FB events can be detected and population probabilities (third row), force-dependent rates (fourth row), free energies, and binding affinity measured (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the dwell times of the FU and FB states are very similar at all preloads, a competition assay was performed using the T7 peptide in solution (Fig S8B) to validate the difference between the force levels of FU and FB, in analogy to what done for all other fusion constructs (Fig 1I and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a constant-velocity trace at 200 nm/s it is possible to see the binding of the T7 in solution (top row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbinding of the T7 and unfolding of the EF3-4 lead to the same contour length increase of the EF3-4 unfolding only (22 nm), as expected for a competition experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long cyan events observable in passive mode (middle row) are also in agreement with previous competition assays; moreover, they allow a better separation between the FB and FU state, because they better set the force level of the latter in the HMM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the contour length vs. dwell-time scatter plot (bottom row) the presence of a cluster at the contour length of 0 nm is clear, corresponding to the FB state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current mechanism for -actinin regulation assumes that the helical neck peptide linking the ABD and the first SR in one subunit of -actinin binds to the C-terminal EF3-4 domain of the opposite subunit, thus auto-inhibiting the interaction of the EF3-4 with titin Z-repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be surprising that the measured affinity of -actinin to the neck peptide for the PullA-neck construct is very low (KD = 235 µM) compared with the interactions with the titin Z-repeats, because this apparently contradicts an effective inhibition mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Young et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) have measured an affinity of 0.2 µM for the interaction EF3-4 and an N-terminal truncation construct of -actinin comprising the ABD, neck, and the first spectrin repeat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They could, however, not show any measureable interaction of EF3-4 with a neck peptide alone, consistent with the low affinity measured here for the neck alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of full-length -actinin 2 in auto-inhibited closed conformation suggests that, in addition to the neck peptide, also specific interactions between ABD and EF3-4 and EF1-2 and SR4 contribute to the stabilization of the CaMD in the closed conformation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the effective very high local concentrations of EF3-4 and the neck in the assembled -actinin dimer promote the interaction and formation of the closed conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Z-disk, PIP2 disrupts the interaction between EF3-4 and the neck, resulting in a higher affinity of -actinin 2 to T7, relative to the neck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correction_of_Rates_and_Affinity_for_PullT7_Construct  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The passive-mode trace of Fig 3C shows a two-state system that can be interpreted as in the right-hand schematic: Force application can unfold/unbind the T7 helix driving the system from the FB to the FU state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This picture is valid only under the assumption that transition from FU to UU is negligible (very slow), which is not the case in the system under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the EF3-4 domain is not under load in this geometry, the zero-load kinetics and population probabilities extrapolated from the PullA-T7 construct (Fig 1F) show how in the absence of load the UU and FU states are populated with about the same probability, with an exchange rate of 100/s in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This special pulling geometry does not allow the monitoring of the transition between FU and UU, because they occur at the same contour length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, because the exchange rate between FU and UU is faster than all binding rates measured under load (130/s; see green rates in Fig 3C), the system can exchange many times between FU and UU before the T7 binds again (FB state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the resulting dwell-time integrated distribution is still a single exponential, with the measured binding rates being half of the rate from FU to FB, which is the binding on-rate of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The real zero-force on-rate can be estimated to be twice the extrapolated one, that is, 432 ± 212/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dissociation constant extracted from the competition assay (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) has to be divided by a factor of 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new value KD= 4 ± 2 µM is perfectly compatible with that obtained from the PullA-T7 construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interaction_Between_-Actinin_and_Titin_Z-Repeat_7  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, proteins responsible for muscle mechanics and stability have been shown to be very stable either mechanically or thermodynamically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titin Ig-domains unfold at forces around 200 pN (26, 27) and the titin/telethonin interaction has been reported as one of the most stable noncovalent bonds (800 pN) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it may come as a surprise that in the PullA-T7 geometry we find that the mechanical stability of the titin Z-repeat/-actinin interaction involves protein structures that tolerate only a few piconewtons of force before they detach or unfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EF3-4 without peptide bound already unfolds at around 1 pN (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when the peptide is bound, the complex unbinds with a midpoint force of 3.5 pN (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively low mechanical stability we find for the complex is in agreement with the moderate dissociation constants reported in the literature (KD = 0.10.25 µM) (18, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our competition assay (Fig 1I) yields a higher KD value (4 µM), which may be explained by different experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the KD values we measure for Z-repeats 1 and 3 (discussed below and shown in Table 1) are also consistently higher than those reported in the literature; however, relative stabilities agree very well with literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our single-molecule competition experiment also provides direct force-free measurements of the kinetics of the -actinin/T7 repeat bond, and we find that the dynamics of this bond are surprisingly high with an average lifetime of 0.7 ± 0.3 s (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the model shown in Fig 1B it becomes obvious that, in the Z-disk, forces resulting from sarcomere length increase will stretch titin and propagates through -actinin, like in the probed PullA-T7 geometry, which we consider therefore a good model for the force-dependent unbinding kinetics in muscle (FB-to-FU transition; Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the midpoint force we measure for the PullA-T7 construct (3.5 pN) is within the physiological range of forces acting on a single titin molecule, estimated to be 05 pN in a number of studies (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low measured forces in the PullA-T7 construct can be ascribed to the fact that EF3-4 readily unfolds after unbinding of T7, whereas this will not happen if titin and -actinin are not tethered, as is the case in muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PullT7 construct resolves this problem because force is applied only across the Z-repeat 7 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, this construct better mimics the rebinding kinetics (FU-to-FB transition), because the EF3-4 domain is not kept under force after unbinding of T7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in PullT7 the unbinding kinetics are identical within errors to the kinetics of the PullA-T7 construct (Fig 1G vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, force-dependent binding and unbinding kinetics measured with PullT7 are likely similar to those occurring in muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The midpoint force in PullT7 (Fig 3D) now shifts from 3.5 to 13 pN, showing that the -actinin/T7 bond can, indeed, resist forces considered physiologically relevant (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher forces for this pulling direction are a consequence of the shorter difference in extension between the bound and the unbound conformations (4 nm of contour length, vs. 34 nm for the PullA-T7 construct, including unfolding of EF3-4): At equilibrium, interaction free energies can be related to the force multiplied by the elongation and the much shorter elongation in the PullT7 construct leads to a higher midpoint unbinding force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interaction_with_Other_Titin_Z-Repeats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of Z-repeats found in titin depends on the isoform and ranges between two and seven across all species (20), with repeats T1 and T7 being always present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Joseph et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22) assessed affinities of all repeats to -actinin and found measurable affinities to -actinin 2 for T1, T3, and T7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with those earlier results, we observed no binding of T2 and T5, and we measured similar affinities for T1 (KD = 1 µM) and T7 (KD = 4 µM) and lower for T3 (KD = 14 µM; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Joseph et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22) found T1 to be a slightly weaker binder, it is rather more stable in our experiments (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in affinities are also reflected in the binding/unbinding rates (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the differences in on-rates are small among the constructs, we observe significant difference in off-rates between the strongly binding peptides T1 and T7 vs. the weakly binding peptide T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the kinetic data suggest that even the strongest Z-repeat/-actinin bonds can last no longer than a few seconds in the absence of force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sarcomeric_Z-Disk_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our single-molecule data indicate that, for a single -actinin/Z-repeat bond, the unbinding rates in the absence of load are faster than 2 s. How can this be reconciled with a long-term stable arrangement of the Z-disk?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, a single bond cannot provide enough long-term stability for the -actinin/titin arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The picture, however, changes if we take into account that, in the Z-disk, there is more than one -actinin/Z-repeat interaction for each titin molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luther and Squire (30) have estimated, from the 19-nm -actinin spacing found in electron microscopy studies, that every other Z-repeat can bind -actinin in the Z-disk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, if seven repeats are present, up to four -actinins will bind to the same titin molecule simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under load, titin will remain anchored in the Z-disk as long as at least one Z-repeat interacts with -actinin at any given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, interaction of the Zq region, which flanks Z-repeats, with -actinin rod further contributes to stabilization of the titin/-actinin interaction (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the overall anchoring stability we therefore have to take into account the avidity effect originating from those multiple interactions (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Avidity (31) is a concept originally proposed for antibodies where, in an early phase of the immune response, low-affinity antibody fragments are combined in pentamers (IgM), thus increasing the number of interaction sites from 2 to 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual interaction free energies add up owing to the increased valency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a similar way, the increased number of -actinin/Z-repeat bonds will increase the overall strength of titin anchoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an estimate of lifetimes, it is important to note that -actinin in muscle is also bound to actin, keeping each -actinin close to its Z-repeat, even if it has transiently detached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we believe the fast on-rates we measure for our fusion constructs are good models for the on-rates in the muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each interaction of the three we identified in this study (T1, T3, and T7) has an off-rate between 0.5/s and 10/s and a rebinding rate of 150500/s (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we assume an equal off-rate of 1/s and an on-rate of 100/s of each interaction for the following estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At zero force, the probability for each interactions being unbound is the ratio between on- and off-rate (i.e., 102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from two Z-repeats only, once per second the first Z-repeat detaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the rebinding takes place, the probability that the second also detaches is 102, meaning that on average it takes 102 attempts (100 s) until both Z-repeats are contemporary detached and titin is released from the anchoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With three repeats, the average lifetime of the cluster would accordingly be 1 s ×104 = 10,000 s. This simple estimate shows that many dynamic bonds, when acting together, can lead to a long-term stable anchor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even under a mechanical load of 5 pN, the probability of finding a single Z-repeat bound (Fig 3D), as well as the unbinding rate (Fig 3C), would not change significantly, and even under those conditions the Z-disk would remain stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concerted effort of many bonds reconciles the apparently contradictory findings of a long-term stable Z-disk (half-life of titin 14 h) (32) and a fast exchange of its individual components (half-lives of -actinin and other Z-disk proteins less_than1 min) (19, 33), as has been measured in various fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is interesting to note that also the interaction of filamin to the von Willebrand receptor GP1b involves such dynamic bonds which, in combination with a cluster of interaction sites, result in long-term stability (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic bonds in combination with avidity providing long-term stability may be a common motif for all situations where a mechanically stable connection has to be maintained while still providing reorganization, flexibility, and dynamics of the components involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All protein constructs were prepared using standard recombinant techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amino acid sequences, as well as the experimental procedures, are presented in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments were carried out using custom-built dual-beam optical tweezers, with a design similar to the one described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, but using two steerable traps, one by means of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) (AA Opto Electronic) and the other by a two-axis piezoelectric mirror tip/tilt actuator (Mad City Labs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constant-velocity traces were obtained by tilting the piezo mirror, and the AODs were used for the jump assays (SI Materials and Methods), because of the higher steering speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stiffness and sensitivity of both traps were calibrated using a standard method (35) with back focal plane detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data acquisition was carried out at a sampling rate of 150 kHz, averaged to 30 kHz before recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cross-talk correction for cross-polarization between the two traps (36), the signal of the two traps was averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
