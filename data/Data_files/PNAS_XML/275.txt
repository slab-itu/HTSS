title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taste cell-expressed -glucosidase enzymes contribute to gustatory responses to disaccharides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously showed that glucose transporters and the KATP metabolic sensor are coexpressed in sweet-responsive taste cells and could serve as sugar sensors in the absence of the sweet receptor (type 1 taste receptors 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only monosaccharides are substrates for these transporters, whereas dietary carbohydrates are mostly polysaccharides and disaccharides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the disaccharide-digesting enzymes maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase are expressed selectively in sweet taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological inhibition of these enzymes diminished taste nerve responses only to disaccharides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that these enzymes act in concert with salivary amylase to generate monosaccharide substrates for taste cell-expressed glucose transporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transported monosaccharides can then be metabolized to ATP to close KATP and activate the T1R-independent sweet taste pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary sweet sensor in mammalian taste cells for sugars and noncaloric sweeteners is the heteromeric combination of type 1 taste receptors 2 and 3 (T1R2+T1R3, encoded by Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the absence of T1R2+T1R3 (e.g., in Tas1r3 KO mice), animals still respond to sugars, arguing for the presence of T1R-independent detection mechanism(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous findings that several glucose transporters (GLUTs), sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), and the ATP-gated K+ (KATP) metabolic sensor are preferentially expressed in the same taste cells with T1R3 provides a potential explanation for the T1R-independent detection of sugars: sweet-responsive taste cells that respond to sugars and sweeteners may contain a T1R-dependent (T1R2+T1R3) sweet-sensing pathway for detecting sugars and noncaloric sweeteners, as well as a T1R-independent (GLUTs, SGLT1, KATP) pathway for detecting monosaccharides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the T1R-independent pathway would not explain responses to disaccharide and oligomeric sugars, such as sucrose, maltose, and maltotriose, which are not substrates for GLUTs or SGLT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry, we found that taste cells express multiple -glycosidases (e.g., amylase and neutral  glucosidase C) and so-called intestinal brush border disaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes (e.g., maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating the tongue with inhibitors of disaccharidases specifically decreased gustatory nerve responses to disaccharides, but not to monosaccharides or noncaloric sweeteners, indicating that lingual disaccharidases are functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These taste cell-expressed enzymes may locally break down dietary disaccharides and starch hydrolysis products into monosaccharides that could serve as substrates for the T1R-independent sugar sensing pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbohydrate-Digesting_Enzymes_Are_Expressed_in_Taste_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain insight into the T1R-independent taste of disaccharides, we examined expression in mouse taste tissue of several carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined expression of the enzymes Amy1 (salivary amylase), Amy2 (pancreatic amylase), and Ganc in taste and nontaste tissues: mRNAs were from taste bud-containing [circumvallate (CV), foliate (FOL), and fungiform (FNG)] papillae and nontaste lingual epithelium (NT) tissues, along with Von Ebners gland (VEG), parotid (PAR) gland, and pancreas (PAN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR assays were then performed using primer pairs specific for cDNAs corresponding to Amy1/2 (salivary and/or pancreatic forms), Amy2, and Ganc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By PCR the Amy2 product was detected only from pancreatic cDNA, whereas an Amy1/2 product was found in all tissues examined, indicating that all of the oral tissues tested (including the NT control) express only Amy1 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR indicated that Ganc mRNA was present in all oral tissues, as well as in pancreas (positive control) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR assays with primer pairs against Mgam and Sis showed that their mRNAs were present in all taste tissues tested and jejunum (positive control), but were absent from NT and VEG (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gustducin served as a positive control for the taste tissues and for jejunum and was not expressed in VEG or NT (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative evaluation by real-time PCR demonstrated highest expression of Amy1 mRNA in VEG and PAR, followed by CV and FOL, with lowest expression in NT (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitation showed higher levels of Mgam and Sis mRNAs in CV and FOL papillae than in NT (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cDNA templates for the PCR experiments were derived from taste tissue containing a mixture of taste cells and surrounding epithelial and connective cells, from negative control NT tissue devoid of taste cells, or from positive control tissues (e.g., VEG, PAR, JEJ, PAN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the mRNAs for these genes are indeed expressed in the taste cells themselves and/or elsewhere in the oral cavity, we carried out in situ hybridization with antisense and sense (control) probes for Amy1/2, Mgam, and Sis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ hybridization to taste bud-containing sections indicated that mRNAs for Amy1/2, Mgam, and Sis are selectively expressed in mouse taste cells in FNG, FOL, and CV papillae (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amy1/2 was also expressed in VEG (Fig 2D), but Mgam and Sis were not (Fig 2 H and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each antisense probe was validated in positive control tissues known to express these mRNAs: Amy1/2 in parotid gland and Mgam and Sis in duodenum (Fig S1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Amy1/2, mRNAs for Mgam and Sis were not expressed in the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands (Fig S1 DI), indicating that they are not secreted by the major salivary glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether mRNAs for additional carbohydrate-digesting enzymes are expressed in taste cells, we carried out in situ hybridization with probes for lactase (Lct) and trehalase (Treh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Lct and Treh are selectively expressed in mouse taste cells in FNG, FOL, and CV papillae (Fig S2 AD and FI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lct and Treh probes were validated in duodenum as the positive control tissue (Fig S2 E and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that mRNA expression demonstrated above may not necessarily be correlated with protein expression, we also performed indirect immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of MGAM, SIS, AMY1/2, GANC, and TREH proteins in taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoreactivity to MGAM, SIS, AMY1/2, GANC, and TREH was observed in mouse taste cells from all three types of papillae (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies against MGAM and SIS were previously validated with intestinal tissues (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiAMY1/2 antibody was validated against VEG (Fig 3C, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the primary antibodies against MGAM, SIS, and AMY1/2 were shown to be specific by preincubation with an excess of the specific immunogenic peptides used to generate each antibody (Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies were shown to be free of nonspecific immunoreactivity in tissue controls with primary antibodies omitted (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Carbohydrate-Digesting_Enzymes_Are_Expressed_in_Type_II_and_III_Taste_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data above indicate by multiple independent means that several carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes are present in taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Were any of these enzymes to contribute to taste sensing of sucrose, maltose, or other disaccharides, they would most likely be found within or in proximity to those taste cells that detect sweet compounds by T1R-dependent and T1R-independent pathways (i.e., the T1R2+T1R3-positive subset of type II taste cells that also express glucose and other monosaccharide transporters and KATP channels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this, we double-stained taste cells using an antibody against either the MGAM or SIS enzymes, along with second antibodies or transgenes that mark specific taste cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-staining with markers for type I taste cells (an antibody against NTPDase2; Fig S4), for all type II taste cells (an antibody against TRPM5; Fig 4), for the T1R3-positive subset of type II taste cells (T1R3-GFP; Fig S5), or for type III taste cells [an antibody against serotonin (anti-5HT); Fig S6], showed that both MGAM and SIS were most often found in type II taste cells (in both anterior and posterior fields), but also frequently in type III taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the small intestine, disaccharidases are localized to the apical plasma membrane of enterocytes with their catalytic domain exposed to the intestinal lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether these enzymes are also localized apically to areas of the taste bud exposed to the contents of the oral cavity, we double-stained taste cells with antibodies against either MGAM or SIS along with an antibody against VILLIN, a marker that labels taste receptor cell microvilli (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected colocalization of both MGAM and SIS proteins with VILLIN in apical taste cell microvilli at the taste pore (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitation of taste cells in CV papillae that coexpress MGAM or SIS with TRPM5 or T1R3-GFP (Table S1) determined the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Among type II taste cells (assessed by their expression of TRPM5), 93% expressed MGAM, and 97% expressed SIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the MGAM-expressing and SIS-expressing cells, 66% and 62%, respectively, were type II taste cells, based on expression of TRPM5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Among T1R3-GFPexpressing taste cells, 89% expressed MGAM, and 89% expressed SIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the MGAM-expressing and SIS-expressing cells, 56% and 53% expressed T1R3-GFP, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Forty-six percent of MGAM-expressing cells and 41% of SIS-expressing cells expressed 5HT, whereas 70% and 71% of 5HT-expressing type III cells expressed MGAM and SIS, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, most type II taste cells and the majority of T1R3-GFP expressing taste cells expressed the MGAM and SIS enzymes in CV papillae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the percentage of type II cells and T1R3 cells that express MGAM and SIS, many bitter responsive and potentially all umami responsive cells may also express both enzymes in addition to the sweet responsive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern of expression was found in the FOL papillae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a majority of type III taste cells in CV and FOL papillae expressed both enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oral_Carbohydrate-Digesting_Enzymes_Contribute_to_Taste_Nerve_Responses_to_Disaccharides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data above show that carbohydrate-digesting enzymes MGAM and SIS are present in type II and type III taste cells, including nearly all T1R3-expressing taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Were these enzymes to function in the oral cavity, we would expect them to be inhibited by -glucosidase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility and to determine whether the activity of these enzymes might contribute to taste responses to disaccharides, we recorded chorda tympani nerve responses of WT (C57BL/6) mice to a series of tastants before treatment, after incubation, and after washout of two different brush border enzyme inhibitors, miglitol and voglibose, applied to the dorsal surface of the tongue (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment and posttreatment washout of the inhibitors had no effect on nerve responses of WT mice to any of the taste stimuli (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, incubation of the tongue with either inhibitor led specifically to decreased chorda tympani nerve responses to the disaccharides sucrose and maltose, but had no effect on nerve responses to the monosaccharides glucose (GLU) and fructose (FRU), the noncaloric sweeteners SC45647 (SC) and sucralose (SCR), or control stimuli representative of nonsweet taste qualities (i.e., salty (NaCl), sour [citric acid (CA)], bitter [quinine hydrochloride (QHCl)], and umami [monopotassium glutamate (MPG); Fig 5 A and B].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miglitol (500 M) reduced chorda tympani nerve responses (n = 7, 8) to sucrose by 40% (P less_than 0.01) and to maltose by 25% (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voglibose (10 M) similarly reduced chorda tympani nerve responses (n = 8, 9) to sucrose by 40% (P less_than 0.001) and to maltose by 25% (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether this effect was via a T1R-independent mechanism, we measured sensitivity of chorda tympani nerve responses of Tas1r3 KO mice to the -glucosidase inhibitor voglibose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment and washout of voglibose had no effect on nerve responses of Tas1r3 KO mice to any of the taste stimuli (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation with voglibose decreased nerve responses of Tas1r3 KO mice (n = 6) to sucrose (P less_than 0.01) and maltose (P less_than 0.01) to background levels (i.e., comparable to their responses to the artificial sweeteners SC45647 and sucralose), but had no effect on nerve responses of these mice to the other sweet compounds (i.e., glucose, fructose, SC45647, and sucralose) or to the control nonsweet stimuli (i.e., NaCl, CA, QHCl, and MPG) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the genetic absence of Tas1r3, pharmacological inhibition of disaccharidases eliminated all responses to the disaccharide sugars sucrose and maltose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starch, a dietary staple for humans and rodents alike, is initially digested into oligo- and disaccharides by salivary and pancreatic amylases (2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intestinal brush border enzymes MGAM, SIS, TREH, and LCT then convert disaccharides maltose, sucrose, trehalose, and lactose into readily absorbable monosaccharides (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the small intestine, absorptive enterocytes take up free glucose and galactose via cotransport with sodium by SGLT1 and free fructose by GLUT5; these sugars are transported by GLUT2 across the basolateral aspect of the enterocytes into the bloodstream (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have shown that the sweet taste receptor T1R2+T1R3 and downstream signaling components, including gustducin and TRPM5, are present in enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine where they up-regulate enterocyte expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 in response to dietary levels of sugars and sweeteners (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finding that taste cells express multiple carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes previously thought to be present only in gut is striking, yet it seems unlikely that these taste cell-expressed enzymes play a significant role in nutrient absorption per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It had previously been shown in rats that Amy1/2 was expressed in both the VEG and the taste buds of the CV papillae, although the relative or absolute level of expression had not been quantified nor was the identity of the amylase isoform determined (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our RT-PCR results show that Amy1 is most highly expressed in the parotid gland and VEG, with lower but clearly detectable expression in the CV and FOL taste bud-containing tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By in situ hybridization, Amy1/2 was found to be expressed in taste buds of the FNG, FOL, and CV papillae, but again at much lower levels than in VEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contents of the VEG are secreted directly into the trenches underlying the FOL and CV papillae (30), suggesting that AMY1 from the VEG and taste cells may act on dietary starch to generate locally elevated amounts of oligo- and disaccharides in close proximity to the taste buds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our immunohistochemistry results show that the majority of taste cells that express MGAM and SIS are type II taste cells (TRPM5 positive), including nearly all T1R3-expressing taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a sizable minority of the MGAM- and SIS-expressing cells is made up of 5HT-positive type III taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That MGAM and SIS are localized at the taste pore and therefore exposed to the oral cavity may be crucial for their role in the T1R-independent pathway, as the monosaccharides released at the taste pore will be accessible to even those nearby cells that don't express these enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GANC is expressed in liver where it hydrolyzes terminal nonreducing (14)-linked -d-glucose residues from maltose and glycogen (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes degradation of glycogen in the liver (32), GANC may also be involved in glycogen metabolism (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GANC in taste cells is found predominantly within the nucleus, and we speculate that this may reflect a mechanism for regulating its activity, as in the case of the liver specific isoform of glucokinase (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Why are AMY1, GANC, and multiple brush border enzymes expressed in taste cells, particularly the T1R3-expressing type II taste cells?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likely they are contributing to the T1R-independent sweet sensing pathway in T1R3-positive taste cells and broadening the responsiveness of this pathway to carbohydrates and sugars beyond just glucose and any other monosaccharides that could be transported into these taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of T1R3 (i.e., in Tas1r3 KO mice) animals lose responses to noncaloric sweeteners, but retain much of their responses to sugars (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We proposed that there are two sweet-sensing pathways (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterodimeric sweet receptor T1R2+T1R3 mediates the T1R-dependent pathway by which T1R3-positive cells respond to both caloric and noncaloric sweeteners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the T1R-independent sweet pathway, also found in the T1R3-positive cells, depends on uptake of glucose and other monosaccharides into these taste cells, followed by metabolism to ATP, which binds to KATP, closing the channel and depolarizing the sweet taste cell, triggering release of neurotransmitters and neuro-peptides (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the T1R-dependent pathway would respond to all sweeteners and all sugars that bind to T1R2+T1R3, the T1R-independent pathway would only respond to those sweet compounds that can be transported into the T1R3-positive taste cells and then metabolized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To a first approximation then, only glucose, fructose, and galactose would be likely substrates for the T1R3-independent pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the disaccharides sucrose and maltose elicit robust nerve responses and preference responses in Tas1r3 KO mice (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the activity of MGAM and SIS can convert dietary oligosaccharides (including AMY1-generated starch hydrolysates) and disaccharide sugars in the oral cavity into monosaccharide substrates for taste cell-expressed monsaccharide transporters (e.g., GLUTs and SGLT1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once transported into the taste cell, glucose and other monosaccharides would be metabolized to ATP, eliciting the closure of taste cell-expressed KATP and taste cell depolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the T1R-dependent pathway and the T1R-independent pathway described here likely account for the entirety of taste responses to caloric sugars: simultaneously blocking both pathways reduces the response to sucrose and maltose to background levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our discovery of MGAM and SIS in taste cells is unprecedented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the location of GLUTs and SGLT1 in human oral mucosa was reported as early as 1999 (13), and their location in T1R3-positive taste cells of rodents was confirmed in 2011 (1012), those studies were limited to glucose uptake and did not test transport of disaccharides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sucrose stimulated sodium-preferring ion-transport system in canine lingual epithelium was reported in 1988, but SGLT1 was not identified in taste tissue at that time (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, sucrose was shown to have the same detection threshold in WT and Tas1r3 KO mice (7), and maltose and sucrose were shown to elicit nerve and preference responses in Tas1r3 KO mice (5), but the presence of GLUTs and SGLT1 was not recognized in those studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our discovery of MGAM and SIS expression in mammalian taste cells explains the connected observations between those previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What is the purpose of having a T1R-independent sweet-sensing pathway in the same cells that express the T1R-dependent pathway?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much as KATP serves in the pancreas as a metabolic sensor of blood glucose levels, so too would the T1R-independent pathway serve as a sensor of metabolizable sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coexpression of the brush border disaccharidases in the T1R3-positive taste cells, along with GLUTs and SGLT1, provides these cells with the ability to detect the caloric value of oligosaccharides and disaccharides, as well as of the starch hydrolysis products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these two pathways may serve as coincidence detectors for substances that are both sweet and have caloric value to provide a mechanism to evaluate the caloric value of a sweet substance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, sufficiently inhibiting KATP channels in T1R3 taste cells by elevated ATP would depolarize these cells and elicit a perception of sweetness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at low sugar levels that would only submaximally inhibit KATP, the addition of a noncaloric sweetener acting via T1R2+T1R3 would likely provide enhanced perception of sweet taste over that achieved by either sweetener alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under low metabolic conditions, the tonic activity of KATP channels would hyperpolarize the T1R3-positive cells, making it less likely that sweetener activation of T1R2+T1R3 depolarizes the taste cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these two pathways underlie the unique sensory response to sucrose and other sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses to many noncaloric sweeteners, in contrast to responses to sugars, display delayed onsets and offsets (34) and lower maximal sweetness intensity (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher peak-magnitude sweetness responses displayed by sugars in vivo may be explained if sugars act via nonsaturable transporters and saturable T1R2+T1R3, whereas noncaloric sweeteners act only on T1R2+T1R3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sucrose may be the most preferred sugar because it initially stimulates the T1R2+T1R3 pathway but then yields glucose and fructose that could be transported into sweet taste cells via the T1R-independent pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to a purely sensory role, the T1R-independent pathway may also have a role in regulating metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a robust cephalic phase insulin release (CPIR) can be induced by oral administration of glucose or sucrose, but not fructose in WT and Tas1r3 KO mice (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CPIR improved glucose tolerance in both strains, buttressing the physiological importance of this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our identification here of SIS in taste cells, particularly the T1R3-positive cells that also express GLUTs and KATP, orally administered sucrose would generate sufficient glucose to stimulate the T1R-independent pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All or at least a portion of the glucose-elicited CPIR may be in response to GLP-1 released directly from taste cells (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, leptin and other circulating hormones may affect sweet taste sensitivity by acting directly on KATP channels in the T1R3-positive cells (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fresh sections were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS, permeabilized by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in 1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.0)/0.5 M EDTA containing 10 g/mL proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim), postfixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS, and then acetylated for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All steps were followed by three 5-min washes with diethyl pyrocarbonate- (DEPC)-treated 1× PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were then prehybridized for 1 h at room temperature in a mixture containing 50% deionized formamide, 5× saline/sodium citrate (SSC), 5× Denhardts solution, 50 L/mL salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 L/mL of yeast tRNA, and 2.5 M EDTA in DEPC-treated water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hybridization, aliquots of the mixture were heated at 85 °C for 10 min to denature yeast tRNA, and full-length DIG-labeled RNA probe was added to yield a concentration of 0.5 g/mL RNA probe mixtures were heated at 85 °C for 3 min to denature the probe and then immediately chilled on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrislip plastic coverslips (Invitrogen) were used to keep sections from drying out during hybridization, and slides were placed in a humidified chamber, sealed in a large moist zip-lock bag, and incubated at 65 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plastic coverslips were removed by soaking in 5× SSC prewarmed to 65 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed three times for 30 min each time in 0.2× SSC and once for 10 min in PBS with 0.1× Triton X-100 (PBST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% heat-inactivated normal goat serum, followed by a 3-h incubation at room temperature with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase (1:1,000; Boehringer) in blocking solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alkaline phosphate labeling was detected by incubation overnight at room temperature in the dark with a nitroblue tetrazolium plus 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl-phosphate mixture (Roche) with levamisole (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed in PBST, rinsed in water, dehydrated with an increasing series of ethyl alcohol, cleared with Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antisense and sense RNA probes were used at equivalent concentrations and run in parallel in the same experiment to ensure equivalent conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experiment, in situ hybridization with positive controls with Tas1r3 or gustducin antisense probes was done on taste tissue to ensure the hybridization worked properly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in situ hybridization experiments were done on positive control tissues to confirm the quality and specificity of the RNA probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Standard immunohistochemical techniques were used as previously described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, frozen sections were rehydrated with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific binding was blocked with Superblock neat (Pierce) at room temperature for 12 h. Sections were incubated with rabbit polyconal antisera against the C termini of mouse MGAM and SIS (1:300) (41, 42), goat anti-TREH (1:200, Cat# sc-241089 N-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit antiAMY1/2 (1:400, Cat# A8273 RRID:AB_258380; Sigma-Aldrich), or rabbit anti-GANC (1:200, Cat# ab126143 RRID:AB_11127828; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control experiments with MGAM or SIS blocking peptides (41, 42), or AMY1/2 in lyophilized powder made from human saliva (Cat#: A1031-1KU; Sigma-Aldrich), the antibodies were preincubated at room temperature with a 10-fold excess of the respective blocking peptide for 1 h before incubation with tissue sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies directed against taste cell type markers were used to label type I cells [rabbit anti-Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2), 1:500; J. Sévigny, Laval University, Quebec, Canada; Cat# NTPDase2 RRID:AB_2314986; Centre de Recherche du CHUL, Quebec, Canada], type II cells [guinea pig anti-transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) (1:500, unpurified polyconal; Emily Liman, University of Southern California, Los Angeles)] (43), and type III cells [goat anti-serotonin (5HT), 1:500, Cat# ab66047 RRID:AB_1142794; Abcam].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 5HT detection, mice were injected with 80 mg/kg of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan (H9772; Sigma-Aldrich) 1 h before death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mouse anti-VILLIN antibody (1:500, Cat#sc-58897 RRID:AB_2304475; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to label taste cell microvilli at the taste pore (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three 15-min washes with PBST, slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the following fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:500) in blocking buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) was used for immunofluorescence of rabbit primaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All double-immunofluorescent labeling was done with combinations of the secondary antibodies Alexa594 donkey ant-guinea pig and Alexa647 donkey anti-goat (1:500; all from Invitrogen), along with DAPI (1:1,000; Invitrogen) to label cell nuclei for cell counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double labeling with two antibodies made from the same host was done according to a procedure supplied by Jackson Immunoresearch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary antibodies used were Dylight 488-conjugated and 649-conjugated AffiniPure Fab fragment donkey anti-rabbit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, the sections were incubated in succession: first primary anti-rabbit antibody overnight at 4 °C, first fluorescence Fab fragment secondary for 1 h at room temperature, unlabeled anti-rabbit antisera and AffiniPure Fab fragment donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) for 23 h at room temperature to ensure that all rabbit sites are occupied, second primary anti-rabbit antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then second fluorescence Fab fragment secondary for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls for the double immunohistochemistry experiments with two rabbit primary antibodies were done without donkey Fab fragment incubation following the first secondary antibody and omitting the second primary antibody (Fig S4A) or with donkey Fab fragment incubation and omitting the second primary antibody (Fig S4B) to show adequate blocking of rabbit IgG by donkey Fab fragment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bright-field images were visualized using either a Nikon DXM 1200C digital camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and captured using Nikon NIS-Element F 3.00 software or a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments) attached to a Nikon SA Microphot microscope and were minimally processed using Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquisition parameters were held constant for in situ hybridization with both antisense and sense probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent images were captured with the TCS SP2 Spectral Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems) using UV, Ar, GeNe, and HeNe lasers, as well as appropriate excitation spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanware software (Leica Microsystems) was used to acquire z-series stacks captured at a step size of 0.250.35 m. Images were scanned using a 512 × 512 pixel format in which each line was scanned twice and each frame (a single complete scan) scanned three times to improve the quality of the image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquisition parameters (i.e., gain, offset, photomultiplier tube settings) were held constant for experiments with antibodies and for controls without antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digital images were cropped and arranged using Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Related antisense and sense images were adjusted at the same brightness and contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence images within a figure were adjusted for brightness and contrast for background standardization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Counting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative measurements were conducted to determine the percentage of singly and doubly labeled type II (TRPM5) and type III (5HT) taste cells that coexpressed MGAM or SIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste bud-containing sections were scanned under a 20× objective on the Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and digitally zoomed to yield a 100- to 150-m2 area in which individual taste cells could be easily distinguished; only those labeled taste cells for which the entire nucleus could be visualized by the presence of DAPI were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections from two mice were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chorda_Tympani_Nerve_Recording  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gustatory nerve responses to lingual application of tastants were recorded from the chorda tympani (CT) branch of the facial nerve as previously described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under pentobarbital anesthesia (5060 mg/kg body weight), the trachea of each mouse was cannulated, and the mouse was then fixed in the supine position with a head holder to allow dissection of the CT nerve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right CT nerve was dissected free from surrounding tissues after removal of the pterygoid muscle and cut at the point of its entry to the bulla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire nerve was placed on an Ag/AgCl electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An indifferent electrode was placed in nearby tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural activities were fed into an amplifer (K-1; Iyodenshikagaku) and monitored on an oscilloscope and audiomonitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole nerve responses were integrated with a time constant of 1.0 s and recorded on a computer using a PowerLab system (PowerLab/sp4; AD Instrument).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For taste stimulation, the anterior half of the tongue was enclosed in a flow chamber made of silicone rubber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste solutions [100 mM NH4Cl, 500 mM sucrose, 500 mM maltose, 500 mM glucose, 500 mM fructose, 1 mM SC45674, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM quinine-HCl, 10 mM citric acid, 100 mM monopotassium glutamate (MPG)] were delivered to the tongue by gravity flow and flowed over the tongue for 30 s. The tongue was washed with distilled water for an interval of 1 min between successive stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only responses from stable recordings were used in data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were taken before application, after application, and after 10-min washing out the -glucosidase inhibitors miglitol and voglibose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the after inhibitor application condition, miglitol (500 M) or voglibose (10 M) was applied to the tongue using a saturated cotton swab for 60 s before testing taste stimuli, followed by rinsing the tongue for 30 s with distilled water, followed by application of taste stimuli for 30 s. Integrated whole nerve response magnitudes were measured 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 s after stimulus onset, averaged, and normalized to responses to 100 mM NH4Cl to account for mouse to mouse variations in absolute response magnitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relative response was used for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA and the post hoc t test were used to statistically evaluate the differences in responses to a series of tastants before treatment with inhibitor, after incubation with inhibitor, and after washout of -glucosidase inhibitors applied to the tongue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software packages IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
