Rapid conversion of an oceanic spreading center to a subduction zone inferred from high-precision geochronology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subduction, the process by which tectonic plates sink into the mantle, is a fundamental tectonic process on Earth, yet the question of where and how new subduction zones form remains a matter of debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we find that a divergent plate boundary, where two plates move apart, was forcefully and rapidly turned into a convergent boundary where one plate eventually began subducting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is surprising because, although the plate material at a divergent boundary is weak, it is also buoyant and resists subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that buoyant, but weak, plate material at a divergent boundary can be forced to converge until eventually older and denser plate material enters the nascent subduction zone, which then becomes self-sustaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Where and how subduction zones initiate is a fundamental tectonic problem, yet there are few well-constrained geologic tests that address the tectonic settings and dynamics of the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical modeling has shown that oceanic spreading centers are some of the weakest parts of the plate tectonic system [Gurnis M, Hall C, Lavier L (2004) Geochem Geophys Geosys 5:Q07001], but previous studies have not favored them for subduction initiation because of the positive buoyancy of young lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, other weak zones, such as fracture zones, have been invoked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these models differ in terms of the ages of crust that are juxtaposed at the site of subduction initiation, they can be tested by dating the protoliths of metamorphosed oceanic crust that is formed by underthrusting at the beginning of subduction and comparing that age with the age of the overlying lithosphere and the timing of subduction initiation itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the western Philippines, we find that oceanic crust was less than 1 My old when it was underthrust and metamorphosed at the onset of subduction in Palawan, Philippines, implying forced subduction initiation at a spreading center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that young and positively buoyant, but weak, lithosphere was the preferred site for subduction nucleation despite the proximity of other potential weak zones with older, denser lithosphere and that plate motion rapidly changed from divergence to convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Models of subduction initiation that explain similar ages between the formation of metamorphic soles and associated ophiolites (in cross-section and map view).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high temperature metamorphic sole (shown as a thick, black line) is generated from the crust of the subducting plate during subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may then be preserved at the base of the upper plate (future ophiolite, shown in cross-hatched pattern).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each model predicts a different age relation between the initially subducted crust, the overlying ophiolite, and the time of subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plate ages are schematically shown with darker shades representing older lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White arrows on subducting plate indicate relative plate motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Sinking of the subducting plate along a transform fault (TF) or fracture zone (FZ) drives extension in the upper plate, generating the future ophiolite (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Subduction initiation of distinctly older lithosphere near an active spreading center (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Subduction initiation along an oceanic detachment fault near a spreading center (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Subduction initiation very close to or at a spreading center axis (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hacker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25) proposed a variant of this in which subduction initiates across a transform or fracture zone with underthrusting directed parallel to an active spreading center axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both options are shown in map view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Schematic of the Palawan ophiolite, its metamorphic sole, and the dated lensoid pods preserved within the sole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U-Pb zircon ages of the pods and ophiolite obtained from this study are displayed along with the metamorphic cooling age of the sole (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cenozoic_Subduction_and_Collision_in_Palawan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied the foregoing test to the metamorphic sole of an ophiolite associated with a young, short-lived subduction zone in Palawan, western Philippines (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central Palawan ophiolite was trapped in the forearc of the subduction zone that generated the Cagayan arc (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subduction began at 34 Ma and lasted for 20 My before it was terminated by microcontinent-arc collision (18, 29, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subduction zones relatively young age and short duration make it an ideal site to study subduction initiation because it was terminated before a potentially complicated history might have ensued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The island of Palawan flanks the southern margin of the South China Sea (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its geology consists of ophiolite-related rocks (31, 32) and continental crust [the North Palawan continental terrane (NPCT)] that rifted from southeast China during the opening of the South China Sea Basin (SCSB) (29, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cagayan Ridge is located to the southeast of, and trends parallel to, Palawan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is composed of calc-alkaline volcanic rocks (33) and is the volcanic arc associated with the subduction zone whose inception is preserved on Palawan (18, 29, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the northwest of central and southwest Palawan is the Palawan trough (Fig 2), a linear depression that, based on seismic reflection observations, is interpreted as a downwarped segment of the southern edge of the NPCT and contiguous proto-SCSB that is underthrust beneath the Palawan ophiolite (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proto-SCSB is Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere that existed south of the NPCTsoutheast China passive margin before opening of the SCSB (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allochthonous remnants of this older Cretaceous ophiolite are found in tectonic windows beneath the 34 My old (see below) Palawan ophiolite (18, 31, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gravity data are consistent with the younger Central Palawan ophiolite being rooted in the south (37) and thrust northward on to the continental crust of the NPCT (Fig 2D) (32) in a manner similar to Tethyan ophiolites (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, all of the available evidence (onshore geologic and offshore drill hole, seismic, and gravity data) from Palawan and the surrounding areas is consistent with a south-southeast dipping subduction zone that formed the Cagayan arc, which places the Palawan ophiolite in the forearc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subduction zone was terminated when the southern edge of the rifted margin of China (the NPCT) jammed the trench in the Middle Miocene (33), causing obduction of the Palawan ophiolite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question of how subduction initiated in Palawan is unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitchell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) speculated that subduction may have initiated at a spreading center, whereas the model of Encarnación et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) shows initiation at a transform fault or fracture zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these proposals lack the necessary age data to properly test these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age_and_Geochemistry_of_the_Palawan_Ophiolite_and_Its_Sole  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The central Palawan ophiolite is a relatively coherent section of oceanic lithosphere consisting of pillowed and massive lavas, diabase dikes, plagiogranite, gabbro, troctolite, and mantle harzburgite (31, 32) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of pillow lavas, dikes, and gabbroic intrusions, as well as felsic intrusions (plagiogranite) (Fig 3) collected from the ophiolite, show slight light rare earth element (LREE) depletions and relatively flat middle REE and heavy REE patterns, about 10 times chondritic values, consistent with midocean ridge (MORB)-like magma (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar MORB to transitional MORB-island arc basalt (IAB) or suprasubduction zone signature is evident in other multielement plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tectonic discrimination diagrams that use robust statistical tests (38) assign the data within the MORB field (Fig 4B) or to a transitional MORB-IAB field (Fig 4C), consistent with a backarc basin basalt (BABB)-type geochemistry (39) and consistent with many other ophiolites (40) formed at oceanic divergent-type boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on zircon U-Pb geochronology from a plagiogranite sampled near Penacosa Point (Fig 2), the best estimate for the age of the ophiolite is 34.1 ± 0.1 Ma (Fig 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regional distribution of rock types (Fig 2) shows that the outcrops of gabbroic and tonalitic intrusives in the Penacosa Point area are located in the upper levels of the main gabbroic crustal section transitional to the extrusive section of the ophiolite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Penacosa Point plagiogranite exhibits field relations that are consistent with the felsic magma being comagmatic with the dominant mafic magmas comprising the bulk of the oceanic crustal section here (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the geochemistry of the plagiogranite is consistent with simple fractional crystallization from the dominant basaltic magma (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The metamorphic sole of the ophiolite is exposed in the Dalrymple Point area and is composed of ductiley strained garnet amphibolites, hornblendites, amphibolites, epidote amphibolites, quartzites, and kyanite schists with isoclinal folds and a distinct, penetrative mineral lineation in most rocks (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rocks represent metamorphosed igneous, basaltic oceanic crust and associated sediments (cherts and mudstone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other metamorphic soles, the higher temperature garnet amphibolites and hornblendites are located closer to the basal mantle harzburgites, whereas lower temperature epidote amphibolites tend to be structurally lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At several locations, more highly strained sole rocks enclose less deformed (or isotropic) and more competent, irregularly shaped lensoid pods of epidote amphibolite (decimeter-meter scale) and smaller lensoid pods of amphibolite (a few millimeters to centimeters in thickness and several centimeters to decimeters in diameter) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermobarometric determinations show that the garnet amphibolites of the sole reached peak metamorphic temperatures of 700760 °C and pressures exceeding 9 kbar (27 km depth in the mantle) (18), conditions consistent with those that the crust of a subducting plate would be subject to during the earliest stages of subduction (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical to this study, previous work (18) has constrained the minimum age for subduction initiation by determining 40Ar-39Ar cooling ages on two hornblende samples and one white mica sample (from garnet amphibolite, amphibolite, and kyanite schist, respectively) in the sole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ages are indistinguishable at 34.2 ± 0.5, 34.2 ± 0.6, and 34.25 ± 0.3 Ma, respectively (Fig 1) (corrected for new revised ages of the neutron flux monitors) (41), and indicate rapid cooling of the sole to 550400 °C after reaching peak metamorphic temperatures (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower grade, altered greenstones, and pillow lavas structurally beneath the metamorphic sole are exposed further south in the Sagasa Point area (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rocks are less metamorphosed oceanic components underthrust beneath the Palawan ophiolite and its sole sometime after the initial underthrusting associated with subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, metabasite samples from the metamorphic sole are geochemically similar to the ophiolite in that they plot in the MORB-like to transitional MORB-IAB fields (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several samples of the epidote amphibolite pods are depleted (23 times chondritic values) relative to the MORB-like samples and have positive Eu anomalies, indicating they were probably cumulate rocks (gabbros, based on major element chemistry) of the midlower crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the smaller pods of amphibolite displays a negative Eu anomaly and is slightly more enriched than the larger epidote amphibolite pods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sample may have crystallized from a magma following the extraction of plagioclase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rocks of the sole are therefore not geochemically unlike the overlying ophiolite and probably formed in a similar petro-tectonic setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on their geochemistry and geologic context within the high temperature sole, we interpret the more competent pods to be middle- to lower-level crustal rocks of the leading edge of the subducted plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the period of underthrusting to subduction, the underthrust crust was sheared, thinned, and ductiley folded, resulting in the transposition of middle to lower crustal gabbroic rocks with upper crustal basaltic rocks, both of which were subject to the high temperature and high pressure metamorphism that formed the metamorphic sole (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zircons from two of the larger pods (PL-14-05 and PL-14-06) and one smaller pod (PL-14-07) from the high temperature metamorphic sole were extracted for U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS geochronology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four analyzed zircons from sample PL-14-05 yielded internally and externally concordant ages with an error-weighted mean age of 35.242 ± 0.062.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of five analyzed zircons from sample PL-14-06 yielded internally and externally concordant ages with a mean of 35.862 ± 0.048 Ma (Fig 1, Table S2, and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three externally discordant but internally concordant ages of 37.00 ± 0.16, 35.97 ± 0.11, and 35.25 ± 0.15 Ma (Fig 1, Table S2, and Fig S1) were obtained from the smaller pod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of the youngest zircon, 35.25 ± 0.15 Ma, is taken as the best estimate of the final crystallization age of the protolith of this sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small spread in ages seen in this sample is similar to those revealed by high precision U-Pb geochronology in the Samail ophiolite (44) and may be due to prolonged zircon crystallization in a replenished magma chamber or assimilation of slightly older wall rock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Establishing that these zircons are igneous, and not metamorphic, is critical because the age of metamorphic zircons would merely represent the age of metamorphic sole formation (subduction initiation) instead of the crystallization age of the metamorphic sole protoliths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although metamorphic zircon growth has been shown to occur under amphibolite facies conditions (45), cathodoluminescence imaging shows no evidence of metamorphic overgrowths in these zircons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, they are euhedral, prismatic, and have distinct, fine, oscillatory zoning, a feature that is characteristic and unique to magmatic zircons (46) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though Th/U ratios are not completely reliable indicators of magmatic vs. metamorphic zircon, we note that the Th/U ratios in these zircons (0.1) are consistent with many magmatic zircons (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are therefore confident that these zircons are igneous and that their ages reflect the original igneous crystallization age of the oceanic crust that was underthrust, and then metamorphosed, at the onset of subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Forced_Subduction_of_Young__Buoyant_Lithosphere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed earlier, a critical test to constrain the tectonic setting of subduction initiation is a comparison of the igneous ages of the underthrust and overriding lithosphere in relation to the time of subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive test for subduction initiation at an active spreading center is to find all three events very close in age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the age differences between the upper plate (the Palawan ophiolite), the subducting plate (protoliths of the sole), and metamorphism of the sole are less than 1 My (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very small age difference between formation of the sole protolith and its metamorphism during subduction initiation leads us to reject outright the models shown in Fig 1 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the model shown in Fig 1C is rejected for subduction initiation at detachment faults that are far from the spreading center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude that subduction must have initiated in very close proximity to, or at, a spreading center (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our age data do not differentiate between the ridge parallel and ridge normal subduction initiation scenarios in Fig 1D in cases where the ridge-transform fault segments in the right-hand scenario are very short.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity in the geochemistry of the sole and overlying ophiolite also supports subduction initiation close to a spreading center, where the eventual upper plate and lower plate (metamorphic sole) are not expected to be geochemically different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data show that oceanic crust was formed at 35.24 Ma and was then underthrust/subducted almost immediately, reaching 27 km depth, metamorphosed to amphibolite, and subsequently cooled to 400 °C by 34.25 Ma, a remarkably short interval between crust formation and subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a slab dip controlled by an 30° dipping lithosphereasthenosphere boundary, this underthrusting would require a convergence rate on the order of 5 cm/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cases where the detachment fault (Fig 1C) is located very close to, or at the spreading center, the models shown in Fig 1 C and D become indistinguishable using age data alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weakness at which subduction initiated could have been a detachment fault very near the spreading center axis or at the spreading center axis itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact nature of the weak zone could be debated, the high-precision age data from our sample site tightly constrains subduction initiation at, or very close to the spreading axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a detachment fault was the weakness, it would have to have been located very close to the ridge where nascent oceanic crust was generated and then underthrust and metamorphosed at a depth of 27 km less than 1 My later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The much younger age of the Palawan ophiolite compared with the Cretaceous proto-SCSB suggests that subduction was initiated within a young marginal oceanic basin hosted in older Cretaceous proto-SCSB (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the positive buoyancy of young oceanic lithosphere, subduction initiation must have been forced in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following forced underthrusting of the young, buoyant lithosphere, the old, cold, and dense Cretaceous lithosphere of the proto-SCSB would have eventually entered the trench and enabled the transition to self-sustained subduction until the NPCT collided with the trench, caused obduction of the Palawan ophiolite and its sole, and terminated subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regionally, the origin of the force that converted a divergent boundary to a convergent boundary was probably the collision of India with Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tapponnier et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (49) proposed that this collision resulted in the extrusion of fairly rigid continental lithospheric blocks from the southeast margin of Asia along large strike-slip faults, such as the Red River shear zone (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the onset of strike-slip movement along the Red River shear zone has been estimated by U-Pb ages on monazite included in shear-related rotated garnets at 34 Ma (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This age coincides well with the timing of the initiation of subduction in Palawan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seafloor spreading in the South China Sea, which accompanied the southward motion of the NPCT, began around 3230 Ma (30), a time also compatible with initiation of subduction in Palawan south of the NPCT (18) and southward convergence of the NPCT with the Palawan subduction zoneCagayan arc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the reconstruction of Fig 5 is correct, the initiation of subduction at the Palawan spreading center, forced by the extrusion of Indochina, supports the results of numerical modeling (1), which predict that the thin lithosphere at oceanic spreading centers requires less force to converge compared with areas of thicker lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several potential weak zones existed in the area: (i) the southeast China passive margin, (ii) the contact between the older Cretaceous proto-SCSB lithosphere and the much younger Palawan marginal basin, and (iii) the spreading center of the Palawan ophiolite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the presence of older and denser oceanic lithosphere, our results indicate that subduction nucleated within the young, buoyant, but weaker Palawan marginal basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, after the eventual underthrusting of the older Cretaceous lithosphere and an additional critical convergence of 100130 km, subduction became self-sustaining (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is currently no known modern analog for subduction initiation exploiting an active oceanic spreading center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intraoceanic subduction appears to be initiating along several sections of the AustralianPacific plate boundary south of New Zealand, exploiting weaknesses associated with extinct spreading centers and/or fracture zones undergoing transpressional deformation (5052).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the case in Palawan where deep underthrusting occurred within 1 My of oceanic crust formation, spreading at the boundary south of New Zealand had ceased and was followed by strike-slip deformation several million years before incipient subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that there are only a few locations where subduction initiation might be happening (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and references therein), and therefore it is unlikely that these represent the full range of potential mechanisms for intraoceanic subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process of subduction initiation may last on the order of only 23 My (assuming a convergence rate of 5 cm/y) (1), a small fraction of the lifetime of a subduction zone, and is therefore unlikely to be captured by present day observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ophiolites that have similar crystallization ages to the metamorphic age of their sole, like the Palawan ophiolite, are not uncommon (19, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These other examples, however, lack dates for the protolith of the sole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dating these protoliths may show that subduction initiation at spreading centers has been more pervasive than currently recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The subduction zone that existed in Palawan and the nascent Puysegur trench (50) are possibly the only well-constrained geologic examples that address the dynamics of subduction initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both of these examples, a forced initiation has been inferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although spontaneous subduction has been simulated by numerical models (9), corresponding geologic tests have been questioned (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that subduction initiation in the modern day plate tectonic regime requires extant subduction, the main driver of plate motion, to force new subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it appears that forces generated in the interior of major continental collisions zones can be transmitted out to the oceanic realm, rapidly causing diverging plates at a spreading center to converge and lead to incipient subduction in less than 1 My.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geochemical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole rock powders were analyzed by a combination of a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) methods for major elements abundances and inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) methods for trace elements abundances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyses were done at Activation Laboratories (Ontario, Canada) (ACTLAB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of sample preparation methods is given on the ACTLAB Website (www.actlabs.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

U-Pb_Zircon_Geochronology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All reported ages are 206Pb/238U error-weighted mean ages, because the uncertainty of 235U/207Pb ages are pronouncedly large due to the very young and low 235U content of these zircons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are corrected for initial Th/U disequilibrium, and errors are reported as 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twelve zircon grains from the epidote amphibolite pods (PL-14-05, PL-14-06, and PL-14-07) were analyzed by chemical abrasion thermal ionization MS (CA-TIMS) at the radiogenic isotope laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples PL-14-05 and PL-14-06 yielded weighted mean ages of 35.242 ± 0.062 and 35.862 ± 0.048 Ma, respectively, whereas sample PL-14-07 displays three distinct ages of 37.00 ± 0.16, 35.25 ± 0.15, and 35.97 ± 0.11 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sample PL-14-06, the youngest cluster of zircon ages was used for the weighted mean age because this best approximates the timing of magma crystallization (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three zircon fractions from the plagiogranite (PW-00-18) were analyzed by conventional TIMS at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One fraction was analyzed as is, whereas the other two were air abraded to remove any exterior zones with possible Pb-loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unabraded fraction is only slightly younger than the two abraded fractions that give a mean age of 34.1 ± 0.1 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional zircon fractions were analyzed using the stepwise chemical abrasion technique (55), and all analyzed fractions after the first few steps yielded identical 34.1 ± 0.1 Ma ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
