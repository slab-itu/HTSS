Competing English, Spanish, and French alabaster trade in Europe over five centuries as evidenced by isotope fingerprinting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gypsum alabaster in medieval artwork equaled or even surpassed the importance of marble for religious sculptures and effigies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on isotope fingerprints, a large corpus of European alabaster sculptures are linked to historical quarries and trade in the Middle Ages and Renaissance period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that English alabaster export was competed on the continent by the Spanish and by a particularly long-lived (500 y) French Alpine trade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study reveals historical trade routes and transport, the diversity of supply of medieval artists and workshops, as well as the presence and provenance of restoration materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A lack of written sources is a serious obstacle in the reconstruction of the medieval trade of art and art materials, and in the identification of artists, workshop locations, and trade routes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the isotopes of sulfur, oxygen, and strontium (S, O, Sr) present in gypsum alabaster to unambiguously link ancient European source quarries and areas to alabaster artworks produced over five centuries (12th17th) held by the Louvre museum in Paris and other European and American collections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three principal alabaster production areas are identified, in central England, northern Spain, and a major, long-lived but little-documented alabaster trade radiating from the French Alps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The related trade routes are mostly fluvial, although terrestrial transport crossing the major river basin borders is also confirmed by historical sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also identifies recent artwork restoration using Italian alabaster and provides a robust geochemical framework for provenancing, including recognition of restoration and forgeries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fifteen works of art or parts of sculptural ensembles, ranging from the 14th to 17th centuries, are undoubtedly identified as Triassic alabaster from the English Midlands (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our sampling strategy mainly included artwork for which English craftsmanship was not stylistically evident; consequently, English material is statistically underrepresented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only typical Nottingham School carving among these samples is a 14th century altar panel that is a fragment of an Arrest of Christ from the Cluny Museum in Paris (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the 15th century St. Michael striking the Evil from the Louvre in Paris is attributed to a workshop in the Touraine province of France.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These examples illustrate the medieval trade of both carvings and raw alabaster from England.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than half of the samples date from the 16th century, showing the massive export of English alabaster raw materials to France and northern Europe post-1550 in the aftermath of the Protestant iconoclastic crisis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated by the isotope analyses (19) of the funeral monument of King Gustaf Vasa of Sweden, sculpted around 1570 by the Flemish artist Willem Boy, and by the monumental high altar of Calais produced by Adam Lottman from Valenciennes in 16241628.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support Firmans analysis (21) of an unprecedented boom in the alabaster trade lasting 7080 y from 1580 before going into decline until around 1700.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Northern Spain exported heavily to southern Europe (22), but only to the Mediterranean coastal zone in France, notably the Perpignan and Narbonne areas, where alabaster arrived from Beuda by ship (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further evidence of local to regional supply is found in Burgundy, where small-scale medieval quarries furnished the decoration of the Jacques dAmboise Palace in Cluny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local supply was also evident in Provence and the French Alpine Maurienne region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most intriguing result of our study is the great number of non-English carvings with a very homogeneous isotope composition indicative of a French Alpine origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virtually all late 14th to early 15th century artworks that are linked to the popes of Avignon (11 artworks), with only one notable exception, fall in an extremely small range of 87Sr/86Sr (0.707796 ± 0.000005 n = 11) and 34S (15.5 ± 0.1 vs. Canyon Diablo Troilite, CDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group is complemented with nine artworks from the Louvre Museum (Fig 4), and six from other collections covering five centuries from the 12th to the 17th century (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only deposit with a compatible isotope signature is Notre-Dame-de-Mésage (NDM), situated in the western French Alps, southwest of Grenoble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the gypsum quarries are still accessible and alabaster is strongly represented in the local religious architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two artworks in this group are noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One was collected from a fragment of the funeral chapel of the Counts of Savoy in Hautecombe Abbey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this sample, a rare and explicit historical source exists detailing the transport of medieval alabaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accounting records of the castellany of Vizille (23) for 1336 make specific reference of the transfer of 45 blocks of alabaster on behalf of the Dauphin Humbert II for use by the Counts of Savoy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exceptional journey began at Mesatico (NDM) with a 16-km ride using carts drawn by 110 oxen down to the navigable section of the Isere River.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cargo then proceeded by boat and finished using ox carts again for the remaining 25 km to Hautecombe Abbey, 100 km north of NDM on the shores of Bourget Lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This source was cited as early as 1722 by Moret de Bourchenu (24), who stated that an alabaster quarry was still active in Mésage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further proof of quarrying here agrees with our findings characterizing the second noteworthy artwork belonging to this group, the funeral monument of the Constable de Lesdiguières.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the 17th century he owned the land where the NDM quarries are situated (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four other carvings, mainly 16th17th century, show similar  34S values but higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios and may be attributed to other quarries in the NDM deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study brings to light the extensive geographical distribution and longevity of the French Alpine alabaster industry, rivaling that of the English Midlands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zone of influence of this French trade encompassed all of the eastern part of France (Fig 1), crossing the divides of three major river basins: the Rhone, Seine, and Loire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the English Midlands (14), river transport was possibly a key to this success with the NDM quarries situated on the banks of the historically (at least temporarily) navigable Romanche River (23), giving access, via the nearby Drac and Isère Rivers, to the Rhone and Avignon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transloading from ship to ox carts and terrestrial transport, as shown by the Hautecombe example, gave access to the upstream parts of the Rhone basin and other major river basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that papal Avignon was almost exclusively supplied with alabaster from NDM and not by sea from Spain via Aigues-Mortes (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only noteworthy Avignon exception is the funeral monument of Pope Urban V (13101370) for which we identify the Provencal alabaster of Malaucène as the source, through its highly distinctive isotope signature, strongly enriched in 18O [18O of +18.8 ± 0.4 vs. standard mean ocean water (SMOW) n = 4, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quarries produced gypsum in the 13th century (27) and the sampled alabaster quarry is mentioned as early as 1458 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Malaucène also had a strong historical link with Avignon as it was the summer resort of Pope Clement V, and was situated much closer to the papal city than NDM (43 km compared with 240 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the proximity and the availability of good quality of alabaster, NDM was the preferred source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the possible reasons is the ease of fluvial transport that was absent at Malaucène.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the role of the Rhone as principal vector for transporting bulk goods to the Papal Palace has been studied in detail (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land transport costs were estimated seven to nine times higher than river transport in the late Roman Empire and five times higher in the 18th century (29), so in medieval times, transport from NDM may have been cost-effective despite the five times longer distance compared with Malaucène.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two other sculptures from our corpus are also related to Malaucène, a 14th century annunciation group initially situated in a rural church near Troyes in eastern France.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group has since been separated and the statue of Virgin Mary is conserved by the Louvre in Paris, and the Angel Gabriel by the Cleveland Museum of Arts in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our multiisotope method proves beyond reasonable doubt their common origin and raw material source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also identifies a recent restoration, overlooked until now, where part of the base of the statue of the Virgin Mary was replaced by a visually identical but isotopically strongly contrasting material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoration alabaster came from the Volterra region in Tuscany, Italy, which was very active both in Etruscan and Roman antiquity and from the 18th to the early 20th centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this source has not been proved in any of the medieval and Renaissance carvings in western Europe so far analyzed, illustrating the supposed decline of the Volterra quarries until small-scale local use started again in the second half of the 16th century (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study demonstrates that isotope fingerprinting using S, O, and Sr can uniquely characterize historical sources of alabaster artwork, providing insight into previously unknown patterns of medieval stone trade and the affiliation of artworks to regional workshops or individual artists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even if the evidence on transport modes is indirect, our study confirms that fluvial (or marine) transport was generally privileged over terrestrial roads, possibly shorter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the extension of the diffusion area of some sources (i.e., NDM) has required also the use of terrestrial transport to cross major river basin divides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also Cheethams conclusion on the alabaster transport in England (14), who states, based on sparse historical records dating back to 1367, that heavy materials were transported more commonly by road than is often supposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our method benefits from the strong variations of isotope ratios of S, O, Sr in seawater and the associated evaporites through the Mesozoic (31, 32) and further age-independent contrasts related to varying continental influx and redox conditions in the evaporite basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large range of 34S values of the alabaster deposits from +10.4 in the British Permian evaporites to +26.3 in the Italian Messinian deposits of Tuscany reflects mainly the evolution of seawater sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial isolation of (sub)basins can lead to nonnegligible continental contribution to evaporite formation as shown for the East Midlands (33, 34), where it results in depletion of 34S through sulfide oxidation and recycling of carboniferous evaporites and in more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr values due to the erosion of the surrounding massifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erosion of emerging zones of the crystalline basement would also explain the high 87Sr/86Sr ratios (maximum 0.7096) of the Triassic Burundian deposits, which are well above the highest Mesozoic seawater values of 0.7092 (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed contrasts in signatures provide a means of forensically investigating restored artworks and forgeries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extension of the technique to alabaster deposits from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean (35) and to artwork dating back to Antiquity seems promising, given the highly distinctive isotope signatures of Zechstein and Messinian evaporites and the major importance of gypsum alabaster in the art of ancient Mediterranean and Mesopotamian cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The required minimum quantity for a complete isotope analysis (Sr, S, and O isotopes) using the method described in Kloppmann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) is less than 20 mg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to a tiny flake of around 2 × 2 × 2 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flakes, sampled with a miniature chisel on a noncarved, nonvisible surface of the sculpture (e.g., rear surface or base), were preferred to microdrilling for two reasons: (i) It is possible to detect and correct any treatment or contamination of the surface by manual cleaning under a microscope; (ii) There is less aesthetic impact as the noncarved surfaces frequently have defects such as drilled fixing holes or irregular surfaces allowing discrete sampling to be undertaken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We strictly avoided any suspected or visible repairs or fixings where gypsum plaster/mortar were present as these are highly contaminant for our method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also avoided or cleaned, whenever possible, any surface treatments (patina, wax, and painting) to obtain unaltered isotope signatures of fresh material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples are crushed, weighed, and slowly dissolved in a closed tube filled with 50 mL of Millipore distilled water at 50 °C in an oven for at least 1 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After filtration, the 50 mL solution is divided in three aliquots; two of 5 mL for Sr isotopes and elemental analysis, the 40 mL for sulfur and oxygen isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfates are precipitated as BaSO4 from the filtered solution by adding BaCl2 solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitate is then filtered off and left to dry and a fraction (350 µg) of BaSO4 is mixed with vanadium pentoxide in a tin capsule (36), injected in a flash combustion elemental analyzer (Flash EA) where BaSO4 is reduced to SO2 at 1,7001,800 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified SO2 is analyzed for S isotopes by a CF-IRMS: Thermo Delta Plus XP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aliquot of the BaSO4 (200 µg) is placed in a silver capsule, injected in a high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer reactor with a graphite insert at 1,450 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting CO is analyzed by CF-IRMS for oxygen isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotopic composition of sulfur is expressed in the usual delta notation as a per mil () deviation of the heavy-to-light isotope abundance ratio (34S/32S) in the sample (34S), with respect to the CDT standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen isotopes (18O/16O) are reported as 18O with respect to the SMOW standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur and oxygen isotopes are measured twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The external error (1), based on repeated measurements of international and in-house standards, is 0.5 for 18O and 0.3 for 34S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internal errors are systematically lower, if not indicated in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemical purification of Sr is performed using an ion-exchange column (Sr-Spec) before mass analysis according to a method adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37, with total blank less_than1 ng for the entire chemical procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After chemical separation, around 150 ng of Sr is loaded onto a tungsten filament with a tantalum activator and analyzed with a Finnigan MAT262 multicollector TIMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios are normalized to an 86Sr/88Sr of 0.1194 and then adjusted to the NBS987 standard value of 0.710240.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An average internal precision of ±10 × 106 (2m) was currently obtained during this study and the reproducibility of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio measurements was tested through repeated analyses of the NBS 987 standard, for which we obtained a mean value of 0.710248 ± 11 × 106 (2; n = 372) during the period of analysis (20132015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
