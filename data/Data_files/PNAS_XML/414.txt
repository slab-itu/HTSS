Role of DNA methylation in hybrid vigor in Arabidopsis thaliana  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hybrid vigor is an important phenomenon in basic genetics and in agricultural practice, but the bases of the superior performance of the hybrid relative to its parents in biomass and seed production remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, it has been suggested that epigenetic controls on levels of gene action are involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mutants of genes involved in DNA methylation, we show that RNA polymerase IV or methyltransferase I do not contribute to the generation of the heterotic phenotype but that decrease in DNA methylation 1, a nucleosome remodeller with an effect on DNA methylation level, is required to produce a full level of hybrid vigor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hybrid vigor or heterosis refers to the superior performance of F1 hybrid plants over their parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterosis is particularly important in the production systems of major crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have suggested that epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation is involved in heterosis, but the molecular mechanism of heterosis is still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the epigenetic contribution to heterosis in Arabidopsis thaliana, we used mutant genes that have roles in DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrids between C24 and Columbia-0 (Col) without RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) or methyltransferase I (MET1) function did not reduce the level of biomass heterosis (as evaluated by rosette diameter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrids with a mutation in decrease in dna methylation 1 (ddm1) showed a decreased heterosis level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetative heterosis in the ddm1 mutant hybrid was reduced but not eliminated; a complete reduction could result if there was a change in methylation at all loci critical for generating the level of heterosis, whereas if only a proportion of the loci have methylation changes there may only be a partial reduction in heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three_F1_Hybrid_Combinations_Show_Heterosis_in_Seedling_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hybrids from different parental combinations show different patterns of vegetative growth (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomass heterosis evaluated by rosette diameter (RD) is observed in C24 × Col hybrids at early seedling stages (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we compared the RD in C24 × Cvi and Col × Cvi hybrids with their parental lines at 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28 days after sowing (DAS) in addition to the comparison between C24 × Col and its parental lines (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RD in C24 × Col hybrids is larger than that of the better parent value (BPV) from 14 to 28 DAS (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 14 DAS, the RD in C24 × Cvi hybrids was smaller than that of C24 × Col hybrids, whereas the RD in Col × Cvi hybrids was the same as that in C24 × Col hybrids (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of RD between the F1 and the BPV (termed rBPV) in the C24 × Cvi hybrid is smaller than that in C24 × Col hybrids, and rBPV in Col × Cvi hybrids was the same as that in C24 × Col hybrids at 14 DAS (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicated that Col × Cvi hybrids have obvious heterosis, whereas C24 × Cvi hybrids have moderate heterosis at 14 DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 28 DAS, the plant sizes of the three hybrids were the same (Fig 1A), but rBPVs in C24 × Cvi and Col × Cvi hybrids were lower than that in the C24 × Col hybrid (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the heterosis in C24 × Cvi and Col × Cvi hybrids is only moderate at 28 DAS, due to the large RD in the better parental line; the RD in Cvi was larger than that in Col or C24 at 28 DAS (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parental ecotypes have different alleles of the two flowering time genes, FRI and FLC, (Materials and Methods) that determine the flowering time of the hybrids in the different parental crosses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flowering time in C24 × Col and C24 × Cvi hybrids was later than in the parental lines, whereas flowering time in Col × Cvi hybrids was the same as the parental lines (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured heterosis before and after flowering for each line and found that all three hybrids had heterotic growth before the flowering time of their parents; the Col × Cvi early flowering hybrid had decreased heterosis after flowering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured rosette diameter in F2 generations derived from C24 × Col and Col × C24 hybrids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of the RD in F2 plants derived from C24 × Col and Col × C24 at 14 DAS compared with the C24 × Col hybrid were 0.82 or 0.92, respectively (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced a BC1F1 population by crossing the C24 × Col hybrid and Col [BC1F1 (Col)], or the C24 × Col hybrid and C24 [BC1F1 (C24)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of RD in BC1F1 (Col) and BC1F1 (C24) compared with that of C24 × Col hybrids (F1) were 0.82 and 0.80, respectively, at 14 DAS (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These scores are similar to the parental lines: 0.83 in Col and 0.82 in C24 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced BC2F1 plants by crossing BC1F1 plants with each parental line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of RD in BC2F1 (Col) and BC2F1 (C24) compared with the F1 hybrid were 0.78 and 0.75, respectively, at 14 DAS (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed BC2F1 plants with the parents to produce BC3F1 plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of RD in BC3F1 (Col) and BC3F1 (C24) compared with the F1 hybrid were 0.85 and 0.88, respectively, at 14 DAS (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We crossed BC1F1 plants with the alternative parent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of RD in BC1F1 (Col) × C24 and BC1F1 (C24) × Col hybrids compared with F1 were 0.84 and 0.95, respectively, at 14 DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we made the hybrids between BC2F1 (Col) and C24 or between BC2F1 (C24) and Col.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averages of the ratio of RD in BC2F1 (Col) × C24 and BC2F1 (C24) × Col hybrids compared with F1 was 0.96 and 1.01, respectively, at 14 DAS (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that two backcrosses were sufficient to generate F1 equivalent heterosis in crosses of BC2 plants with the alternative parent plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Establishment_of_Seedling_Heterosis_Is_Independent_of_Pol_IV_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is nonadditive 24nt-siRNA content in heterotic F1 hybrids, suggesting that a change in 24nt-siRNA levels with associated changes in the pattern of gene expression in the F1 hybrids may contribute to the heterotic phenotype (17, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pol IV is a key enzyme for generating 24nt-siRNAs (16, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the contribution of 24nt-siRNAs to seedling heterosis, we crossed pol IV mutants in both parental accessions [nrpd1a-3 (SALK_128428) in Col, and sde4-2 in C24; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the reduction of the 24nt-siRNAs, siRNA02 and siRNA1003, by Northern blot analysis (Fig 3B), decrease of DNA methylation levels in AtSN1 by chop-PCR (Fig 3C), and transcriptional activation of the AtSN1 and Solo LTR by RT-PCR in the pol IV mutant hybrids (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reciprocal F1 hybrids between nrpd1a-3 and sde4-2 developed heterosis at the same level as the C24 × Col wild-type hybrids (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the expression levels of 27 genes in the pol IV mutant hybrids, and these genes had shown nonadditive expression in wild-type C24 × Col hybrids; 16 genes had expression levels greater than the midparent value (MPV) and 11 genes had expression levels less than the MPV (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the genes have the same differential expression in the mutant and wild-type hybrids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the 27 genes showed differential expression between the pol IV mutant hybrids and wild-type hybrids (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the expression level of these two genes in nrpd1a-3 and wild-type Col or between sde4-2 and wild-type C24; they showed differential expression only between nrpd1a-3 and Col, indicating that the expression in the pol IV mutant hybrids relative to wild-type hybrids was due to an increased expression level of the Col allele in the presence of the pol IV mutation (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Maintenance_of_CG_Methylation_by_MET1_Is_Not_Involved_in_Heterosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used two approaches to examine the involvement of MET1, or maintenance CG methylation, in heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made met1-RNAi knockdown lines in a C24 background (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrids between met1-RNAi (C24) and met1-1 (Col) had RDs the same as in the C24 × Col wild-type hybrids (SI Appendix, Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expected decreased CG methylation of the promoter region of FIS2 in the hybrids between met1-RNAi (C24) and met1-1 (Col) was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We crossed met1-1 (Col) to C24 and generated the BC2F1 (C24), which was heterozygous for the met1-1 mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed met1-1 to BC2F1 (C24) (MET1/met1) and obtained hybrids being homozygous or heterozygous met1-1; there was no size difference between the plants with these two genotypes (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RD in the BC2F1 (C24) × met1-1 hybrid was larger than in the parents, BC2F1 (C24) and met1-1 (Col) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased CG methylation of the homozygous met1 hybrid plants from the cross between BC2F1 (C24) (MET1/met1) and met1-1 was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing of three control loci (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDM1_Is_Involved_in_the_Maintenance_of_Heterosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first generation of the ddm1 mutation in both the Col and C24 has rosette diameters closely similar to the wild type (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these mutants, we made a hybrid between ddm1-9 (C24) and ddm1-1 (Col).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the decrease of DNA methylation in the ddm1 homozygous hybrids by MeDIP-qPCR (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RD in the ddm1 mutant hybrids was smaller throughout development than that in C24 × Col wild-type hybrids (Table 1 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in the level of heterosis was greater at 18 DAS than at 14 DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the backcrossing procedure (26), ddm1-1 in a Cvi background was made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again used the first generation of the homozygous ddm1 mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C24 × Cvi and Col × Cvi hybrids had heterotic RDs (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced the ddm1-9 (C24) × ddm1-1 (Cvi) and ddm1-1 (Col) × ddm1-1 (Cvi) hybrids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rosette size of both these two hybrids was smaller than the wild-type hybrids (Fig 6 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8), indicating that the DDM1 protein is involved in seedling heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crosses using the second generation of ddm1 mutants showed the same plant size as first-generation ddm1 mutant hybrids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution_of_the_ddm1_Mutation_Effects_and_the_Level_of_Heterosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether the decrease in heterosis in ddm1 hybrids is linked to the absence of DDM1 function, we made an F1 hybrid between a heterozygote of the ddm1-9 mutation in C24 (DDM1/ddm1) and a ddm1-1 homozygous mutant in Col (ddm1/ddm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 14 to 26 DAS, the average RD in the F1 hybrid plants homozygous for ddm1 was smaller than the RDs of the heterozygous ddm1 plants (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some plants heterozygous for ddm1 were smaller than the average of the RD in F1 hybrid plants homozygous for ddm1 (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was also observed in the combinations between C24 (ddm1/ddm1) and Col (DDM1/ddm1), between Col (DDM1/ddm1) and C24 (ddm1/ddm1), between C24 (DDM1/ddm1) and Cvi (ddm1/ddm1), and between C24 (ddm1/ddm1) and Cvi (DDM1/ddm1) (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the decrease in heterosis in the hybrid ddm1 homozygotes is associated with stochastic changes in the methylation state of loci either directly or indirectly contributing to the level of heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F1 hybrid between C24 ddm1 and Col met1-1 is heterozygous for DDM1 and MET1 and has a wild-type heterosis level (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been suggested that epigenetic systems may be involved in the alteration of gene expression in hybrids that, in turn, could contribute to the hybrid phenotype (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One epigenetic system that has been studied is the small RNA system, particularly the 24nt-siRNAs, which are involved in the modification of DNA methylation of many genes of the genome (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the changes in DNA methylation in hybrids correlate with changes in transcription levels (11), but there is no consistent relationship among the changes in DNA methylation, the changes in transcription, and the generation of the heterotic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have considered the effects of three genes, POL IV, MET1, and DDM1, which are known to affect DNA methylation status, either directly or indirectly, of many loci in the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found that a loss of the RdDM system involving POL IV production of 24nt-siRNAs does not decrease the level of heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of small siRNA expression in hybrids versus the levels of expression in the parents of the hybrids has been determined in rice, wheat, and maize, as well as in A. thaliana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of these species, a reduction in 24nt-siRNAs in the hybrid has been observed (13, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In maize, mutants in the MOP1 (Mediator of Paramutation 1) gene, an ortholog of RDR2 of A. thaliana, reduced the level of siRNAs (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrids homozygous for the mop1 mutation retained their level of heterosis, indicating that siRNAs synthesized by MOP1 are not involved in generating the heterosis phenotype (27), consistent with our finding with the pol IV mutants in A. thaliana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second gene we studied was MET1, important in the maintenance of CG methylation (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The null mutant of MET1 reduces the frequency of CG methylation but does not reduce the level of heterosis, indicating that MET1-dependent CG maintenance of DNA methylation is not involved in heterosis in these hybrids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The third gene we examined was DDM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene has a number of different effects through modification of chromatin structure, with resultant effects on DNA methylation levels (15, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have examined seven loci in ddm1 hybrids and found DNA methylation to be reduced at these loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hybrids had a rosette diameter up to 25% smaller than the wild-type hybrid rosette at 14 DAS and up to 75% smaller than the wild-type hybrid rosette at 18 DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrids heterozygous for the ddm1 mutation in general had a phenotype the same as wild-type hybrids, but up to 10% of the plants had a smaller rosette diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These DDM1/ddm1 hybrid plants with the smaller rosettes may result from the previous methylation state of the genome in the ddm1 parent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ddm1 parent has progressive DNA demethylation over several generations with increasing levels of developmental abnormalities (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the DDM1/ddm1 heterozygous hybrid, the gene or segments important for heterosis coming from the ddm1 parent might already have an altered level of DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that in the crosses involving first- and second-generation ddm1 mutants, not all prospective targets important for the heterotic phenotype have been subjected to DNA demethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difference in heterosis levels between DDM1/ddm1 and ddm1/ddm1 hybrids could be due to an unrelated effect of ddm1 on growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We think this possibility is unlikely because the first-generation ddm1 mutants in the C24 and Col parents used in these crosses have rosette diameters similar to the rosette diameters of the wild-type parents (Table 1), consistent with the findings of Vongs et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) who first described the ddm1 mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of heterosis in the rosette diameters in the ddm1/ddm1 hybrids is 1025% lower than the rosette diameters of the wild-type hybrids when they are compared with their respective parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous met1 plants can have reduced growth, but the level of heterosis is not altered (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 and Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fact that the dmm1/ddm1 hybrid plants have reduced heterosis contrasting to the hybrids carrying met1 and pol IV mutation is likely to be a consequence of the different modes of involvement of these three loci in the methylation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The POL IV locus is responsible for the production of 24nt-siRNAs, which act as guides for de novo methylation of sequences homologous to the sRNA molecules and for the maintenance of the CHH methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MET1 operates as a principal maintenance mechanism for the CG methylation context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDM1 is a nucleosome remodeler that, through changes in chromatin structure, leads to hypomethylated loci in all three sequence contexts, mostly associated with heterochromatic transposable elements that, in turn, may result in changes in patterns of gene expression affecting the level of hybrid vigor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The scale of the reduction in the level of heterosis in the ddm1/ddm1 hybrids could be due to the incomplete demethylation events caused by the ddm1 mutation in early generations of the homozygous mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loci undergoing demethylation could have changes in their expression contributing to hybrid vigor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another effect of the ddm1 allele is its propensity in successive generations to produce hypermethylation at some loci in the genome (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative importance of hypermethylation and hypomethylation in affecting heterosis together with the identity of the critical loci is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that there is only a partial loss of heterosis in ddm1/ddm1 hybrids may be due to the levels of changes of methylation status of loci across the genome, but it may also point to the existence of other pathways that play a role in the generation of hybrid vigor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Columbia-0 (Col), C24, and Cvi accessions were used as parental lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Col and Cvi have late alleles of FLC and inactive alleles of FRI, C24 has an early allele of FLC and an active allele of FRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lines of ddm1-1 (Col) (31), ddm1-9 (C24) (33), met1-1 (Col) (30), nrpd1a-3 (Col) (SALK_128428), and sde4-2 (C24) (25) mutants were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reciprocal hybrids and backcross populations were generated by hand pollination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown in growth chambers under a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeds were sown on plastic dishes containing Murashige and Skoog agar medium supplemented with 1.0% sucrose (pH 5.7), and were transferred to soil at 14 DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD was measured for evaluation of plant size or heterosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD equals the maximum diameter of the rosette as measured between the two largest leaves at a certain point in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD depends on leaf blade and petiole length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ddm1-1 mutant in Col or Cvi was the first generation of the ddm1 homozygous mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second generations of ddm1 mutants were developed by self-pollination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ddm1-9 in C24, we crossed ddm1-9 to wild-type C24 and gained the first generation of ddm1-9 homozygous mutant from the F2 population, and first- and second-generation ddm1-9 mutants were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences used for genotyping of ddm1-1, ddm1-9, and met1-1 are shown in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
