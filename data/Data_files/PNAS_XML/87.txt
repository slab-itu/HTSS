Virion-associated phosphatidylethanolamine promotes TIM1-mediated infection by Ebola, dengue, and West Nile viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many viruses use phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors to gain entry into target cells, and phagocytes use these receptors to clear apoptotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS receptors mediate these activities by binding PS on the viruses or apoptotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate here that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors, and that PE plays a key role in apoptotic cell clearance and infection of various pathogenic viruses, including West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding provides significant insights; it clarifies how PS receptors promote viral infection, suggests PE is a useful broad-spectrum antiviral target, and deepens our understanding of apoptosis and the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors contribute to two crucial biological processes: apoptotic clearance and entry of many enveloped viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, they recognize PS exposed on the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors and that this phospholipid mediates phagocytosis and viral entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a subset of PS receptors, including T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1), efficiently bind PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that PE is present in the virions of flaviviruses and filoviruses, and that the PE-specific cyclic peptide lantibiotic agent Duramycin efficiently inhibits the entry of West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory effect of Duramycin is specific: it inhibits TIM1-mediated, but not L-SIGN-mediated, virus infection, and it does so by blocking virus attachment to TIM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and promotes their phagocytic uptake by TIM1-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data show that PE plays a key role in TIM1-mediated virus entry, suggest that disrupting PE association with PS receptors is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy, and deepen our understanding of the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PE_Is_a_Ligand_for_TIM1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We and others have reported that PS receptors promote the entry of viruses by binding PS present in the viral envelope (9, 10, 18, 19, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also observed that TIM1-mediated entry of various viruses, including replication-competent DENV2, EBOV VLPs, and WNV VLPs, was efficiently inhibited by PE liposomes in addition to PS liposomes (Fig S2) (10), implying that PE may also be involved in TIM1-mediated viral entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we first assessed the binding of TIM proteins to synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS)] by ELISA, using constructs in which the extracellular domain of hTIM1, hTIM3, or hTIM4 was fused to the Fc domain of murine IgG2a (hTIM1-mIg, hTIM3-mIg, and hTIM4-mIg, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, hTIM1- and hTIM4-mIg efficiently bound DOPS, with detectable binding observed at a concentration as low as 0.1 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, we could detect only marginal binding of hTIM3-mIg to DOPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting our hypothesis, hTIM1- and hTIM4-mIg, but not hTIM3-mIg, indeed bound DOPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TIM proteins contain a metal ion-dependent ligand binding site contributing to PS binding (2224), we assessed the effect of Ca2+ on TIM binding to PE or PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3A shows that the absence of Ca2+ slightly lower binding of hTIM1-mIg to PE or PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, hTIM4-mIg binding to PS, and more so to PE, was markedly reduced, suggesting that hTIM4 relies on metal ions more strongly to bind PE and PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that TIM protein binding to PE was not affected by the source of phospholipids, we compared synthetic phospholipids to phospholipids extracted from mammalian tissues for their binding to TIM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical results were obtained with both types of phospholipids (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data show that PE is an effective ligand for TIM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Duramycin_Binds_PE_in_Viral_Membranes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the role of PE in TIM1-mediated viral entry, we used a small, PE-specific molecule, Duramycin, a 19-aa lantibiotic agent (Fig S1) that has been described to interact with PE with high specificity (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Duramycin was reported to lyse red blood cells at high concentrations, its derivative, biotin-Duramycin, was shown to be substantially less hemolytic while retaining its affinity and specificity for PE (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus used biotin-Duramycin throughout these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first confirmed by ELISA that Duramycin interacted only with DOPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No signal was detected with DOPC or DOPS, even when high concentrations of Duramycin or phospholipids were used (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then assessed Duramycin binding to antibody-captured enveloped viruses, including DENV2, WNV VLPs, and EBOV VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonenveloped adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) was used as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2B, Duramycin efficiently bound to DENV2, EBOV VLPs, and WNV VLPs, but not to AdV5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the lack of Duramycin binding to AdV5 was not a result of the absence of the virus, we used a second AdV5-specific antibody that demonstrated the presence of the antibody-captured virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify that Duramycin binds PE and not any other viral components, antibody-captured DENV2 was digested with phospholipase C (PLC), which removes the head group of phospholipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant and dose-dependent decrease of Duramycin binding to PLC-digested DENV2 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sandwich ELISA specific for DENV2 showed that the amount of virus was similar in all of the wells, regardless of the concentrations of PLC used, verifying that PLC digestion did not cause the virus to dissociate from the capturing antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show that Duramycin specifically binds PE on EBOV, DENV2, and WNV, indicating that PE is exposed at their surface and could therefore be engaged in viral entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PE_Contributes_to_hTIM1-Mediated_Viral_Entry_of_EBOV__DENV2__and_WNV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether the ability of TIM1 to bind PE is important for its function as a mediator of viral entry, we used Duramycin as an inhibitor in infection assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV2, EBOV VLPs, and WNV VLPs were preincubated with increasing concentrations of Duramycin and used to infect 293T cells or 293T cells expressing hTIM1 (hTIM1-293T; Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, hTIM1 expression markedly increased infection of the cells by DENV2, EBOV VLPs, and WNV VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that Duramycin drastically decreased TIM1-mediated entry, with 75% of inhibition for EBOV VLPs and more than 90% for DENV2 at 0.3 M (Fig 3 A and B and Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although less sensitive, hTIM1-mediated entry of WNV VLPs was completely abolished by 1 M of Duramycin (Fig 3C and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1, which does not use TIM1 to enter cells (10), and nonenveloped virus AdV5 were used as controls for DENV2 (Fig 3A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, neither hTIM1 expression nor Duramycin affected the infection of hTIM1-293T with these viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VSV VLPs, generated by pseudotyping EBOV VP40 matrix protein fused to -lactamase (Bla) with VSV GP, was used as a control for EBOV VLPs (Fig 3B and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The moderate enhancement of VSV VLP entry into hTIM1-293T cells correlated with a moderate inhibitory effect of Duramycin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MLV-based pseudoviruses (PVs) bearing the entry protein of Lassa virus (LASV), which does not use hTIM1 or any other PS receptors (10), was used as an additional control (Fig 3C and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LASV PV entry was not affected by hTIM1 expression or Duramycin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To exclude the possibility that the inhibition of infection by Duramycin was caused by any cytotoxic effect, we measured the leakage of the cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5A shows that Duramycin had no cytotoxic effect in hTIM1-293T cells at concentrations as high as 1 ÂµM, the highest concentration used in these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that Duramycin also has no virolytic activity on TIM1-using viruses, WNV VLPs preincubated with Duramycin were used to infect hTIM1- or hL-SIGN-293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S5B, WNV VLP infection into hLSIGN-293T cells was not affected by Duramycin, whereas entry into hTIM1-293T cells was inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Duramycin did not specifically inactivate TIM1-using viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, Duramycins inhibitory effect was not observed with TIM1-independent viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although antibody-captured IAV (H1N1) efficiently bound Duramycin (Fig S5C), it did not inhibit IAV (H1N1) entry into hTIM1-293T cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the fact that IAV does not use PS receptors (10), and indicate that Duramycin-mediated inhibition is specific for TIM1-using viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine Duramycins mode of action, we performed time-of-addition experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Duramycin was added to cells postinfection, it showed no effect (Fig S6A, Right), indicating that Duramycin works at early steps of virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Fig S6B shows that Duramycin inhibits DENV2 association with hTIM-293T cells, whereas binding of the same virus to hL-SIGN-293T cells is not affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results show that Duramycin potently inhibits TIM1-mediated virus infection by blocking virus association with TIM1, and confirm that virion PE plays a crucial role in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contribution_of_PE_in_PS_Receptor-Mediated_Viral_Entry_Is_Physiological  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further investigated the involvement of PE in virus entry into cells naturally expressing TIM1, such as Vero cells and A549 cells (Fig 4 A and C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Vero cells were infected with WNV VLPs or LASV PVs preincubated with Duramycin, WNV VLP entry was substantially decreased in a dose-dependent manner, but that of LASV PVs was not (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected fluorographs are shown in Fig 4B, Left: a strong effect of Duramycin on WNV VLP entry is evident at 0.5 M. Similarly, in A549 cells, Duramycin dramatically decreased DENV2 infection, whereas IAV (H1N1) infection remained unaffected (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Fig S7 shows, the inhibition of infection in Vero and A549 cells is not caused by any cytotoxic effect of Duramycin, and is consistent with the fact that WNV and DENV2 use PS receptors whereas LASV PV and IAV (H1N1) do not (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then assessed the contribution of PE to EBOV VLP entry into primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NaÃ¯ve mouse peritoneal macrophages, which are known to express PS receptors (15), were infected with EBOV VLPs either preincubated with Duramycin or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4D shows that 1 M of Duramycin nearly completely abolished the infection of the macrophages by EBOV VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that PE is a key player in virus entry into cells naturally expressing PS receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PE_Is_Exposed_on_Apoptotic_Cells_and_Promotes_TIM1-Mediated_Phagocytosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TIM1 is known to promote phagocytosis by binding PS at the surface of apoptotic cells (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify that the ability of TIM1 to bind PE contributes to its physiological functions, we investigated the role of PE in TIM1-mediated phagocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like PS, PE is mostly confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, we induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells by using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, and stained them with biotin-annexin A5 or biotin-Duramycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5A, Duramycin bound the majority of these cells, confirming that PE exposure is a physiological feature of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annexin A5, used as a positive control, strongly bound actinomycin D-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live Jurkat cells remained negative for Duramycin and annexin A5 binding, although, at the highest concentration (0.3 ÂµM), Duramycin showed a low level of binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the role of PE in phagocytosis, apoptotic Jurkat cells were loaded with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo and incubated with increasing amounts of Duramycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hTIM1-293T cells were then cocultured with these cells and washed extensively before analysis to remove the Jurkat cells that were not engulfed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hL-SIGN-293T cells were also used to ensure that protein overexpression at the surface of the cells did not trigger any nonspecific engulfment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because pHrodo emits brighter fluorescence in acidic environments, only Jurkat cells that have been engulfed and have reached a low pH compartment are scored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of hTIM1 in 293T cells resulted in approximately a fivefold increase in phagocytosis compared with parental 293T and hL-SIGN-293T cells (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preincubation of apoptotic Jurkat cells with Duramycin significantly decreased their uptake, with 80% inhibition of TIM1-mediated phagocytosis at 0.5 M Duramycin (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results demonstrate that PE becomes exposed at the cell surface during apoptosis and plays an important role in TIM1-mediated phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show here that PE is a ligand for TIM proteins, especially for TIM1, and other PS-binding proteins (Fig 1 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that PE is present on the virions of enveloped viruses, including EBOV, DENV2, and WNV (Fig 2B), and that virion-associated PE promotes virus entry into cells exogenously or naturally expressing TIM1 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using PE-specific Duramycin, we show that PE on the virion membrane mediates virus attachment to TIM1 (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that PE is exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells and promotes TIM1-mediated phagocytosis of those cells (Fig 5), showing that PE is also involved in the physiological activities of PS receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of TIM-family proteins to bind PE and its important role in viral entry have not been described thus far to our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2007, Kobayashi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that human and murine TIM proteins bound PS, but not PE (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by using similar methods (ELISA) and constructs (TIM extracellular domains fused to mIg), we demonstrate here that PE is an unambiguous ligand for hTIM1 (Fig 1 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy could be explained by the use of two different cell lines, hamster CHO cells and human 293T cells, to produce the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, glycosylation differences in the IgV head domain, which contains a PS and PE binding site, may have altered the specificity of TIM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, at high concentrations of PE and PS, hTIM-mIg binding is rather decreased (Fig 1 and Fig S3), a possible consequence of micelle formation at high concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is more pronounced for PE than PS, perhaps explaining why some investigators have overlooked the role of PE (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other groups have previously reported that other so-called PS-binding proteins also bind PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) protein was shown to promote phagocytosis, it was observed that it bound PE in addition to PS (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, annexin A5 was previously shown to bind PE (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these observations were overlooked, and such proteins were subsequently described to exclusively bind PS (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the phospholipid binding profile of MFG-E8 and annexin A5 by ELISA and confirmed that PE is a ligand for both proteins (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to bind PE is therefore not exclusive to TIM proteins, but rather a common feature of at least a subset of PS-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the ability to bind PE varies among PS receptors, it is tempting to speculate that cells bearing these receptors can detect varying PE/PS ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, PS receptors vary dramatically in their dependence on Ca2+ concentrations (Fig 1 and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of PE and perhaps Ca2+ may therefore regulate processes mediated by PS receptors such as phagocytosis, as well as innate and adaptive immunity (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is noteworthy that Duramycin-mediated inhibition is almost complete for all viruses tested (Fig 3), although PS is also present on the virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple explanation is that Duramycin molecules bound to PE on the virions occlude access of TIM1, whose head domain consists of 100 aa, to neighboring PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, efficient PE liposome blocking of infection (Fig S2) and TIM1/PE ELISA data (Fig 1) indicate that most of the Duramycin-mediated infection inhibition seems to result from direct binding of PE to TIM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PS receptors may be useful to viruses because these proteins are redundantly expressed in a wide range of cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells that are often the primary target cells for many viruses (3740).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBOV buds from PS-rich microdomains (41), which may ensure abundant PS on the virion to amplify PS receptor utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS receptors may also be especially beneficial to viruses that cycle between evolutionarily distant hosts, such as mosquitoes and mammals, because PS-binding proteins are functionally conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subset of PS receptors that bind PE in addition to PS might be of special interest to viruses because PE content in mammalian membranes (1525% of total phospholipids; as much as 45% in the brain) is much higher than that of PS (510%) (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, viral envelopes are likely to contain more PE than PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With PE content in insect cells being even higher (as much as 4658%) (4448), it is not surprising that arboviruses, such as flavi- and alphaviruses, evolved to use PE-binding receptors like TIM1 with high efficiency (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For viruses such as DENV, vaccine design is extremely challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective vaccines or immunotherapies are complex to develop as a result of the severe complications caused by cross-reactive antibodies (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a broad antiviral strategy might be one of the few viable options to control dengue hemorrhagic fever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting PS on virions has previously been suggested as a broad antiviral strategy (12), but proven difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soares et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that guinea pigs survived a lethal Pichinde virus infection when treated with an antibody originally described as PS-specific (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this antibody primarily recognizes -2 GP I and cardiolipin (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, another anti-PS antibody (clone 4B6) we tested did not bind PS but rather bound PE (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown here that the PE-specific antibiotic agent Duramycin effectively inhibits the infection of many pathogenic viruses without any approved vaccines or treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the importance of PE in viral entry processes, the presumed high abundance of PE on the virions, the fact that it is not exposed on the surface of healthy cells (29), Duramycin and similar PE-binding compounds may make useful antiviral agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Duramycin itself contains lanthionine and methyllantionine bridges, making it expensive to synthesize and difficult to improve, its ability to control the replication of major pathogens such as EBOV, DENV, and WNV suggests that PE is a promising target for the design of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ELISAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For protein and Duramycin binding to phospholipids, phospholipids were dried on ELISA plates and incubated with the indicated molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding was detected by using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for mIg fusion proteins and HRP-conjugated streptavidin for biotin-Duramycin and biotin-annexin A5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Duramycin binding to viruses and to PLC-digested DENV2 virions, ELISA plates coated with virus-specific antibodies were incubated with virus, followed by incubation with PLC when indicated, then Duramycin and HRP-conjugated streptavidin to detect the binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
