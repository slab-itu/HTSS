Mnemonic convergence in social networks: The emergent properties of cognition at a collective level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human memory is highly malleable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this malleability, jointly remembering the past along with another individual often results in increased similarity between the conversational partners memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose an approach that examines the conversation between a pair of participants as part of a larger network of social interactions that has the potential to reveal how human communities form collective memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical evidence indicating that dyadic-level conversational alignment processes give rise to community-wide shared memories is presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that individual-level memory updating phenomena and social network structure are two fundamental factors that contribute to the emergence of collective memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of shared memories, beliefs, and norms is a fundamental characteristic of human communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These emergent outcomes are thought to occur owing to a dynamic system of information sharing and memory updating, which fundamentally depends on communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report results on the formation of collective memories in laboratory-created communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated conversational network structure in a series of real-time, computer-mediated interactions in fourteen 10-member communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that mnemonic convergence, measured as the degree of overlap among community members memories, is influenced by both individual-level information-processing phenomena and by the conversational social network structure created during conversational recall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By studying laboratory-created social networks, we show how large-scale social phenomena (i.e., collective memory) can emerge out of microlevel local dynamics (i.e., mnemonic reinforcement and suppression effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social-interactionist approach proposed herein points to optimal strategies for spreading information in social networks and provides a framework for measuring and forging collective memories in communities of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phases of the experimental procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants first study information about the four Peace Corps volunteers (only two shown here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the preconversational and postconversational phases, 10 participants individually recall the studied information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conversational recall phase, participants are part of either the clustered (left) or the nonclustered (right) condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circles represent participants, and links represent conversations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers in red indicate the sequence of conversations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To provide an additional test of our hypothesis that the conversational network structure affects the degree of mnemonic convergence in networked communities, we conducted a Mantel test, a test commonly used in ecology to calculate correlations between matrices (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, the mnemonic similarities among participants in each network could be represented as distance matrices from each participants mnemonic representation to every other participants mnemonic representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this feature allows us to make predictions about the pairs that are expected to align their mnemonic representations as a function of their designated communitys conversational network structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first computed the mnemonic similarity score between each pair of participants separately for the preconversational recall and the postconversational recall (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then computed a mnemonic alignment score for each pair of participants within a network (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high score on this measure indicates that the two participants memories became more similar to each others following network conversations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then standardized these scores for each network and averaged the standardized scores across the networks, separately by condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that the mnemonic alignment score would decrease as the degree of separation in the conversational network increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that the observed data should match an artificially constructed dataset that exhibited the hypothesized property (i.e., matched hypothesis matrix) and should mismatch an artificially constructed dataset that violated this property (i.e., mismatched hypothesis matrix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For these hypotheses matrices, we created two mnemonic similarity matrices, one for the expected mnemonic similarities in the clustered condition and another for the expected mnemonic similarities in the nonclustered condition (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the clustered condition, the degree of separation between participants ranged from 1 (the two participants had a conversation in the network; e.g., P5 and P6 in Fig 1) to 5 (the participants had a degree of separation of 5, i.e., they are five steps away from each other in the network; e.g., P1 and P10 in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nonclustered condition, the degree of separation ranged from 1 to 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture this difference in the range of degrees of separation, we assigned mnemonic distances to the hypotheses matrices as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took the range of the mnemonic similarities standardized scores that we measured in the data, and we split the interval between the minimum and maximum values into either five (clustered condition) or three (nonclustered condition) equally spaced intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the maximum and minimum values inserted into the hypotheses matrices were different for the two conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the clustered condition, we created two hypotheses matrices using the maximum and minimum standardized values observed in the clustered condition data: the matching matrix and the nonmatching matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the matching matrix, we assigned mnemonic similarities corresponding to the network structure in the clustered condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum value was assigned to participants who were connected to one another in the network; the minimum value was assigned to participants who were 5 degrees away from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the nonmatching hypothesis matrix, we assigned mnemonic similarity values according to the nonclustered network topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for the nonclustered condition, we created the matching hypothesis matrix by assigning mnemonic similarities corresponding to the network structure in the nonclustered condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the nonmatching hypotheses matrix, we assigned mnemonic similarities according to the network structure in the clustered condition (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then conducted Mantel correlation analyses between the observed dataone matrix for each of the two conditions containing the data aggregated for all of the networks in that conditionand the hypotheses matricestwo matrices for each of the two conditions, the matching hypothesis matrix and the nonmatching hypothesis matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance values were computed based on 10,000 permutations, which allowed for estimation of the likelihood that random matrix permutations produce higher correlations than the ones observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the clustered condition, the observed data were significantly correlated with the matching hypothesis matrix (r = 0.45, P less_than 0.006), but not with the nonmatching hypothesis matrix (r = 0.25, P  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the nonclustered condition, the observed data were significantly correlated with the matching hypothesis matrix (r = 0.21, P less_than 0.04), but not with the nonmatching hypothesis matrix (r = 0.03, P  0.42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the magnitudes of the matching hypothesis correlations were only small to moderate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the effects were modest for at least two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the variation in one of the variables (i.e., mnemonic similarities hypothesis matrices) was artificially reduced to either three or five levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, if the influences triggered by each conversation in which a participant was involved are conceptualized as forces that shape the participants mnemonic representations, then it becomes plausible that these forces might have opposed one another, thereby reducing their final impact at a network scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This double dissociation, in conjunction with the degree of separation effect shown in Fig 3, provides support for the hypothesis that the conversational network structure impacts the mnemonic alignment among participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study constitutes one of the first cognitively grounded investigations of large-scale social dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that both the conversational network structure and the individual-level sociocognitive phenomena triggered during conversational recall influence the emergence of collective memories in laboratory-created communities of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exploration meaningfully extends existing research by measuring interactional outcomes that are nonobservable to individual social actors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research on information propagation (22), imitation (24), and social influence (25) study large-scale dynamics by focusing on behavior manifested in a social context (e.g., observed, interpreted, and acted on); however, this excludes a large class of situations that involve unobservable cognitive consequences of social interactions, such as mnemonic reinforcement and retrieval-induced forgetting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we fill this gap and provide a framework for investigating the emergent properties of individual cognition at a social level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to acknowledge that even though the manipulation of the network structure was aimed at differentially affecting the clustering of the two types of communities, this manipulation unavoidably resulted in changes in other network parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diameter, betweenness centrality, and average path length are three network features that differed between the two conditions and could have plausibly impacted mnemonic convergence (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using targeted analyses, for instance, we have shown that differences in diameter between the two types of network structures affect the degree of mnemonic convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we caution that the present investigation is only a first step in a programmatic investigation of the independent contribution of these network parameters to the emergence of collective memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With recent advances in psychological approaches to the formation of collective memories, we are now in a position to overcome both the theoretical and methodological limitations that have hindered the field (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow researchers interested in investigating micro-macro processes to ask more nuanced research questions regarding the interaction between individual-level cognitive phenomena and structural features of social formations (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Can sampling procedures be designed to minimize data collection efforts and still reveal a communitys collective memories?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What type of network structures result in maximal mnemonic convergence?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are there sociocultural conditions that accelerate mnemonic convergence (e.g., intergroup conflict) or attenuate this convergence (e.g., organizational mergers)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are just some of the many questions that become empirically tractable with the social-interactionist approach proposed herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, understanding the formation of collective memories is of utmost importance, because they are central to human functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, these shared memories affect peoples attitudes (7), their decisions (8), and how they collectively solve problems (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, systematically investigating these dynamics is of wide social importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Policy makers could use these findings to measure and forge convergent memories in communities affected by biological or social epidemics (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In public health, disease outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika that have the potential to reach pandemic proportions require rapid and widespread dissemination of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Community convergence on information about symptoms, risk factors, and preventive measures could save lives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally important, strategies aimed at facilitating social justice in open societies could benefit from the approach proposed herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings could lead to interventions aimed at diminishing the propagation and maintenance of stereotype-consistent information in communities of individuals (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its large-scale nature, our approach could prove more impactful from a policy perspective than current interventions aimed at an individual level (31, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One hundred and forty students affiliated with Princeton University (61% female; mean age, 20.19 y; range, 1830 y) participated in this experiment for either research credits or compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy participants were assigned, in groups of 10, to the clustered condition, and the remaining 70 participants were assigned to the nonclustered condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subjects gave informed consent for the protocol, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Princeton University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the Qualtrics survey platform, we created a presentation describing a fictional but realistic humanitarian aid program initiated by the American Peace Corps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presentation consisted of an introductory section outlining the program, followed by descriptions of four Peace Corps volunteers, each with a different mission, stationed on a different continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four volunteers were Rachel (environmental protection, South America), Alex (refugee assistance, Europe), Christine (postdisaster recovery, Asia), and Jim (HIV/AIDS prevention, Africa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each volunteer, four of their projects with the program were presented in separate brief paragraphs (Mword-number, 36.75; range, 2352).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A photo illustrated each project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Rachel was involved in protecting endangered species, preventing deforestation, distributing natural fertilizer, and cleaning beaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated each volunteer as a unitary category, and each project undertaken by the volunteer as an exemplar within the category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted two preliminary studies over Mechanical Turk to balance the 16 activities on relevance and memorability across the four categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design_and_Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants signed up for the study through Princeton Universitys online recruitment system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each session was conducted with 10 participants who went through the experimental procedure in a computer laboratory on the universitys campus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the participants within each network were physically present in the same room and carried out the study on the designated computer terminals throughout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the study phase, participants first learned information about the four Peace Corps volunteers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of presentation of these volunteers (categories), as well as that of their missions (items) was random across participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the exemplars were blocked, such that items pertaining to that volunteer were presented on the same screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, in a preconversational recall phase, participants were provided with the name and background information for each of the four volunteers and were instructed to individually remember the initially presented information (preconversation recall).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this phase, participants took part in a sequence of conversations for which they were instructed to jointly remember the initially studied materials (conversational recall).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These computer-mediated chat conversations took place in dyads, such that each participant in a 10-member community engaged in a sequence of three interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversations were characterized by turn-taking, with virtually all conversational recall instances involving collaboration between the interacting partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A qualitative analysis of the conversations revealed that all of the participants stayed on task throughout the duration of the study and engaged in collaboratively remembering the initially studied materials, as instructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We manipulated the network structure of conversational interactions as illustrated in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A software platform was specifically designed for this project to allow for fluent computer-mediated interactions among participants (i.e., Software Platform for Human Interaction Experiments; SoPHIE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We kept the number of participants, the number of conversations in which each participant was engaged, and the sequence of conversations constant across the two conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each conversation lasted for 150 s, which in preliminary studies provided ample time for information to be exchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A final recall test similar to the preconversational recall test was administered following the conversational phase (postconversational recall).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preconversational and postconversational recall phases presented the volunteer name cues in random order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coding of all of the recall protocols was performed by a research assistant who was blinded to the studys hypotheses and involved a binary system in which an item was labeled as either remembered or not remembered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten percent of the data were double-coded for reliability (Cohen  0.89 for all of the recall phases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three- to 5-min distracter tasks, in which participants completed unrelated questionnaires, were inserted between any two phases described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
