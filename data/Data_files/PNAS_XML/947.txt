Vibrational coupling in plasmonic molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we provide evidence of vibrational coupling between the constituent atoms in a plasmonic molecule mediated by coherent substrate phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple coupled harmonic oscillator model provides fundamental insight into the optomechanical selection rules for the launching of vibrational modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling strength-dependent vibrational frequency shifts can be directly manipulated by precise tuning of the structure of the plasmonic molecule by using top-down lithography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tunability paves the way for new strategies to design optomechanical devices based on metallic nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmon hybridization theory, inspired by molecular orbital theory, has been extremely successful in describing the near-field coupling in clusters of plasmonic nanoparticles, also known as plasmonic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the vibrational modes of plasmonic molecules have been virtually unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By designing precisely configured plasmonic molecules of varying complexity and probing them at the individual plasmonic molecule level, intramolecular coupling of acoustic modes, mediated by the underlying substrate, is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of this coupling can be manipulated through the configuration of the plasmonic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, classical continuum elastic theory fails to account for the experimental trends, which are well described by a simple coupled oscillator picture that assumes the vibrational coupling is mediated by coherent phonons with low energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide a route to the systematic optical control of the gigahertz response of metallic nanostructures, opening the door to new optomechanical device strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Transient transmission of a decamer and its components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient transmission of a central disk (A and E), an outer ring (B and F), and a decamer (C and G) excited by 405-nm laser pulses, probed at 810 nm (AC) or 650 nm (EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic modes are isolated by first subtracting the response corresponding to electronphonon and phononphonon coupling and then describing the residuals by damped harmonic oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic frequencies of 10.7 ± 0.8 GHz for the central disk and 21.5 ± 0.8 GHz for the outer ring are obtained, while the frequencies of the decamer are 10.4 ± 0.7 and 24.7 ± 0.4 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black lines in all figures indicate fits to the model described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM images of each structure are shown as Insets in AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM image size is 640 × 550 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D and H) FFT analysis of the experimentally obtained acoustic modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(F) Measured acoustic frequency as a function of the central disk frequency that is independently determined for each size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red curve plots Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 using the value for  obtained from the gap size dependence in C without any further adjustments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe wavelength is 650 nm for all measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All SEM images correspond to a size of 640 × 550 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual and coupled gold nanodisks are fabricated on a glass substrate by using electron-beam lithography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrates are sonicated in acetone for 5 min, rinsed with isopropyl alcohol, cleaned with oxygen plasma for 5 min, and spin-coated with a layer of polymethyl methacrylate resist (PMMA 950 A2; MicroChem) and Espacer 300Z (Showa Denko).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron-beam patterning of the resist is performed by using a FEI QUANTA 650 SEM with a voltage of 30 K and a beam current of 40 pA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resist is then developed in a 1:3 methyl isobutyl ketone:IPA solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titanium adhesion and gold layers are deposited on the substrates by electron-beam evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the deposited metals is monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance and further confirmed by AFM measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures are treated with a standard lift-off process via incubation in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at 65 °C for 2 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dark-Field_Scattering_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scattering spectra of individual nanostructures are measured by using a dark-field spectroscopy setup based on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer m1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White light from a halogen lamp is focused on the sample by a dark-field condenser [Zeiss, numerical aperture (N.A.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.4], and the scattered signals are collected by a 74 × reflective objective (Beck Optronic Solutions; N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.65) and directed into a spectrograph (Princeton Instruments Acton SP2150) toward a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments Pixis 400BR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum is obtained by dividing the collected signal by the white light spectrum after subtracting background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Particle_Transient_Extinction_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A diode-pumped laser (Coherent Verdi) is used to pump a Ti-Sapphire oscillator (KMLab Griffin) to generate a 810-nm beam with a pulse duration of 80 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 405-nm pump beam is generated by frequency-doubling part of the 810-nm fundamental beam in a beta barium borate crystal (Altos BBO-1004H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other part of the 810-nm femtosecond beam is focused into a photonic crystal fiber (Newport SCG-800) to generate a supercontinuum white light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using 25-nm bandpass filters, specific wavelengths are selected as probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe beam passes through an optical delay line (Newport UTS150CC), and the intensity of the pump beam is modulated by an acousto-optic modulator (IntraAction AOM-402AF1) with a frequency of 720 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pump and probe beams are collinearly overlapped by a dichroic mirror before being focused onto the sample by the same objective (Zeiss; N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pump (405 nm) and probe (810 or 650 nm) powers are 150 and 50 W, respectively, unless mentioned specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam polarizations are manipulated with half-wave plates positioned before the dichroic mirror that combines pump and probe beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A parallel configuration of linearly polarized pump and probe beams is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diameter (FWHM) of both pump and probe beams is 400 nm, ensuring that the entire nanostructure is probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this condition is still met for the Fano clusters, the homodimers and heterodimers are all significantly smaller than the focused femtosecond laser pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pump and probe beams are collected by a second objective (Zeiss; N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.6) in a transmission geometry and passed through a 450-nm long-pass filter so that only the probe beam is detected by a photodiode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal is fed into a lock-in amplifier and connected to a counterboard (National Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient extinction images, used to locate individual nanodisks, are obtained with pump and probe beams overlapped temporarily by scanning the sample through the focused laser beams using a piezo scanning stage (Physik Intrumente P-517.3CL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time transients are acquired by moving the optical delay line and repeated at least two times to ensure the reproducibility of each measurement and photostability of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Finite_Element_Method_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D gold nanoclusters, as shown in Fig 1C, are modeled in the commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics by using its frequency response solver for a solid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For numerical simulations, the interaction between the gold nanodisk with the 2-nm Ti adhension layer and the glass substrate is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To truncate the thickness of the thicker glass layer, a perfectly matched layer (PML) on the bottom of the glass substrate is used to absorb propagating acoustic waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensions of the glass layer and the PML are optimized by considering different thicknesses and radii of these layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported results are independent of mesh size to within 0.1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider three different cases: a 178-nm central disk, a ring composed of nine 78-nm nanodisks, and a decamer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deformation field of the central disk, outer ring, and decamer with a gap size of 20 nm is shown in Fig 1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated frequencies do not change as the central disk is inserted into the ring and are also independent of the gap size, as we vary it from 5 to 20, 44, and 88 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BEM_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations of the extinction and scattering spectra of the different gold nanostructures are performed with the BEM by using the MNPBEM toolbox implemented in the Matlab software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gold nanostructures with a Ti adhesion layer on top of a glass substrate are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric function of gold is taken from Johnson and Christy (51), while values for Ti and glass are taken from Palik and Ghosh (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of each nanostructure is adopted from the SEM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
