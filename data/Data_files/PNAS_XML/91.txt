Human-specific derived alleles of CD33 and other genes protect against postreproductive cognitive decline  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most vertebrates die soon after they stop reproducing, but humans are an exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postreproductive humans care for offspring, assist in foraging, and communicate ecological and cultural knowledge, increasing the survival of younger individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of cognitive capacity disrupts these benefits and burdens the group with the care of older members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied how the immunoregulatory receptor CD33 contributes to Alzheimers disease, a human-specific postreproductive condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a protective CD33 allele is derived and unique to humans, despite weak direct selection on older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified several genes with derived alleles that protect against neurodegenerative disease and cerebrovascular insufficiency in old age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection by inclusive fitness may be strong enough to favor alleles that protect against cognitive decline in postreproductive humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The individuals of most vertebrate species die when they can no longer reproduce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans are a rare exception, having evolved a prolonged postreproductive lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elders contribute to cooperative offspring care, assist in foraging, and communicate important ecological and cultural knowledge, increasing the survival of younger individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-related deterioration of cognitive capacity in humans compromises these benefits and also burdens the group with socially costly members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the contribution of the immunoregulatory receptor CD33 to a uniquely human postreproductive disease, Alzheimers dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, even though selection at advanced age is expected to be weak, a CD33 allele protective against Alzheimers disease is derived and unique to humans and favors a functional molecular state of CD33 resembling that of the chimpanzee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, derived alleles may be compensatory and restore interactions altered as a consequence of human-specific brain evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found several other examples of derived alleles at other human loci that protect against age-related cognitive deterioration arising from neurodegenerative disease or cerebrovascular insufficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection by inclusive fitness may be strong enough to favor alleles protecting specifically against cognitive decline in postreproductive humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such selection would operate by maximizing the contributions of postreproductive individuals to the fitness of younger kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Protective_CD33_Allele_Is_Derived_in_Humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our closest evolutionary relatives do not seem to develop the complete pathology of LOAD, we decided to investigate the allelic state of CD33 in human and nonhuman primates (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of a recently sequenced dataset of 79 primate genomes (28) showed that chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla are fixed for rs3865444C, confirming that the protective allele is derived (in this dataset, orangutans lack information for the CD33 region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the 1000 Genomes dataset shows the rs3865444A LOAD-protective allele is found at an overall frequency of 0.21 in the human population, ranging from 0.05 in Africans to 0.48 in Native Americans (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the available genomic data from Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes showed only the ancestral rs3865444C allele (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern for rs12459419 is identical: only modern humans have the protective allele, consistent with the observation that these two SNPs are in complete linkage disequilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the LOAD-protective CD33 allele represents a derived state in humans, having evolved after our common ancestor with other hominids, and possibly after our common ancestor with Neanderthal and Denisovans 550,000765,000 y ago (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD33M_Is_Expressed_at_Higher_Levels_in_Humans_Than_in_Chimpanzees  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied expression of CD33 on human and chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using antibodies specific for the two splice forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimpanzee monocytes show lower cell surface expression of CD33M than human monocytes, independent of the allelic state of rs3865444 (Fig 2A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry analysis of brain microsections using antibodies that recognize both CD33 isoforms detected CD33 on human and chimpanzee microglia, but at different levels (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot data confirmed a fourfold increase in CD33M expression in human brain with rs3865444C/C compared with chimpanzee brain, whereas expression of CD33m was found to be similar in both species (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data show that two CD33 isoforms are expressed both in human cells and in chimpanzee cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whereas overall CD33M expression is high in humans, CD33M is maintained at lower levels in the chimpanzee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it appears that at some point after the common ancestor with chimpanzees, the human lineage up-regulated CD33M expression as the result of an unknown selective pressure or as a byproduct of other adaptive changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased CD33M expression in humans may have been deleterious in terms of LOAD risk, and an alteration in splicing efficiency to lower the amounts of the CD33M isoform followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD33_and_APOE_Underwent_Comparable_Evolutionary_Changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We noted that the evolutionary history of CD33 is similar to that of APOE, in that both genes have derived alleles that protect from a novel liability that is uniquely human (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APOE gene, which encodes for the plasma protein APOE, is polymorphic in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three isoforms (2, 3, and 4) have a distinct affinity for lipoprotein particles (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carriers of the minor 4 allele have higher levels of total cholesterol and accumulate atherosclerotic plaques in their arteries, leading to increased risks for cardiovascular disease, stroke, vascular dementia, and LOAD (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three alleles differ at two key nonsynonymous sites, resulting in amino acid differences at positions 112 and 158.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the APOE of nonhuman mammals (including great apes) and the human 4 allele share the same residues at 112 and 158, studies of transgenic mice indicate that a threonine at position 61 in the APOE of nonhuman primates causes binding preferences that are functionally similar to the derived human 3 allele (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although human 4 is the ancestral allele, it appeared sometime before the common ancestor of modern humans, possibly in relationship to higher lipid consumption associated with increased access to meat or marrow in the genus Homo (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary changes in both CD33 and APOE along the human lineage caused detrimental effects on the cognition of older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of the compensatory changes in the derived alleles is also noteworthy: in both genes, the new alleles seem to restore former interactions (lower levels of immune inhibitory CD33 and a functionally apelike APOE protein sequence in human 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derived protective alleles are found to be polymorphic in all populations, which suggests they do not have direct advantageous effects on the fitness of young individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their direct effects on young individuals could be neutral or deleterious and could be offset by the helpful behaviors of postreproductive individuals that carry a protective allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, these benefits could be directed actively, by kin-directed nepotistic behavior, or probabilistically, by social structures that favor interactions among old and young family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, selection by inclusive fitness may be capable of favoring alleles that protect against cognitive decline in late life, despite weak direct selection on the phenotypes of older individuals themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Many_Other_Genes_Underlying_Cognitive_Decline_Have_Derived_Protective_Alleles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LOAD risk and progression are aggravated by vascular dementia, which is linked to risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes dyslipidemias, and obesity (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is difficult to untangle the pathologies of Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia in older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in Alzheimers disease, vascular pathology such as small vessel disease may have a greater influence on disease course than amyloid itself, especially in older individuals (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations prompted us to extend our search for genes with human-derived alleles with potential protective properties against cognitive decline and vascular dementia in postreproductive humans (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A modest but significant increase in diabetes risk is associated with the more common allele P12, whereas the protective A12 allele is derived (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, CAPN10 encodes a member of the calpain-like cysteine protease family that regulates blood glucose levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derived allele at SNP 44 (rs2975760) protects against type II diabetes mellitus (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, population genetic analyses reveal a significant deficit of variation in the haplotypes surrounding the derived allele, suggesting it is being driven to high frequency by positive selection (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants that control sodium homeostasis show similar patterns: ancestral alleles increase risk of hypertension, whereas the derived alleles are protective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the geographic distribution of the A(-6)G variant in the promoter region of human angiotensinogen (AGT) suggests the G(-6) variant is selectively advantageous outside Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derived allele is present at higher frequency in Asians and Europeans, but the ancestral (sodium-conserving) alleles are more prevalent in Africans (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A regulatory polymorphism in Secretogranin II (SCG2) associates with hypertension in African Americans, with a derived protective allele (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T allele of the transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with impaired insulin secretion and enhanced hepatic glucose production (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive selection has driven derived haplotypes at this locus to near fixation in East Asians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, many genes involved in management of cognitive functions appeared to have evolved protective alleles that remain polymorphic in the human lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Origins_of_Some_Derived_Protective_Alleles_May_Predate_the_Origin_of_Modern_Humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been proposed that derived protective alleles arose and underwent selection primarily after human populations became agrarian, with the changes in selection caused by a sedentary lifestyle and increased consumption of carbohydrate- and lipid-rich diets (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario clearly holds for lactase persistence and may also be true of some of the derived alleles in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surveys of the literature, and our current analyses using several different population-level metrics (FST, Rbp, iHS, Tajimas D, and Fay and Wus H; Dataset S1), indicate that these genes do not consistently show signs of recent selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1000 Genomes data, some do show evidence of population structure and of possible deviations from neutrality; others appear to be evolving neutrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all the protective derived alleles in Table 1 are present in African populations, on the continent where modern humans originated and where contemporary nonagrarian societies persist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If inclusive selection operated on these other derived protective alleles, it may have been most effective near the origin of behaviorally modern humans 100,000 y ago, a depth of time at which clear genomic signatures of selection and selective sweeps are degraded beyond recognition with existing statistical methods (4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions_and_Perspectives  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Survival beyond a fertile age is not a recent phenomenon in human groups, as huntergatherer populations exhibit aging structures in which about a third of the females are postreproductive (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, chimpanzee females rarely live past fertile years, even when accorded full veterinary care in captivity (5, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that the cooperative child-rearing in humans is crucially tied to the survival of grandmothers (5, 54) and also greatly contributed to the shortening of interbirth interval in humans (34 y compared with more than 4 y in chimpanzees) (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike chimpanzees, young humans are unable to feed themselves until long after they reach weaning age and critically depend on the help and support of group members other than their mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cooperative breeding played a key role in human cognitive evolution (57), and selection for grandmothering could have propelled the evolution of postmenopausal longevity, setting the social context for the subsequent evolution of many other features in our lineage (5, 54, 5860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For humans, however, intergenerational information transfer is also an important factor for the survival of individuals, groups, and larger social networks characteristic of foraging societies (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such information transfer could enhance inclusive fitness via resource sharing and reduced mortality of younger individuals (6264).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antagonistic pleiotropy is considered a key mechanism in the evolution of senescence (65), as genes strongly selected for their positive effects early in life via differential survival or reproductive success can have deleterious (pleiotropic) effects later in life, when natural selection is weak or absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derived alleles that protect against cognitive decline during a prolonged postreproductive period could result from kin selection late in life through increased survival of younger kin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such alleles would operate by maintaining the cognitive capacity of grandmothers, as well as of active elderly decision makers and transmitters of valuable cultural information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these features are apparently unique to humans compared with other primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the onset of dementia in otherwise physically fit humans would have a detrimental effect on these functions not only because of the dysfunctional and sometimes disruptive behavior of affected elders but also because of the time and resources eventually needed to care for older individuals whose decision making is compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these data indicate that the existence of a postreproductive lifespan in humans may be supported by selection to maintain cognitive function in older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to search for similar derived alleles in the two mammalian species of toothed whales also known to have prolonged postreproductive lifespans (3, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in at least one instance (Orcinus orca; Orcas, or killer whales), it has been suggested that ecological knowledge and leadership may have led to the evolution of menopause (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postmenopausal female killer whales lead foraging groups, and their leadership is most significant for the survival of the group when food is scarce (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helping by older female orcas results in differential survival of their male offspring, indicating kinship dynamics and inclusive fitness effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolutionary window in which cognition-based selection could operate in humans likely opened with the development of linguistic capabilities and the capacity for cumulative culture and shared intentionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a time depth of  greater than 100 kya, which limits the potential to detect selective sweeps with existing statistical methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, polymorphic protective alleles do exist, and there could be ongoing selection for alleles that protect against cognitive decline in contemporary human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue zones are populations in which extreme human longevity occurs in the absence of modern medicine (68, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting that in these populations, there tends to be no retirement age: older individuals continue to be active, functional members of society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD33_rs3865444_Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and tissues with a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allelic state of rs3865444 was defined by NcoI digestion of a 421-bp fragment amplified from genomic DNA, using primers 5-GCGAACCCCATGTCTAAA-3 and 5-CCTACCTCCCTCTGTGCC-5 (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD33_Expression_on_Blood_Monocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chimpanzee blood samples were collected as extra tubes only during routine noninvasive health screens of chimpanzee subjects at the Yerkes National Primate Center, Emory University, Atlanta [supported by NIH Base Grant ORIP/OD P51OD011132; routine collection covered under local institutional review board (IRB) approval by Emory University].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All collections were made prior to the September 15, 2015 designation of captive chimpanzees as endangered species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimpanzee blood samples were shipped overnight on ice to the University of California, San Diego.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human blood was collected at about the same time into identical tubes from healthy volunteer donors (following informed consent, under the approval from the University of California, San Diego Human Subjects IRB), and stored overnight on ice, to ensure similar treatment conditions prior to analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All health and safety issues related to handling of human and non-human primate samples are covered by an institutional biosafety approval from the University of California, San Diego Environmental Health and Safety Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All individuals who handle the samples receive the required training regarding precautions for blood-borne pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contaminating red blood cells were lysed by incubation in ACK buffer (Gibco, Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained with an APC-conjugated anti-CD33 antibodies clone WM53 (BD Biosciences) and a FITC-conjugated anti-CD33 antibodies clone HIM3.4 (Biolegend), or isotype control antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD33 expression was measured with a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed with FlowJo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frozen or paraffin-embedded samples of human brain were obtained from the National Cancer Institute-funded Co-operative Human Tissue Network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen or paraffin embedded samples from chimpanzee brains were obtained from the Yerkes Primate Research Foundation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidases and endogenous biotin and were overlaid with control mouse IgGs (Abcam), mouse anti-CD68 (AbD Serotec), rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), or rabbit anti-CD33 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by detection using appropriate secondary reagents, color developed using the AEC substrate (Vector Laboratories), followed with Mayers nuclear counterstain, using established protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with antigen retrieval in Decloaking Chamber (Biocare) and overlaid with mouse anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies (clone PWS44; Leica Biosystems Inc.) overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibodies, HRP-conjugated streptavidin, biotinyl tyramide enhancement, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin, followed by AEC substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblot  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frozen brain samples were homogenized in lysis buffer [1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris at pH 8, 150 mM NaCl].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were spun twice at 20,000 × g. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-CD33 (St Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), as well as secondary antibodies (LI-COR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals were acquired with an Odyssey instrument (LI-COR) and analyzed by Image Studio software (LI-COR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unpaired Students t test was used for comparisons involving two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prism 6 Program (GraphPad) was used for most of the statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human genomes were accessed from the 1000 Genomes Project server (www.1000genomes.org/), using tabix to extract regions in variant call format (VCF 4.1) (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neanderthal and Denisovan VCFs were downloaded from their respective servers (Neanderthal, cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/altai/AltaiNeandertal/VCF/; Denisovan, cdna.eva.mpg.de/denisova/VCF/hg19_1000g/) (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primate VCFs were downloaded from the Great Ape Genome Project server (biologiaevolutiva.org/greatape/) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bed coordinates defining the genomic regions surrounding CD33 and other genes were retrieved using the University of California, Santa Cruz, genome browser (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primate VCFs are referenced to hg18, bed coordinates were lifted to hg19 using CrossMap (crossmap.sourceforge.net/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New coordinates were checked against hg19 and corrected by hand when necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants in each region of each species were extracted with vcftools (73), and variants of each CD33 SNP were called directly from each file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Polymorphism_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bed coordinates of the loci in Table 1 were retrieved from build hg19, using the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Browser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A region containing each gene, plus 100 kb upstream and 100 kb downstream, was retrieved in VCF format from the 1000 Genomes Project database, using tabix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patterns of polymorphism at each gene and its surrounding region were analyzed for each population and each region (as defined by the 1000 Genomes Project), using the selectionTools pipeline and custom Perl scripts (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several statistical tests were evaluated: frequency-based methods (Tajimas D, Fay and Wus H); linkage disequilibrium-based methods (Rsb, iHs); and population differentiation-based methods (FST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each is suited to detecting selection at different timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequency-based and population differentiation-based methods are better suited to detecting events farther in the past than linkage disequilibrium-based methods (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outputs from selectionTools were formatted with custom Perl scripts and visualized in R as heatmaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots were examined for evidence of deviation from the null expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of each test statistic from the 200 kb surrounding the gene of interest were used to generate histograms that describe the empirical null expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Test statistic values from within each gene itself were compared with this expectation to look for statistical outliers whose positions lie within in the gene of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
