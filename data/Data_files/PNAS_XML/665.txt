Entropy redistribution controls allostery in a metalloregulatory protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The immune system limits nutrient availability and releases highly reactive toxic molecules to control bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful pathogens resist these host effects by using regulatory proteins that sense diverse environmental stressors and alter the transcription of genes required to mount an adaptive response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate here that these regulatory proteins are capable of sensing a specific stressor in a process that relies nearly exclusively on a redistribution of atomic motions to regulate gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work provides insights into how nature exploits a simple molecular scaffold that relies on changes in atomic motions to evolve new adaptive responses to a wide range of environmental stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Allosteric communication between two ligand-binding sites in a protein is a central aspect of biological regulation that remains mechanistically unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that perturbations in equilibrium picosecondnanosecond motions impact zinc (Zn)-induced allosteric inhibition of DNA binding by the Zn efflux repressor CzrA (chromosomal zinc-regulated repressor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA binding leads to an unanticipated increase in methyl side-chain flexibility and thus stabilizes the complex entropically; Zn binding redistributes these motions, inhibiting formation of the DNA complex by restricting coupled fast motions and concerted slower motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allosterically impaired CzrA mutants are characterized by distinct nonnative fast internal dynamics fingerprints upon Zn binding, and DNA binding is weakly regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the predictive power of the wild-type dynamics fingerprint to identify key residues in dynamics-driven allostery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that driving forces arising from dynamics can be harnessed by nature to evolve new allosteric ligand specificities in a compact molecular scaffold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Allosteric regulation in CzrA based on a conformational entropy mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermodynamic linkage scheme, structures, and schematic free energy diagrams for CzrA heterotropic allostery based on the findings presented in this report and in previous studies (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy diagrams show the population of the two different conformations (open, incompatible with DNA binding; closed, compatible with DNA binding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures represented by each state are: P2 (PDB ID code 1R1U), P2Zn2 (PDB ID code 2M30), DNAP2 (PDB ID code 2KJB), DNA(P2Zn2) (structure not yet solved; modeled here with DNA and P2Zn2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression used in this work for the overall coupling free energy (Gc) is depicted in the center of the thermodynamic box (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure summary of CzrA in various allosteric states and the coupled equilibrium model used in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Ribbon representation of Zn-bound CzrA with secondary structural segments indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homodimeric CzrA is a single domain, compact structure whose DNA-binding activity is allosterically modulated by tuning side-chain dynamics, with Leu34 and Met90 shown as examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B, Top) Global superposition of the DNAP2 (orange, 2KJB) CzrA docked on a DNA operator with the CzrO sequence and apo P2 (green, 1R1U).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Bottom) Structural comparison of the Zn2P2 state (slate, 2M30) to the apoP2 reference state (green, 1R1U).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For clarity, Zn is represented by a yellow sphere with van der Waals radius of 2 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) ArsR family members adopt an (0)- 1-2-3-4-1-2-5 secondary structure (the 0 helix is only found in a subset of ArsR repressors, e.g., CadC) which is flanked by N (designated N) and C (C)-terminal tails.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where available, DNA-bound structures are shown in orange, the low DNA affinity conformation is represented in blue, and the presumed high DNA affinity conformation is shown in green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cartoon models shown above each structure schematizes the location(s) of the sensing site within the homodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The label designation identifies the secondary structure element(s) (2, 3, 5, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), N-terminal tail (N) or C-terminal tail (C) that provide residues to the sensing site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of CadC and SmtB, the metal-binding site that does not allosterically impact DNA binding is displayed as open circles and secondary structure element are shown in parentheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed boxes represent the nature of the stimuli sensed: metal (yellow) and oxidative stress (orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDB ID codes and inducer sensed are as follows: CzrA (Zn, Co) 1R1U 2M30 2KJB; SmtB (Zn, Cd) 1R1T 1R23; CadC (Zn, Cd, Pb) 1U2W 3F72; NmtR (Ni, Co) 2LKP; CmtR (Pb/Cd) 2JSC; QsrR (RES) 4HQM 4HQE; YodB (RES) 5HS9 5HS7 5HS8; HypR (HOCl) 4A5M 4A5N; HlyU (ROS) 4K2E 4OOI 3JTH; BigR (RSS) 3PQJ 2PQK;NolR 4OMY 4OMZ 4ON0; PagR 2ZKZ 3GW2; YgaV 3CUO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Slow_Timescale_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A model of conformational selection compatible with previous data would predict that Zn locks CzrA into a conformation with low DNA affinity (24) by quenching a global exchange process identified in a clustering analysis of 0.12-µs molecular dynamics trajectories (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no direct experimental evidence supports this model, because NMR 1H15N dynamics measurements of CzrA showed little evidence for conformational exchange along the backbone (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Backbone motion on such a small scaffold (24 kDa homodimer) may not be a good reporter of relatively subtle exchange between closed and open conformations, so we turned to 13C relaxation dispersion experiments (31) to study protein side-chain dynamics using 1H-13C methyl groups as probes (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At multiple temperatures and field strengths, we find several residues that exhibit chemical exchange for the apo state on the timescale of the pulse frequencies used (501,000 Hz, providing access to processes in the 0.55-ms range; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These small effects are expected for exchange between two similar folded structures such as the open and closed states (Fig 1B; 25 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there is a good correspondence between the residues that show large exchange broadening and the residues that show a difference in chemical shift in the closed conformation, as determined by spectral differences between the apo- and DNA-bound states outside of the DNA-binding site (Fig S3 C and D; 1.5 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this chemical exchange broadening is abrogated by coordination of the allosteric inhibitor Zn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, Zn quenches motions in apoCzrA that are associated with sampling an excited-state conformation that is likely structurally compatible with DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this conformational selection may indeed impact CzrA allostery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fast_Timescale_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural plasticity on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale is typically associated with weakly populated excited states (32), but is also known to be associated with changes in fast internal dynamics in the ground state where the population of different side-chain rotameric states is affected (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Zn-induced quenching of these slow motions in apoCzrA suggests that dynamical changes also impact shorter timescale motions of the methyl groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would affect the entropic driving force and is distinct from enthalpic contributions derived from structural compatibility with DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the role of these shorter timescale dynamics on allostery, we measured the axial order parameter, S2axis, for all 58 methyl groups, first comparing the apo- and Zn-bound states of CzrA (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2axis values range from 0 to 1, which is indicative of unrestricted and highly restricted motion of the methyl group, respectively, on the picosecondnanosecond timescale and thus are considered a proxy for conformational entropy (Sconf) (35) (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the majority of methyl groups in CzrA are insensitive to Zn binding; however, there are several that clearly change motional regimes (5), S2axis  0.2 (Fig 3A and Fig S5) summing to a small net decrease in flexibility (stiffening; TSconf) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the S2axis fingerprint (Fig S5D) obtained by subtracting S2axis in the apo state from that of the Zn-bound state reveals that some methyl groups stiffen on Zn coordination, including L34 2 and V69 1, and others become more flexible on this timescale, notably V66 1 and L68 1 (Fig 3A and Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we find strongly dynamically perturbed methyl groups distant from both ligand-binding sites (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Zn binding significantly impacts the side-chain dynamics of CzrA, the methyls of the DNA-binding helices (4) are unperturbed (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether side-chain dynamics influence DNA binding, we measured the fast timescale response of apoCzrA to the binding of the DNA operator, CzrO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S2axis fingerprint from DNA binding contrasts sharply with that of Zn binding, with most methyls becoming more flexible in the DNA-bound state (Fig 3B and Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased flexibility is distributed throughout the core of the dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the formation of specific contacts with the DNA might be expected to restrict side-chain flexibility (7), the latter result is surprising but not unprecedented for proteinDNA complexes (36, 37), and is consistent with prior molecular dynamics simulations (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the overall increase in internal mobility suggests that the negative linkage of Zn and DNA binding might be explained on the basis of fast internal motions, because these occupy opposite corners of the coupled equilibrium scheme (Fig 1) that show contrasting side-chain dynamical behavior (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the effect of the increased flexibility on the stabilization of the DNAP2 complex, we determined the entropic contributions to binding (Fig S5F; Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in side-chain rotameric degrees of freedom upon DNA binding is comparable to the favorable entropic contribution of counterion release (38) and compensates for the cost of burying two polar interfaces (Fig S5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this increase in protein internal flexibility is a major component of the net entropic driving force measured by calorimetry (TSconf = 5.5 kcal mol1 vs. TS = 7.8 ± 0.4 kcal mol1) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the dynamical impact of Zn binding (Fig 2A) could impair binding to DNA by blocking access to an internally flexible conformation (Fig 2B), thus eliminating this favorable entropy term (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temperature_Dependence_of_the_Fast_Timescale_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate how Zn prevents the CzrA homodimer from increasing internal flexibility and exploring an active excited state (Fig 3B), we further probed the origin of these dynamical changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in flexibility likely derives from the release of restrictions imposed on rotamer populations by neighboring residues, associated with conditional motion (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such motions have also been described as dynamical networks and are more frequently interrogated by molecular dynamics simulations from crystal structures (17, 4144), combined, in some cases, with NMR fast timescale dynamics analysis (17, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations of this system have suggested that Zn binding decreases the extent of residue-specific correlation and may therefore disrupt the network of correlated and anticorrelated motions associated with DNA binding and quench a global exchange process (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the interplay between fast internal dynamics (picosecond to nanosecond) and slow sampling of different conformations (microsecond to millisecond) could be associated with changes in conditional motion induced by Zn, and thus may be a primary driver of allostery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To experimentally assess the presence of a network of conditional side-chain mobility in CzrA, we measured the temperature dependence of S2axis (; Fig 3C), because an inverse temperature dependence can be indicative of conditional motion, attributed to excluded volume effects (39) and possibly other correlated motional processes (39, 47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the residues in the apo- and Zn2-bound CzrA homodimers are well described by a harmonic or mildly anharmonic potential (0 less_than  less_than 3; Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are several methyls that are clearly outside that range and not previously observed in model systems (49), suggesting this feature may specifically impact the biological function of CzrA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, many methyl groups within the dimer core of apoCzrA have an inverse dependence of S2axis on temperature ( less_than 0; Fig 3C), suggesting a high degree of coupled motion in this unliganded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, most methyl groups in the dimer core of the allosterically inhibited Zn state exhibit strong anharmonic behavior, compatible with a steep angular potential (  greater than  3; Fig 3C) (49), rather than conditional motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we propose that the Zn-imposed redistribution of fast timescale dynamics quenches an apo-state network of conditional motions responsible for the favorable conformational entropy term associated with DNA binding, thereby inhibiting Zn-bound CzrA from binding DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Allosterically_Impaired_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These observations establish a role of side-chain dynamics in heterotropic allosteric coupling and suggest a model where the allosteric ligand impacts a network of coupled motions implicated in the entropic and enthalpic driving forces of protein function, i.e., DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes the prediction that allostery can be impaired by simply perturbing residues that contribute to this Zn-induced site-specific entropy redistribution (S2axis), because these residues would define those required for heterotropic coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this, we measured the conformational dynamics of the Zn and apo states of previously described allosterically impaired cavity mutants that harbor substitutions of V66 and/or L68 with smaller methyl-containing side-chains, e.g., V66A, V66A/L68V (AV), and V66A/L68A (AA) mutants (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all allosteric mutants structurally switch upon Zn coordination, as measured by nearly identical chemical shift perturbation maps (Fig S7), the dynamical changes in the methyl groups (S2axis) in mutants CzrA are dramatically different from wild-type CzrA as well as from in each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the AV mutant is nearly dynamically silent, although the Zn-bound structures of the AV and wild-type CzrA homodimers are globally identical (25) (Fig 4A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Zn-bound states of these mutants retain a residual network of conditional motion observed in wild-type CzrA in the apo state only (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with their ability to bind DNA tightly in the Zn state as shown previously for the AV mutant (25) and in this work for the AA mutant (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zn quenches microsecond-to-millisecond conformational exchange in each of the mutants, as in the wild-type protein, yet unlike wild-type CzrA, the Zn-bound mutants retain the ability to bind to DNA in vitro, and are anticipated to fail to derepress transcription in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation reveals that changes in this larger amplitude, slower timescale motions alone are insufficient to modulate DNA-binding affinity (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, allosteric crippling originates only from nonnative fast internal dynamical changes upon Zn binding that fails to eliminate the strong entropic driving force for DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, a comprehensive analysis of 11 different cavity mutants (Fig 5A, Fig S8, and Table S1) shows that the impact on the allosteric coupling free energy, Gc, and proxy for biological regulation (Fig 5A) can be predicted solely on the basis of their S2axis values upon Zn binding to the wild-type CzrA (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uniquely strong impact of dynamically sensitive residues on CzrA function (Fig 5B), with |S2axis|  greater than  0.1, allows us to classify these residues as allosteric hot spots (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, L34A and L34V mutants are functionally compromised to an extent comparable to severely affected AA and AV (25) mutants, despite being far (20 Å) from both the Zn- and DNA-binding sites, on the extreme periphery of the dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, all cavity substitutions of dynamically sensitive and partially solvent-exposed methyl-containing residues tested here are significantly allosterically impaired; whereas, those substitutions of buried residues have a correspondingly weaker impact on the heterotropic coupling free energy, e.g., V87A CzrA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the sign on S2axis is immaterial to this effect, because cavity substitutions of residues that show significant site-specific stiffening or flexibility upon Zn binding to CzrA both strongly perturb Gc (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4A and 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we elucidate how the allosteric effector Zn tunes the site-specific internal dynamics in CzrA to affect a cellular response to host-imposed zinc toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate further the predictive power of this dynamically driven model of allostery, and show that uncoupling of Zn and DNA binding in allosterically impaired mutants occurs as a result of a nonnative redistribution of conformational entropy that is strongly linked to allosteric inhibition of DNA binding (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that distinct sites in a protein can communicate with one another exclusively through differences in the relative populations of rotameric states of the side-chains, without the need to invoke a defined molecular pathway or significant structural rearrangements (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that changes in fast internal dynamics compromise a network of coupled motions that likely plays a central role in the entropic and enthalpic contributions to DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the idea that fast internal dynamical fluctuations in proteins can contribute to allosteric signal transduction has been discussed previously (68, 10), there are only a few prior reports that experimentally test these ideas in folded proteins, and those studies focused largely on two systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first system is a multidomain transcriptional activator (catabolite activator protein [CAP]) where the allosteric ligand cAMP quenches both slow- and fast-timescale dynamics and activates DNA binding through a mechanism where conformational selection plays a major role (6), superimposed on changes in conformational entropy (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second system consists of an isolated PDZ (PSD-95/SAP90 PDZ3) domain where ligand binding promotes an entropy change, and dynamical pathways of signal transmission have been identified (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these studies highlight the limitations of deducing allosteric mechanisms from static structures alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of conformational entropy in these systems arises from ligand-induced quenching of fast timescale motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work confirms and significantly extends predictions from early ensemble-based models (51), to show that a redistribution of fast internal dynamics, rather than simple quenching, can also contribute to heterotropic allostery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this redistribution also perturbs slow motions (Fig 2), our results reveal that fast-coupled motions (Fig 3) directly contribute to an allosteric response without invoking a defined molecular pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A more recent computational study of CAP hints at the possibility of a network of coupled motions as responsible for entropic contributions to allostery of ligand binding (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors used elastic network models to demonstrate that collective modes rationalize homotropic negative cooperativity of cAMP binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, perturbations of fast internal dynamics in response to ligand binding are known to involve groups that are not in direct contact with another (5, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the contribution of protein conformational entropy to biological function (19) may impact global networks of coupled motions over longer timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we show here that a Zn-dependent delocalized redistribution of fast internal dynamics in wild-type CzrA not only perturbs the entropic contribution to DNA binding (Fig 3), but also alters access to an excited-state conformation on the millisecond timescale (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nature continuously evolves the ability to exploit ligand binding to affect new functional outputs that ultimately regulate cellular activity (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within traditional models of allostery, where molecular pathways are involved, it is challenging to understand how structurally distinct sensing sites can drive the same biological outcome, i.e., transcriptional derepression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of a sensor for a new ligand, for example, not only requires development of a specific sensing (ligand binding) site, but also simultaneous evolution of additional structural connections to this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensemble models of allostery provide a solution to this problem (1, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the ArsR superfamily (25), CzrA senses Zn in the 5 ligand-binding site, CadC and CmtR sense Cd and Pb in the 4 and 3 sites, respectively, while sensing of reactive oxygen, sulfur (53) and electrophilic species (54) occurs in the 2 and 1 sites (Fig 5C and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sensing sites are dispersed throughout the molecular scaffold, but each must be connected in some way to the R DNA-binding helices to drive allosteric inhibition of DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a single pathway model cannot be operative in the ArsR superfamily, in contrast to a system in which specific ligand-binding sites have evolved via remodeling of a single structural site, as in the mercuric repressor (MerR) (11, 55) and copper-sensitive operon repressor (CsoR) (56, 57) families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the sensing sites in the ArsR family correspond closely to the hot spots we have identified in CzrA that strongly impact fast internal dynamics (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the common feature among these diverse sensors is a network of coupled motions required to modulate DNA operator occupancy (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a new sensing site could then arise simply by exploiting these delocalized dynamical connections (29, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model of allostery (51) where coupled fast internal motions modulate the driving forces for transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in turn may be harnessed to rapidly evolve new sensor specificities without the need to build a new molecular wire when a new biological output is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

NMR experiments were performed on Varian 800- and 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with Agilent 5 mm PFG 1H{13C,15N} triple resonance salt tolerant cold probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were run in standard NMR buffer: 10 mM Mes, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 in 10% D2O or 100% D2O depending on the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentrations (monomer) for chemical shift assignments were typically 250500 M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All backbone assignments of V66A, V66A/L68V, and V66A/L68A in apo and Zn(II) states were carried out using standard triple resonance experiments on uniformly 1H,13C,15N-labeled mutants as described previously for wild-type CzrA at 40 °C (60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Side-chain methyl chemical shifts of Met residues were confirmed using 13C-edited nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stereospecific methyl assignments of leucine and valine residues were obtained using 1H,13C HSQC spectra of 10% 13C-labeled samples (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All methyl assignments used for dynamics studies were transferred from 40 to 25 °C by following the temperature dependence of the 1H,13C HSQC spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ILVMA CzrA samples for dynamics studies were specifically labeled at the methyl groups (13C1H3) of Ile 1, Leu 1/2, Val 1/2, Ala , and Met  in an otherwise deuterated (2H) and 12C background (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1H,13C HSQC spectra obtained for these samples exhibit excellent chemical shift dispersion and are exquisitely sensitive to ligand (Zn or DNA) binding as shown previously, thus providing 58 independent stereospecific reporters (38 total residues) of side-chain dynamics evenly dispersed throughout the structure (Fig S2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined chemical shift perturbations (CSP) of methyl groups upon Zn(II) binding were calculated using 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the methyl groups using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1=(H)2+0.3(C)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]Relaxation dispersion measurements were acquired using a 1H-13C HMQC-based CPMG pulse sequence (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For wild-type CzrA, experiments were performed at 25 and 40 °C at 600 MHz and at 25 °C at 800 MHz using delay times, T, of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 34, and 40 ms. Representative relaxation dispersion curves are shown (Fig 2) along with the curve obtained by fitting the data to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2R2eff=R2+Rex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12vCPMGtanh(12.vCPMG)][S2]at all of the available frequencies using Origin with allowed to float in the range of 0.55 ms and CPMGfit (www.palmer.hs.columbia.edu/software/cpmgfit.html) (69) for wild-type CzrA and the mutants (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fast_Timescale_Motion_(Picosecond_to_Nanosecond)_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The magnitude of the axial order parameter, S2axis, describes the amplitude of methyl group rotameric motion, and varies from 0 to 1, where S2axis = 0 describes large amplitude, generally unrestricted interconversion between different rotameric states on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale and S2axis = 1 describes highly restricted motion within a single rotameric state (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2axis of the Ile 1, Leu 1/2, Val 1/2, Ala , and Met  methyl groups in apo and Zn(II)2 states were determined using 1H spin-based relaxation experiments at 600 MHz at 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, and 40.0 °C (34) essentially as described in our previous work for methionine (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2axis values, cross-correlated relaxation rates, , between pairs of 1H1H vectors in 13CH3 methyl groups were measured using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3=R2,HFR2,HS2910(o4)2[P2(cosaxis,HH)]2Saxis2H42crHH6,[S3]where c is the tumbling time of the protein; RF2,H and RS2,H are the fast and slow relaxing magnetization, respectively; H is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton; and rHH is the distance between pairs of methyl protons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain an approximation of the differences in fast and slow relaxation rates (2), we measured the time dependence of the cross-peak intensities in a correlated pair of single and double quantum (2Q) experiments (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the signal intensity (Ia), in the spin-forbidden experiment that creates 2Q coherences during a variable relaxation delay (T), depends on spin dynamics in the I = 3/2 manifold of the methyl 1H spin system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal intensity (Ib), in the spin-allowed experiment, where the pulse that builds up the 2Q coherence is absent, is determined by spin dynamics in the I = 3/2 and I = 1/2 manifolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using various T values (3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 22, and 27 ms, recorded in an interleaved manner), the rates of  were obtained by fitting ratios of peak intensities measured in pairs of experiments (Ia and Ib) with Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4IaIb=0.5tanh(2+2T)2+2-tanh(2+2T),[S4]where T is the variable delay time,  is a parameter that is related to the 1H spin density around the methyl group, and Ia and Ib are the time dependencies of differences and sums, respectively, of magnetization derived from methyl 1H single-quantum transitions, as described (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peak heights and spectral noise were measured in Sparky (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A python script was used to fit the peak height ratios to  values and to determine S2axis values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errors in S2axis were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation where a Gaussian-distributed random number generator was used to generate simulated datasets by generating random values for the ratios at each delay value according to a distribution dictated by the error propagated from spectral noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new datasets were then each individually fit to obtain a distribution of S2axis values (34, 73) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although this approach suffers from difficulties associated with using 1H relaxation as a dynamics probe (compared with the more traditional 2H- and 13C-derived measures), it has been validated for proteins using a number of different techniques that exploit different spin probes and a number of proteins (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the sensitivity of this experiment is particularly well-suited for proteins of the size of the CzrA homodimer (P2 = 24 kDa), especially in complex with DNA (17-kDa duplex, TAACATATGAACATATGTTCATATGTTA) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For apo, Zn(II), and DNACzrA states, c was obtained from T1, T2, and heteronuclear NOE obtained at 40 °C and 10% D2O (24) and adjusted for changes in solvent and temperature (nickanthis.com/tools/tau).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Backbone amide relaxation experiments (15N R1 and R2) were performed at 800 MHz under the same conditions (10 mM Mes, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 in 10% D2O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relaxation delays used for the DNACzrA complex were 0.01, 0.05, 0.11, 0.19, 0.31, 0.65, 1, 1.5, 1.9, 2.3, 2.7, and 3.2 s for R1 and 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11, 0.13, 0.15, 0.19, and 0.25 s for R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the values obtained for c obtained from Monte Carlo simulations with tensor2 software using the previously reported structures are shown in Fig S9 (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues 215, 22, 44, 6984, and 94106 were not included in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the fact that an isotropic model successfully fits the data (the model was accepted with a pvalue  greater than  0.05), possible effects of anisotropic rotational diffusion were evaluated using a fully anisotropic model and the diffusion tensors obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant improvement was obtained and the ratio of the tensors obtained using both models is close to one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the predicted ratio of coefficients for diffusion about the long and short axes is sufficiently close to 1 for the tumbling to be considered isotropic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uniform decrease in order parameters as a result of DNA binding could also be due to an inaccurate determination of the global tumbling correlation time (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an inaccurate c would also lead to a uniform offset in backbone order parameters, which was not observed previously (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the measured c of the CzrADNA complex was validated using the alanine methyls that are expected to be centered at S2axis = 0.85 because these methyl groups are generally motionally restricted in proteins (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c is slightly larger than expected for a complex of this size, which could be due to a higher viscosity of the sample, which will affect c but not individual values of S2axis (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the apo and Zn wild-type CzrA, the methyl-specific lambda () values were obtained for each state from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5A (39)state,i=dln(1Sstate,i)dln(T/K)[S5A]by fitting the T dependence of the order parameter for T = 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, and 40.0 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 25.0 and 40.0 °C were collected in duplicate to ensure that irreversible changes in the sample were not being misinterpreted as a temperature dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temperature dependence of the site-specific methyl S2axis values for P2Zn2 of AA CzrA and AV CzrA was studied measuring the order parameter at 25.0 and 40.0 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the site specific lambda values were obtained from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5Bstate,i313298ln(1Sstate,i)ln(313)ln(298).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5B]The apo forms of these allosterically impaired mutants were not measured at 40.0 °C because of protein precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The site-specific effect of cavity mutations (76)[mut(S2axis)] (Fig 5B) was obtained from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6mutSaxis,i2=Saxis,i2¯(WT,P2ZnP2)Saxis,i2¯(mut,P2ZnP2),[S6]where I refers to the residue that was replaced in the mutation, mut refers to the CzrA mutant, and Saxis,i2¯ refers to the mean value for both methyls in double labeled residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site-specific order parameter change from the mutants was obtained from the dynamic signature (Fig S4) or estimated from WT average for a particular amino acid type, e.g., alanines change on average 0.02 upon Zn binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solvent inaccessible residues in apo CzrA (Fig 5B) were obtained from the crystal structure (PDB ID code 1R1U) using the web server for quantitative evaluation of protein structure VADAR 1.8 (vadar.wishartlab.com/) (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isothermal_Titration_Calorimetry_(ITC)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ITC experiments were carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter using 4.0 mM Zn(II) as titrant in the syringe and solution conditions of 50 mM Hepes, 5.0 mM NTA as a Zn(II) competitor, 0.40 M NaCl (pH 7.0, 25.0 °C), and 220 M CzrA dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The raw ITC data were integrated, concentration normalized, and plotted as heat versus metal:protein ratio using Origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were fit using the sequential two-site model included in the data analysis software provided by MicroCal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NTA-independent binding constants were determined by using methods described previously (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SD of the mean values from triplicate experiments is given for all thermodynamic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computation_of_Conformational_Entropy_and_Other_Entropic_Contributions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The change in conformational entropy difference between two states (SCONF; referred also as SNelecCONF in Fig S9) was obtained using empirical model-free (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7) (35) expression:TSCONF,abEmpirical=T(0.0018kcalmol1K1)Nprot[Sb2Sa2],[S7]where Nprot the total number of side-chain torsion angles in the protein methyl containing side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy assumes that methyl-terminated residues are representative of the overall protein dynamics, and the validity of this assumption has been extensively discussed (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This methodology has evolved from the oscillator inventory (5) to the entropy-meter (35, 78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major uncertainty with the approach of using measured NMR methyl order parameter to quantitatively calculate the global changes in conformational entropy is the small percentage of the atoms measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the fact that the validity of these approximation is still under discussion, this is up to date the most robust and experimentally validated approach to obtain thermodynamic parameters from experimentally determined site specific dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another strategy that is commonly used in the literature (7) is based on the direct connection between dynamics and entropy that can be accessed by NMR relaxation in a model-dependent way (16, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite considering this approach more limited than the former, for comparison and consistency a value of conformational entropy was independently obtained using model-dependent (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8) (16) expressionTSCONF,abModel=TkBln{3(1+8Sb,i)1/23(1+8Sa,i)1/2}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]The solvation entropy (SSOLV; referred as SSOLVNelec in Fig S4 F and G) was estimated from the polar (PASA) and apolar (AASA) accessible surface area calculated using visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software from crystal structures when available or from models derived from NMR data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation was done with an approach previously reported (78, 80, 81) (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9)SSOLV,ab={0.26JK.mol.ln(T335)abPASA+0.45JK.mol.ln(T385)abAASA}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]The PASA and AASA were determined from O, N, S, P, and C, respectively, using a probe radius of 1.4 Å and default values for atomic radii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electrostatic entropy (Selec; Fig S4F) contribution accounts for the ion exchange processes that occur between the macromolecules and the solution upon binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For DNA binding, 7 Na+ ions are released from the DNA solvation shell (25), a typical counterion release corresponding to an average of 7.5 kcal mol1 (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both electrostatic contributions are not expected to be sensitive to changes in the protein amino acid sequence (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonelectrostatic entropy contribution (SNelec; Fig S4F) was obtained as a difference between the total entropy (S) and electrostatic component (Selec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This term is expected to be comparable to the addition of the conformational entropy (SCONF) and the solvation entropy (SSOLV), with the assumption that other terms are negligible (35), such as changes in the dynamics of DNA base pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The allosteric mutations, V66A, V66A/L68V (AV), and V66A/L68A (AA) also influence the underlying energetics of Zn binding, as expected from strong perturbations in S2axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the sign and magnitude of global (TS) vs. (TSconf) differ for each of the three mutants of Zn binding (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that these mutations not only induce a nonnative redistribution of conformational entropy upon Zn binding, but also affect other entropy terms in a distinct way, such as the entropy of the solvent (Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations contrast with previously described cases, in particular E. coli CAP (7), and may derive from the compact nature of CzrA, relative to other systems studied in this way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence_Anisotropy-Based_DNA-Binding_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescein-labeled 28-bp DNA duplexes harboring a single 12212 DNA operator (24) were obtained by annealing and used to measure the change in fluorescence anisotropy upon CzrA addition to the DNA solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were carried out on a PC1 spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength of 495 nm, 1 mm slit; with the emission collected through a 515-nm filter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duplex DNA concentration in all cases was 10.0 nM in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Zn2P2-binding curve measurement, the DNA buffer contained 0.23 M NaCl and 3 M ZnCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the P2apo-binding curve measurements, the DNA buffer contained 0.4 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0) contained the same NaCl as the DNA buffer and the Zn content was below 5% of the protein concentration (between 1 and 100 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solutions were filtered and the protein concentration was measured before starting the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots of protein were added using a programmable syringe pump (KD Scientific) with the temperature maintained at 25 (±0.1) °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average of approximately 10 iterations of anisotropy measurements of 30 s each was obtained after signal stabilization for each addition of protein, with a corresponding SD that was 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA-binding isotherms were fit to a single-binding site model (one dimer to DNA) coupled to a monomerdimer equilibrium (Kdimer = 1.7 × 105 M1 and 4.5 × 105 M1 for P2apo and Zn2P2, respectively) (22) using Dynafit (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA-binding affinities were measured for L13V, L34V, L34A, L49V, and V69A CzrAs in the absence and presence of Zn (Fig S8) to extract Gc (Fig 5A, main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA-binding affinities of the apoL13V, L34V, L34A, and V69A CzrAs DNA are within a factor of 10 of the wild-type affinity, revealing all are active repressors (Fig 5A and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metal-Binding_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All metal-binding experiments were carried out by using a PC1 spectrofluorometer as previously described (25, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, mag-fura-2 Zn(II)-binding competition assays were carried out in 10 mM Hepes, 0.23 mM NaCl (pH 7.0), 3 M protein, and 2 M mag-fura-2 and analyzed using a stepwise binding model of two Zn per CzrA dimer using Dynafit (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CoCl2 titrations of 100 M CzrA monomer (50 M dimer) were carried by using a Hewlett-Packard model 8452A spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co(II) and mag-fura-2 titrations were obtained for L13V, L34V, L34A, L49V, and V69A CzrAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mutants bind Zn tightly and adopt native metal coordination structures as evidenced by their similar d-d ligand field absorption envelopes (Fig S8 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, mag-fura-2 shows no Zn(II) binding competition with apo CzrA, and therefore only a lower limit on the zinc-binding affinity (K1, K2; Table S1) is reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
