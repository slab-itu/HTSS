Decreasing maternal myostatin programs adult offspring bone strength in a mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is an incurable genetic disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that maternal deficiency of myostatin (a negative regulator of muscle growth) can enhance bone biomechanical strength and integrity in control and osteogenesis imperfecta mouse offspring, using three independent approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that bone is responsive to developmental programming and that myostatin can mediate these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryo transfer experiments show that the effects of maternal myostatin deficiency are conferred by the postimplantation environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies represent a paradigm shift in understanding and treating osteogenesis imperfectaa shift from believing only genetic and postnatal environmental factors control bone health to the inclusion of prenatal/perinatal developmental programming as a modifiable factor controlling adult bone health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During fetal development, the uterine environment can have effects on offspring bone architecture and integrity that persist into adulthood; however, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental myostatin deficiency (Mstntm1Sjl/+) increases muscle mass in wild-type offspring, suggesting an intrauterine programming effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we hypothesized that Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams would also confer increased bone strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type offspring, maternal myostatin deficiency altered fetal growth and calvarial collagen content of newborn mice and conferred a lasting impact on bone geometry and biomechanical integrity of offspring at 4 mo of age, the age of peak bone mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we sought to apply maternal myostatin deficiency to a mouse model with osteogenesis imperfecta (Col1a2oim), a heritable connective tissue disorder caused by abnormalities in the structure and/or synthesis of type I collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femora of male Col1a2oim/+ offspring from natural mating of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams to Col1a2oim/+sires had a 15% increase in torsional ultimate strength, a 29% increase in tensile strength, and a 24% increase in energy to failure compared with age, sex, and genotype-matched offspring from natural mating of Col1a2oim/+ dams to Col1a2oim/+ sires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, increased bone biomechanical strength of Col1a2oim/+ offspring that had been transferred into Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams as blastocysts demonstrated that the effects of maternal myostatin deficiency were conferred by the postimplantation environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, targeting the gestational environment, and specifically prenatal myostatin pathways, provides a potential therapeutic window and an approach for treating osteogenesis imperfecta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approach_1__Effect_of_Parental_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_Bone_Geometry_and_Biomechanics_of_WT_Offspring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the effect of parental myostatin deficiency on WT offspring bone strength, WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams were mated to WT or Mstntm1Sjl/+sires to generate four types of mating crosses (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 mo of age, parental myostatin status had no significant impact on body or muscle weights (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Femoral geometry of WT male offspring was examined using µCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As paternal myostatin status did not affect geometry or biomechanics, data from WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+sires were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams had longer femora and 13% greater polar moment of area compared with those from WT dams (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulatively, this shift in geometry and increase in polar moment of area predicts a greater ability to resist torsion in WT offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By torsional loading to failure, femora of WT male offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams exhibited a 19% increase in torsional ultimate strength (Tmax), the maximum force required to break the bone (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tensile strength (Su), an estimate of the strength of the bone material, was also increased by 17% (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither stiffness (Ks) nor the shear modulus of elasticity (G), a measure of the stiffness of the bone material, was altered by maternal myostatin status (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams showed evidence of a 37% increase in energy to failure (U), although this did not reach significance (P = 0.06) (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data show that the maternal myostatin deficiency in Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams improves the bone biomechanical integrity of WT male offspring by cumulatively altering the geometry, ultimate strength, and material properties of the bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paternal myostatin status did not influence femoral geometry or strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effect of maternal myostatin deficiency occurred independent of offspring sex, the response was not as robust in female offspring and did not reach significance in pairwise comparisons (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Parental_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_Tibial_Microarchitecture_of_WT_Offspring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tibial trabecular microarchitecture of 4-mo-old WT male offspring from WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams was assessed by high-resolution µCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trabecular bone volume to total volume (BV/TV), number, thickness, and separation were equivalent among the four crosses, exhibiting no main parental effect or interactions (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Parental_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_WT_Offspring_Bone_Apposition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Osteoblasts synthesize type I collagen and other noncollagenous proteins that stimulate mineralization and bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was evidence of increased serum osteocalcin, an indirect measure of osteoblast activity (17), in offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 2A), whereas serum PINP (amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen), a biomarker of collagen synthesis, remained equivalent in offspring from WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the type I collagen gene Col1a1 was not impacted by maternal myostatin status (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Col1a2 expression was increased in offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams only when the sire was also Mstntm1Sjl/+ (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, hydroxyproline content per gram of bone (an indirect measure of type I collagen) was similar in the WT offspring tibiae from either WT or Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data suggest that maternal myostatin deficiency does not alter the overall collagen content or its synthesis per gram of bone in adult offspring but may impact osteoblast activity and/or number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Parental_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_Perinatal_Growth_and_Collagen_Content_of_WT_Offspring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate how maternal myostatin deficiency impacts fetal development, placental and fetal growth were examined in late pregnancy (d16.5) in WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT male fetuses weighed 25% more when the dam was Mstntm1Sjl/+ (Fig 3A), whereas placental weights (Fig 3B) remained equivalent to those from WT dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests an increase in placental efficiency, although the difference in the fetal weight to placental weight did not reach significance (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetal serum was collected to examine whether maternal serum myostatin concentrations influence fetal myostatin concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams had reduced circulating myostatin levels compared with WT dams (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although myostatin was quantified in serum of WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ fetuses, it was undetectable in serum of Mstntm1Sjl/tm1Sjl fetuses (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, circulating myostatin concentrations in WT fetuses from WT and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams did not differ (Fig 3F), further demonstrating that maternal myostatin does not impact fetal serum myostatin at d16.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the increase in fetal size of offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams at d16.5 was associated with differences in bone formation, neonatal calvaria were harvested and evaluated for type I collagen expression and content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calvaria harvested from neonatal WT pups from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams did not exhibit differences in the expression of the type I collagen genes Col1a1 or Col1a2 (Fig 3 G and H), although they had 34% more hydroxyproline per gram of bone than calvaria harvested from WT dams (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approach_2__Effect_of_Maternal_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_Bone_Geometry_and_Biomechanics_of_OI_Offspring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OI compromises bone material integrity and alters osteoblast and osteoclast activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if OI bone can respond to prenatal exposure to maternal myostatin deficiency, femora of Col1a2oim/+ mice born to Col1a2oim/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams were evaluated (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in WT offspring, adult male Col1a2oim/+ offspring body and muscle weights were not affected by maternal myostatin [sample size for females was insufficient (Table S1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perinatal exposure to myostatin deficiency also did not alter femoral geometry (Table S3), as assessed by µCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By torsional loading to failure, femora of male Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams had increased femoral torsional ultimate strength (Tmax) and tensile strength (Su) by 15% and 29% (Fig 4 B and C) relative to Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Col1a2oim/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These improvements are similar to those seen in WT offspring born to Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femoral energy to failure (U) was not significantly increased in male Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams, although as in WT offspring (Fig 1F), there was some evidence of an increase (Fig 4F, P = 0.07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femoral stiffness and shear modulus of elasticity were equivalent in male Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Col1a2oim/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to males, femora from female Col1a2oim/+ offspring did not exhibit differences in biomechanical strength based on maternal genotype (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, bone strength in Col1a2oim/+ offspring benefited similarly to that of WT offspring from being born to Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams, although the geometric impact was not as robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Maternal_Myostatin_Deficiency_on_Bone_Composition_of_OI_Offspring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the enhanced ability of Col1a2oim/+ bone to resist fracture is dependent on changes in bone material, the hierarchical organization of the mineral to matrix composition was examined by Raman spectroscopy (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in PO43-/CO32- ratios between Col1a2oim/+ offspring tibiae from Col1a2oim/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was some indication of increased PO43-/CH2 (mineral:protein) in tibiae of males born to Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig 5B) (P = 0.06).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PO43-/amide I (mineral:collagen) ratio of Col1a2oim/+ male offspring tibiae from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams was increased 27% compared with those from Col1a2oim/+ dams (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tibial collagen cross-link ratios were similar in Col1a2oim/+ male offspring born to Col1a2oim/+ (1.80 ± 0.04) and Mstntm1Sjl/+ (1.91 ± 0.04) dams (P = 0.16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroxyproline content was also not altered (Fig 5D), suggesting the increased ratio of mineral: collagen in offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams is not due to an overall decrease in collagen content per gram of bone and therefore may reflect increased mineral content with altered structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approach_3__Effect_of_Myostatin_Deficiency_After_Embryo_Implantation_on_Femoral_Geometry_and_Biomechanics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To begin to define the critical time point during gestation when myostatin deficiency programs offspring bone strength in the Col1a2oim/+ mouse, we transferred embryos from a Col1a2oim/+ dam to a Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipient dam so that offspring were exposed to the myostatin-deficient maternal environment only after d3.5 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the femoral geometry and biomechanical strength of 4-mo-old male offspring using µCT and torsional loading to failure, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although WT and Col1a2oim/oim offspring were also produced, the study was powered only to examine Col1a2oim/+ offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 mo of age, body and muscle weights were not affected by recipient genotype (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in Col1a2oim/+ male offspring femoral geometry resulting from maternal recipient genotype, although there was some evidence of increased marrow diameter in those born to Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipients (P = 0.10) (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The torsional ultimate strength of the femora of male Col1a2oim/+ offspring born to Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipients was 36% stronger than in those born to Col1a2oim/+ recipients (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was insufficient evidence for an effect of maternal recipient myostatin status on tensile strength (P = 0.08), but Col1a2oim/+ male offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipient dams showed a 20% increase over those from control dams (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the natural mating studies (approaches 1 and 2), femoral stiffness and shear modulus of elasticity (Fig 6 D and E) were equivalent in males born to Mstntm1Sjl/+and Col1a2oim/+ recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy to failure increased 83% in male Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipient dams (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was no Sex × Recipient Genotype interactions in the bone biomechanics, the female offspring did not respond as robustly as the males (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, exposure to maternal myostatin deficiency only after d3.5 produced similar improvements in bone strength as exposure throughout oogenesis and gestation, and the maternal uterine environment is responsible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study assesses the effect of maternal myostatin deficiency on bone development and maturity by characterizing bone strength, geometry, microarchitecture, and material in WT and Col1a2oim/+ offspring born to control versus Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birth to a Mstntm1Sjl/+ dam improved torsional ultimate strength and tensile strength at the age of peak bone mass (4 mo) in both WT and Col1a2oim/+ male offspring in all three experimental approaches and produced significant or suggestive improvements in energy to failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One caveat is that improvements were more equivocal in female offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we conclude that maternal myostatin deficiency improves bone biomechanical integrity in both WT and mice with mild OI (Col1a2oim/+) and that this advantage is conferred during gestation after d3.5 (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alterations in both geometry and material properties contribute to increased bone strength, but they were more variable among the three experimental approaches than the improvements in biomechanical integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT offspring, gestation in a Mstntm1Sjl/+ dam increased the femoral polar moment of area (an estimate of the contribution of bone geometry to breaking strength).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Col1a2oim/+ offspring were more variable and did not show significant changes in femoral geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Col1a2oim mouse model has compromised bone remodeling and osteoblast maturation and exhibits ER stress, in addition to the observed structural defects (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular defects in osteoblast function may contribute to the less robust geometric response in Col1a2oim/+ offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maternal myostatin deficiency increased the calvarial collagen content per gram of bone in WT neonates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it did not do so in 4-mo-old WT or Col1a2oim/+ offspring tibias, suggesting that collagen content cannot account for the observed biomechanical differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of increased Col1a2 mRNA levels in 4-mo-old WT offspring tibia from only the Mstntm1Sjl/+ × Mstntm1Sjl/+cross in the absence of increased Col1a1 mRNA levels or hydroxyproline is uncertain, as Col1a1 and Col1a2 gene expression are generally coregulated (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in calvarial neonate and adult tibial collagen content may reflect differences due to endochondral ossification versus direct mesenchymal intramembranous ossification and/or inherent differences in fetal bone modeling versus adult bone remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WT offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams were larger at d16.5 than their counterparts from WT dams, and this may suggest that they are further along developmentally and thus in bone modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Femoral PO43-/amide I (mineral:collagen) ratio was also increased in Col1a2oim/+ offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams relative to Col1a2oim/+ offspring of Col1a2oim/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypermineralization with reduced collagen content is believed to contribute to brittleness in OI (16, 21, 22), yet this did not occur here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams displayed no differences in stiffness, shear modulus of elasticity, or collagen cross-link ratios, despite increased mineral content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were similar to a previous study examining the impact of myostatin deficiency in Col1a2oim/+ mice (4), suggesting that the mineral:matrix ratio alone does not predict bone strength and that further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms responsible for improved biomechanical strength of bone in response to maternal myostatin deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bone and muscle are dependent upon the shared forces of the mechanostat unit, with bone strength being proportional to muscle mass (23), and bone responding to secretory factors released by muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one mechanism by which maternal myostatin deficiency strengthens bone may be via enhanced muscle loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, Lee demonstrated that offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/tm1Sjl dams had greater muscle mass at 10 wk of age than offspring from WT dams (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we also detected some evidence of increased muscle mass in WT offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (P = 0.12) (Table S1) and of increased relative contractility in the tibialis anterior muscle of Col1a2oim/+ offspring from embryo transfers to Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (P = 0.09) (Fig S2), we did not observe as clear an impact of maternal myostatin deficiency on muscle as on bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that increased muscle loading is not sufficient to explain the increased torsional ultimate strength in offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decreased myostatin in the maternal environment may act by altering the differentiation capacity of progenitor cells to favor an osteoblast lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal nutritional status during gestation can impact osteoblast differentiation (24), showing that developmental programming of bone occurs via this mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in calvarial hydroxyproline content per gram of bone in the absence of increased collagen expression per cell at birth suggests a greater number of osteoblasts in offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could also account for the evidence of increased serum osteocalcin in 4-mo-old offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscle, bone, and fat are derived from the same precursor, mesenchymal stem cells (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of myostatin increases commitment of the mesenchymal stem cell [C3H 10T(1/2)] to an adipogenic fate, and mesenchymal stem cells from myostatin-deficient mice show increased osteogenic potential in vitro (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as maternal myostatin did not enter the fetal circulation and fetal size was increased overall, an indirect action of maternal myostatin on fetal bone is likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the lack of myostatin in the uterine environment increases osteoblast number or activity and whether this occurs via alterations in mesenchymal stem cell progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fetal growth advantage at d16.5 may have programmed the growth trajectory of offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams to lead to the improved adult bone biomechanical integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, birth weight and weight at 1 y correlate positively with adult bone integrity (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Finnish cohort hospitalized for hip fracture were found to be shorter at birth but of average height at 7 y of age compared with individuals who did not fracture (26), suggesting an effect of childhood growth rate on adult bone strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone strength did not differ among offspring at 1 mo of age, but serum osteocalcin levels were lower in male offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1 mo of age, the bone is in its active growth trajectory, and the decrease in osteocalcin may indicate that offspring from Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams reached their peak growth acceleration earlier than offspring from WT dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism by which maternal myostatin deficiency promotes fetal growth is yet to be determined, but it may involve the placenta and the uterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of myostatin on placental glucose transport is mixed, with decreased glucose transport in a choriocarcinoma cell line (27) and increased transport in human placental explants (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myostatin also promotes extravillous trophoblast migration in vitro, which may alter placental development in vivo (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uterine knockout of myostatin receptor ALK4 profoundly alters placental organization (30), as does knockout of ALK5, which additionally disrupts implantation, spiral artery remodeling, and uterine natural killer cell localization (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining whether myostatin regulates placental establishment and organization or transport of key nutrients by the uterus and placenta in vivo will be critical to understanding the mechanisms by which it promotes fetal growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The embryo transfer data (approach 3) begin to define the critical window in which myostatin deficiency alters programming of offspring bone geometry and integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During maternal germ cell development, DNA methylations are removed and reacquired during oogenesis (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the embryo undergoes demethylation following fertilization with remethylation beginning around the time of blastocyst formation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events make the periconceptional window a critical time during which the maternal environment can alter the epigenetic landscape and program fetal and adult outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the periconceptional period did not prove to be the time at which maternal myostatin deficiency programs bone health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the embryo transfer experiment, offspring exposed to the Mstntm1Sjl/+ maternal environment only after d3.5 showed similar improvements in adult bone biomechanical integrity as offspring exposed throughout oogenesis and embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implicates the postimplantation uterine environment in programming of musculoskeletal outcome by maternal myostatin deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our data have consistently shown that maternal myostatin deficiency increases offspring bone strength in male offspring, the effect on females was less robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When evaluating offspring muscle mass, Lee detected increases in muscle mass in both male and female offspring from Mstntm1Sjl parents compared with those from WT parents (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although myostatin deficiency affected both sexes, more of the muscle groups were affected in WT male offspring than in female offspring (5), suggesting a more robust phenotype in the males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex differences are commonly observed in developmental programming models and often times more drastically affect males than females, although the molecular mechanisms driving the sexual dimorphic nature of developmental programming outcomes remain largely unknown (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides additional evidence that bone is responsive to developmental programming and the finding that myostatin can mediate these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone geometry, physiochemical composition, and cellular activity are programed in offspring of Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams at 4 mo of age, with differences in fetal size as early as d16.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulatively, these changes increased bone biomechanical integrity at the age of peak bone mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our study provides evidence that OI bone, despite containing compromised material, cellular function, and biomechanical strength, is responsive to the developmental programming effects of maternal myostatin deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although research in developmental programming has largely focused on identifying harmful prenatal exposures, this finding opens up an avenue of research to explore the application of developmental programming to a congenital bone disorder and begins to define a potential in utero therapeutic window for treating OI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All mouse models were backcrossed into a C57BL/6J congenic background from Jackson Laboratories, and homogeneity was confirmed using microsatellite markers (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility at the University of MissouriColumbia with ad libitum access to water and food (5008 Formulab Diet; Purina Mills Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was performed under an approved University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tissue collections and data analysis were performed blinded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approach_1__Maternal_Myostatin-Deficient_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WT and heterozygous myostatin (Mstntm1Sjl/+) mice were bred to generate four genetic crosses (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At d16.5, a set of dams were killed by CO2 and exsanguinated via cardiac puncture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Placental and fetal weights were recorded and blood harvested from each fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pups 12 d old from a second set of dams were killed by decapitation and the calvaria harvested and frozen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a third set of dams, WT male offspring were killed at 1 or 4 [peak bone mineral density (35)] mo of age for collection of femurs, tibiae, and hindlimb muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approaches_2_and_3__Maternal_Myostatin_Deficiency_in_Col1a2oim_+_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the effect of maternal myostatin deficiency on Col1a2oim/+ offspring bone integrity, we used two additional approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In approach 2, the natural mating model, Col1a2oim/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/+ dams were bred to Col1a2oim/+ sires and the resulting Col1a2oim/+ offspring were evaluated (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In approach 3, the embryo transfer model, to determine if the effect of maternal myostatin deficiency on offspring musculoskeletal outcome was conferred pre- or postimplantation, d3.5 embryos were transferred from Col1a2oim/+ females mated to Col1a2oim/+ sires into pseudopregnant Col1a2oim/+ and Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipients as described in SI Methods (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring were killed at 4 mo of age and their hindlimb muscles, tibiae, and femora evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Geometric parameters of right femora were defined by CT scan analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, each right femur was potted in a cylindrical holder to test torsional loading to failure, as described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relative_mRNA_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was isolated from calvaria of 1-d-old offspring and tibiae of 4-mo-old offspring, and relative mRNA levels were compared by real-time RT-PCR as described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Maternal and fetal myostatin levels were quantified using a GDF8/myostatin Quantikine ELISAs (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum PINP was quantified using the Rat/Mouse PINP EIA kit (AC-33F1) by Immunodiagnostics Systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum osteocalcin was quantified using an Osteocalcin EIA (Alfa Aesar) with a reported intraassay variation of 6%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples and standards were assayed in duplicate and read on a BioTek Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Reader and Gen5 Data Analysis Software v2.00.17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Collagen_Content_and_Raman_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collagen content was determined by an indirect assay quantifying hydroxyproline, as described in SI Methods and previously (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tibial cortical bone cross-sections were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, as described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fishers Protected Least Significant Difference with litter as the experimental unit and multiple offspring per litter as subreplicates, as detailed in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences were considered to be significant at P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Donor Col1a2oim/+ females were mated to Col1a2oim/+ sires, and blastocysts were flushed from the uterine tract of donor dams on the morning of gestational day d3.5 using CZB medium (EMD Millipore) with 22 mM Hepes (Life Technologies) and briefly cultured in drops of KSOM culture medium (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blastocysts from donor dams were pooled and transferred into Col1a2oim/+ or Mstntm1Sjl/+ recipient dams on d2.5 of pseudopregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with vasectomized males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the transfer surgery, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and given 0.05 mg/kg Prevail (VetOne, MWI Veterinary Supply) for analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter sizes ranged from 3 to 7 pups per litter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mstntm1Sjl/+ mice were genotyped for the myostatin allele using KAPA2G Fast HotStart Genotyping PCR Mix according to the manufacturers instructions (KAPA Biosystems, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KK5621) using the specific primers (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tail tip genomic DNA samples were amplified by PCR using the following parameters: 95 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 65.5 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s; 72 °C for 1 min; and finally held at 12 °C until evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then visualized by loading 15 µL of sample onto a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel with 1× tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) as the buffer and running the gel electrophoresis at 95 V for 1 h to separate the PCR products by size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To genotype the Col1a2oim mice, genomic DNA was extracted from tail clips and the Col1a2oim allele genotyped using the GoTaq G2 Hot Start Green Master Mix (2×, Promega, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M7423) according to the manufacturers instructions with specific primers (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were PCR amplified using the following parameters: 2.5 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 0.5 min at 57.1 °C and 0.5 min at 72 °C, and followed by 5 min at 72 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, 20 L of sample was loaded onto a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel with 1× TBE buffer and subjected to electrophoresis at 95 V for 50 min to separate PCR products by size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Harvest  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Left quadriceps muscles were removed, cleaned of extraneous tissue, blotted, and weighed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femora and tibiae were excised, the soft tissue removed, and the bones wrapped in sterile gauze before storage in sterile 1× PBS at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following removal of soft tissue, the left tibia was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C for RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum was collected and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tibial_µCT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vivaCT 40 is equipped with a rotating gantry and a microfocus X-ray source (4570 kVp), which allowed the detector to rotate around the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All scans were performed with a source voltage of 55 keV, current of 145 µA, and 10 µm voxel resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hydroxypatite (HA) calibration was performed to convert µCT values to a mineral-equivalent value, in milligrams per cubic centimeter (mg/ccm), for each voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tibiae were placed in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol in Falcon 15 mL polypropylene conical tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) with low-density foam to position the specimens firmly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimens were aligned with the vertical axis of the scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D images were reconstructed and each dataset arranged as a series of 10 µm-thick slices oriented along the long axis of each tibia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proximal metaphysic trabecular bone was analyzed 1 mm below the growth plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphometric variables include trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), thickness, number, and separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A global threshold 253 (µCT gray value) was used for all samples to extract the bone phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Femoral_Geometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Right femora were scanned by µCT (MicroCAT II, Siemens Medical) using the Amira 5.3.3 software package (Mercury Computer Systems/TGS) before ex vivo torsional loading to failure as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Torsional_Loading_to_Failure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The right femur was potted in a cylindrical holder and placed in a test fixture mounted on a TA-HDi testing machine (Stable Micro Systems), as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied torque (T; Nmm) was calculated from the test machines control software and plotted as a function of relative angular displacement  (degrees).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Torsional ultimate strength (Tmax; Nmm) was determined at the peak of the torque:displacement curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Torsional stiffness (Ks; Nmm/rad) was determined as the slope of a line of this plot between Tmax and Tmax/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shear modulus of elasticity (G; N/mm2) was determined according to Roarck (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy to failure (U; Nmm) was calculated as the area of a triangle created from the 3 points: Tmax, the X intercept at Tmax, and the X intercept found by extrapolating the slope of the line created between Tmax and Tmax/2 of the T versus  graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole bone parameters of strength [torsional ultimate strength (Tmax) and strain energy to failure (U)] and stiffness [torsional stiffness (Ks)] are descriptors of the entire bone, taking into account both the material comprising the bone as well as its size and shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Material properties of strength [tensile strength (Su)] and stiffness [shear modulus of elasticity (G)] are descriptors of the bone material, independent of the size and shape of the bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation_and_Quantitative_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calvaria harvested from 1-d-old offspring were homogenized in buffer RLT from Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) using a Pro200 homogenizer with MultiGen7XL generator (Pro Scientific) and isolated according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tibiae were homogenized in a 4 M guanidinum thiocyanate solution, and RNA was isolated using standard acidphenol chloroform extraction and precipitation in isopropanol according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following precipitation, the RNA pellet was suspended in RLT buffer from Qiagen RNeasy kit and isolated according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All RNA was subjected to Qiagen on-column DNase incubation according to the manufacturers instruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reverse-transcribed 2 µg of total RNA using a high capacity reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and quantitatively amplified it using specific primer/probe sets for Col1a1, Col1a2, Gapdh, and Atp6 (Applied Biosystems, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mm00801666_g1, Mm00483937_m1, Mm99999915_g1, Mm03649417_g1) using probe fast qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KK4703) under recommended cycling parameters (3 min 95 °C; 40 cycles of 2 s 95 °C/20 s 55 °C) on a BioRad CFX96 thermal cycler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of Col1a1 and Col1a2 was normalized to Gadph and Atp6, which were determined to be consistent among offspring treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficiencies of primer probe sets were validated with 1:10 serial dilutions to produce a five-point linear curve and found to be between 85% and 91%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hydroxyproline_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydroxyproline was measured as an indication of collagen content, as previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tibia or femora were weighed, acid-hydrolyzed, and reacted to Chloramine T and Ehrlichs reagent to quantitate hydroxyproline content (µg/g bone) as described by Stegemann and Stalder (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Raman_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Left tibial cortical bone cross-sections were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy using a LabRam HR 800 Raman spectrometer (Horiba JobinYvon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged bone biochemical composition was determined from Raman spectra (7001,800 cm1 range) that were excited by a helium-neon laser (633 nm) with a 20× water immersion objective, as previously described, allowing acquisition of peaks attributed to the bone minerals and proteins (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tibia was examined at four points from anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral cross-section and the data averaged for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra analyses were performed to measure the area of hydroxyapatite 1 PO43- peak (960 cm1), type B 1 CO32- peak (1,070 cm1), and matrix CH2 band (1,450 cm1), amide I (1,640 cm1), and cross-link ratio (1,660 cm1/1,690 cm1) (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphate:matrix (PO43-/CH2) ratio, which increases with bone mineral content, was assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of phosphate/carbonate, which decreases with maturation of mineralized matrix, was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of PO43-/amide I, the bone mineral:collagen ratio, was also determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-link ratio is proportional to the relative amounts of the collagen trivalent pyridinoline and the divalent dihydroxylysinonorleucine cross-links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Muscle_Contractile_Strength  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Briefly, 4-mo-old Col1a2oim/+ offspring from the embryo transfer experiment (approach 3) were anesthetized and the left gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles surgically exposed at their distal insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal tendon of each muscle was attached to the grass force transducer and adjusted in length so that passive tension was 0 g. The sciatic nerve was isolated and placed on a stimulating electrode, and a twitch was obtained as previously described (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At optimal length, a peak tetanic contraction (Po) was elicited by pulses delivered at 150 Hz, 300 ms duration, and an intensity of 6 V for each muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were collected using Power Lab (ADInstruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the relative Po, contractile generating capacity was normalized to muscle weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
