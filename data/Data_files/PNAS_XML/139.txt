Cocaine elicits autophagic cytotoxicity via a nitric oxide-GAPDH signaling cascade  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cocaine is one of the most abused drugs in modern society, with overdoses that are frequently lethal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular mechanisms underlying its toxic actions have been obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study demonstrates that cocaines cellular toxicity involves a signaling cascade that utilizes the gasotransmitter nitric oxide, which leads to autophagy, a cellular modification that can cause cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, manipulations that impair nitric oxide signaling and autophagy diminish cytotoxic actions of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, alterations of apoptosis and other nonautophagic modes of cell death are ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapies directed toward the autophagic process may be beneficial in treating cocaine neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cocaine exerts its behavioral stimulant effects by facilitating synaptic actions of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also neurotoxic and broadly cytotoxic, leading to overdose deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the cytotoxic actions of cocaine reflect selective enhancement of autophagy, a process that physiologically degrades metabolites and cellular organelles, and that uncontrolled autophagy can also lead to cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brain cultures, cocaine markedly increases levels of LC3-II and depletes p62, both actions characteristic of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, cocaine fails to stimulate cell death processes reflecting parthanatos, monitored by cleavage of poly(ADP ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1), or necroptosis, assessed by levels of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy protects neurons against cocaine-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, inhibition of parthanatos, necroptosis, or apoptosis did not change cocaine cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of ATG5 or beclin-1, major mediators of autophagy, prevents cocaine-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, depleting caspase-3, whose cleavage reflects apoptosis, fails to alter cocaine cytotoxicity, and cocaine does not alter caspase-3 cleavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, depleting PARP-1 or RIPK1, key mediators of parthanatos and necroptosis, respectively, did not prevent cocaine-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagic actions of cocaine are mediated by the nitric oxide-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cocaine-associated autophagy is abolished by depleting GAPDH via shRNA; by the drug CGP3466B, which prevents GAPDH nitrosylation; and by mutating cysteine-150 of GAPDH, its site of nitrosylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments that selectively influence cocaine-associated autophagy may afford therapeutic benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cocaine_Elicits_Autophagy_in_Neuronal_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3) is the mammalian homolog of the yeast protein Atg8, a well-characterized mediator of autophagy (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammalian autophagy is associated with the lipidation of LC3-I via the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine to generate LC3-II (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of LC3-II can be regarded as an important marker for autophagy (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treatment of primary neuronal cerebrocortical cultures with cocaine markedly augments formation of LC3-II with a maximal sevenfold increase and half-maximal effects at 1 M (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bafilomycin facilitates monitoring autophagic flux by increasing the pH of lysosomes, which prevents degradation of autophagic vesicles and reduces variability (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of bafilomycin, cocaine enhances levels of LC3-II (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because bafilomycin prevents degradation of autophagic vesicles, these findings rule out the possibility that cocaine acts by altering the disposition of autophagic vesicles and establish that cocaine acts by increasing autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined p62, an adaptor protein that binds to ubiquitylated proteins to facilitate their degradation via autophagy (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the process, p62 itself is degraded, with this degradation representing a marker for the autophagic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cocaine (1200 M) dramatically decreases protein levels of p62, which are virtually evident even at 1 M dose of cocaine (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess autophagy at a morphologic level, we monitored LC3-II punctae by confocal microscopy (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed substantial increases in such punctae following cocaine treatment, further supporting autophagic actions of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopic analysis of cortical cultures further supports the autophagic actions of cocaine (Fig 1H and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers of autophagic vesicles are tripled by 10 M cocaine and increased sixfold at 100/200 M cocaine (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed morphologic examination reveals the double lamellar structure characteristic of autophagic vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extended our analysis to intact mouse brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports demonstrated neurotoxic effects of cocaine in the lateral habenula (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brains of adult mice treated with cocaine, transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM) reveals a substantial increase in numbers of autophagic vesicles in the lateral habenula (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When pregnant mice were treated with cocaine, considerable numbers of autophagic vesicles are evident in the cerebral cortices of pups compared with pups of control pregnant mice (Fig 1K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To substantiate microscopic data, we performed Western blot analysis of LC3-II in different part of mice brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, treatment of cocaine substantially induced LC3-II level in dorsal striatum, cortex, lateral habenula, and nucleus accumbens compared with vehicle treated group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig S1 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, multiple lines of evidence, both biochemical and morphologic, support an autophagic action of cocaine in neuronal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Autophagic_Actions_of_Cocaine_Involve_GAPDH_Nitrosylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier, we reported that behavioral stimulant and neurotoxic actions of cocaine depend upon a signaling system involving NO nitrosylating GAPDH (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that this process also underlies cocaine-associated autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In HEK-293 cells cocaine elicits autophagy monitored by the generation of LC3-II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations of 250 M cocaine have been used, because HEK-293 cells are relatively insensitive to autophagic actions of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of GAPDH by shRNA treatment (Fig S2A) virtually abolishes the autophagic enhancement of LC3-II elicited by cocaine (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous study linking GAPDH nitrosylation to cocaines actions used intact mice (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we evaluated cerebrocortical neuronal cultures, which differ notably from adult rodent brain in lacking the dopamine and serotonin neuronal systems that are classically involved in psychotropoic influences of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cultures, we demonstrate that cocaine (1100 M) elicits GAPDH nitrosylation (Fig 2C) as well as nuclear translocation of GAPDH (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NO/GAPDH/Siah1 system is potently inhibited by the drug CGP2466B, which, at very low nanomolar concentrations, prevents GAPDH nitrosylation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cocaine-elicited augmentation of LC3-II is prevented by treatment with 2 nM CGP3466B (Fig 2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GAPDH nitrosylation appears to be required for these actions of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nitrosylation of GAPDH that mediates the NO/GAPDH/Siah1 signaling system selectively involves C150 of GAPDH (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated autophagic influences of cocaine in HEK-293 cells overexpressing wild-type GAPDH or GAPDH with cysteine-150 mutated to serine (GAPDH-C150S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of LC3-II is evident after GAPDH over expression and appears to be significantly high after cocaine treatment compared with GAPDH-C150S mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diminished autophagy is evident in the absence as well as the presence of cocaine (Fig 2 G, H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we treated nNOS knockout (KO) mice-derived cortical cultures (Fig S2B) to further confirm the role of NO in cocaine-induced autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing concentrations of cocaine failed to augment LC3-II levels in nNOS KO neurons (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings emphasize the importance of GAPDH nitrosylation in cocaine-induced autophagy in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selectivity_of_Cocaine_s_Influences_on_Autophagic_Neuronal_Cell_Death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus far, we have established that cocaine impacts autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next explored cocaines actions upon other modes of programmed cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neuronal cultures, cocaine half maximally elicits cell death at about 10 M (Fig 3A), which is prevented by CGP3466B (2 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared agents that influence different modes of cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARP-1specific inhibitor, 3,4-dihydro-5-(4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxyl)-1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ), selectively prevents parthanatos associated with PARP-mediated necrosis (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Necrostatin uniquely blocks necroptosis, which is mediated by RIPK1 (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) is a well characterized inhibitor of multiple caspases, a classical mediator of apoptosis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cocaine-elicited cell death in cortical cultures is not significantly influenced by the inhibitors of parthanatos, necroptosis, and caspases (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, bafilomycin (50 nM) abolishes cocaine-mediated cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cocaine-associated cell death can be attributed to autophagy rather than to other well known forms of programmed cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine directly a selective role for autophagy in cocaine-associated cell death, we depleted either ATG 5 or beclin-1 (Fig S3 A and E), physiologic mediators of autophagy (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATG 5 or beclin-1 depletion markedly diminishes cocaine cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, depletion of caspase-3, PARP-1, or RIPK1 (Fig 3C and Fig S3 BD) has no influence upon the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apoptosis is selectively enhanced by staurosporine, a well known inhibitor of protein kinases (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the influence of staurosporine upon apoptosis monitored by cleavage of caspase-3 (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase-3 cleavage is elicited by staurosporine, but not by cocaine, indicating that cocaine does not display proapoptotic influences (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DNA-alkylating agent MNNG elicits parthanatos-mediated cell death via PARP-1 cleavage (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas MNNG substantially cleaves PARP-1, cocaine fails to do so, indicating that cocaine does not act via parthanotos (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MLKL is phosphorylated by RIPK1 in response to agents that stimulate necroptosis (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Necroptosis is typically induced by treatment with TNF- in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, an apoptosis inhibitor (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously (42), TNF-, combined with Z-VAD-fmk, increases levels of phospho-MLKL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, cocaine has no influence, indicating that cocaine is not a stimulant of necroptosis (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autophagic cell death is associated with specific morphologic alterations, such as nuclear concavity and swelling of the perinuclear space (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopic analysis reveals concavity of the nucleus following cocaine treatment (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, we fail to observe nuclear fragmentation or membrane disruptions that characterize nonautophagic forms of cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autophagic cell death is a relatively recently appreciated but well accepted phenomenon defined by specific criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagic death is characterized by autophagic flux and the involvement of at least two autophagic regulatory factors along with the absence of apoptosis (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cocaine-elicited cell death fulfills these criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cocaine elicits autophagy as evaluated by several indices: induction of LC3-II, degradation of p62, ultrastructural analysis by TEM, and confocal monitoring of LC3 punctae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have ruled out involvement of cocaine in other modes of programmed cell death such as apoptosis, parthanatos, and necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cocaine induces autophagy in cortical cultures at concentrations as low as 1 M. These levels are clinically relevant because recreational abuse of cocaine is associated with peak serum concentrations between 0.5 and 5 M. The highest reported cocaine serum concentration in a living person is 120 M. Cocaine concentrations in the brain are generally higher than those in the blood (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human toxicity cases, average brain-to-blood cocaine concentrations ratio is 9.6-fold (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, other workers have described autophagy associated with cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (46) reported activation of microglia in response to cocaine, which appeared to involve autophagy and inflammatory reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cao et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37) detected autophagy in astrocytic cultures following treatment with cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies were restricted to single cell lines and did not discriminate autophagy from other modes of cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, our study systematically rules out a variety of modes of programmed cell death and establishes that cocaines toxic actions are uniquely associated with autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study also demonstrates that cocaines impact upon autophagy involves the NO/GAPDH signaling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our earlier investigation (24) established a role for the NO/GAPDH system in cell death but failed to delineate the type of cell death involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the effects of stimulant and neurotoxic doses of cocaine on NO/GAPDH signaling are blocked by dopamine D1 receptor inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current work, cocaine induces NO/GAPDH signaling in primary cortical cultures, which lack the dopaminergic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information suggests the existence of another mechanism by which cocaine induces autophagy via the NO/GAPDH cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is needed to delineate the upstream molecular events that lead to NO/GAPDH signaling-mediated activation of autophagy in response to high doses of cocaine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings may have therapeutic relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the notion that cocaine toxicity is uniquely associated with autophagy implies that selective and potent inhibitors of autophagy may be therapeutic in treating cocaine users.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interventions in the autophagic process may also benefit infants born of cocaine-using mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terms of specific agents that might be beneficial, our observations that the NO/GAPDH pathway mediates cocaine actions may have therapeutic ramifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CGP3466B prevents GAPDH nitrosylation at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM (28) and has been administered in clinical trials of patients with Parkinsons disease as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these studies CGP3466B appeared to be safe with negligible side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drug or related agents may be beneficial in the therapy of cocaine abuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
