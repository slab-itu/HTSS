Critical impact of vegetation physiology on the continental hydrologic cycle in response to increasing CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Predicting how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect the hydrologic cycle is of utmost importance for a wide range of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is typically thought that future dryness will depend on precipitation changes, i.e., change in water supply, and changes in evaporative demand due to either increased radiation or temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opposite to this viewpoint, using Earth system models, we show that changes in key water-stress variables will be strongly modified by vegetation physiological effects in response to increased [CO2] at the leaf level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results emphasize that the continental carbon and water cycles have to be studied as an interconnected system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Predicting how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect the hydrologic cycle is of utmost importance for a range of applications ranging from ecological services to human life and activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical perspective is that hydrologic change is driven by precipitation and radiation changes due to climate change, and that the land surface will adjust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Earth system models with decoupled surface (vegetation physiology) and atmospheric (radiative) CO2 responses, we here show that the CO2 physiological response has a dominant role in evapotranspiration and evaporative fraction changes and has a major effect on long-term runoff compared with radiative or precipitation changes due to increased atmospheric CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This major effect is true for most hydrological stress variables over the largest fraction of the globe, except for soil moisture, which exhibits a more nonlinear response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the key role of vegetation in controlling future terrestrial hydrologic response and emphasizes that the carbon and water cycles are intimately coupled over land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supply and demand for water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation (AC; annual) is the supply; demand for water is driven by two factors: net radiation (DF; annual) and VPD (GI; growing season) for, respectively, CTRL (Left), ATMO (Center), and PHYS (Right) runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Change is quantified by the difference of the years 89118 of the simulation and the years 120, normalized by the SD of CTRL over the years 120 (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes observed for VPD are much larger in amplitude than for Rn and P, so that the scale was adjusted accordingly for VPD in G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several dryness indices based on Ep have been previously defined and used to assess changes in water stress, but give contradictory responses (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore decided to not use such indices [e.g., Swann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6)] as they are not pertinent in the future because of plant physiological effects [Swann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) and Milly and Dunne (7)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We instead focus on actual physical variables that can be used as land aridity indicators pertinent to various applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-ET is a good proxy for long-term runoff, as soil and groundwater storage variations over several years are negligible, and a useful variable for agricultural and ecological impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to P-ET, we focus on three variables (Fig 2): soil moisture (agronomy and ecology), ET (hydrology, climate), and evaporative fraction (EF) (landatmosphere interactions), i.e., the ratio of ET to surface available energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Disentangling_Atmospheric_and_Physiological_Responses_to_Increasing_CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We quantify changes in these water cycle parameters using a multimodel ensemble from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP5 (25), and assess the impact of atmospheric (ATMO) vs. physiological (PHYS) CO2 effects (21) using an idealized experiment where [CO2] is increased from preindustrial levels by 1% each year only in the atmospheric model (ATMO) or in the vegetation model (PHYS), or in both (CTRL) (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conceptual experiments give geographically consistent results with the more commonly used Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP 8.5) experiments (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3), and enable us to disentangle the greenhouse gas warming (ATMO) from the physiological effects of increased [CO2] (PHYS) on hydrologic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further decompose the global warming effects in ATMO into the contribution of precipitation and net radiation (and related increases in temperature and VPD) (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are then able to estimate the relative contribution of each of the three main hydrologic drivers: precipitation, net radiation, and physiological effects (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S4), as well as nonlinearities that could result from the interactions between surface physiology and atmospheric changes (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The drivers of water supply and evaporative demandprecipitation, radiation, and VPDare primarily controlled by atmospheric greenhouse effects (ATMO) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the supply side of the water balance, annual precipitation increases throughout the globe in CTRL, because of the increased energy input into the surface due to increased greenhouse gas effects and because of the increased atmospheric water vapor, especially at northern latitudes (Fig 1A) where the present pattern is exacerbated by warming-induced changes in water vapor (1, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation decreases in several places such as in Southwest North America, southern Africa, the Amazon, and the Mediterranean region (2), primarily because of global warming (Fig 1B) and changes in atmospheric dynamics and not because of physiological effects, which mainly have an impact on tropical precipitation (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the demand side of the water balance, net radiation (Rn), one of the main drivers of Ep (3), increases relatively uniformly over the Earth (Fig 1D) in CTRL, primarily driven by greenhouse gas radiative effects (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, physiological effects also increase Rn throughout the globe except in equatorial Africa and in Indonesia (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in low cloud cover imposed by the decreased EF (28) (Fig 2I) drives a downwelling shortwave radiation increase, while the limited differential changes in surface skin and air temperature keep longwave radiation changes small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enhanced VPD not only increases evaporative demand [Penmans equation (3)] but also decreases stomatal conductance, and therefore ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VPD increases strongly across the Earth with increasing [CO2] (Fig 1G) due to its exponential dependence on temperature (Fig 1H and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to warming effects (Fig 1H), the closure of stomata under higher [CO2] implies reduced water flux into the air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting shift in EF (Fig 2I) contributes to higher temperatures, which, combined with lower humidity, increases VPD throughout the globe, especially in the wet tropics (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate change also drives differential land and ocean warming, reducing relative humidity over land (29), as highlighted in ATMO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physiological_Effects_Have_a_Critical_Impact_on_the_Variables_of_the_Water_Cycle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field experiments (12, 15, 20) and observations (30) have shown that higher [CO2] can stimulate plant growth within an observed range of nearly zero up to 12% at a doubling of [CO2] depending on species, climates, nutrient availability, and other stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land-surface models capture a similar range (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the leaf area index (LAI) indeed increases almost everywhere except in Amazonia and central Africa (SI Appendix, Fig S6A), where LAI is already high and further growth is thus limited (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological effect (SI Appendix, Fig S6C) is, as expected, the primary driver of LAI changes over 89% of land accounting for two-thirds of the change globally (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6D and S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptions are the northern latitudes where radiative effects (SI Appendix, Fig S6D) induce warmer temperatures and a longer growing season (31) (SI Appendix, Fig S6B), and the Amazon basin, where the combined negative contributions of the precipitation decline (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Fig S6D) and the radiatively induced Rn increase (Fig 1E and SI Appendix, Fig S6D), cancel out the physiological effects (SI Appendix, Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in ET under elevated [CO2] vary widely across the globe (Fig 2A) and are mostly controlled by physiological effects, which account for 58% of the changes globally (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the energy-limited northern latitudes, higher ET is however mostly due to radiative effects and accompanying increased precipitation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical rainforests, which are also energy-limited, display an increase in ET from radiative effects (Fig 2B) but this effect is overcompensated by the physiological response of stomata to [CO2] (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mediterranean, Central America, and West Africa all exhibit reduced ET (Fig 2A) in response to radiatively driven precipitation declines (Fig 2B), but are also largely physiologically controlled (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 AC and S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The response of P-ET, i.e., long-term runoff (Fig 2D), reflects the changes in both P and ET, and should be more strongly related to radiative changes as they mostly alter precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, physiology still slightly dominates precipitation changes of P-ET, 37% vs. 32% of the total changes, respectively (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CTRL, the response is a smoothed version of the precipitation response (Fig 1A) and does not reflect the increase in Ep (Fig 3B) (6), further confirming that Ep is not a pertinent variable of changes in ET in the future (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geographical structure of P-ET thus largely reflects global warming changes (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiological effects and their impact on ET (Fig 2C) drive the P-ET response in the regions where ET changes are the largest (Eastern United States,, central South America, Southeast Asia, and central Africa) (SI Appendix, Fig S9I); they contribute most to P-ET in about one-third of the globe (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation accounts for about one-third of the P-ET changes (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S4E) and dominates the P-ET response in one-quarter of the globe (SI Appendix, Fig S7C), which is a much larger fraction than for other stress indices such as LAI, ET, EF, or soil moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over Western Europe, the northern part of Amazon, and southern South America, the decreasing trend in precipitation (Fig 1A) has a large impact on P-ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation and related temperature increase drives P-ET change in the northern latitudes and in some semiarid regions (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one-third of the globe surface is not dominated by one single factor, and only their combined effects can explain the overall response (SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This multimodel analysis of P-ET shows that both total greenhouse gas effects (as assessed in ATMO) and PHYS play a very significant role in long-term runoff similarly to a previous single Earth system model analysis (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EF (latent heat flux divided by the total energy input) and its associated quantity, the Bowen ratio (sensible heat flux divided by latent heat flux), measure the surface energy partitioning toward ET and its impact on the overlying atmosphere (32, 33), and reflects ecosystem stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While changes in EF are constrained by ET, they are impacted by the energy cycle changes as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the radiative flux and EF changes impact the global changes in evaporation and precipitation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ET equals EF times the radiative flux, the responses of ET and EF are related but distinct, especially in regions where radiative changes are large, such as in cold regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear combination of radiative and physiological effects very well explains the spatial patterns of EF in CTRL (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiative (Fig 2H and SI Appendix, Fig S7D) and physiological effects (Fig 2I and SI Appendix, Fig S7D) show strong and opposite control on EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiative effects increase EF (34), except in the Mediterranean, Central America, West Africa, and around the Amazon delta (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2H and 3C and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4G and S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, physiological effects have a large negative impact on EF (Fig 2I and SI Appendix, Fig S7D) in most regions (79% of the globe, SI Appendix, Fig S7D) and especially in tropical regions (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S4I), as decreases in transpiration due to stomatal closure under rising [CO2] are not compensated by saved soil moisture resources (17, 35) or increased LAI, which is already very high in tropical regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Alaska, Siberia, Australia, and the horn of Africa, the physiological-induced decrease of EF indicates increased partitioning toward sensible heating compared with ET and thus increased temperature through landatmosphere feedback (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore critical to correctly represent physiological effects in models to estimate future landatmosphere interactions and extremes (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S4H) is a major driver of EF changes in Europe, Australia, in the Great Plains, and some of Central and South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the northern west coast of South America, EF decreases significantly, while ET tends to increase because of increased radiative effect (Fig 2 A, B, and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Northern latitudes regions like Québec or central northern Russia, EF increases slightly but ET increases much more because of the additional radiative heating (Fig 2 A, B, and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall though, physiology accounts for the majority (almost two-thirds) of the EF changes (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growing season soil moisture at 2-m depth (SM2m) (Materials and Methods) changes almost everywhere but the sign and magnitude of the response varies widely across the globe (Fig 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SM2m is influenced by changes in seasonality imposed by changes in phenology and LAI (SI Appendix, Fig S6C) (17, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the soil moisture decrease (Fig 2J) is due to radiative effects (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2K and 3D and SI Appendix, Fig S4J), whereas physiological effects tend to increase SM2m (Fig 2L), especially in equatorial Africa, South America, South Asia, and Indonesia (Fig 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture does not homogeneously change over the whole soil column, consistent with recent findings (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture changes are often thought to be driven by changes in P, but this is confirmed only over a very small fraction of the globe (Fig 3D and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4K and S7E), and, overall, soil moisture changes have no unique global driver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large fractions of the globe are impacted by radiative changes, including the Amazon and most of western Europe (Fig 3D and SI Appendix, Fig S4J), where precipitation also declines (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetation and landatmosphere interactions are the main drivers of soil moisture changes in regions including South America, eastern United States, Southeast Asia, and some places in central Africa (SI Appendix, Fig S9O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, soil moisture variations are strongly nonlinear so that a linear decomposition does not explain all of the features observed (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3 and S6E), emphasizing that predicting soil moisture is more complicated than other stress indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The control of precipitation on the future terrestrial water cycle is weak in general and represents the dominant control for only a small fraction of the Earth, consistent with recent remote sensing observations showing stronger vegetation response to atmospheric aridity compared with precipitation (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, precipitation trends are only a minor factor for biomass growth (as measured by LAI, SI Appendix, Fig S6 AC) and energy partitioning (as indicated by EF, Fig 2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the response over the Amazon basin is heavily influenced by net radiation changes rather than by physiological or precipitation effects (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In energy-limited ecosystems such as the Amazon, changes in radiation will become one of the primary drivers of transpiration and ecosystem functioning (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our conclusions are not strongly affected by additional land-use and land-cover changes or the addition of aerosols, as present in the RCP 8.5 simulations, which overall behave similarly to the simplified 1% yearly increase CO2 experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture appears to be the most complex and nonlinear variable and is also affected by uncertain land-use and land-cover change and vegetation response (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study illustrates how deeply the physiological effects due to increasing atmospheric [CO2] impact the continental water cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to previous wisdom, changes in precipitation and radiation do not play the primary role in future drying and moistening in most regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, biosphere physiological effects and related biosphereatmosphere interactions (42) are key for predicting future continental water stress as represented by ET, long-term runoff, EF, or leaf area index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, vegetation water stress largely regulates land carbon uptake (43), further emphasizing how tightly the future carbon and water cycles are coupled so that they cannot be evaluated in isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used outputs from six Earth system models (ESM) from the idealized single-forcing CMIP5 (25) experiments with [CO2] increasing either in the atmospheric model only, in the vegetation model only, or in both, at a rate of 1% per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined vegetation and atmospheric model [CO2] increase is called CTRL (1pctCO2 in CMIP5 terminology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We call PHYS the vegetation model [CO2] increase with no atmospheric model increase (esmFixClim1 in the CMIP5 terminology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We call ATMO the converse simulations, with atmospheric and no vegetation [CO2] increase (esmFdbk1 in CMIP5 terminology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three runs are replicas of the same experiment, in which the [CO2] is increased for 140 y by 1% each year starting from preindustrial [CO2] levels in 1850 (except for HadGEM2-ES which starts in 1860).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data are available for six models: bcc-csm1-1, CanESM2, CESM1-BGC, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and NorESM1-ME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most of the models only one ensemble member is available for those experiments (r1i1p1 in the CMIP5 terminology), so we consider only one ensemble member per model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sum of ATMO and PHYS is very close to CTRL (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3), indicating that the runs are indeed independent, and justifies this linear decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for example, rare and extreme events caused by increased warming do not significantly impact PHYS effects on the future mean state in these simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture, which shows more nonlinearities, is an exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also emphasize that because of slight differences in each ensemble member initial condition, one should not expect to obtain a perfect match between the combined ATMO + PHYS and CTRL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, regional variations should be expected and due to the internal climate variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These idealized runs differ from the more typical CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, an emission scenario from 2005 to 2100 that includes prescribed changes in land-use and land-cover scenarios, as well as aerosol and ozone forcing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the [CO2] increase is different between RCP 8.5 (ending at 936 ppm in 2100) and the 1% per year runs (ending at 1,145 ppm after 140 y of simulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison with the idealized 1% runs, we combined RCP 8.5 with the data from historical runs simulating the period 18502005 (historical in CMIP5 terminology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting data for 18502100 are shown in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3, and are comparable in terms of geographical features to the 1% simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis is based on monthly averaged outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider one value of a given water stress indicator for each year, and suggest the use of the most relevant period of the year for each variable and localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It makes more sense to use annual average for precipitation and ET, and P-ET to obtain the total water fluxesas ET is very small in cold winter regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also use the annual average for the net radiation and LAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, summer is the dominant growing season whether in tropics, midlatitudes, or high latitudes, but not around the equator, and so plant soil moisture stress is more present and relevant in summer than at other times of year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we use the summertime mean (i.e., June, July, and August for latitudes between [10; 90] and December, January, and February for latitudes between [90; 15]) for EF, VPD, and soil moisture, three variables that indicate a stress, except around the equator (latitudes between [15; 10]) where, in the Congo for instance, there are two dry/wet seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around the equator, selecting only one season would thus lead to a subjective assessment of dryness, as there is minimal dryness in the wet seasons, and ultimately the annual signal is dominated by the dry seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The [15; 10] latitude range was chosen so that the transition with the local summer averaging zones looks smooth, and so that the equatorial range stays as small as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We regrid each model to a common 1° × 1° grid to later compute the intermodel average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change of a variable X is normalized before the intermodel averaging by the interannual variability and is calculated according to the following formula: X=Xfut¯Xhist¯/(Xhist)CTRL, where Xfut¯ is the mean of X over years 89118 of the runs CTRL, PHYS and ATMO (respectively, 20702099 for RCP 8.5), Xhist¯ is the mean of X over years 120 (respectively, 19391968), and (Xhist)CTRL is the SD of X over the same period of the run CTRL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have chosen the averaging periods so that the mean CO2 concentrations in all four sets of runs are similar (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compute the standardized change X intermodel average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9 show for all of the variables presented in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 the change in ATMO and PHYS relative to CTRL: RUN/CTRL=[Xfut¯Xhist¯]RUN/[Xfut¯Xhist¯]CTRL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Net radiation is computed using the net downward minus upward longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EF is defined as the monthly ratio of the latent heat flux to the sum of the latent and the sensible heat fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VPD is computed from the relative humidity and the saturation vapor pressure, calculated from the monthly averaged temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture at 2 m and at 30 cm are interpolated using the model soil moisture profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the number of layers varies across models, we first linearly interpolate the profiles of each model and each annual data point (e.g., after the seasonal averaging), extract the value at 2-m depth and 30-cm depth, and then apply the same routine as for the other variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Fig S11 shows the number of models that agree with the sign of the X intermodel average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the soil moisture intermodel average change shows wide areas of mismatch with individual model change sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We decompose changes in each water stress variable X (P-ET, LAI, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into three terms (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S4): the change due to the effect of Rn, the change due to the effect of P, and the change due to the effect of the physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes due to Rn are not differentiated from correlated changes in air temperature and VPD, as they are too collinear to yield unique linear decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This translates into the following equation [1] decomposing changes in water cycle variables, due to Rn and precipitation changes in ATMO and physiological changes in PHYS (and related changes in atmospheric VPD and Rn through landatmosphere interactions, as seen in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2):X={[XRn.Rn]ATMO+[XP.P]ATMO+[Decompositionerror]ATMO}+[X]PHYS+[DecompositionerrorintoATMO&PHYS].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First we regrid X to 1 × 1° and temporally (annually except for the soil moisture at 2 m) average it as for Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we apply a multiple linear regression of the variable X of ATMO with respect to the drivers P or Rn, over the 140 y of the six models data of X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence we regress against 140 × 6 values for each grid point and each variable X, P, Rn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those decomposed PHYS and ATMO runs help us uniquely define the sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with CTRL where all variables are evolving jointly in response to both surface physiological and radiative changes so that a uniquely defined decomposition is nearly impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decomposition error terms are reported in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3; the fraction of variance explained by the multiple linear regression (R2) is in coherence with the fact that LAI and EF are dominated by physiological effects (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S6D), but large for P-ET (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A linear regression on net radiation and precipitation cannot account for all of the variance explained, as we did not include other modified variables such as temperature, relative humidity, or wind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the very strong correlation (nearly 1) of temperature with net radiation, a unique linear decomposition cannot be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other terms (relative humidity, wind, and nonlinearities), as well as nonlinearities and ensemble variations, explain the nonunity R2 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in most regions R2 is very high, emphasizing that precipitation and net radiation (and related temperature changes) are the primary drivers of the change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the CO2 physiological runs, precipitation changes as well as mean temperature changes are small (Fig 1), so that it is fair to ignore precipitation influence on the changes due to physiological effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It should also be noted that PHYS and ATMO are strictly independent and cannot have cross-correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decomposition of CTRL into ATMO and PHYS is not perfect but works well, as shown in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the linearization in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 in the independent PHYS and ATMO runs is further compared with the full nonlinear response of the CTRL runs in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATMO and PHYS contribute quite independently and linearly to CTRL (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if we use the decomposition of ATMO changes along the precipitation and the net radiation (as in Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S4) to reconstruct an equivalent to CTRL, the result is satisfactory except for EF at northern latitudes and in eastern Africa (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3), and especially for the soil moisture (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3), indicating nonlinearities, consistent with an overall low R2 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further emphasizes the difficulty to predict the change in soil moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We end up with a triplet (R, G, B) with R, G, and B in [0; 1] for each pixel defined as the absolute normalized sensitivity to net radiation, physiology, and precipitation changes, respectively:R=|[XRn.Rn]ATMO||[XRn.Rn]ATMO|+|[XP.P]ATMO|+|[X]PHYS|,[2]G=|[X]PHYS||[XRn.Rn]ATMO|+|[XP.P]ATMO|+|[X]PHYS|,[3]B=|[XP.P]ATMO||[XRn.Rn]ATMO|+|[XP.P]ATMO|+|[X]PHYS|..[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The triplet (R, G, B) is used to color the pixel with the combination of (red, green, blue) in Fig 3, as an indicator of absolute net radiation, physiology, and precipitation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On all plots we discard pixels where LAI is below 0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 reports also pie charts of global averages of R, G, and B values, weighted by the total effect including error terms, reported in these pie charts as a dashed gray area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
