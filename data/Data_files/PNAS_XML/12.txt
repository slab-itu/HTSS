Protein tyrosine phosphatase SAP-1 protects against colitis through regulation of CEACAM20 in the intestinal epithelium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Much attention has been recently paid to the role of intestinal epithelial cells in the homeostatic regulation of intestinal immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that ablation of stomach-cancerassociated protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SAP-1) markedly increased the severity of colitis in interleukin (IL)-10deficient mice, suggesting that SAP-1 protects against colitis in a cooperative manner with IL-10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identify carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 20, an intestinal microvilli-specific membrane protein, as a dephosphorylation target for SAP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 promotes the binding of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), thereby inducing production of chemokines such as IL-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose a mechanism by SAP-1 and CEACAM20 in the intestinal epithelium for regulation of the intestinal immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intestinal epithelial cells contribute to regulation of intestinal immunity in mammals, but the detailed molecular mechanisms of such regulation have remained largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomach-cancerassociated protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SAP-1, also known as PTPRH) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that is localized specifically at microvilli of the brush border in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that SAP-1 ablation in interleukin (IL)-10deficient mice, a model of inflammatory bowel disease, resulted in a marked increase in the severity of colitis in association with up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosine phosphorylation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 20, an intestinal microvillus-specific transmembrane protein of the Ig superfamily, was greatly increased in the intestinal epithelium of the SAP-1deficient animals, suggesting that this protein is a substrate for SAP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 by the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src and the consequent association of CEACAM20 with spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) promoted the production of IL-8 in cultured cells through the activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a complex through interaction of their ectodomains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAP-1 and CEACAM20 thus constitute a regulatory system through which the intestinal epithelium contributes to intestinal immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Impact_of_SAP-1_Ablation_on_Development_of_Colitis_in_IL-10Deficient_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SAP-1 was previously shown to be localized specifically to microvilli of the brush border in epithelial cells of the small intestine and stomach of mice (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistofluorescence analysis showed that SAP-1 is also localized at the apical surface of colonic epithelial cells in the mouse (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, immunoelectron microscopy revealed prominent SAP-1 staining at the microvilli of epithelial cells in the colon (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, SAP-1 immunoreactivity was virtually undetectable in the colon of SAP-1deficient (Sap1/) mice (Fig 1 A and B), indicating that SAP-1 is indeed expressed in the microvilli of colonic epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only intestinal immune cells but also IECs are thought to contribute to intestinal immunity (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Sap1/ mice up to 20 wk of age did not exhibit any sign of colonic inflammation, as judged on the basis of both clinical manifestations such as bloody stool or weight loss as well as histological examination (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore crossed Sap1/ mice with IL-10deficient (Il10/) mice, a model of human IBD such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis (21, 22) and examined the impact of SAP-1 ablation on the severity of spontaneous colitis in these latter mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first monitored disease activity, which was scored on the basis of stool consistency, blood in the stool, and anorectal prolapse, in Il10/ and Il10/Sap1/ mice at 10, 15, and 20 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease activity in Il10/Sap1/ mice (male and female) at 1020 wk of age was markedly increased compared with that in Il10/ mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the incidence of anorectal prolapse was greatly increased in Il10/Sap1/ mice compared with Il10/ mice (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colon of Il10/Sap1/ mice at 20 wk of age showed signs of severe colitis, including pronounced thickening of the bowel wall, a shortened colonic length, and unformed or absent stools, compared with Il10/, Sap1/, or wild type (WT) mice (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic examination revealed that the thickness of the colonic mucosa in Il10/Sap1/ mice at 20 wk of age was markedly increased compared with that in Il10/ mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, severe epithelial hyperplasia, crypt distortion, crypt abscesses, and microadenoma were apparent in the colon of Il10/Sap1/ mice (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histological score for colonic inflammation was thus significantly greater for Il10/Sap1/ mice than for Il10/ mice (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the survival rate of Il10/Sap1/ mice was substantially reduced compared with that of Il10/ mice (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations thus suggested that SAP-1 ablation results in exacerbation of spontaneous colitis in Il10/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with the extent of colonic inflammation, quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that the amounts of mRNAs for proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), IL-6, IL-1, and IL-12 were markedly increased in the colonic mucosa of Il10/Sap1/ mice at 10 wk of age compared with those in Il10/, Sap1/, or WT mice (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of mRNAs for interferon  (IFN-) and IL-17, both of which are implicated in development of colitis in IL-10deficient mice (22, 23), was also increased in the colonic mucosa of Il10/Sap1/ mice (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the amounts of mRNAs for the T helper 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 were decreased in the double-mutant animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of chemokine genes such as those for KC and MIP-2 in the colonic mucosa was greatly up-regulated in Il10/Sap1/ mice compared with the other three strains (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results thus further suggested that SAP-1, together with IL-10, protects against the development of colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commensal bacteria are implicated in the development of colitis in IL-10deficient mice (21, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore next examined the role of commensal bacteria in the exacerbation of colitis in Il10/Sap1/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were given a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics in drinking water beginning at 4 wk of age to deplete commensal bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such depletion largely prevented the development of colitis in both Il10/Sap1/ and Il10/ mice at 1020 wk of age, with scores for disease activity in the two strains being similar (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that commensal bacteria are important for the increase in the severity of spontaneous colitis induced by SAP-1 ablation in Il10/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Carcinoembryonic_Antigen-Related_Cell_Adhesion_Molecule_(CEACAM)_20_as_a_Tyrosine-Phosphorylated_Protein_in_the_Intestinal_Epithelium_of_SAP-1Deficient_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further investigated the molecular mechanism by which ablation of SAP-1 exacerbates colitis in Il10/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAP-1 was previously shown to inhibit the proliferation of cultured cells (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cell turnover, morphology of intercellular junctions, and paracellular permeability in the colonic epithelium did not differ between WT and Sap1/ mice (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the number of goblet cells or Paneth cells, which are thought to protect against colitis by secreting mucus or antimicrobial peptides, respectively, in the intestinal epithelium did not differ between the two strains (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, immunohistofluorescence analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine revealed that staining was markedly increased along the apical surface of colonic epithelial cells in Sap1/ mice compared with WT mice (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, immunoblot analysis of isolated microvillus membranes from the small intestine with the same antibodies showed that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (molecular sizes of 40 to 110 kDa) were increased in Sap1/ mice (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were affinity purified from the solubilized microvillus membrane fraction of Sap1/ mice with the use of agarose beads conjugated with the antibodies to phosphotyrosine and were then visualized by silver staining of SDS/PAGE gels (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bands corresponding to 100-, 60-, and 40-kDa proteins were excised, enzymatically digested, and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several peptide fractions were obtained for each protein band, and the molecular size of these peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the determined molecular sizes with theoretical peptide masses for proteins registered in the nonredundant database in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBInr) indicated that the 100-kDa protein band contained CEACAM20 and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the 60-kDa protein band contained several Src family kinase SFKs (Lyn, c-Yes, Lck, c-Src, and c-Fgr) as well as the SFK-related protein Frk (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the basis of its cDNA sequence, CEACAM20 is predicted to be a transmembrane protein that possesses four Ig-like domains in its extracellular region as well as four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic region, with the two COOH-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr559 and Tyr570) and their surrounding sequence corresponding well to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (25) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to mouse CEACAM20 showed that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was indeed increased in the microvillus membrane fraction of Sap1/ mice compared with that apparent for WT mice (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results thus suggested that CEACAM20 is a substrate for the PTP activity of SAP-1 in the intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the phosphorylation of Tyr416 of c-Src (26) as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of other SFKs in microvillus membranes did not differ substantially between Sap1/ and WT mice (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps8 was also increased in microvillus membranes of Sap1/ mice compared with that apparent for WT mice (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that the abundance of Ceacam20 mRNA, like that of Sap1 mRNA, was previously found to be highest in the intestine (18, 25), whereas Eps8 is expressed ubiquitously (27), we pursued the further characterization of CEACAM20 as a potential substrate for SAP-1 in the intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Colocalization_of_CEACAM20_and_SAP-1_in_the_Intestinal_Epithelium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the localization and function of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot analysis of various mouse tissues showed that the abundance of CEACAM20 was highest in the small intestine and colon, being minimal or low in other tissues (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression pattern of CEACAM20 is essentially identical to that of SAP-1 (Fig 4A) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistofluorescence analysis revealed that staining for CEACAM20 was localized at the apical surface of the colon and largely overlapped with that of SAP-1 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoreactivity for CEACAM20 was detected immediately above prominent staining for F-actin, likely corresponding to the terminal web (2), at the brush border of colonic epithelial cells (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results thus indicated that CEACAM20 is expressed specifically in microvilli of colonic epithelial cells, where it colocalizes with SAP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coexpression of SAP-1 and Myc epitope-tagged CEACAM20 in HEK293A cells also revealed that the two proteins coimmunoprecipitated with each other (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such complex formation was also apparent when mutant versions of either or both proteins that lack the cytoplasmic region were coexpressed (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the association of SAP-1 with CEACAM1, another CEACAM family member expressed in colonic epithelial cells (28), was not detected in HEK293A cells overexpressing these two proteins (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that SAP-1 specifically interacts with CEACAM20 and that this interaction is mediated via the ectodomains of both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tyrosine_Phosphorylation_of_CEACAM20_by_SFKs_and_Its_Association_with_Spleen_Tyrosine_Kinase_(Syk)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that CEACAM20 was identified as a potential substrate for SAP-1 and was found to colocalize with SAP-1 in colonic epithelial cells, we further investigated the properties of this protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the presence of putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic region (Fig 3C), we found that forced expression of CEACAM20 tagged with the Myc epitope in HEK293A cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the overexpressed protein and that such phosphorylation was prevented by treatment of the cells with PP2, an inhibitor of SFKs, but not by that with PP3, an inactive PP2 analog (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, coexpression of c-Src or an activated form of the tyrosine kinase Fyn together with CEACAM20 in HEK293A cells markedly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter protein (Fig 5 B and C), suggesting that SFKs play a role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of SAP-1, but not that of its catalytically inactive mutants SAP-1(C/S) or SAP-1(D/A), reduced the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 in transfected cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 in vitro with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of SAP-1 [GSTSAP-1(WT)], but not that with GSTSAP-1(C/S), resulted in its efficient dephosphorylation (Fig S6), further suggesting that CEACAM20 is likely a substrate for SAP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ITAM of CEACAM20 contains Y559EKL and Y570CKI sequences (Fig 3C), which correspond well to sequences previously shown to serve when phosphorylated as a binding site for the SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk or SFKs (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, coexpression of CEACAM20 and Syk in HEK293A cells resulted in the association of the two proteins as well as in a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, whereas a mutant of CEACAM20 [CEACAM20(2YF)] in which Tyr559 and Tyr570 are replaced with Phe failed to form a complex with Syk (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A GST fusion protein containing the two SH2 domains of Syk also bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20(WT) but not to CEACAM20(2YF) in vitro (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 failed to bind to c-Src or Fyn as well as to the SFK-related protein Frk (Fig S7 BD), the latter of which is highly expressed in the intestine (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, coexpression of Syk with CEACAM20(WT) [but not that with CEACAM20(2YF)] resulted in an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter protein (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data thus suggested that tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 specifically binds to the SH2 domains of Syk and thereby activates this kinase, which in turn mediates the further tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistofluorescence analysis showed that Syk was indeed present in the cytoplasm of colonic epithelial cells (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CEACAM20_Promotes_Chemokine_Production_Through_Activation_of_Nuclear_Factor-B_(NF-B)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IECs contribute to the regulation of intestinal immunity by producing chemokines such as IL-8, KC, and MIP-2 that promote inflammatory infiltration, in particular that of neutrophils (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined whether CEACAM20 together with c-Src and Syk might promote chemokine production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of CEACAM20 with c-Src in HEK293A cells (which express endogenous Syk) (Fig 5 E and F) resulted in a significant increase in IL-8 production compared with that observed in cells expressing either protein alone (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect of CEACAM20 and c-Src was further enhanced by coexpression of Syk (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, forced expression of CEACAM20(2YF) together with c-Src and Syk had no effect on IL-8 production (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, coexpression of SAP-1 markedly attenuated the increase in IL-8 production induced by expression of CEACAM20 and c-Src (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 and its association with Syk in the presence of c-Src promote IL-8 production, whereas SAP-1 counteracts this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of NF-B and MAPKs downstream of Syk is thought to be important for production of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines including IL-8 (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, treatment of HEK293A cells with the NF-B inhibitors JSH-23 or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), or with PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), markedly attenuated the increase in IL-8 production induced by CEACAM20 plus c-Src and Syk (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, treatment with SB203580 or SP600125, inhibitors of the MAPKs p38 MAPK and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively, had only a small or no inhibitory effect on such IL-8 production (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, forced expression of CEACAM20(WT) [but not that of CEACAM20(2YF)] together with c-Src and Syk increased the expression of a luciferase reporter gene placed under the transcriptional control of NF-B response elements (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that activation of NF-B is important for promotion of IL-8 production by CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 and its association with Syk likely promote IL-8 production in cultured cells, we examined whether the expression of KC or MIP-2 occurs in the colonic epithelial cells of Il10/ or Il10/Sap1/ mice before the apparent onset of colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of mRNAs for KC and MIP-2 in colonic epithelial cells isolated from the double-mutant mice at 68 wk of age (when the disease activity score was 02) were about four and six times, respectively, those in cells isolated from Il10/ mice (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the amount of mRNA for TNF- in the cells from Il10/Sap1/ mice was increased only twofold relative to that for Il10/ mice, whereas the abundance of mRNA for IL-6 did not differ substantially between the two strains (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results thus suggested that the expression of MIP-2 and KC tends to be increased in the intestinal epithelium of Il10/Sap1/ mice before the development of colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sap1/ mice were generated as described previously (18) and were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for four generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Il10/ mice (B6.129P2-Il10tm1Cgn/J) on the C57BL/6 background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and crossed with Sap1/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Il10+/Sap1+/ offspring were crossed to generate Il10/Sap1/ and Il10/ mice for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT, Sap1/, Il10/, and Il10/Sap1/ mice were maintained at the Institute of Experimental Animal Research of Kobe University or Gunma University under specific pathogen-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of Kobe University or Gunma University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Depletion_of_Gut_Commensal_Bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gut commensal bacteria in Il10/ and Il10/Sap1/ mice were depleted as previously described (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four-week-old mice were treated with ampicillin (1 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich), neomycin sulfate (1 g/L; Nacalai Tesque), metronidazole (1 g/L; Wako), and vancomycin (500 mg/L; Wako) added to drinking water until analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Rabbit_pAbs_to_CEACAM20  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic region of mouse CEACAM20 (amino acids 485577) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The encoded GST fusion protein (GSTCC20-cyto) and GST were then prepared as described previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbits were injected with GSTCC20-cyto, and the resulting pAbs to CEACAM20 were purified from serum with the use of columns containing GST or GSTCC20-cyto immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), as described previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histological_and_Immunofluorescence_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For histological analysis, the colon was removed from mice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 3 m, and the sections were stained with Mayers H&E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunofluorescence analysis, the colon or ileum was fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, transferred to a series of sucrose solutions [7%, 20%, and 30% (wt/vol), sequentially] in PBS, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura), and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sections with a thickness of 5 m were prepared with a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, and autoclaved in Retrievagen A (pH 6.0) (BD Biosciences) at 110 °C for 10 min for antigen retrieval (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were then exposed sequentially to primary antibodies and labeled secondary antibodies as described previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence images were acquired with a BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus) or an LSM Pascal (Carl Zeiss) or FV1000 (Olympus) confocal laser-scanning microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, mice were anesthetized by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg) and then perfused transcardially with 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 2.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were removed, immersed in the same fixative for 1 h at 4 °C, and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then dehydrated and embedded in Epon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunoelectron microscopy, tissue samples were fixed by immersion for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sections with a thickness of 10 m were then prepared and processed for immunostaining with mAbs to SAP-1 and with Fab fragments of goat pAbs to rat IgG that were labeled with 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals were enhanced with the use of an HQ Silver Enhancement Kit (Nanoprobes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were fixed again with 1% OsO4 and 0.1% potassium ferrocyanide and finally embedded in Epon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were prepared, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEM 1010 electron microscope (JEOL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clinical_and_Histological_Assessment_of_Colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were monitored weekly for stool consistency, stool blood, and anorectal prolapse, and disease activity was scored as described previously (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stool consistency was scored as follows: 0 = normal, 2 = loose stools, or 4 = liquid stools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood in the stool was scored as: 0 = no blood as revealed with the use of the guaiac occult blood test (Occult Blood Shionogi II; Shionogi), 2 = positive occult blood test, and 4 = gross bleeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of anorectal prolapse was scored as: 0 = no prolapse, 2 = prolapse evident only during defecation, and 4 = prolapse evident at all times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total score for diarrhea, blood in the stool, and prolapse, ranging from 0 (normal) to 12 (severe), was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scoring of colonic inflammation by histological examination, the entire colon was excised and divided into four segments consisting of proximal, mid, or distal colon and rectum, which were then immediately fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin-embedded sections (3 m) were stained with Mayers H&E, and a combined score for inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue damage, and crypt structure was determined in a blinded manner as described previously (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory cell infiltration was scored as follows: 0 = presence of occasional inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, 1 = presence of an increased number of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, 2 = confluence of inflammatory cells extending into the submucosa, 3 = transmural extension of the infiltrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue damage was scored as: 0 = no mucosal damage, 1 = lymphoepithelial lesions, 2 = surface mucosal erosion, and 3 = extensive mucosal damage and extension into deeper structures of the colonic wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crypt structure was scored as: 0 = normal structure, 1 = occasional hyperplasia without depletion of goblet cells, 2 = hyperplasia with depletion of goblet cells, and 3 = distortion of crypts and the presence of crypt abscesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each segment of the colon was given a score based on the three criteria, ranging from 0 (no change) to 9 (severe), and the total score was calculated as the average of the scores from each segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_Mouse_IECs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse IECs were isolated as described previously (43), with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, either the ileum or the entire colon was washed with PBS and minced into small pieces, and the minced tissue was washed three times with PBS containing 1 mM DTT and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in HBSS containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were vigorously shaken to detach IECs, which were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min after removal of tissue debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have here shown that ablation of SAP-1, a microvillus-specific PTP, exacerbated spontaneous colitis in association with up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon of Il10/ mice, whereas Sap1/ mice did not manifest any sign of colonic inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-10 is thought to suppress the functions of various immune cells in the intestine, thereby protecting against colitis (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of IL-10 in mice thus results in colonic inflammation that resembles IBD in humans (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of commensal bacteria with antibiotics also attenuates the severity of colitis in Il10/ mice (21, 24), suggesting the importance of such bacteria in this colitis model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that antibiotic treatment also prevented the exacerbation of colitis induced by SAP-1 ablation in Il10/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus suggest that SAP-1, in cooperation with IL-10, contributes to protection against the development of colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also investigated the molecular mechanism by which SAP-1 regulates intestinal immunity and by which ablation of SAP-1 exacerbates colitis in Il10/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20, which is specifically expressed in IECs, was markedly increased in Sap1/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 was efficiently dephosphorylated by SAP-1 in vitro as well as in cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the expression pattern and localization of CEACAM20 overlapped with those of SAP-1, with both proteins being localized at microvilli of the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a complex through interaction of their ectodomains in cultured cells, suggesting that both proteins physically associate with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations suggest that CEACAM20 is a physiological substrate for SAP-1 in the intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that we found that SAP-1 regulates intestinal immunity through dephosphorylation of CEACAM20, we also investigated the function as well as signaling downstream of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that c-Src promotes the phosphorylation of Tyr559 or Tyr570 in the COOH-terminal region of CEACAM20 and that Syk then binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 through its SH2 domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such binding to CEACAM20 likely results in the activation of Syk and promotes further tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we showed that formation of the CEACAM20Syk complex promoted the production of IL-8, likely as a result of the activation of NF-B, in cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, forced expression of SAP-1 markedly attenuated the increase in IL-8 production induced by expression of CEACAM20 and c-Src, suggesting that SAP-1 counteracts the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 on IL-8 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also found that forced expression of CEACAM20 together with c-Src and Syk induces the production of IL-6 in HEK293A cells (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CEACAM20 thus likely promotes inflammatory conditions in the intestine through its formation of a complex with Syk and the consequent production of chemokines and cytokines in IECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal mucosa is fundamental to the development and progression of IBD (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemokine IL-8 is thought to play a major role in the neutrophil infiltration that is frequently associated with colitis lesions in individuals with IBD (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2), a receptor for the IL-8 homologs MIP-2 and KC, manifest a reduced susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, another animal model of IBD (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, transgenic mice that overexpress MIP-2 specifically in the intestinal epithelium manifest exaggeration of such colitis (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of mRNAs for MIP-2 and KC tended to increase in the intestinal epithelium of Il10/Sap1/ mice before the development of colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tyrosine-phosphorylation of CEACAM20 thus likely contributes at least in part to the development of colitis in Il10/Sap1/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the ectodomain of SAP-1 interacts with that of CEACAM20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that both proteins are localized at microvilli of IECs, theyand in particular CEACAM20might also interact with commensal bacteria in the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the Ig-like ectodomain of another CEACAM family member, CEACAM3, which also contains an ITAM-like motif in its cytoplasmic domain, recognizes bacteria that express the Opa protein and thereby triggers phagocytosis and elimination of the bacteria by granulocytes (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, which are expressed in human IECs, have been shown to function as a receptor for Escherichia coli isolated from the intestine of healthy individuals or IBD patients (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, commensal or pathogenic bacteria might contribute to the regulation of CEACAM20 function by interacting with the ectodomain of this protein at the microvilli of IECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we propose a model for regulation of intestinal immunity by SAP-1 and CEACAM20 (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study will be required to elucidate whether mutations of the genes for SAP-1 or CEACAM20 are associated with IBD in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these molecules are potential drug targets for the treatment of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
