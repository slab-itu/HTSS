Volatile biomarkers of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infection in humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria elimination efforts are hindered by the prevalence of asymptomatic infections, which frequently go undetected and untreated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is a pressing need for improved diagnostic screening methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on extensive collections of skin odors from human populations in Kenya, we report broad and consistent effects of malaria infection on human volatile emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that predictive models based on machine learning algorithms reliably determined infection status based on volatile biomarkers and, critically, identified asymptomatic infections with 100% sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that volatile biomarkers have significant potential for the development of robust, noninvasive screening methods for detecting symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections under field conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria remains among the worlds deadliest diseases, and control efforts depend critically on the availability of effective diagnostic tools, particularly for the identification of asymptomatic infections, which play a key role in disease persistence and may account for most instances of transmission but often evade detection by current screening methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research on humans and in animal models has shown that infection by malaria parasites elicits changes in host odors that influence vector attraction, suggesting that such changes might yield robust biomarkers of infection status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present findings based on extensive collections of skin volatiles from human populations with high rates of malaria infection in Kenya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report broad and consistent effects of malaria infection on human volatile profiles, as well as significant divergence in the effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, predictive models based on machine learning algorithms reliably determined infection status based on volatile biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, our models identified asymptomatic infections with 100% sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by microscopy, far exceeding the performance of currently available rapid diagnostic tests in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified a set of individual compounds that emerged as consistently important predictors of infection status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that volatile biomarkers may have significant potential for the development of a robust, noninvasive screening method for detecting malaria infections under field conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Collection_and_Determination_of_Malaria_Infection_Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Between 2013 and 2016, we collected samples of skin volatiles from more than 400 primary-school children (aged 12 y) at 41 schools across 21 localities within the Mbita area of western Kenya (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before sample collection, children were interviewed (using a standardized questionnaire) to assess medical history and current symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood samples were then obtained from each participant, and skin volatiles were collected, separately but simultaneously, from one foot and one arm (at the elbow) for 1 h, using a portable push/pull volatile collection system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blood samples were used for initial assessment of infection status via an SD Bioline Rapid Diagnostic Test (which detects malaria specific antibodies) and parasite detection by light microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children who tested positive were treated with artemether/lumefantrine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these diagnostic methods are imprecisemicroscopy has a detection limit threshold, while RDTs have variable accuracy depending on malaria species and frequently yield false-positive results (11)infection status was later definitively confirmed via PCR-based methods, which detect the presence of Plasmodium parasites with high sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Additional details are provided in Methods and SI Appendix.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these analyses and symptoms reported in the initial interview, subjects were classified as malaria uninfected (U), malaria symptomatic (S), or malaria infected but asymptomatic (AS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were included in our initial analyses only if both PCR and microscopy were negative (for U subjects) or positive (for S and AS subjects), yielding a total of 330 participants with unambiguous classifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because this conservative approach excludes subjects harboring malaria infections who test negative via microscopy due to low parasite numbersand because such individuals are important from a diagnostic perspectivewe included 66 individuals who were positive by PCR but negative by microscopy in some subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to these subjects as submicroscopic symptomatic (S[SUB]) or submicroscopic asymptomatic (AS[SUB]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Volatile_Profiles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volatile samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only compounds that exceeded a minimum concentration threshold in 75% of the samples for at least one category of infection status (U, S, or AS) were included in our subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting data were explored using machine learning techniques (discussed below) to identify predictors of infection status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In subsequent discussion, the overall dataset is treated as two independent subsets, Kenya 1 (K1) and Kenya 2 (K2), due to differences in the chemical analyses used (owing to a change of institution by the lead investigator during the study and the resulting availability of more sensitive analytical equipment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K1 comprises 95 U, 99 S, and 34 AS individuals, and K2 comprises 39 U, 35 S, and 28 AS individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volatile profiles for the additional 66 individuals classified as malaria-negative by microscopy but as malaria-positive by PCR (52 S[SUB] and 14 AS[SUB]) were analyzed by the methods used for K2 but are presented separately below except where noted otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the chemical analytical techniques used for K2 allowed for much higher-quality analyses (due to an approximate 25-fold increase in sensitivity, as well as improved compound separation), our analyses focus primarily on this subset of the data; however, we discuss similarities and differences between the two datasets where appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, there is broad agreement in the overall patterns revealed by the two datasets, even though they were derived from separate sets of samples that were analyzed on different equipment at different locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Volatile_Profiles_and_Infection_Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial investigation of the data via discriminant analysis of principal components (23) (DAPC) revealed separation between the volatile profiles of malaria-infected individuals (including both S and AS subjects) and uninfected individuals for both foot and arm (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This separation was apparent for both K1 and K2 but was more pronounced for K2, likely reflecting the improved quality of the chemical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating symptom status in our analyses also revealed separation between the volatile profiles of S and AS individuals, as well as between each of these groups and U individuals (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, this pattern was also apparent but less pronounced for K1 (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed similar separation of the volatile profiles of S[SUB] and AS[SUB] individuals from U individuals (Fig 3), suggesting that even submicroscopic malaria infections generate a volatile signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The divergent effects of S and AS infections on volatile emissions were also apparent when comparing changes in the levels of individual compounds relative to those observed for U individuals (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the effects of infection status on individual compounds tended to be similar in arm and foot samples (Pearsons r = 0.8 for asymptomatic vs. uninfected and 0.61 for symptomatic vs. uninfected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission levels of most compounds were reduced in S individuals, with several compounds showing strong suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effects on the emissions of AS individuals were more mixed, with some compounds elevated and others suppressed relative to the levels observed for U individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the strongest suppression was observed for compounds in S individuals and the strongest up-regulation was seen for compounds in AS individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overall pattern is consistent with our previous observation that volatile emissions were suppressed during the acute phase of infection by the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudii in a mouse model (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predictive_Models_of_Infection_Status  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the volatile signatures associated with each category of infection status, we used machine learning algorithms that develop tree-based ensemble classification models, which aim to identify a minimal set of compounds that correctly classify individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These algorithms were used to train models on 70% of samples from K2, iteratively eliminating the least important compounds (i.e., those making the smallest contribution to accuracy) to obtain a subset resulting in the best model performance, which was then tested on the remaining 30% of samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that adaptive boosting (adaboost) consistently provided the best predictions for our data with respect to the key metrics of sensitivity (i.e., proportion of malaria-positive individuals detected) and accuracy (i.e., proportion of all cases classified correctly).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our focus on identifying diagnostically meaningful biomarkers of infection, our model selection emphasized sensitivity over accuracy (i.e., we are willing to accept a somewhat higher rate of false-positives to maximize the proportion of actual malaria cases correctly identified), and also favored models capable of generating predictions using relatively few compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted, we are also particularly interested in the ability to identify asymptomatic (AS and AS[SUB]) infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the overall similar effects of infection status on arm and foot volatiles, predictive models using foot volatiles exhibited greater sensitivity, particularly for the detection of asymptomatic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model sensitivity and accuracy for several key comparisons, along with the compounds used as predictors, are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models based on foot volatiles identified AS infections with 100% sensitivity and S infections with 91% sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these models also identified submicroscopic S[SUB] and AS[SUB] infections with 100% sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This performance greatly exceeded that of our RDT screening, which failed to identify more than one-third of AS[SUB] infections and approximately one-fourth of S[SUB] infections (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observed differences in the effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections on volatile profiles, we also tested the ability of our algorithms to detect all malaria cases without regard to symptom status and including submicroscopic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here our model was able to predict infection status with 95% sensitivity and 77% accuracy using foot volatile compounds, or with 92% sensitivity and 80% accuracy using arm volatiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the results of our predictive models suggest the presence of volatile signatures that can reliably predict malaria infection status and, critically, identify AS malaria infections with high sensitivity, even in the case of incipient or otherwise low-level infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selected_Key_Compounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chemical identities for all the compounds included in our analyses are presented in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illuminate key compounds with potential diagnostic significance, we focused on those that were consistently found to be important predictors of infection status by our machine learning algorithm (adaboost) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, models based on foot volatiles generally exhibited the best predictive performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For general prediction of malaria infection status (without regard to symptom status), the five most important foot volatiles for model accuracy were compound 17 (4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one), compound 49 (unidentified), compound 31 (unidentified), compound 61 (nonanal), and compound 5 (toluene) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These five compounds also frequently appeared as important predictors across other comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, each was an important predictor for models predicting both AS vs. U and S vs. U on the basis of either foot or arm volatiles (or both) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compound 56 (2-ethylhexan-1-ol) also frequently appeared as an important predictor for both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections and was the top predictor for overall infection status for arm volatiles (Table 1), while compound 20 (ethylbenzene) consistently appeared as an important predictor of submicroscopic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound 14 (ethylcyclohexane) appeared as a predictor in some models and, along with compound 38 (propylcyclohexane), exhibited an interesting pattern in which its emission exhibited relatively strong up-regulation in AS individuals and relatively strong suppression in S individuals (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, compound 9 (hexanal), which also appeared as a predictor in some models, exhibited relatively strong suppression in both S and AS individuals, particularly in foot volatile profiles (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two of the compounds discussed above, toluene and hexanal, are notable in that they have previously been reported to be produced by Plasmodium parasites in vitro (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, hexanal, ethylbenzene, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, and nonanal have previously been shown to elicit electrophysiological responses in mosquitoes (2729) (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously suggested that parasite-induced changes in host odors that have relevance for vector behavior might provide reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis (20), raising the possibility of overlap between compounds that are predictive of infection status and those that influence vector behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A search of the existing literature suggests that mosquito responses have been examined for relatively few of the compounds mentioned above (SI Appendix, Table S3); however, we plan to explore the influence of relevant changes in the emissions of these and other compounds on vector behavior in a future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Origins_and_Emission_Patterns_of_Key_Compounds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although some of the compounds discussed above can occur as environmental contaminants (e.g., toluene, 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one, and 2-ethylhexan-1-ol) (30, 31), all of the identified compounds highlighted here have either been previously reported from human volatile collections or have known mechanisms of natural production from humans or potentially human-associated microbes (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds originating from human-associated microbiota are of significant diagnostic interest, particularly with respect to the identification of volatile biomarkers, and previous work in a mouse model has documented the effects of malaria infection on the microbiome (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, one of the most consistently important predictors in our models, compound 5 (toluene)which may be produced by Clostridium in the human microbiome (34)has previously been explored as a diagnostic biomarker for cancer in humans (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the key compounds discussed above (and highlighted in Table 2) are directly affected by infection status and exclude potential biases (e.g., due to spatiotemporal coincidence of environmental contamination and high rates of infection), we further explored how emission levels of these compounds varied between uninfected and infected individuals across individual sample collection sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear analysis via two-way ANOVA revealed significant variation in compound levels across collection sessions (SI Appendix, Table S5), as expected given that volatile emissions are labile and highly responsive to environmental conditions (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these analyses also revealed a highly significant effect of infection status (S + AS vs. U) for all of our key compounds except compound 61 (nonanal) (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also a significant interaction effect between collection session and infection status (SI Appendix, Table S5), which might be explained if, for example, infection influences the responsiveness of emissions to other environmental influences; however, this interaction effect does not obscure the effects of disease status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses confirm that malaria infection affects the emissions of our key predictors even when accounting for environmental variation across collection sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that malaria infection causes broad and consistent changes in human volatile emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found consistent differences in the effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection on human volatile profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in volatile profiles create a signature of infection that can be used to reliably predict the infection status of human subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, these volatile signatures can identify asymptomatic infections with high sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by microscopya key finding given the pressing need for more effective diagnostic methods capable of detecting asymptomatic carriers of infection (4, 5, 8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our predictive models performed significantly better than RDT, and as well as PCR, in detecting submicroscopic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important to note that this performance was achieved based on the analysis of volatile samples collected under field conditions and despite considerable variation introduced through sampling that took place over 3 y and across a number of different localities, as well as by the presence of multiple Plasmodium species and a high prevalence of mixed parasite infections in our study population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our analyses highlight a number of key compounds that consistently appear as important predictors of infection across our predictive models and thus warrant further exploration as biomarkers with potential for the development of robust, noninvasive volatile-based diagnostics for malaria infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
