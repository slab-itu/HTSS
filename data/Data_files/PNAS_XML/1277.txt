Gravity of human impacts mediates coral reef conservation gains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine reserves that prohibit fishing are a critical tool for sustaining coral reef ecosystems, yet it remains unclear how human impacts in surrounding areas affect the capacity of marine reserves to deliver key conservation benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our global study found that only marine reserves in areas of low human impact consistently sustained top predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish biomass inside marine reserves declined along a gradient of human impacts in surrounding areas; however, reserves located where human impacts are moderate had the greatest difference in fish biomass compared with openly fished areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reserves in low human-impact areas are required for sustaining ecological functions like high-order predation, but reserves in high-impact areas can provide substantial conservation gains in fish biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (gravity), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Drawing on an analogy from Newtons Law of Gravitation, the gravity concept predicts that interactions between two places (e.g., cities) are positively related to their mass (i.e., population) and inversely related to the distance between them (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gravity concept is often considered one of the most successful and long-enduring empirical models in economics and geography (31), but has rarely been directly applied in a natural resource management setting and holds much promise in informing reef conservation and management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of the gravity concept in a reef governance context posits that human interactions with a reef are a function of the population of a place divided by the squared time it takes to travel to the reefs (we used travel time instead of linear distance to account for the differences incurred by traveling over different surfaces, such as water, roads, tracks) (14, 32) (see Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we build upon previous work (14) by developing a new indicator that examines the cumulative human gravity of all populated places within a 500-km radius of a given reef, which aims to capture both market and subsistence pressures on reef fish biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the predictive power of a series of gravity metrics with varying radii (50 km, 250 km, 500 km) and exponents of travel time (travel time, travel time2, travel time3) (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key limitation of our global gravity metric is that we are unable to capture local variations in efficiencies that may affect fishing mortality per capita, such as fishing fleet technology or infrastructure (e.g., road) quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Operationalizing gravity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Applied to coral reefs, our heuristic of the gravity concept captures interactions between people and coral reef fish as a function of the population of a place divided by the squared time it takes to travel to the reefs (i.e., travel time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Gravity isoclines along gradients of population size and travel time illustrate how gravity values could be similar for places that have large populations but are far from the reefs (e.g., populationx = 15,000 people, travel timex = 7 h, gravityx = 306) as to those with small populations that are close to the reef (e.g., populationy = 300 people, travel timey = 1 h, gravityy = 300).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ease of interpretation, we have illustrated travel time here in hours, but we use minutes in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Gravity_Future_Directions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our gravity index (Materials and Methods and Box 1) makes several key assumptions that could potentially be refined in further applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our application of gravity held friction constant across each specific type of surface (i.e., all paved roads had the same friction value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future applications of more localized studies could vary travel time to reflect the quality of road networks, topographic barriers to access (such as cliffs), and the availability of technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, future applications could also aim to incorporate local information about fishing fleet efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our adaptation of the gravity model (31) is unidirectional, assuming a constant level of attraction from any reef (i.e., gravity varies based on human population size, but not on the quality or quantity of fish on a specific reef).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reefs with more fish, or higher fish value, could be more attractive and exert a higher pull for exploitation (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, societal values and preferences can also make certain fish more or less attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our adaptation of gravity was designed to examine the observed conditions of reefs as a function of potential interactions with markets and local settlements, so our modification of the concept for this application was appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future applications wishing to predict where reefs may be most vulnerable might wish to consider incorporating fish biomass or composition (i.e., potential market price of reef fish) in the gravity equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, our database was not designed to look at ecological changes in a single location over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future applications could examine whether ecological recovery in reserves (8) depends on the level of gravity present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we provide a global dataset of gravity for every reef pixel globally (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate that human impacts deplete reef fish stocks and how certain types of management can mediate but not eliminate these pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an era of increasing change, the global network of marine reserves may not safeguard reef fish communities from human impacts adequately enough to ensure key ecological functions, such as predation, are sustained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts must be made to both reduce and dampen key drivers of change (1, 61), while maintaining or improving the well-being of reef-dependent people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we find evidence that both remote and human-surrounded reserves can produce different types of conservation gains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, multiple forms of management are needed across the seascape to sustain coral reef fishes and the people who depend upon them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Scales_of_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data were organized at three spatial scales: reef site (n = 1,798), reef cluster (n = 734), and nation/state (n = 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reef site is the smallest scale, which had an average of 2.4 surveys (transects), hereafter referred to as reef.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For reef cluster (which had an average of 2.4 ± 2.4 reef sites), we clustered reefs together that were within 4 km of each other, and used the centroid to estimate reef cluster-level social and environmental covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define reef clusters, we first estimated the linear distance between all reef sites, then used a hierarchical analysis with the complete-linkage clustering technique based on the maximum distance between reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the cut-off at 4 km to select mutually exclusive sites where reefs cannot be more distant than 4 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of 4 km was informed by a 3-y study of the spatial movement patterns of artisanal coral reef fishers, corresponding to the highest density of fishing activities on reefs based on GPS-derived effort density maps of artisanal coral reef fishing activities (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clustering analysis was carried out using the R functions hclust and cutree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A larger scale in our analysis was nation/state (nation, state, or territory, which had an average of 44 ± 59 reef clusters), which are jurisdictions that generally correspond to individual nations (but could also include states, territories, overseas regions), within which sites were nested for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Other_Social_Drivers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the influence of other social drivers that are thought to be related to the condition of reef fish biomass, we also included the following covariates in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Environmental_Drivers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first looked for collinearity among our covariates using bivariate correlations and variance inflation factor estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to the exclusion of several covariates (not described above): (i) Biogeographic Realm (Tropical Atlantic, western Indo-Pacific, Central Indo-Pacific, or eastern Indo-Pacific); (ii) Gross Domestic Product (purchasing power parity); (iii) Rule of Law (World Bank governance index); (iv) Control of Corruption (World Bank governance index); (v) Voice and Accountability (World Bank governance index); (vi) Reef Fish Landings; (vii) Tourism arrivals relative to local population; (viii) Sedimentation; and (ix) Marine Reserve Size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other covariates had correlation coefficients 0.7 or less and Variance Inflation Factor scores less than 5 (indicating multicollinearity was not a serious concern).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Care must be taken in causal attribution of covariates that were significant in our model, but demonstrated collinearity with candidate covariates that were removed during the aforementioned process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the covariate of interest in this study, gravity, was not strongly collinear with candidate covariates except reserve size (r = 0.8, t = 3.6, df = 104, P = 0.0004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the relationships between gravity and target fish biomass, we developed a general linear-mixed model in R, using a log-normal distribution for biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the relationships between gravity and presence/absence of top predators, we developed a generalized linear-mixed model with a binomial family and a logit link function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both models, we set reef cluster nested within nation/state as a random effect to account for the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e., reef sites nested in reef clusters, reef clusters nested in nation/states).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included an interaction between gravity and reserve age, as well as all of the other social and environmental drivers and the sampling method and total sampling area as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested interactions between gravity and management and used AIC to select the most parsimonious model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fish biomass, the interaction between gravity and reserve age had AIC values 2 lower than the interaction between gravity and management (and a combination of both interactions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the top predator models, both interactions were within 2 AIC values, so we chose the interaction with reserve age for consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All continuous covariates were standardized for the analysis, and reserve age was then normalized such that nonreserves were 0 and the oldest reserves were 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our models thus predicted target fish biomass or probability of top predators being observed at the reef site scale with an interaction between gravity and reserve age, while accounting within the random factors for two bigger scales at which the data were collected (reef cluster, and nation/state) (SI Appendix), and key social and environmental characteristics expected to influence the biomass of reef fish (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to coefficient plots (SI Appendix, Fig S1), we conducted a supplemental analysis of relative variable importance (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We ran the residuals from the models against size of the no-take areas of the marine reserves and no patterns were evident, suggesting it would explain no additional variance in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trend lines and partial plots (averaged by site and nation/state) are presented in the figures (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 BH and 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plotted the partial effect of the relationship between gravity and protection on targeted fish biomass and presence of top predators (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 BG and 3 BG) by setting all other continuous covariates to 0 because they were all standardized and all categorical covariates to their most common category (i.e., 410 m for depth, slope for habitat, standard belt transect for census method).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For age of reserves, we set this to 0 for fished and restricted areas, and to the average age of reserves (15.5 y) for reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the expected conservation gains of different management strategies, we calculated: (i) the difference between the response of openly fished areas (our counterfactual) and high-compliance marine reserves to gravity; and (ii) the difference between the response of openly fished areas and fisheries restricted areas to gravity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ease of interpretation, we plotted conservation gains in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha; as opposed to log[kg/ha]) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A log-normal (linear) model was used to develop the slopes of the biomass (i) fished, (ii) marine reserve, and (iii) fisheries restricted areas, which results in the differences between (i) and (ii) and between (i) and (iii) being nonlinear on an arithmetic scale (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We plotted the diagnostic plots of the general linear-mixed model to check that the model assumptions were not violated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check the fit of the generalized linear-mixed model, we used the confusion matrix (tabular representation of actual versus predicted values) to calculate the accuracy of the model, which came to 79.2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine homoscedasticity, we checked residuals against fitted values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We checked our models against a null model, which contained the model structure (i.e., random effects), but no covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the null model as a baseline against which we could ensure that our full model performed better than a model with no covariate information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases our models outperformed our null models by more than 2 AIC values, indicating a more parsimonious model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All analyses were undertaken using R (3.43) statistical package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
