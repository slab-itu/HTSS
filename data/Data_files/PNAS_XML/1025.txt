WeylKondo semimetal in heavy-fermion systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While electronic states with nontrivial topology have traditionally been known in insulators, they have been evidenced in metals during the past 2 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such Weyl semimetals show topological protection while conducting electricity both in the bulk and on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outstanding question is whether topological protection can happen in metals with strong correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report theoretical work on a strongly correlated lattice model to demonstrate the emergence of a WeylKondo semimetal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify Weyl fermions in the bulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, both of which are associated with the many-body phenomenon called the Kondo effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determine a key signature of this WeylKondo semimetal, which is realized in a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulating states can be topologically nontrivial, a well-established notion that is exemplified by the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, topological metals have not been experimentally evidenced until recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In systems with strong correlations, they have yet to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heavy-fermion semimetals are a prototype of strongly correlated systems and, given their strong spin-orbit coupling, present a natural setting to make progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we advance a WeylKondo semimetal phase in a periodic Anderson model on a noncentrosymmetric lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quasiparticles near the Weyl nodes develop out of the Kondo effect, as do the surface states that feature Fermi arcs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy-fermion semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide the much-needed theoretical foundation for the experimental search of topological metals with strong correlations and open up an avenue for systematic studies of such quantum phases that naturally entangle multiple degrees of freedom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The 3D noncentrosymmetric lattice and associated Brillouin zone (BZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Diamond lattice with hopping t and onsite energy ±m differentiating A,B sublattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid lines connect nearest neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Interlocking tetrahedral sublattice cells illustrating how the distinction between the A and B sublattices (zincblende structure) invalidates the inversion center lying on the point marked X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The BZ of the diamond lattice, with Weyl nodes shown in blue/red and high symmetry contour used for Fig 2 in green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Energy dispersion of the bulk electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown here is the energy vs. wave vector k along a high-symmetry path in the BZ, defined in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom four bands near EF show a strong reduction in the bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bare parameters are (t,,m,Ed,V)=(1,0.5,1,6,6.6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the self-consistent solution, r0.259 and 6.334.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterization of the Weyl nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plots are in the (x,y) plane of the four Weyl nodes at z=2 (gray plane in Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Energy dispersion, showing the band degeneracies at the Weyl node points and a strong reduction of the bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The distribution of the Berry curvature field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bare parameters are the same as in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Energy dispersion of the surface electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum shows the (anti-)Weyl nodes marked with blue (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid black lines connecting the nodes represent Fermi arcs, and black dashed lines represent the BZ around the X point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) High-symmetry k-space contour taken on the BZ boundary at z=2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Energy dispersion of the surface state along the path specified in A; the gray dotted line denotes the decay of the surface states into the bulk states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters are the same as in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_3D_Periodic_Anderson_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three terms in the model of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 are presented here in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongly correlated d electrons are specified byHd=Edi,didi+Uinidnid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]The hybridization term is as follows:Hcd=Vi,(dici+H.c.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]In the above two equations, the site labeling i means i=(,a), where r runs over the Bravais lattice of unit cells and a runs over the two sites, a=A,B, in the unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conduction electron Hamiltonian Hc realizes a modified FuKaneMele model (26) and is expressed as Hc=h, where T=(c,Ac,Bc,Ac,B), andh=0(u1()x+u2()y+mz)+(())z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]Here, =(x,y,z) and =(x,y,z) are the Pauli matrices acting on the spin and sublattice spaces, respectively, and 0 is the identity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first term, u1() and u2() are determined by the conduction electron hopping, tij=t between nearest-neighbor sites (ij).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second term specifies a Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit coupling between the second-nearest-neighbor sites (ij), which is of strength  and involves vector ()=(Dx(),Dy(),Dz()).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically,u1()=t(1+n=13cos(n)),[8]u2()=tn=13sin(n),[9]Dx()=sin(2)sin(3)sin((21))+sin((31)),[10]and Dy,Dz are obtained by permuting the fcc primitive lattice vectors n. The canonical (unitary) transformation, =S, leads toHc=(h+00h),[11]h±=u1()x+u2()y+(m±D())z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [12]We have used a pseudospin basis (27), defined by the eigenstates |±D with eigenvaluesD|±D=±|±D[13]where D()|()|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eigen energies of the |±D sectors are simply obtained to be±D=u1()2+u2()2+(m±D())2[14]where =(+,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use this transformation on the full Anderson model in the strong coupling limit, at the saddle-point level where the Lagrange multiplier i, which enforces the local constraint bibi+fifi=1, takes a uniform value, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to =S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anticipating the separability of the |±D sectors by specifying T=(+T,T), T=(+T,T), where ±T=(±,A,±,B) and ±T=(±,A,±,B), we obtain the strong coupling HamiltonianHs=,a=±(aa)(ha12rV12rV12(Ed+)12)(aa),[15]which separates as Hs=H+s+Hs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtain the full spectra of the eight hybridized bands,E±D(,)()=12[Es+±D+(Es±D)2+4Vs2],[16]where =(+,) indexes the upper/lower quartet of bands, ±D=±D, and (Es,Vs)=(Ed+,rV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supporting Information, we prove that the |+D sector is always gapped, whereas the |D sector allows Weyl nodes when 0less_thanm4||less_than1, and determine =Vs2/Es, which fixes the Fermi energy at the Weyl nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine r,, Hs must be solved self-consistently from the saddle-point equations12Nu,a=±aa+r2=1,V4Nu,a=±[aa+H.c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ]+r=0,[17]where Nu is the number of the unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equations are solved on a 64×64×64 cell of the diamond lattice, with error O(105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
