title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unconstrained muscle-tendon workloops indicate resonance tuning as a mechanism for elastic limb behavior during terrestrial locomotion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fields of terrestrial biomechanics and bio-inspired robotics have identified spring-like limb mechanics as critical to stable and efficient gait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In biological systems, distal muscle groups cycling large amounts of energy in series tendons are a primary source of compliance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the origins of this behavior, we coupled a biological muscle-tendon to a feedback controlled servomotor simulating the inertial/gravitational environment of terrestrial gait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We drove this bio-robotic system via direct nerve stimulation across a range of frequencies to explore the influence of neural control on muscle-tendon interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study concluded that by matching stimulation frequency to that of the passive biomechanical system, muscle-tendon interactions resulting in spring-like behavior occur naturally and do not require closed-loop neural control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terrestrial locomotion, there is a missing link between observed spring-like limb mechanics and the physiological systems driving their emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous modeling and experimental studies of bouncing gait (e.g., walking, running, hopping) identified muscle-tendon interactions that cycle large amounts of energy in series tendon as a source of elastic limb behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural, biomechanical, and environmental origins of these tuned mechanics, however, have remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the dynamic interplay between these factors, we developed an experimental platform comprised of a feedback-controlled servo-motor coupled to a biological muscle-tendon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our novel motor controller mimicked in vivo inertial/gravitational loading experienced by muscles during terrestrial locomotion, and rhythmic patterns of muscle activation were applied via stimulation of intact nerve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach was based on classical workloop studies, but avoided predetermined patterns of muscle strain and activationconstraints not imposed during real-world locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our unconstrained approach to position control allowed observation of emergent muscle-tendon mechanics resulting from dynamic interaction of neural control, active muscle, and system material/inertial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrated that, despite the complex nonlinear nature of musculotendon systems, cyclic muscle contractions at the passive natural frequency of the underlying biomechanical system yielded maximal forces and fractions of mechanical work recovered from previously stored elastic energy in series-compliant tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By matching movement frequency to the natural frequency of the passive biomechanical system (i.e., resonance tuning), muscle-tendon interactions resulting in spring-like behavior emerged naturally, without closed-loop neural control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conceptual framework may explain the basis for elastic limb behavior during terrestrial locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All metrics reported in tables and scatterplots are mean (±SD) for five muscle preparations across every frequency condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For brevity, we only present overall ANOVA and least-squares regression (LSR) results (i.e., P values and R2) in the text when there was a significant effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finer details of the analyses, including post hoc paired t tests and regression equations for significant effects, as well as other nonsignificant ANOVA and LSR effects, are fully documented in Table S1 (ANOVA) and Table S2 (LSR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall_System_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
System dynamics observed in this study were generally cyclic and self-stabilizing (Fig 1C i and ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative dataset showing the mean (±SE) of the final four cycles of muscle stimulation for all muscle stimulation driving frequency (Drive) conditions from a single experimental preparation is shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that pennation effects were small and that FMTU=FCE=FSEE (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By examining these dynamics, it can be seen that there were alternating phases of energy storage and return at the system level (i.e., MTU) and for individual muscle and tendon/aponeurosis components (i.e., CE and SEE, respectively) of the biomechanical system over a stretch-shorten cycle (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also note that, for conditions plotted against normalized cycle time (Fig 2 AE, iiiv), deviations from mean behavior in force, length change, and power output were quite small across all conditions; (i.e., behavior is periodic and steady; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTU_Peak_Force_and_Phase_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MTU peak force varied significantly with muscle stimulation driving frequency, Drive (ANOVA: P=0.032;LSR:P=0.037,R2=0.26) and was maximized for Drive0 (Fig 3A and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal peak MTU force approached 0.9 × Fmax for a driving frequency of 10%0, which was roughly 30% higher than values observed in the 20%0 and +20%0 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MTU peak force phase decreased slightly with increasing Drive (ANOVA: P=0.009; LSR: P=0.0002,R2=0.47; Fig 3B and Tables S1 and S2), and consistently occurred 50% of a cycle after minimum MTU length, or bottom dead center (BDC) across all conditions (Fig 1C, i and ii and 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, muscle stimulation onset phase relative to BDC had strong dependence on driving frequency, Drive (ANOVA: P = 0.004; LSR: P=0.012,R2=0.46), with a shift centered at or just above Drive=0 (Fig 3B and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 20%0 condition, stimulation onset phase was coincident with peak force phase (50%), but transitioned to a global minimum of 25% in the 0 condition (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For driving frequencies  0, stimulation onset phase began to rise again, whereas peak force phase continued to drop slightly (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTU_Mechanical_Power_Output_and_CE__SEE_Component_Contributions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elastic energy storage and return within the MTU was maximized when it was driven with muscle stimulation frequency that coincided with the natural frequency of the passive mechanical system (i.e., Drive=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contribution to overall mechanical power from both CE and SEE was highly dependent on driving frequency, Drive (ANOVA: Pless_than0.0001; LSR: Pless_than0.0001,R2=0.71), with the SEE contributing the largest percentage (80%) of total MTU power when Drive=0 (Fig 3C and Tables S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Average net mechanical power output (P¯mechnet) output of 0 was observed across all frequencies at both the MTU (Fig 3D) and component (CE/SEE) (Table S3) level, indicating steady cyclic behavior (i.e., akin to locomotion on level ground at constant speed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net zero power output was the result of equal and maximal amounts of average positive (P¯mech+) and negative (P¯mech) mechanical power from MTU and CE/SEE when Drive0 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 A, iv through E, iv and 3D and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Muscle_Length_and_Velocity_at_Peak_Force  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability for the muscle (CE) to actively generate force is intrinsically coupled to its mechanical state and CE length and velocity at the time of peak force were of great interest in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, higher driving frequencies resulted in lower muscle strains at peak force (ANOVA: Pless_than0.0001; LSR: P=0.08,R2=0.12; Fig S2A and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized CE velocity also depended on driving frequency, shifting from shortening at peak force, to lengthening between driving frequencies of 10%0 and 0 (ANOVA: P=0.035; LSR: P=0.0039,R2=0.40; Fig S2B and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeled_MTU_Metabolic_Rate_and_Apparent_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Driving the MTU near its passive natural frequency (i.e., Drive0) minimized modeled average metabolic power consumption (P¯met) (Fig S3G) and maximized estimated MTU apparent efficiency, app (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P¯met was found to vary significantly with Drive (ANOVA P=0.004), but MTU app did not (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regression trends for both P¯met and MTU app were nonsignificant (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall_System_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overarching hypothesis in this study was that the form of the mechanical system, defined by the structural properties (i.e., kMTU,lin,lout, and M) that determine its passive natural frequency (0), would ultimately govern neural control strategies that yield proper system function (i.e., tuned spring-like MTU mechanics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous modeling studies, we expected peak mechanical tuning of biological muscle-tendon (i.e., CE/SEE) interaction, or resonance, would be observed when the system was driven with muscle stimulation at a frequency Drive = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our main hypothesis was supported by experimental data demonstrating tuned MTU dynamics characteristic of mechanical resonance at a driving frequency Drive coincident with 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak MTU force was maximized at a frequency at or just below Drive = 0 (Fig 3A and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  whereas the percent contribution to overall MTU power output from energy stored/returned in SEE occurred for Drive at or just above 0 (Fig 3C and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, maximums in both of these characteristic outcomes of a tuned MTU system appear to be centered around Drive=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A secondary hypothesis was that emergent muscle stimulation phase dynamics would facilitate both high peak forces and SEE energy storage and return.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction was also supported by experimental outcomes, as muscle stimulation onset phase shifted from 55% in the 20%0 condition to a global minimum 25% in the Drive=0 condition (Fig 3B); while peak force consistently occurred 50% of a cycle following minimum MTU length (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ultimately resulted in muscle activation during MTU/CE lengthening for Drive20%0 (Fig S2), which enhanced active muscle (CE) force production (Fig 3A) and tendon (SEE) energy storage and return (54) (Fig 3C and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results match well with predictions from a recently published workloop study, in which a stimulation phasing of 25% relative to minimum MTU length was found to be ideal for generating net zero mechanical work and storing/returning significant amounts of energy in SEE (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although muscle stimulation timing dynamics (i.e., phase) were imposed in the aforementioned workloop study, here, they were an emergent property of system dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

From_De-Tuned_to_Tuned_and_Back_Again__Frequency-Phase_Coupling_in_Biological_MTU  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To provide context for the idea of resonance tuning in a biological MTU, we used the classical SHO as a behavioral template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system is, in the mechanical sense, a grossly oversimplified representation of tuned interaction between muscle, tendon, transmission, load, and environment, but there are several fundamental features that each of these systems share.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the classic SHO oscillator, driving it well below its resonant frequency will result in the elastic component effectively operating as a rigid coupling between the load and the driving force source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By examining the time course of the Drive=20%0 condition early in a stimulation cycle (the first 1015% of the cycle following muscle stimulation onset), it can be seen that LCE=LMTU, with the preloaded tendon acting as connector between the muscle (CE) and environment/load (Fig 2A, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, this is not an uncommon role for tendon to play, but is energetically not ideal for a distal MTU known to supply the majority of mechanical power output during steady locomotion from a relatively small volume of muscle (e.g., ankle plantar flexors) (30, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Driving the MTU at 20%0 ultimately resulted in minimal values of Fpeak (Fig 3A), minimum SEE energy storage and return (Table S3), minimum SEE contributions to overall P¯mech+ (Fig 3C), maximal predicted metabolic demand (Fig S3G) and minimal MTU apparent efficiency (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another consequence of low driving frequencies relative to 0 was high muscle strain, 1.51.6l0 (Fig S2A), which diminished active force generation capabilities and increased force contributions from passive CE components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These high strains might be problematic for a relatively noncompliant MTU, but in vivo studies of jumping in Rana lithobates observed operating strains 1.4lo for the plantaris muscle (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although strains observed here were high in general, they were within reason for the particular muscle group under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As Drive was increased toward 0, the system began to tune itself much the way a SHO might.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation onset occurred earlier and earlier with respect to the MTU length change cycle, and reached a global minimum at Drive=0 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the SEE effectively decoupled CE and whole MTU length change dynamics and allowed CE to shorten internally against a lengthening SEE and MTU (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C i and ii and 2 B, iE, i and B, iiiE, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following an initial shortening phase, the interaction of muscle mechanical state and system inertial demands was such that muscle was lengthening while operating at lower strains during the time approaching peak MTU length/force (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C, i and ii and 2 C, iiE, ii and C, iiiE, iii and Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CE strain dynamics improved active force generation capabilities due to the highly nonlinear nature of force-velocity dynamics in the neighborhood of vCE=0 (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These muscle contractile conditions facilitated significant energy storage and return in the SEE (Fig 1C, i and ii, 2, and 3B and Table S3), enhanced MTU mechanical power output to values above that of the muscle (CE) alone (Fig 3D and Table S3), drove down predicted metabolic demand (Fig S3G), and ultimately maximized MTU app for the Drive=0 condition (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These highly favorable dynamics only persist for a narrow range of frequencies, however, and muscle stimulation onset phase begins to increase again for Drive0 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the highest driving frequency examined here (Drive=+20%0), there is still effective decoupling of CE and MTU mechanics via SEE energy storage/return, but very little of this internal energy exchange is ultimately transmitted to the load (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2E and 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome is also consistent with SHO behavior, and the net result is reduced mechanical performance (i.e., reduced Fpeak,P¯mech+/) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2E and 3 A and B), increased predicted metabolic cost (Fig S3G), and decreased MTU app (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Form__Function__and_the_Energetics_of_Resonance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies of human bouncing have used indirect approaches for identifying (26, 32, 58) and even imposing (59) the resonant frequency of the human ankle plantar flexor muscle-tendon complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies collectively identified several key features of human bouncing at resonance, including minimal ratio of CE to whole MTU work (26, 32), maximized gain between peak force and muscle activation (59), minimized metabolic cost (32, 58), and maximized apparent efficiency (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They did not, however, provide an explicit link between these functional features and the underlying structural characteristics of the mechanical system (i.e., form).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To begin to close the gap between mechanical resonance of a whole limb and our observation of mechanical resonance in an isolated muscle-tendon unit, we compared our bio-robotic frequency response data in this study to partially published data from human studies of hopping at frequencies from 2.2 to 3.2 Hz (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Joint-level and metabolic data from these studies have been published for all frequencies, whereas muscle-level data have only been published for the 2.5-Hz condition (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further information on collection and analysis of these data, please see Farris et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two distinct differences worth noting when comparing these datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the passive natural frequency of a human subjects limb is not known a priori and thus the resonant hopping frequency was presumed to be somewhere in the range of frequencies explored (i.e., 2.23.2 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, measures of metabolic energy consumption in the human system are whole body measures rather than single muscle estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although human hopping is primarily driven by the ankle joint, and it is likely that ankle energetics are driving those of the whole body, it cannot be stated definitively that all observed variation in metabolic demand was the sole result of variations in ankle MTU dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these differences, we found strong qualitative, if not quantitative, agreement between trends in peak MTU force (Fig S3 A and B), MTU P¯mech (Fig S3 C and D), contributions of CE and SEE to MTU mechanical power output (Fig S3 E and F), modeled/measured metabolic power (Fig S3 G and H), and MTU apparent efficiency (Fig S3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the similarities in these trends, we feel confident that our bio-robotic framework reasonably approximates functional ankle MTU mechanics observed in human studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies of ankle-driven bouncing in humans have also demonstrated that mechanical resonance of the lumped plantar flexor MTUs is the preferred pattern of movement in a sustained (i.e., 6 min) task (58) and that inertial load and environment (e.g., added mass and increased stiffness, respectively) can influence resonant/preferential bouncing frequency (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When resonant frequency is altered via environment perturbation, there is additional evidence indicating that proprioceptive (muscle spindle and golgi tendon) feedback allows humans to rediscover resonance and identify movement frequencies with optimal gain/phase relationships (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence for a default mode of operation centered on learned resonant movement frequencies that maximize efficiency/elastic energy storage and return under normal inertial conditions; and the use of a feedback-based mechanism for making adjustments in response to acute perturbations or in atypical environments (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outcomes reported here support this idea and demonstrate that feedback-based control is not necessary for stable and efficient MTU function when movement frequency matches that of the passive biomechanical system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further extending the concept of resonance tuning demonstrated here and in human studies of ankle-driven vertical hopping/bouncing (28, 55, 58, 59) to whole limb behavior during forward gait presents several formidable challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include accounting for the collective behavior of additional MTUs that cross the knee and hip joints; which can alter the stiffness of the limb as a function of muscle geometry/activation, gait type, and gait speed (15, 61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the center of pressure tends to shift throughout stance phase of forward gait (i.e., variable biological moment arm ratio) and there are alternating phases of single/double limb support in walking (i.e., variable load).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge, we are the first to identify how the combination of environment dynamics and muscle/tendon actuator properties ultimately govern neural control strategies essential for stable and efficient gait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was made possible by our experimental framework, which did not constrain MTU strain patterns to follow predetermined cycles, but instead allowed us to close the loop and allow dynamic mechanical interaction between the biological MTU and the physics of the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental apparatus enabled identification of the system-level variables that ultimately regulate emergent behavior when open-loop neural control is applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrated that closed-loop neural control was not required to properly time muscle activation for elastic energy storage and return.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it was possible to exploit the inherent frequency phase coupling between a cyclically activated MTU and its inertial environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through proper selection of movement frequency alone, effective timing of muscle activation onset for maximizing MTU force and elastic energy storage and return emerged naturally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome points to mechanical resonance as an underlying principle governing muscle-tendon interactions and provides a physiology-based framework for understanding how mechanically simple elastic limb behavior may emerge from a complex biological system comprised of many simultaneously tuned muscle-tendons within the lower limb (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal_Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments shown here were approved by the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five adult American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus; mean body mass = 374.3 ± 50.3 g; Table S4) were purchased from a licensed vendor (Rana Ranch) and housed in the NC State University Biological Resources Facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On arrival, there was a 1-wk adaptation period before use in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were fed crickets ad libitum and housed in an aquatic environment with free access to a terrestrial platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before use in experiments, animals were cold-anesthetized and killed using the double-pith technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surgical_Protocol_and_Instrumentation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A single limb was detached from the killed animal at the hip joint, and the skin was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limb was then submerged in a bath of oxygenated Ringers solution (100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM NaHCO3, 1.6 mM CaCl, and 10.5 mM dextrose) at room temperature (22 °C) for the duration of surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All muscles proximal to the knee, as well as the tibialis anterior, were removed with great care taken to keep the sciatic nerve intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plantaris longus muscle tendon unit was separated from the shank but left intact at its proximal insertion point at the knee joint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free tendon and aponeurosis were carefully removed and preserved up to the distal insertion point at the toes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscles were instrumented with two sonomicrometry crystals (1 mm diameter; Sonometrics) implanted along a proximal muscle fascicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bipolar stimulating electrode cuff (Microprobes for Life Science) was placed around the intact sciatic nerve and connected to an Aurora 701C stimulator (Aurora Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals foot was removed proximal to the ankle joint, and intact portions of femur and tibia were mounted to a Plexiglas plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A custom friction clamp was placed over distal portions of the free tendon, and the whole prep was inserted into a Plexiglas chamber with continuously circulating oxygenated ringers solution at 27 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tendon clamp was then attached to a feedback controlled ergometer (Aurora 310B-LR; Aurora Scientific) for the duration of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic of the experimental preparation can be seen in Fig 1A, and a photograph of one can be seen in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Muscle-Tendon_Properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine maximal muscle isometric force (Fmax), the sciatic nerve was supramaximally stimulated with 0.2-ms pulses at a pulse rate of 100 Hz for 300 ms under various amounts of passive tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same rate and duration of stimulus pulses were used in all subsequent conditions requiring muscle activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The condition for which Fmax was observed was also used to approximate muscle act and deact values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an equation from Zajac, we performed a brute force least squared error fit by sweeping a parameter space consisting of reasonable values for each time constant and determined subject-specific values for use in estimating metabolic cost (act=0.066±0.011,deact=0.100±0.020; Table S4) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the system passive resonant frequency (0) for our simulated environment, we allowed the inactive MTU to oscillate against our simulated inertial system until steady-state behavior was reached (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provided an approximate resonant frequency and estimated linear MTU stiffness for our selected environment parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observed frequency of oscillation was 0 (¯0=2.34±0.11Hz; Table S4), and all stimulation frequencies in dynamic conditions were centered on this value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that this implies a linear MTU stiffness and is only appropriate for a single set of environment parameters (e.g., mass and moment arm lengths) because it represents a local linear approximation of nonlinear MTU passive stiffness (10, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we acknowledge that, in theory, the passive muscle-tendon system should dissipate energy over a stretch-shorten cycle and exhibit decaying strain amplitude from cycle to cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclic energy dissipation was observed initially in passive oscillations, but strain patterns eventually settled in to near constant strain amplitude (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our motor controller was imperfect, with delays between applied/measured local maximum/minimums in position (mean motor delay = 7.8 ± 0.08 ms), leading to small errors in applied vs. measured absolute motor position (mean position error = 0.13±0.38%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these errors were small enough relative to the amplitude and time course of oscillation dynamics that we do not believe hardware/controllers to be a significant limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we suggest that stretch-induced calcium leakage may have played a role in active stiffening (64) and possibly limited stretch-induced membrane depolarization (65), counteracting energy dissipation known to occur in biological tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before dynamic conditions, three fixed end contractions (FECs) were performed at a stimulation frequency of 0 and a stimulation duty of 10% as a means of determining a baseline force for estimating muscle fatigue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same pattern of stimulus was applied following all dynamic conditions, and if the peak force achieved was 60% of the initial value, the experiment was ruled a success (mean Fatigue % =76±16.9%; Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamic_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For conditions where there was dynamic interaction between the active MTU and simulated inertial load, the driving frequency was varied between ±20%0 in 10% intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of driving frequency conditions was randomized to counteract fatigue effects, and each frequency condition consisted of eight cycles of stimulation (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each trial began with the biological MTU under 1 N of passive tension and the inertial load resting on a virtual table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To disengage the table, MTU force must exceed that of the gravitational loadFMTU(lout/lin)Mg.[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once this condition is satisfied (FMTU17.5 N for parameters used here), the table is removed, and there is no constraint placed on system dynamics from that point on (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was allowed four stimulation cycles to reach steady-state behavior (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C, 2, and 3C), and the last four cycles were used in all subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Muscle-Level_Mechanics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MTU force and MTU/CE L were measured directly, and SEE L was assumed to adhere to the following relationship:LSEE(t)=LMTU(t)LCE(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MTU and component (CE/SEE) mechanical power (Pmech) were also computed for this preparation as follows:Pmech(t)=F(t)×ddtL(t),[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Where F(t) and L(t) were recorded force vs. time and length vs. time, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phase data presented here were computed relative to the minimum MTU length observed for each stretch-shorten cycle and normalized to Tstim for each experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic of these measured/reported values is shown in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are reported in this manner for ready comparison with previous workloop studies where sine wave-like trajectories are applied, and stimulation phase relative to MTU oscillation period is varied systematically (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also yielded sine wave-like trajectories that had the same period as applied stimulus patterns in all frequency conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation phase relative to MTU strain patterns was an emergent property of system mechanics/driving frequency and was not constrained in any way as part of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Average_Positive_Power  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Average positive mechanical power (P¯mech) for MTU and CE/SEE was computed by integrating instantaneous mechanical power over a cycle and dividing by stimulation cycle period (TDrive=Drive1) as follows:P¯mech=1TDrivet=0t=TDrivePmech(t)dt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To get average positive and negative powers (P¯mech+ and P¯mech, respectively), the same calculation was made for only positive or negative regions of instantaneous power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeled_Metabolic_Rate_and_Apparent_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeled dimensionless metabolic rate was computed as a function of normalized velocity (66), where maximal shortening velocity (vmax) was assumed to adhere to the relationship (67)vmax=13.8l0×s1,[6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and s is the unit of time (seconds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instantaneous dimensionless metabolic cost [pmet(t)] was scaled by physiological constant Fmax and modeled muscle active state (t) (68), which was computed using our experimentally applied stimulus pattern u(t) and estimated act/deact values (10) (Table S4) to model instantaneous rate of metabolic power as follows:Pmet(t)=Fmax×[t,u(t),act,deact]×pmet(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Average metabolic power (P¯met) was calculated using the same approach as for average mechanical power (P¯mech in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate CE and MTU apparent efficiency (app) of positive mechanical work for input unit of metabolic energy, the following equation was used:app=P¯mech+P¯met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address our hypotheses, we conducted a one-factor, repeated-measures ANOVA (fixed effect: muscle stimulation frequency, Drive) to test for an effect of muscle stimulation frequency on a number of key dependent measures of muscle-tendon mechanics and energetics during unconstrained workloops ( = 0.05; JMP Pro; SAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For dependent measures with ANOVA (P less_than 0.05), we performed post hoc Student's t tests to make pairwise comparisons of all conditions with the Drive=o condition, as well as the study-wide maximum or minimum condition (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to establish quantitative relationships for observed trends in dependent variables as a function of muscle stimulation frequency (Drive) we performed a least-squares regression (LSR) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each dependent variable was subjected to stepwise first- and second-order polynomial fits to all data, pooled from each experimental preparation (n = 5), to determine whether or not statistically significant trends were present (P less_than 0.05; Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event that a fit was nonsignificant, the best fit based on lowest P value was used to represent observed trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated goodness of fit using the R2 statistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
