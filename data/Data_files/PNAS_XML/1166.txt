title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biomass smoke from southern Africa can significantly enhance the brightness of stratocumulus over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each year biomass burning (BB) aerosols emitted in southern Africa during the fire season (JulyOctober) transport westward over the southeast Atlantic Ocean and interact with underlying stratocumulus decks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies showed that BB aerosols greatly perturb the top of atmosphere radiation balance by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and by altering cloud properties via changing the lower tropospheric stability (direct and semidirect effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a state-of-the-art model in combination with satellite observations, we found that BB aerosols that are entrained into the clouds function as cloud condensation nuclei, and increase the brightness of stratocumulus clouds (indirect effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these models, this indirect effect dominates the direct and semidirect effects of BB aerosols over this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine stratocumulus clouds cover nearly one-quarter of the ocean surface and thus play an extremely important role in determining the global radiative balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semipermanent marine stratocumulus deck over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean is of particular interest, because of its interactions with seasonal biomass burning aerosols that are emitted in southern Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the impacts of biomass burning aerosols on stratocumulus clouds and the implications for regional and global radiative balance is still very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have focused on assessing the magnitude of the warming caused by solar scattering and absorption by biomass burning aerosols over stratocumulus (the direct radiative effect) or cloud adjustments to the direct radiative effect (the semidirect effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a nested modeling approach in conjunction with observations from multiple satellites, we demonstrate that cloud condensation nuclei activated from biomass burning aerosols entrained into the stratocumulus (the microphysical effect) can play a dominant role in determining the total radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, compared with their direct and semidirect radiative effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomass burning aerosols over the region and period with heavy loadings can cause a substantial cooling (daily mean 8.05 W m2), primarily as a result of clouds brightening by reducing the cloud droplet size (the Twomey effect) and secondarily through modulating the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water path and coverage (the cloud lifetime effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the importance of realistically representing the interactions of stratocumulus with biomass burning aerosols in global climate models in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Evaluation_of_WRF-Chem_Against_Satellite_Observations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before examining the impact of BB aerosols on stratocumulus clouds, we thoroughly evaluate the WRF-Chem performance by comparing aerosol and cloud fields from the P case against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), CALIOP, and CATS observations over the SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found an excellent agreement between modeled and observed above-cloud aerosol optical depth (AOD), in terms of both domain-averaged values (0.357 from MODIS on the Aqua satellite vs. 0.351 from P case) and spatial distributions as shown in the SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B. Above-cloud AODs, in both the model simulation and MODIS retrievals, peak near the coast between 5° and 10°S, and gradually decrease westward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agreement lends confidence to our simulation of the BB aerosol emission and horizontal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further evaluate the modeled frequency of occurrence of ACA cases with aerosol in contact with cloud top (ACAcloud mixing frequency) as a function of longitude (Fig 1B), which is generally in good agreement with the CATS observations, although the model tends to predict higher mixing frequencies over 10° to 17°W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy in ACAcloud mixing frequency between model and observation may be also due to relatively low sampling rates of ACA by CATS over this region, where the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this region, the model predicted Nd is about 15 cm3 higher compared with the MODIS/Aqua retrievals (32) as shown in Fig 1B; whereas, over other regions, the model has a good performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Fig S1C shows the vertical distribution of aerosols observed by the spaceborne lidars CALIOP and CATS over the coastal and remote regions during nighttime averaged over the fire season (AugustSeptember of 2014 for CALIOP and AugustSeptember 2015 and 2016 for CATS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the vertical profiles reveals that, when transporting westward from the coastal region to the remote region, BB aerosols gradually descend to lower altitudes, likely because of large-scale subsidence and/or gravitational settling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of modeled (SI Appendix, Fig S1D) with observed vertical profiles (SI Appendix, Fig S1C) shows that WRF-Chem reasonably captures the transition of vertical distributions of aerosol features from the coastal to remote region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S1 C and D also shows the relative occurrence frequencies of cloud-top heights over the SEA as (SI Appendix, Fig S1C) observed by CALIOP and (SI Appendix, Fig S1D) modeled by the P case and C case during the daytime of the study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model simulations for the P case depict a very similar picture although the cloud-top heights are slightly underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Table S1 shows the aerosol and cloud properties modeled by the three cases and the corresponding satellite measurements/retrievals averaged over the SEA and study period, including CF, LWP, cloud-top Nd, and ACA occurrence frequency (See SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3, for the spatial distributions of these properties).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties associated with satellite measurements are discussed in the SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these model-simulated parameters are in good agreement with the satellite observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_BB_Aerosols_on_Stratocumulus_Clouds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A shows the diurnal changes of modeled Nd averaged over the SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P and M cases predict a domain average of about 100 cm3 of Nd through the entire day (Nd is slightly lower during the daytime); whereas, the C case predicts about half of Nd compared with the other two cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, modeled cloud LWP, cloud optical depth (c), and CF fields averaged over the SEA for the study period exhibit strong diurnal cycles, which peak at 0600 UTC and decrease to a minimum at 1500 UTC as shown in Fig 2 BD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the microphysical effect of BB aerosols, MBL clouds in the P case tend to have higher cloud LWP than their counterparts in the C case throughout the day, especially during the early morning hours (0600 UTC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the afternoon (12001500 UTC), the difference in LWP (LWP,  denotes the difference in cloud properties between P case and C case) reduces to 5.2 g m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diurnal cycles of c closely follow those of LWP; however, because of higher Nd (the Twomey effect) in the P case, the relative increases in c due to BB aerosols (by about 2530%) are much larger than the increases due to LWP (less_than10%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the BB aerosols are able to increase the brightness of stratocumulus clouds significantly over the SEA during the fire season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 2D, BB aerosols can enhance the amplitude of the CF diurnal cycle, as the P case predicts 2.1% higher CF during the early morning and 2.0% lower CF during the afternoon compared with the C case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to two snapshots of MODIS observations, the modeled CF diurnal cycles also lie within the range of time series of CF as observed by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2 E and F, the solid lines marked with blue circles show CF over the coastal and remote regions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the morning, both regions experience more than a 2% increase in CF under the influence of BB aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1200 UTC, the P case predicts nearly 4% lower CF than the C case over the remote region; whereas, there is only a slightly lower CF (less_than1%) over the coastal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with the microphysical effect of BB aerosols that first causes higher LWP due to precipitation suppression (28) (SI Appendix, Fig S4) and stronger entrainment due to higher LWP and Nd (faster evaporative cooling at cloud top) before noon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, higher entrainment rates are able to reduce the magnitude of LWP increase and enhance the breakup of stratocumulus clouds during the afternoon, especially over the remote region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (In the afternoon, LWP remains positive over a large area of the SEA, and only becomes negative over a relative small area of the remote region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix, Fig S5 for more detailed analysis of the spatial pattern of LWP.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another plausible reason for significantly reduced CF over the remote region during the afternoon is that the higher entrainment rate from night to early morning deepens the MBL (e.g., higher cloud top), making it more prone to decoupling from surface moisture supply during the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there is a delayed impact leading to an earlier transition into trade cumulus in the remote region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decoupling occurs more frequent during the day than the night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process is discussed more in detail in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 2 E and F, the solid lines marked with green squares represent the difference in CF between the P case and M case (SCF, S denotes the difference in cloud properties between P case and M case due to the semidirect effect) over the coastal and remote regions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the semidirect effect of BB aerosols only plays a significant role over the coastal region during the afternoon by increasing lower tropospheric stability (LTS) and cloud fraction (SCF  1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this region, consistent with the findings in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, because of the large CF, dense BB aerosol layers are able to produce a strong semidirect effect (a negative radiative effect), partially preventing the breakup of cloud decks during the afternoon due to entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the impacts of BB aerosols on the diurnal cycles of CF and LWP modeled by the WRF-LES model (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7), which agrees reasonably with the WRF-Chem results in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of the cloud-top heights between the P and C cases in SI Appendix, Fig S1D shows that an important effect of above-cloud BB aerosols is to enhance the mean cloud-top height over the SEA by 4550 m during the daytime in the 2-d reinitialized simulations, partially owing to stronger cloud-top entrainment rates in the P case (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The diurnal cycles of cloud-top heights modeled by three cases are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S8.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, by conducting a group of short-period WRF-Chem simulations (10 d, from September 1 to 11, 2014) and performing a budget analysis with a passive tracer (34), we confirm that the P case, compared with the C case, produces higher cloud-top entrainment rates (3.4 vs. 2.1 mm s1, daily mean), which can be interpreted as enhanced local mixing in the WRF-Chem model (see details in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3, we examine the radiative forcing caused by the BB aerosols over the SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the scatterplot, modeled upward shortwave (SW) fluxes at TOA (SWTOA) are compared against Clouds and the Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations averaged over 0900, 1200, and 1500 UTC of each day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the regression slope and the correlation coefficient suggest SWTOA modeled by the P case is in better agreement with CERES retrievals than the C case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, the P case slightly overestimates SWTOA by 1.6 W m2, and the C case underestimates SWTOA by 18.4 W m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 1, the difference in daily mean SWTOA between the P case and C case is as high as 8.05 W m2, a cooling effect that is mostly caused by the microphysical effect of BB aerosols on clouds (7.01 W m2, the difference between the M case and C case), and also contributed by the DRE and semidirect effects (a combined effect of 1.04 W m2, the difference between the P case and M case).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of higher Nd and LWP during the daytime and higher CF before noon, the microphysical effect of BB aerosols causes a strong cooling over both the coastal and remote regions (8.28 and 6.12 W m2) as shown in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the approach in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35, we estimate the contributions from the BB aerosol-induced changes in Nd, LWP, and CF to the changes in SWTOA between M case and C case (the microphysical effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the contribution from higher Nd (Twomey effect) is 77.86%, followed by higher LWP (21.09%) and higher CF before noon (1.05%) (cloud lifetime effect, see SI Appendix for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the coast, the sum of direct and semidirect effects of BB aerosols varies from 11.9 W m2 at 0900 UTC to 3.7 W m2 at 1200 UTC to 4.5 W m2 at 1500 UTC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warming is mainly due to the direct effect of BB aerosols before noon when the CF is relatively large (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooling effect at 1500 UTC is caused by the semidirect effect, which increases the CF by about 1% near the coast as shown in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The daily average sum of the direct and semidirect effects exerts a warming of 1.40 W m2 over the coastal region and a cooling of 2.81 W m2 over the remote region, with an average of 1.04 W m2 over the SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This magnitude is comparable to the estimate of 1.7 to 0.8 W m2 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 (see SI Appendix for comparisons of heating profile and changes in subsidence and LTS due to BB aerosols).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The much larger cooling associated with the microphysical effect, especially the Twomey effect of BB aerosols on clouds is the dominant factor in determining the total radiative forcing at TOA, and further highlights the need for reasonably representing the microphysical effect of BB aerosols on clouds over the SEA in climate models (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we employed the WRF-Chem/WRF-LES models in conjunction with satellite observations to study the effects of BB aerosols emitted from southern African fires on stratocumulus clouds and the radiative energy budget over the southeast Atlantic Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main findings of the impact of BB aerosols on the diurnal cycle of clouds are schematically summarized in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, over the entire SEA domain in both day and night, BB aerosols are entrained into clouds from above, function as CCN, and increase Nd and cloud brightness, leading to a negative radiative effect that dominates over the direct and semidirect effects of the aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the late nighttime to earlier morning, the microphysical effect of BB aerosols increases cloud LWP and CF by reducing drizzle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher Nd and LWP increase the cloud-top height and entrainment rate at cloud top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to stronger entrainment, the changes in cloud LWP due to BB aerosols remain positive but reduce in magnitude, while the changes in CF switch from positive to negative in the afternoon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another plausible reason is that the deeper MBL caused by higher entrainment during the night makes it more prone to decoupling during the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Near the coastal region where CF is large, the semidirect effect of BB aerosols partially counteracts the microphysical effect on the reduction of CF in the afternoon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the net effect of BB aerosols on CF over the coastal region is slightly negative (by 0.5%) during the afternoon, whereas CF over the remote region is significantly reduced (by 4%) under the influence of BB aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by increasing cloud brightness with higher Nd and LWP during the daytime and higher CF during the morning, the microphysical effect of biomass smoke can cause a significant cooling at TOA, bringing the domain averaged SWTOA modeled by the P case into much better agreement with CERES observations than the C case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to BB aerosol-induced changes in SW radiative energy budget discussed above, fire events in southern Africa are also able to alter longwave (LW) radiative energy budget over SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the moisture within BB aerosol plumes has a potentially important effect on cloud-top LW cooling over SEA (21), which is not discussed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we have compared and evaluated our modeled aerosol and cloud fields against satellite observations whenever possible, two important aspects of simulations are still not constrained by observations due to the lack of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pointed out in many previous studies, the DRE of BB aerosols is strongly dependent upon their single scattering albedo (SSA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, estimating the SSA from remote sensing observations is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, there is still a lack of reliable observations to validate the scattering properties of BB aerosols used in our DRE computations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another aspect is the exact amount of BB aerosols entrained into the clouds, which directly influences the magnitude of the cloud microphysical effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the amount of entrained aerosols from satellite observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, in 2016, several international and multiagency field campaigns, including Observations of Aerosols Above Clouds and Their Interactions (ORACLES) and Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC), were conducted over southern Africa and the SEA; some of these campaigns have resumed in 2017 [in addition to CloudAerosolRadiation Interactions and Forcing (CLARIFY) and Aerosol Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-Sa)] and are scheduled to continue in 2018.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main goals of these campaigns are to characterize the radiative and microphysical effects of BB aerosols on cloud properties, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With abundant in situ measurement incorporated in our model simulations, we hope to more accurately assess the effects of BB aerosols on stratocumulus clouds over this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with the above uncertainties, however, based on the high ACAcloud mixing frequency observed by CATS, our model simulations indicate strong evidence that BB aerosols are able to significantly enhance cloud Nd and LWP, and hence c and the brightness of stratocumulus over SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results change what we know about the impacts of BB aerosols on the regional radiative balance over SEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all previous studies focused on estimating the direct and semidirect effects of BB aerosols; however, the magnitudes of these two effects (2 to 2 W m2) are much smaller than the microphysical effect of BB aerosols (7.01 W m2) estimated in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, missing or incorrect representations of this strong cooling effect can contribute to the underestimation of shortwave cloud radiative forcing calculated by GCMs in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, despite the fact that our study focused on the radiative energy budget over the SEA region only, the results have broad implications for global climate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a cooling of 8.05 W m2 over SEA in our study domain can be roughly translated to global cooling of 0.089 W m2 during the fire season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cooling effect is significant and comparable to the radiative forcing from many other forcing agents assessed in IPCC AR5 [e.g., the radiative forcing due to aerosolradiation interactions as estimated by IPCC AR5 is 0.35 W m2 (1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, this study emphasizes the importance of studying the competing effects between aerosolradiation and aerosolcloud interactions in other geographical regions (e.g., in the Arctic), where BB aerosols often coexist with stratocumulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first use the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model version 3.6.1 (36) to simulate the transport of BB aerosols from the African continent and their interaction with underlying MBL clouds over coastal and remote oceanic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation domain covers a vast region of 6,000 km (longitudinal direction) × 1,800 km (latitudinal direction) including southern Africa and the southeast Atlantic Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conduct a series of 3-d forecasts at a horizontal resolution of 3 km by simulating the chemistry continuously from August 1 to September 30, 2014, but reinitializing meteorological initial and boundary conditions and sea surface temperatures with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final (FNL) reanalysis data every 2 d. The first day of each 3-d simulation is used as a spin-up period and only the results of the last 2 d are used for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reinitializing meteorology every 2 d, we do not consider the feedbacks of aerosol on large-scale circulation, but fast processes, such as aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds, LTS, and subsidence are accounted for in the model simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hourly BB aerosol emissions are generated from SEVIRI satellite observations of fire radiative power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See SI Appendix for more details.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By comparing the results of the P case against the C case and M case, we are able to quantify the total effects (direct + semidirect + microphysical effects) and direct + semidirect effects of BB aerosols, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To corroborate the WRF-Chem results, we run the nested WRF model in the large-eddy simulation mode (37) at a horizontal resolution with the innermost nest of 66.7 m over four subdomains centered over SEA, driven by the meteorology and aerosol fields modeled by WRF-Chem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See SI Appendix for more details on WRF-Chem and WRF-LES model configurations.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeled aerosol and cloud fields are compared and evaluated against satellite observations whenever possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See SI Appendix for more details on the description of satellite data.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in cloud properties and shortwave fluxes at TOA between different aerosol scenarios aid in the interpretation of the semidirect and microphysical effects of BB aerosols on cloud properties and the radiative energy budget.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
