Cancer-secreted hsa-miR-940 induces an osteoblastic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment via targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prostate cancer is one of most common cancers in men worldwide, and osteoblastic bone metastasis is frequently observed in prostate cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms responsible for the predominantly osteoblastic phenotype have not been fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer-secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) were recently shown to be significant in the modification of the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, hsa-miR-940, which was highly secreted by prostate cancer cells, promoted osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the bone metastatic microenvironment in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a demonstration that osteoblastic bone metastasis can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bone metastatic lesions are classified as osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prostate and breast cancer patients frequently exhibit osteoblastic-type and osteolytic-type bone metastasis, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In metastatic lesions, tumor cells interact with many different cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms responsible for the modification of bone remodeling have not been fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred between cells via exosomes and serve as intercellular communication tools, and numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer-secreted miRNAs are capable of modifying the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted by several human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs that were highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-940, significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are commonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line, the implantation of miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors by facilitating the osteogenic differentiation of host mesenchymal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the phenotypes of bone metastases can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identifying_Exosomal_miRNAs_Markedly_Secreted_by_Osteoblastic_Phenotype-Inducing_Cancer_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on previous studies, we divided human cancer cell lines into two groups: osteoblastic phenotype- and osteolytic phenotype-inducing cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The osteoblastic phenotype-inducing cancer cell lines included human prostate cancer cell lines (e.g., C4, C4-2, and C4-2B) and represent the osteoblastic phenotype when the cells are implanted into the tibia of immunodeficient mice (Fig 1A) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, human breast cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231-Luc) and human myeloma cell lines (e.g., KMS11 and U266) are known to induce the osteolytic phenotype in bone metastatic lesions (Fig 1A) (6, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the expression profile of miRNAs in exosomes secreted by the above osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype-inducing cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cancer-secreted exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of the culture supernatant (Fig S1A), and total RNAs, including miRNAs, were extracted from the isolated exosomes and subjected to miRNA microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In advance of the analysis, we confirmed that the exosomal RNAs had an abundance of small RNAs compared with cellular RNAs (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comprehensive microarray analysis showed that eight human miRNAs, hsa-miR-99a-5p, 125b-2-3p, 141-3p, 200a-3p, 200b-3p, 200c-3p, 940, and 1260a, were highly expressed in the exosomes secreted by osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines compared with the exosomes from osteolytic phenotype-inducing cell lines (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

hsa-miR-940_Promotes_the_Osteogenic_Differentiation_of_Human_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize the transfer of miRNA-containing exosomes from cancer cells to mesenchymal cells, we constructed a retroviral vector containing CD63, which is a well-known exosome marker (13), fused with improved yellow fluorescent protein (Venus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then established a CD63-Venus stably expressing cancer cell line, C4-2B-CD63-Venus, using a retroviral infection system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Venus-labeled exosomes were isolated from the supernatant of the cells by ultracentrifugation and added to tdTomato-expressing immortalized human mesenchymal stem cell lines (hMSCs) (Fig 2A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 24-h culture, we detected Venus-labeled exosomes incorporated into hMSCs (Fig 2A, Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that the expression of ALPL was significantly up-regulated in hMSCs cultured with the exosomes for 48 h (Fig 2A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that miRNA-containing exosomes derived from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing cell lines have the potential to promote the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effect of the cancer-secreted miRNAs that were identified in Fig 1B on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, each miRNA mimic was subsequently transfected into hMSCs, and the cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 14-d osteogenic induction, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay revealed that the overexpression of miR-940 or miR-1260a significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs as shown by the increase in the ALP activity (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 28-d induction, von Kossa staining was performed to investigate the effect of the miRNAs on the matrix mineralization of hMSCs, and miR-940 overexpression induced extensive mineralized nodules (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also established stable miR-940overexpressing hMSCs using a lentiviral infection system, and the osteogenic potential of the cells was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 7-d osteogenic induction, miR-940overexpressing hMSCs showed significantly increased ALP activity, as well as a higher expression of osteogenic markers than the empty vector-infected hMSCs (Fig 2D and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mineralized areas of the cultured cells were also significantly increased in miR-940overexpressing hMSCs after a 28-d osteogenic induction (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, miR-940 overexpression in human osteoclast precursor cells, which were isolated from CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, did not affect osteoclastogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated osteoclasts was not altered by miR-940 overexpression (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene expression of an osteoclast marker, CTSK, was also not changed (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ARHGAP1_and_FAM134A_Are_Targets_of_hsa-miR-940_to_Promote_Osteogenic_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the target genes of hsa-miR-940 to regulate osteogenic differentiation, we performed in silico analysis using four target prediction databases: Target Scan (17), miRDB (18), miRanda (19), and miRWalk (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the analysis, 19 candidate genes were identified as targets of miR-940 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether miR-940 regulates osteogenic differentiation through targeting these genes, hMSCs were transfected with siRNA of each candidate gene and cultured in osteogenic induction medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 14-d osteogenic induction, the down-regulation of ARHGAP1 and FAM134A significantly increased the ALP activity of hMSCs (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hMSCs with stable overexpression of ARHGAP1 or FAM134A also showed a significant decrease in the ALP activity of the cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also confirmed that miR-940 overexpression in hMSCs decreased ARHGAP1 and FAM134A protein levels, as well as their mRNA expression levels (Fig 3 D and E), indicating that ARHGAP1 and FAM134A were targets of miR-940.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the in silico analysis, ARHGAP1 and FAM134A have the binding sites for miR-940 in each 3UTR region (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that miR-940 binds to the lesions, we performed a luciferase activity assay using a reporter plasmid in which the above putative miR-940 binding sites were cloned into the 3UTR of the luciferase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the in silico prediction, transient overexpression of miR-940 significantly decreased the luciferase activity of both binding sites of ARHGAP1 and FAM134A (Fig S3B, Left), whereas each mutation in these binding sites abrogated the response to miR-940 (Fig S3B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-940 also significantly decreased the luciferase activity of a construct harboring the entire length of the ARHGAP1 or FAM134A 3UTR (Fig S3C, Left), and mutations in the binding sites of the 3UTR diminished the response to miR-940 (Fig S3C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that miR-940 promotes osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cancer-Secreted_hsa-miR-940_Is_Transferred_via_Exosomes_to_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells_and_Promotes_Osteogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether miR-940 overexpression in the osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cells would induce the characteristics of osteoblastic phenotype-inducing cancer cells, we established hsa-miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells using a lentiviral infection system (Fig 4A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empty vector-infected MDA-MB-231 cells were also established as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with the genomic fragment of pri-mir-940, the overexpressing cells showed higher expression of mature miR-940 as well as pri-mir-940 compared with the control cells (Fig 4A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosomes from the miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Exo-miR-940) or exosomes from the empty vector-infected cells (Exo-control) were added to the culture medium of hMSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exo-miR-940incorporated hMSCs showed a higher expression of mature miR-940 than Exo-control-incorporated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the expression level of pri-mir-940 was not altered (Fig 4A, Right), suggesting that the increased expression of miR-940 in the Exo-miR-940incorporated hMSCs was due to the transfer of mature miR-940 via exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, to investigate whether miR-940 is enriched in the exosomes from miR-940overexpressing cells, MDA-MB-231-CD63-Venus cells were transfected with miR-940 mimic, and Venus+ exosomes were sorted from the culture supernatant by flow cytometry using magnetic beads (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR analysis showed that miR-940 was significantly expressed in the exosomes from miR-940overexpressing cancer cells (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the expression of ALPL and targets of miR-940 in the Exo-miR-940incorporated hMSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR analysis showed that the expression of ALPL was significantly up-regulated in hMSCs cultured with Exo-miR-940 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis revealed that the protein levels of ARHGAP1 and FAM134A were down-regulated in the cells (Fig 4C), suggesting that the exosomes from miR-940overexpressing cells were incorporated into the hMSCs and promoted the osteogenic differentiation of the cells by regulating the targets of miR-940.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cancer-Secreted_hsa-miR-940_Induced_Osteoblastic_Lesions_in_the_Bone_Microenvironment_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether miR-940 overexpression can induce an osteoblastic phenotype in bone metastatic lesions in vivo, we established two clones of miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231-CD63-Venus cells, miR-940-H1 and miR-940-H2, which exhibited different levels of miR-940 overexpression (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clonal cells were implanted on the calvarial bones of immunodeficient mice (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mouse model is useful to assess the interaction between implanted cancer cells and host cells in the bone microenvironment (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells formed tumors with extensive mineralized tissues inside (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E or von Kossa staining confirmed that the mineralized tissues were composed of bone matrix and surrounded by osteoblast-like cells or osteoids (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of osteoblastic lesions correlated with the overexpression levels of miR-940 (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were also injected into the tibiae of immunodeficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miR-940-overexpressing cells also induced osteoblastic lesions at the tibial sites (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, to ensure that the osteoblastic lesions were induced by the transfer of miR-940containing exosomes in vivo, CD63 fused with red fluorescent protein (CD63-tdTomato) was stably transduced into miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, and the cells were implanted on the calvarial bones of GFP-transgenic nude mice with ubiquitous GFP expression (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy analysis of the developed tumors showed that tdTomato-labeled exosomes secreted by the cancer cells were incorporated into GFP-expressing host cells (Fig S6B, arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we dissociated the developed tumors and isolated GFP+ host cells using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extracted proteins from the sorted cells and performed Western blot analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the protein levels of the miR-940 target genes, Arhgap1 and Fam134a, were suppressed in the GFP+ host cells that incorporated cancer cell-derived exosomes (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed immunofluorescent staining of the osteoblastic lesions using primary antibodies against ALP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy analysis showed that GFP-expressing host cells around the osteoblastic lesions expressed ALP, suggesting that the osteogenic potential of host cells was up-regulated by cancer cell-derived exosomes (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the expression level of miR-940 in bone metastatic lesions of prostate cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three samples were analyzed for qPCR analysis, and the results showed that two samples had higher expression of miR-940 compared with human nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1 cells) or bone tissues (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide, and osteoblastic-type bone metastasis is observed in up to 70% of patients with prostate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone metastasis can cause severe pain, pathological fractures, and spinal cord compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying bone metastasis can facilitate the development of new therapeutic options and improve patient survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bone microenvironment comprises osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and many other cell types, including MSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is believed that the cross-talk between metastasized cancer cells and the surrounding bone cells is critical for the formation of the osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that metastasized prostate cancer cells secrete several osteotropic factors, such as BMPs, VEGF, PDGF, and ET-1, and promote osteoblastic-type bone metastasis (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying such factors is important because the signaling pathways mediated by the molecules may be potential targets to prevent or treat osteoblastic-type bone metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
miRNAs also serve as important intercellular communication tools, as they are transferred between cells via exosomes and influence the phenotypes of their recipient cells (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have shown that cancer-secreted miRNAs can modify the tumor microenvironment to facilitate tumor development, progression, and metastasis (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings raise the possibility that bone remodeling in the bone metastatic lesions can be regulated by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of cancer-secreted miRNAs in the bone metastatic phenotype is not yet understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our study, miRNA microarray analysis identified eight human miRNAs that were highly expressed in the exosomes isolated from the prostate cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro analysis showed that hsa-miR-940 significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, several studies have shown that miR-940 plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and apoptosis in various types of cancers (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of miR-940 in bone metabolism has not previously been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our study reveals the osteogenic effect of cancer-secreted miR-940.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether miR-940 is generally expressed in prostate cancer cell lines that induce osteoblastic bone metastasis, we also examined the expression of miR-940 in other osteoblastic phenotype-inducing cancer cell lines, VCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression level of miR-940 in these cells was comparable to that observed in the osteolytic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3 cells (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that miR-940 is not generally involved in the induction of osteoblastic bone metastasis of prostate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VCaP or MDA-PCa-2b cells might induce osteoblastic bone metastasis via different mechanisms, such as prostatic acid phosphatase, BMP-2, TGF-, bFGF, or other soluble osteoblast-stimulating factors (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified ARHGAP1 and FAM134A as targets of hsa-miR-940 in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP1 is a factor comprising GTPase-activating proteins, which enhance intrinsic GTPase activity, leading to G protein inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have reported that ARHGAP1 regulated the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting RhoA/ROCK signaling (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RhoA/ROCK signaling is known to be involved in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have also reported that the RhoA/ROCK pathway stimulated osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells and that inhibition of the pathway reduced hMSC osteogenesis (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, ARHGAP1 overexpression decreased the ALP activity levels of hMSCs (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inhibitory effect may be attributable to RhoA/ROCK pathway suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAM134A is broadly expressed in many types of adult and fetal tissues, as well as cancer tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study showed that FAM134A played important roles in promoting tumor metastasis by enhancing cancer cell invasion, mobility, and adherence capabilities (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological function of FAM134A in osteogenesis remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-MB-231 cells are commonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, which had a miR-940 expression level comparable to C4 lineage cell lines (Fig 4A and Fig S7), and implanted the cells on the calvaria of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors (Fig 5 C and D), indicating that miR-940 is a crucial osteogenic factor in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrated that the osteoblastic lesions were induced by the transfer of exosomes from cancer cells to host stromal cells (Fig S6B) and that the osteogenic activity of host cells was up-regulated through suppressing the protein levels of Arhgap1 and Fam134a (Fig 5E and Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-940overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were also implanted into the subcutaneous tissues of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, osteoblastic lesions were not observed in the developed tumors (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicated that the osteoblastic lesions induced by miR-940 overexpression could be microenvironment-dependent and that additional factors in the bone microenvironment may mediate the formation of the osteoblastic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, in preliminary analyses, we also showed that miR-940 enhanced the resistance of cancer cells against chemotherapy agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, advanced prostate or breast cancers become hormone-independent and rapidly develop resistance to chemotherapy, leading to aggressive bone metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent numerous studies have shown the significance of miRNAs in cancer therapeutic response or drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several miRNAs were also identified as predictive biomarkers of drug resistance (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our high-throughput inhibitor screening revealed that miR-940 increased resistance to several chemotherapy agents, such as 5-FU, methotrexate, and vinblastine (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we demonstrated that prostate cancer-secreted hsa-miR-940 promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro and induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the bone metastatic microenvironment in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a demonstration that a cancer-secreted miRNA induced osteoblastic-type bone metastasis, serving as an osteotropic factor in the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
