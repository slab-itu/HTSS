Substance P induces plasticity and synaptic tagging/capture in rat hippocampal area CA2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hippocampal area Cornu Ammonis (CA) CA2 is a small region interposed between CA1 and CA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a long time, there has been a lack of information on the CA2 areas role in memory formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This area is innervated by supramammillary axonal fibers that are rich with Substance P (SP), which acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that SP induces an NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent potentiation of CA2 synapses that requires kinases such as CaMKIV and PKM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SP-induced effects on Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses transform entorhinal cortical-CA2 short-term potentiation into long-term potentiation, thereby expressing synaptic tagging and capture, an associative property of neuronal populations that engage in consolidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hippocampal area Cornu Ammonis (CA) CA2 is important for social interaction and is innervated by Substance P (SP)-expressing supramammillary (SuM) nucleus neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP exerts neuromodulatory effects on pain processing and central synaptic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide evidence that SP can induce a slowly developing NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission that can be induced not only at entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 synapses but also at long-term potentiation (LTP)-resistant Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SP-induced potentiation of SC-CA2 synapses transforms a short-term potentiation of EC-CA2 synaptic transmission into LTP, consistent with the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this SP-induced potentiation and associative interaction between the EC and SC inputs of CA2 neurons is independent of the GABAergic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CaMKIV and PKM play a critical role in the SP-induced effects on SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, afferents from SuM neurons are ideally situated to prime CA2 synapses for the formation of long-lasting plasticity and associativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The average values of the slope function of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) per time point (20, 21) were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (henceforth Wilcoxon test) when compared within the same group (before and after induction of synaptic plasticity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MannWhitney U test was applied when compared between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Students t test at the P less_than 0.05 significance level was used for the analysis of RT-PCR (22) and Western blot results (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed descriptions of statistical analysis of each experiment are provided in SI Methods and Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Slice_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For electrophysiology, a total of 244 hippocampal slices were prepared from 124 male Wistar rats (57 wk old).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal procedures were approved by guidelines from the institutional animal care and use committee of the National University of Singapore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after anesthetization by using CO2, the rats were decapitated and brains were quickly removed, followed by isolation of the right hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hippocampus remained cooled in 4 °C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 17 d-glucose equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (Carbogen) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH of the aCSF was maintained at 7.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transverse slices (400 µm) from the right and left hippocampus were prepared by using a manual tissue chopper, transferred onto a nylon net in an interface chamber (Scientific Systems Design), and incubated at 32°C for 3 h. An aCSF flow rate of 1 mL/min and carbogen consumption of 16 L/h were maintained throughout the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole process was carried out within 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_Potential_Recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For most of the experiments, three monopolar lacquer-coated stainless steel electrodes (A-M Systems) were positioned in the hippocampal area CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulating electrodes were located in SCs (CA3  CA2) and cortical fibers (EC  CA2), and the fEPSPs were recorded from the distal dendritic region of the CA2 neurons (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the DPCPX experiment, an extra pair of electrodes was used to simultaneously stimulate SC-CA1 synapses and record the fEPSP from the distal dendritic region of CA1 (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another experimental paradigm, to compare the SP-induced potentiation in CA1, CA2, and CA3, three stimulating electrodes were used to simultaneously stimulate the SC-CA2, SC-CA1, and MF-CA3 synapses (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fEPSPs were recorded distally from CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signals were amplified by a differential amplifier and digitized by using a CED 1401 unit (Cambridge Electronic Design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the incubation period, an input/output curve (stimulus intensity vs. fEPSP slope) was plotted, and the test stimulus intensity was set to obtain an fEPSP slope of 40% of the maximum amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The independence of the two different synaptic inputs was evaluated by the absence of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in a modified cross-input PPF protocol at an interpulse interval of 50 ms. A PPF was observed if the same synaptic input was activated with an interval of 50 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A stable baseline was recorded for at least 30 min before the induction of electrical or SP-mediated LTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce an early LTP, WTET, consisting of a single high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 21 pulses) was applied, whereas, for L-LTP, STET involving repeated high-frequency stimulations (three trains of 100 Hz, 100 pulses) with an intertrain interval of 10 min was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole-Cell_Voltage-Clamp_Recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of evoked EPSCs were recorded from the soma of visually identified pyramidal neurons (i.e., larger) located within the CA2 region of the hippocampus (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patch pipettes (46 M) were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 135 CsMeSO3, 8 NaCl, 10 Hepes, 0.25 EGTA, 2 Mg2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 0.1 spermine, 7 phosphocreatine, and 5 QX-314 (pH 7.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Series (i.e., access) resistance was within the range of 1535 M throughout each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Access resistance, membrane resistance, and membrane capacitance were monitored to ensure that the stability and the health of cells were maintained during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were considered stable when the membrane resistance, membrane capacitance, and holding current did not change by more than 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were held at a holding potential of 70 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The triple patch-clamp EPC10 patch-clamp amplifier and software Patch-master (HEKA Electronics) were used for data acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a CED 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge Electronic Design) and a custom-made software program were used to regulate stimulation and to record evoked EPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPSCs were evoked by stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers in the stratum radiatum of CA2 by using a tungsten stimulating electrode (AM Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schaffer collateral projections were stimulated at 0.05 Hz by 200-ms voltage pulses generated by an isolated pulse stimulator (Model 2100; AM Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulation strength (25 V) was adjusted to evoke EPSCs with amplitude of approximately 50 pA. Basal synaptic current was recorded for at least 10 min before LTP induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SP (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1156; Tocris) was stored at 20 °C as a 2.5-mM stock in deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before application for 15 min, the stock solution was diluted to a final concentration of 5 µM in aCSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compound application time remained constant in all experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein synthesis inhibitor EME dihydrochloride (E2375; Sigma-Aldrich) was stored at 20 °C as a 20-mM stock solution prepared in deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stock was diluted to a final concentration of 20 µM in aCSF and applied for a total time period of 60 min, beginning 20 min before STET (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 E and F and 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the other group of experiments, the same working concentration of EME (20 µM) was applied 15 min before and after coapplication with SP (total application time, 45 min; Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANI (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1290; Tocris) was stored at 20 °C as 25-mM stock in DMSO and was diluted to a final working concentration of 25 µM in aCSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to EME, ANI was applied for 60 min, starting 20 min before STET (Fig 3 C and D), whereas, in another group of experiments, it was applied 15 min before and after coapplication with SP (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CaMKIV inhibitor KN-93 (1 mg in solution; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  422712; Calbiochem) and its corresponding inactive control KN92 (solid; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  422709; Calbiochem) were stored at 20 °C as a 10-mM stock in DMSO and diluted with aCSF to achieve a final concentration of 10 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KN-93 and its control KN-92 were applied 15 min before and after coapplication with SP (total application time, 45 min; Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM antisense oligonucleotides (5-C*T*C* TTG GGA AGG CAT *G*A*C-3) Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and its scrambled control (5-A*A*C*AAT GGG TCG TCT *C*G*G-3) were stored at 20 °C as 2-mM stocks in 1× Tris-EDTA buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both were diluted in aCSF to obtain a final concentration of 20 µM and applied throughout the experiment (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 100-µM stock solution of DPCPX (C101; Sigma-Aldrich), a potent adenosine receptor antagonist, was prepared in DMSO and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final working concentration of DPCPX was 10 nM and was applied for 15 min (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 50-mM stock of d-AP5 (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0106; Tocris), a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was prepared in deionized water and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A working solution of 50 µM d-AP5 was made in aCSF and applied 15 min before and after coapplication with SP (total application time, 45 min; Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-733060 hydrochloride (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1145; Tocris) is a potent NK1 receptor antagonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stock solution of 5 mM was prepared in deionized water and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A final 5-µM working solution was prepared in aCSF and bath-applied 15 min before and further coapplied with SP (total application time, 45 min; Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GABAA antagonist PTX (100 µM; P1675; Sigma-Aldrich) and the GABAB antagonist CGP 55845 hydrochloride (2 µM; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1248; Tocris) were prepared freshly in aCSF before the experiments were conducted (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Collection_for_Gene_and_Protein_Expression_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 60 slices from three biological samples (three male Wistar rats, 57 wk old) were prepared from right and left hippocampi for CaMKIV and PKM gene and protein expression analysis (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NK1 gene expression analysis, approximately 100 slices from five biological samples were used (n = 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Extraction_and_Real-Time_Quantitative_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the relative expression of NK1 mRNA (Fig S1), the whole hippocampus was isolated and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions were isolated under a dissection microscope at 4 °C from the frozen hippocampus, manually prepared by perpendicular cuts along the septaltemporal axis of the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CA2 region from naïve rat control was also prepared in the same way (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the relative mRNA expression of CaMKIV and PKM (Fig S6), the control slices and SP-treated slices were snap-frozen immediately after electrophysiology recording, i.e., after 240 min, and CA2 regions were isolated carefully under a dissection microscope at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy Mini kit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74106; Qiagen) and quantified by using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following various treatments to the slices, RLT lysis buffer was prepared by adding 10 L of -mercaptoethanol per milliliter of RLT buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 600 L of RLT lysis buffer was added to each sample, and a 1-mL syringe was used to homogenize the lysate thoroughly by sucking in and out the lysate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethanol 70% was then added to the cell lysate, mixed well, and transferred to the RNeasy spin column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Rotor FA-45-24-11, Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424 R) at room temperature for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the subsequent steps, RW1 and RPE buffers were added to the spin columns to remove the unwanted materials, and flow-through was discarded after each step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the final step, 20 L of nuclease-free water was added to the spin column to elute the bound RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spectrophotometer was used to quantify RNA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
cDNA synthesis was carried out by using a GoScript Reverse Transcription System (cat no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A5000; Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 1 g of RNA was subjected to preheating with 2 L Oligo(dT) at 72 °C for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 1 h followed by 95 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a StepOne Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) was used to carry out the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) with TaqMan universal PCR master mix (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4304437; Thermo Scientific) and TaqMan probes specific for NK1 receptor (NK1/Tacr1, Rn00562004_m1; lot no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1366947), PKM (Prkcz FAM, Rn01520438_m1; lot no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P160302_001 E01), and CaMKIV (Camk4, Rn00664802_m1; lot no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1594469).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles each of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK1, PKMZ, and CaMKIV gene expressions were measured in duplicate and were normalized with the internal control GAPDH (Gapdh, Rn01775763_g1; lot no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1523580).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold changes of NK1, PKMZ, and CaMKIV gene expressions were calculated according to the 2Ct method (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SP_Induces_NMDA_Receptor-_and_Protein_Synthesis-Dependent_Long-_Lasting_Potentiation_in_the_Hippocampal_Area_CA2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we evaluated the distribution of SP receptors (i.e., NK1) in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions and observed a higher level of NK1 transcripts in CA2 and CA3 compared with CA1 (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then investigated if direct application of SP can induce plasticity in areas CA1, CA2, and CA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using fEPSP recordings (Fig 1A) from the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions at the same time, we observed that bath application of SP (5 µM) for 15 min resulted in a slowly developing long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission only in area CA2 (Fig 1B, blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant potentiation was observed in SC-CA2 synapses starting from the 30th minute (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.04) and lasting as long as 3 h (180 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither SC-CA1 (Fig 1B, pink circles) nor mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 (Fig 1B, green circles) synapses showed statistically significant potentiation at any recorded time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An earlier study showed that application of an antagonist of adenosine A1 receptor, 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), induced plasticity only in area CA2 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed these findings by using a similar simultaneous stimulation and recording of CA2 and CA1 regions of hippocampal slices (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, bath application of DPCPX (10 nM) for 15 min induced a slowly developing potentiation in SC-CA2 (Fig S2C, red circles) and EC-CA2 (Fig S2C, blue circles) synapses, but not in the CA1 area (pink circles; Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline responses recorded without DPCPX remained stable in all synaptic inputs (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, electrophysiological investigation by using paired-pulse stimulation between the two inputs (50-ms interstimulus interval; Fig S2D) confirmed that we recorded from independent SC and EC synaptic inputs in CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the focus of the study was on SC-CA2 and EC-CA2, we restricted future recordings to these synapses by using two-pathway experiments (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been noted previously that the SC synapses in area CA2 are resistant to the induction of activity-dependent plasticity such as LTP, whereas EC synapses are not (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented in Fig S3 are consistent with earlier findings (4, 5) and provide additional evidence that we were studying the exact CA2 synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further explored the effects of SP on EC-CA2 and SC-CA2 synaptic inputs (Fig 1D) and noticed that SP could induce a slowly developing potentiation in SC (from the 40th minute; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.008) and EC synapses (from the 30th minute; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.007) that lasted for 4 h (Fig 1D, blue and red circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed potentiation was found to be NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent (Fig S4 AC), and the potentiation was completely abolished in the presence of SP receptor (i.e., NK1) antagonist L-733060 (5 µM; Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, there is a reasonable possibility that extracellular recording from area CA2 may not be appropriate to monitor fEPSPs from SC and EC that are purely from CA2 because distal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons are very likely to be stimulated with the stimulating electrodes in area CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check this possibility, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA2 pyramidal neurons (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline stimulation in SC-CA2 for 10 min followed by bath application of SP for 15 min resulted in a statistically significant potentiation from the seventh minute that lasted as long as 60 min (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.005; Fig 1E, blue circles), whereas control stimulation without SP resulted in relatively stable potentials throughout the experimental period (Fig 1F, blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Test_Stimulation_Is_Required_for_the_Expression_of_SP_Potentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have reported earlier that test stimulation is critical for expressing dopamine or D1/D5 receptor agonist-induced potentiation (2628).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspending test stimulation during dopamine or D1/D5 agonist application prevented the expression of plasticity in those inputs, and we had used those silenced inputs to study the STC interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested whether test stimulation during SP application was necessary to express SP-mediated plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of experiments was conducted to test the requirements of test stimulations in SP-induced plasticity in SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 synaptic inputs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2 A and B, SP was applied to the bath medium, but test pulses were suspended in EC-CA2 (Fig 2A, red circles) or in SC-CA2 (Fig 2B, blue circles) for the subsequent hour (total of 60 min including the SP application period of 15 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-induced potentiation was not observed in the synaptic inputs that did not receive test stimulation during SP application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow onset potentiation observed in SC-CA2 (Fig 2A, blue circles) and EC-CA2 (Fig 2B, red circles) was significantly different from the 30th and 20th minutes onward compared with their own baselines (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.017 and P = 0.017).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2C, SP was applied to the bath medium, but, in both EC and SC synaptic inputs, the baseline recordings were suspended at the time of SP application and for the subsequent 1 h. In both synaptic inputs, the potentials remained stable at baseline levels, and there was no significant potentiation compared with the respective baseline values before drug application (Wilcoxon test, P  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control experiments displayed in Fig 2D used the same experimental design as in Fig 2C, but the baseline recordings were suspended for 1 h without SP application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline values in EC-CA2 and SC-CA2 inputs showed stable recordings before and after suspending the test stimulation (Fig 2D, red and blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, test stimulation during SP application is critical for the expression of long-lasting plasticity in SC and EC synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SP-Induced_Plasticity_Expresses_STC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the STC paradigm, application of a weak stimulation such as a single tetanization [weak tetanization (WTET); Methods] or repeated tetanization [strong tetanization (STET); Methods] in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors results in only a transient form of plasticity, early LTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this process is able to mark the synapses to set synaptic tags (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synaptic tags can then presumably capture plasticity factors from nearby strong inputs [inputs that express protein synthesis-dependent late LTP (L-LTP)], eventually expressing long-lasting plasticity (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a series of experiments within the STC framework to determine whether SP could cause the expression of PRPs that contribute to the potentiation of tagged synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, STC was studied by using a strong-before-weak paradigm (SBW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, SP-induced potentiation was considered strong because of its protein synthesis dependency and its long-lasting nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study STC in the framework of SBW, a 30-min stable baseline was recorded from SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 inputs (Fig 3B, blue and red circles) before the bath application of SP for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The test stimulation in EC-CA2 (Fig 3B, red circles) was suspended during SP application period and for the subsequent 1 h, whereas synaptic responses in SC-CA2 (Fig 3B, blue circles) was recorded continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the findings depicted in Fig 2A, SC-CA2 expressed statistically significant potentiation starting from the 40th minute (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.013) whereas no potentiation was observed in EC-CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An early-LTP protocol (i.e., WTET) was delivered to EC-CA2 (Fig 3B) 30 min after resuming the baseline stimulation in this input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed an expression of L-LTP at weakly stimulated EC-CA2 synaptic input (Fig 3B, red circles) that, without SP, would have decayed back to the baseline level (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next step was to test whether continuous stimulation of SC was required during SP application to prime EC-CA2 synapses to express late plasticity or if SP application during the suspension of stimulation was sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S5A, stopping the test stimulation entirely in SC-CA2 (Fig S5A, blue circles) 60 min after SP application still primed the EC-CA2 synapses to express L-LTP (Fig S5A, red circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, suspending test stimulation in SC-CA2 during SP application and then for as long as 60 min did not prime the EC-CA2 to express L-LTP (Fig S5B, red circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, suspending test stimulation in SC-CA2 during SP application and then as long as 60 min, followed by the application of STET 30 min after resuming the test stimulation, also failed to induce plasticity in this input (Fig S5C, blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, the EC-CA2 input received test stimulation throughout the recording period of 240 min and displayed statistically significant potentiation starting from the 40th minute throughout the recording period (Fig S5C, red circles; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.027).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we confirmed the STC experiments by using a strong-before-strong (SBS) paradigm (29) using the same experimental design as in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, instead of early LTP, L-LTP was induced in EC-CA2 in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (ANI; 25 M) or emetine (EME; 20 M), that resulted in an L-LTP in the EC-CA2 input (Fig 3 D and F, red circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC-CA2 showed statistically significant potentiation from the 30th minute to the end of the recording (Fig 3 D and F, blue circles; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.017 and P = 0.016, respectively), and EC-CA2 showed statistically significant potentiation immediately after STET (Fig 3 D and F, red circles; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.012 and P = 0.003, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the drug was applied 20 min before and continued for 40 min after the first tetanization of STET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control experiments depicted in Fig 3 C and E used the same experimental design as of Fig 3 D and F except that SC-CA2 was not recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of L-LTP in the presence of ANI (Fig 3C) or EME (Fig 3E) in these experimental conditions resulted in only early LTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant potentiation was present only up to the 205th minute in Fig 3C (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.04) and up to the 215th minute in Fig 3E (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.018).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In short, SP-induced long-lasting plasticity participates in late associative processes reminiscent of STC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CaMKIV_and_PKM_Are_Required_for_SP-Induced_Plasticity_and_Associativity_in_Area_CA2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that CaMKIV and PKM can play important roles in maintaining long-term plasticity and STC in hippocampal area CA1 (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether these molecules may play a role in SP-induced plasticity and associativity in area CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been reported that many genes are robustly activated or down-regulated at the mRNA level upon cutting slices, and that these changes can persist for 6 h (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude this possibility, we have first determined the mRNA level in area CA2 from naïve rat tissue for reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of mRNA in naïve rat hippocampus and control hippocampal slices did not show any significant difference (Fig S6; more details provided in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we determined the expression levels of CaMKIV and PKM mRNAs in area CA2 before and after the establishment of SP-induced potentiation (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed significantly higher expression of CaMKIV and PKM mRNA after SP application (P less_than 0.05; Fig S6) compared with control (unstimulated) slices and naïve (i.e., not sliced) CA2 tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings motivated us to test whether pharmacological inhibition of CaMKIV or PKM abolishes SP-induced long-lasting plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this notion by inhibiting CaMKIV with KN-93 (10 µM) and inhibiting PKM with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (20 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coapplication of KN-93 along with SP completely abolished SP-induced potentiation in SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 inputs (Fig 4A, red and blue circles), whereas a nonactive version of the drug KN-92 (10 µM) did not prevent SP-induced potentiation (Fig 4B, red and blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant potentiation was observed in SC and EC-CA2 inputs from the 10th and 35th minutes (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.046 and P = 0.03, respectively), which lasted for 240 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, continuous PKM inhibition by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (20 M) during the incubation and the entire recording period prevented SP-induced potentiation (Fig 4D, red and blue circles), whereas a control scrambled version left SP-induced potentiation intact (Fig 4E, red and blue circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potentiation observed in SC- and EC-CA2 inputs showed statistical significance starting from the 70th and 50th minutes onward (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.018 and P = 0.03, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockdown experiments of PKM by antisense and scrambled oligodeoxynucleotides were validated by Western blot analysis (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further quantified the CaMKIV and PKM protein levels by Western blot analysis and Fig 4 C, a and b, and F, a and b, show compelling evidence that phosphorylated CaMKIV and total PKM are significantly increased in area CA2 after the application of SP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have shown that CaMKIV is activated by phosphorylation in the CA1 area of hippocampus after LTP induction (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed a change in the phosphorylation activity of CaMKIV in the area CA2, rather than the total amount of proteins after SP-induced potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Western blot analysis showed that total CaMKIV level did not change after SP treatment, but phosphorylated CaMKIV (p-CaMKIV) showed a significant increase after SP treatment in area CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized p-CaMKIV protein expression with the respective total CaMKIV protein expression to measure the change in the fraction of total proteins that have been phosphorylated and thereby activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-induced CaMKIV activity by phosphorylation may increase the expression of CaMKK enzymes, which are known to phosphorylate the CaM kinase cascade (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the contrary, new PKM proteins are synthesized during LTP, as an elevated level of Ca2+ can activate different types of kinases (such as CaMKII and PKA) that can remove the translational block of PKM mRNA and subsequently synthesize new proteins (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for PKM protein expression, we preferred to show the total amount of proteins that were synthesized during SP-induced potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SP-Induced_Plasticity_and_Associativity_in_Area_CA2_Is_Independent_of_the_GABAergic_Transmission  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many different classes of interneurons strongly express SP in all fields of the hippocampus (10), and the NK1 receptor is expressed by several different interneuron populations in the hippocampus (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we cannot rule out the possibility of the release of SP by interneurons in the hippocampal slices by electrical stimulation in SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we have repeated some of the critical experiments in the presence of GABAA or GABAB receptor antagonists to determine whether GABAergic transmission is required for SP-induced potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first of this series of experiments displayed in Fig 1D was repeated in the presence of an inhibitor of GABAA receptors, picrotoxin (PTX; 100 M), and GABAB receptors CGP55845 (2 M), applied together during the entire incubation and recording period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-induced potentiation was intact in SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 synaptic inputs (Fig 5A, blue and red circles) irrespective of the complete blockade of GABAergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both synaptic inputs showed statistically significant potentiation from the 20th and 30th minutes (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.027 and P = 0.046) onward, and lasted to the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we repeated the STC experiments displayed in Fig 3 B and F in the presence of inhibitors of GABAA and GABAB receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, even during the continuous inhibition of GABAergic transmission, STC initiated by SP was successfully established within the framework of tetanus-induced potentiation in SBW (Fig 5B) or SBS (Fig 5C) configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-induced potentiation in SC-CA2 showed statistically significant potentiation from the 25th and 15th minutes in Fig 5 B and C (blue circles; P = 0.018 and P = 0.046, respectively) and remained stable from the 120th minute to the end of the recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically significant LTP was expressed in EC-CA2 immediately after the application of WTET (P = 0.018; Fig 5B) or STET (P = 0.03; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In short, SP-induced plasticity and associativity in area CA2 is independent of GABAergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study provides compelling evidence that activation of NK1 receptors enables SC-CA2 synapses to respond to synaptic activation by expressing synaptic potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP in conjunction with NMDA-receptor activation induces gene expression that facilitates synaptic changes that eventually lead to long-lasting potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP shows preferential binding to the ligand-binding site of NK1 receptors (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of SP to NK1 receptors leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase, hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, mobilization of intracellular calcium ions, and activation of downstream effector molecules such as PKA, PKC, and MAPK (38), all of which have been associated with the expression of LTP (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kinases such as CaMKIV and PKM have been reported to play important roles in maintaining STC in hippocampal area CA1 (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed earlier that CaMKII can mediate the setting of synaptic tags while CaMKIV acts as a PRP (30, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, tagging of PKM from a strongly tetanized input to a weakly tetanized input is critical for the expression of STC in CA1 pyramidal neurons (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have recently reported that metaplastic activation of PKM can rescue the plasticity and associativity that is degraded under neurodegenerative conditions (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the levels of CaMKIV and PKM (PRKCZ) transcripts were significantly increased within the area CA2 after SP application, indicating that area CA2 also shares similar molecular pathways as CA1 during the establishment of SP-induced potentiation and its associativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the CaM kinase inhibitor used in this study, KN-93, has a broad spectrum of specificity for inhibiting CaM kinases (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low concentration of KN-93 (1 M) is enough to impair synaptic plasticity in brain slices (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaMKII (with a Ki of 370 nm) can be effectively blocked by a low concentration of KN-93 with much less inhibition on CaMKIV (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study by Redondo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) reported that a general CaMK inhibitor such as KN-93 at a low dose inhibits CaMKII, thus specifically impairing the synaptic tag setting process, whereas a higher concentration (10 M) of KN-93 blocks tag setting, synthesis, and availability of PRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the high concentration of KN-93 used in the present study to prevent SP-induced potentiation in area CA2 must have interfered with tag setting and PRPs (here CaMKIV) synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An intriguing observation in the present study is the requirement of test stimulation for the expression of SP-induced potentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, test stimulation was observed to be mandatory only during SP application, as experiments suspending test stimulation after establishing SP potentiation did not show interference with the STC process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, test stimulation along with SP not only helps in the setting of synaptic tags but also quickly activates the synthesis of PRPs (here CaMKIV ad PKM) that are essential for the expression of plasticity in SC-CA2 and EC-CA2 synapses of area CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, SP priming did not facilitate plasticity induction in SC-CA2 synapse, as STET failed to induce any visible plasticity, an interesting finding that needs further attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the present findings on the role of test stimulation are consistent with our earlier observation that a synergistic role of dopaminergic D1/D5- as well as NMDA receptor-function is required for the maintenance of protein synthesis-dependent long-lasting plasticity in hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal neurons (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum (4) showed that cortical inputs can drive excitation in CA2 pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of excitation in CA2 from the intrahippocampal CA3 input makes it difficult to gauge the role of CA2 in the intrahippocampal network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the feed-forward inhibition of CA3 inputs at CA2 serves to fine tune the information flow from CA3 to CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasrallah et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) showed that LTD induction at inhibitory synapses (iLTD) in CA2 results in CA2 firing upon SC stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, iLTD further increases the net excitatory drive of CA2 pyramidal neurons upon EC-LII stimulation and may serve to increase the cellular output at CA1 from the combined EC LII-dentate gyrus-CA3-CA2-CA1 and the more direct EC LII-CA2-CA1 loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory GABAergic transmission was shown to be a prerequisite for iLTD induction in CA2, as blocking of GABA receptors abolished this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study (46) had already shown that the activation of delta opioid receptors (DORs) in the inhibitory interneurons is necessary to mediate iLTD in CA2 by decreasing solely the inhibitory transmission without altering excitatory transmission from CA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nasrallah et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) showed that the increase in postsynaptic potential amplitude and action potential firing in CA2 upon HFS is also dependent on DOR activation, further confirming the role of DOR-mediated iLTD at inhibitory synapses onto CA2 in mediating potentiation in CA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a presynaptic inhibitory plasticity allows the net output of area CA2 to increase, i.e., a decrease in inhibition combined with no change in excitation leads to a net increase in CA2 pyramidal neuron output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike DORs, tachykinins are mostly known to cause a direct excitation of inhibitory interneurons and enhance the inhibitory inputs in the pyramidal neurons (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study reported by Ogier et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47) shows that hippocampal GABAergic interneurons possess tachykinin receptors (including NK1), which can engage in dual mechanisms by depressing or disinhibiting the activity of pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These receptor-bearing interneurons can indirectly inhibit other interneurons as a result of the existence of interneuron-interneuron synapses, and this action causes a partial disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, leading to an indirect excitation of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility cannot be ruled out in the case of CA2, which is enriched with a dense population of interneurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our studies did not show any difference in SP-mediated plasticity and STC processes in the presence of GABA inhibitors, it is not unlikely that the NK1 receptors in GABAergic interneurons would still be intact, even in the absence of GABAergic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, according to Liu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (48), SP can increase the intracellular calcium concentration with a rapid enhancement in glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn can activate more NMDA receptors and result in a large and long-lasting excitatory postsynaptic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an indirect inhibition and/or disinhibition of CA2 pyramidal neurons may play a critical role in maintaining SP-mediated plasticity in area CA2 during the inhibition of GABAergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the exact mechanism of SP-mediated neuromodulation in CA2 during the inhibition of GABAergic transmission is not very clear and needs further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neuromodulator SP is proposed to be related to the transmission of pain information into the central nervous system (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuromodulation of hippocampal area CA2 by SP possesses the potential to fine tune excitatory inputs onto the major hippocampal output CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of the emerging evidence of different neuromodulatory substances capable of mediating plasticity in area CA2, it is becoming increasingly clear that the plasticity limiting properties of CA2 is functionally important, requiring the right signal at the right time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social interactions and their resultant emotional repercussions could potentially influence ones day-to-day performance and ability to learn and remember.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to understand if neuromodulatory inputs onto CA2 neurons during such social interactions and resultant stressors could, in turn, modulate information flow to CA1 and thereby the net output from CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that modulation of synaptic inputs at CA2 could also have an impact on learning and memory functions other than social recognition memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As alterations to the CA2 region have been reported in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, it is of clinical significance to understand whether changes in neuromodulatory inputs to CA2 are associated with the symptomatic deficits in day-to-day performance, learning and memory, social recognition memory, and social interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response to novelty (49) and generation of hippocampal theta rhythm (5053), two critical factors for long-term memory formation and maintenance, are influenced by SuM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, given the crucial role of CA2 in social memory, it is highly likely that the SP-expressing afferents that uniquely innervate hippocampal area CA2 can potentially influence the consolidation of social memory and thereby influence social interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our future study will address the specific role of SP in area CA2 and its influence on social memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
