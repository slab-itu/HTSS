Structural and evolutionary relationships of AT-less type I polyketide synthase ketosynthases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are many differences in the sequences of ketosynthase (KS) domains from the well-studied type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) and the more recently discovered acyltransferase (AT)-less type I PKSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AT-less type I PKSs generate polyketides with a high degree of structural diversity, which stems from their evolution by horizontal gene transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, canonical type I PKSs evolve by gene duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seven structures of AT-less type I PKS KSs reveal the molecular details surrounding the evolution of substrate specificity and structural diversity, and their overall differences with canonical type I PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the mechanism of substrate specificity will allow reprogramming of the KS active sites to generate polyketide analogues by PKS and polyketide biosynthetic pathway engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) break the type I PKS paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They lack the integrated AT domains within their modules and instead use a discrete AT that acts in trans, whereas a type I PKS module minimally contains AT, acyl carrier protein (ACP), and ketosynthase (KS) domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures of canonical type I PKS KS-AT didomains reveal structured linkers that connect the two domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT-less type I PKS KSs have remnants of these linkers, which have been hypothesized to be AT docking domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural products produced by AT-less type I PKSs are very complex because of an increased representation of unique modifying domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT-less type I PKS KSs possess substrate specificity and fall into phylogenetic clades that correlate with their substrates, whereas canonical type I PKS KSs are monophyletic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have solved crystal structures of seven AT-less type I PKS KS domains that represent various sequence clusters, revealing insight into the large structural and subtle amino acid residue differences that lead to unique active site topologies and substrate specificities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One set of structures represents a larger group of KS domains from both canonical and AT-less type I PKSs that accept amino acid-containing substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One structure has a partial AT-domain, revealing the structural consequences of a type I PKS KS evolving into an AT-less type I PKS KS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures highlight the structural diversity within the AT-less type I PKS KS family, and most important, provide a unique opportunity to study the molecular evolution of substrate specificity within the type I PKSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sequence_Analysis_of_AT-Less_Type_I_PKS_KSs_and_High-Throughput_Structural_Genomics_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alignment of 456 KS domains from 43 AT-less type I PKSs with 165 KS-AT domains from 23 canonical type I PKS pathways (12 from hybrid NRPS/PKS pathways) revealed conservation in the KS cores and weak homology between the KS/AT adapters and ATd; however, some AT-less KS domains lacked clear ATd, and others contain an ACP-like insertion within the ATd (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A conserved tryptophan that is inserted into a pocket on the surface of the KS as found in the structures of the canonical type I PKS KS-AT didomains was used to define the C terminus (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KS domains were produced with 10 residues C terminal to the conserved tryptophan or truncated to the KS core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, KS domain constructs that include the ATd are more soluble than the corresponding KS core constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 29 KS domains examined for large-scale expression, 20 were soluble and 16 produced crystals, yielding seven structures (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structurally characterized KS domains are MgsE-KS3, MgsF-KS4, MgsF-KS6, OzmQ-KS1, OzmN-KS2, OzmH-KS7, and OzmH-KS8 (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SSA_of_AT-Less_Type_I_PKS_KSs_Reveals_that_Sequence_Clusters_Correlate_with_Predicted_Substrates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the substrate specificities of our KSs with solved structures correlated with other KSs having similar sequences, we performed phylogenetic analysis and SSA (SI Appendix) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KS domains from each pathway were assigned a substrate based on colinearity and a retrobiosynthetic analysis of the major product from each pathway (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig S5), and the substrate structures were overlaid on the SSA (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SSA, we will refer to E-value cutoffs close to zero (E-200) as high stringency and E-value cutoffs further from zero (E-165, E-185) as low stringency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SSA reveals clear correlation between clusters of sequences and clusters of substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher stringency, highly related clusters break apart, revealing detailed relationships and subclusters that have evolved through subfunctionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower stringency, new relationships between the clusters start to emerge, revealing clusters of sequences that have likely evolved by gene duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlaying clade names from a previous phylogenetic analysis (18) onto the SSA reveals a high correlation with phylogenetic clades and the sequence clusters, but also reveals many more clades than previously described, in part because we have captured a much larger dataset (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the SSA is appropriate for analyzing this very large set of proteins, where there is a high likelihood of very different rates of evolution as a result of a mixture of horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Canonical_Type_I_PKS_KS_Domains_Accepting_-Branched_and_N-Acyl_Amino_Acid_Substrates_Are_More_Similar_to_AT-Less_Type_I_PKS_KS_Domains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SSA reveals that canonical type I PKS KS domains form a distinct cluster with members that are all very related, with an average identity of 67%, whereas the AT-less type I PKS KSs have an average identity of 42% (SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some AT-less type I PKSs occasionally contain canonical KS-AT didomains, and not surprisingly, they cluster with the majority of canonical type I PKS KSs (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher stringency, cyanobacterial and myxobacterial type I PKS KS domains form distinct clusters near actinobacterial type I PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the two -branch accepting type I PKS KS domains, CurF-KS2 and JamJ-KS2, which are from cyanobacteria, cluster with the AT-less type I PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cyanobacterial type I PKSs appear to possess KS domains from AT-less type I PKS origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hybrid NRPS/PKS KS domains form two clusters at medium stringency, representing canonical and AT-less type I PKSs, respectively (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower stringency, they cluster closer to the AT-less type I PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous phylogenetic analyses also revealed that hybrid PKS/NRPS domains form clades distinct from canonical type I PKS KS domains (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to our knowledge, this is the first study revealing that they are more closely related to the AT-less type I PKS KS family, suggesting that the evolutionary relationships between canonical and AT-less type I PKSs are more complex than previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Structures_of_OzmQ-KS1_and_OzmN-KS2_Represent_KS_Domains_from_Hybrid_NRPS_PKS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 domains, which accept -formamide and oxazole substrates, respectively, cluster most closely with N-acyl amino acid-accepting domains from type I PKSs rather than AT-less type I PKSs (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that these domains have recently been incorporated into the OZM biosynthetic gene cluster from a type I PKS cluster by horizontal gene transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 therefore represent not only N-acyl amino acid-accepting KSs from AT-less type I PKSs but also a much larger class of KS domains found in hybrid NRPS/PKS gene clusters from bacteria across diverse phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Structure_of_OzmH-KS8_Represents_a_Subset_of_KS0_Domains_Typically_at_the_Interface_Between_AT-Less_Type_I_PKS_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OzmH-KS8 is predicted to be nonfunctional for CC bond formation, as there is an asparagine in place of the first catalytic histidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the KS0 domains are highly divergent and only cluster at low stringency, and in phylogenetic analyses, these domains tend to form clades, but this is likely because of long-branch attraction (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some KS0 domains form clusters in the SSA, and OzmH-KS8 clusters with KS0 domains that are a part of split bimodules, such as PksJ-KS4, PksJ-KS8, DifG-KS5, and TaiK-KS8, where these KS0 domains are at the end of AT-less type I PKS proteins and lack ATd domains (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Structure_of_MgsE-KS3_Represents_KS_Domains_Accepting_Glutarimides_and_-Branch_Lactones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MgsE-KS3 accepts a glutarimide and phylogenetically clades with other glutarimide-accepting KS domains such as ChxE-KS3, SmdI-KS3, and LtmE-KS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MgsE-KS3 is in a cluster with RhiF-KS15, which follows the -branch lactone introducing RhiE-KS14, and other domains that accept six-membered rings at the -position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the other domains that cluster with MgsE-KS3 accept alkane bearing substrates, including PksJ-KS2, which was previously structurally characterized (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Structures_of_MgsF-KS4__MgsF-KS6__and_OzmH-KS7_Represent_the_Largest_Cluster_of_AT-Less_Type_I_PKS_KS_Domains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MgsF-KS6 and OzmH-KS7 accept an -methyl-alkene and alkene substrate, respectively, and are located within the largest AT-less type I PKS KS cluster (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MgsF-KS4 accepts a -hydroxy substrate and clusters near MgsF-KS6 and OzmH-KS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher stringency, these KS domains clade more closely with other domains sharing their respective substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previously structurally characterized RhiE-KS14 that performs -branching is also connected to the largest cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Comparison_Reveals_Similar_Overall_Structures_that_Roughly_Correlate_with_the_SSA_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall structures of the AT-less type I PKS KS domains are very similar (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall comparison of the KS core regions using DALI pairwise structural alignment Z-scores as a similarity matrix reveals that the structures fall into four clades (Fig 4 and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of OzmH-KS8 is unique as a result of most of the loops covering the active site lacking interpretable electron density, which is interpreted as conformational heterogeneity, as SDS/PAGE analysis reveals the protein is intact (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of MgsF-KS4, OzmH-KS7, and MgsF-KS6 clade closely together with the structure of RhiE-KS14 in the same branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2 have similar overall structures and, surprisingly, form a clade adjacent to the type I PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 have very conserved overall structures and are the least similar to the other groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural clustering is similar to patterns found in the SSA, revealing the SSA clustering captures structural features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differences_in_Structural_Homology_Are_Mostly_Attributed_to_the_Variable_Structures_of_Three_Loops  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the core structures of the KS domains are highly conserved, a few loops vary greatly (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These loops are highlighted in a structure-based alignment that enumerates the conserved structural features (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the structures have an active site tunnel that is formed by interactions at the dimer interface and with the variable loops covering the conserved active site residues (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the differing loops is defined by the region between -sheet 2 and -sheet 3, which forms an outer clasping loop that is highly variable in structure and sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clasping loop may interact with upstream modifying domains, as found in the structure of RhiE-K14 (SI Appendix, Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clasping loop is short in most of the KS0 domains and is missing from the electron density in the structure of OzmH-KS8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a shortened clasping loop likely influences the structural dynamics of the loops covering the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second variable dimer interface loop that makes up much of the dimer interface is defined by the region between -sheet 5 and -helix 4 in the structure-based sequence alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loop is highly variable in sequence and structure and makes many contacts with itself across the twofold dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again this loop is missing in the structure of OzmH-KS8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2, this loop contains two helices; MgsF-KS4, MgsF-KS6, OzmH-KS7, and RhiE-KS14 have a single extended loop and helix; and OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 have three helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of this loop with the PKS KS structures reveals it is most similar to MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2, which explains why the type I PKS KS domains cluster closer to MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2 than MgsF-KS4, MgsF-KS6, and OzmH-KS7 in the structural homology dendrogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The clasping loop and dimer interface loop flank an -helix, as defined by the residues between -sheet 7 and -sheet 8 in the structure-based sequence alignment, which lies above the active site cysteine forming an active site cap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues emanating from this region form the top of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same residues in OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 form an extended loop conformation with a -sheet (-sheet B, which interacts with -sheet A), differentiating the family of hybrid NRPS/PKS KSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of this loop is unknown in OzmH-KS8 because of the disorder, and is lacking sequence conservation with the other structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the active site capping helix or loop generates very different active site tunnel topologies between the sets of structures (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subtle_Differences_in_Active_Site_Residues_Between_Members_of_a_Cluster_Likely_Confer_Substrate_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The active site cysteine, position 199 (Fig 3), is buttressed with the two active site histidines and the N terminus of -helix 11, making the bottom of the active site very conserved on one side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residue immediately N-terminal to the active site cysteine is typically either a small residue or a large bulky residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residue is covariant with three adjacent residues; thus, when there is a small residue at position 198, the residues at 177 and 461 are larger, as in MgsE-KS3, PksJ-KS2, OzmQ-KS1, and OzmN-KS2, whereas when this residue is a large hydrophobic residue, the others are small residues, as in OzmH-KS7, MgsF-KS4, and MgsF-KS6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These covariant residues act together to alter the other half of the active site bottom near the tunnel (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subtle differences in the active sites further differentiate members of MgsF-KS4 from MgsF-KS6 and OzmH-KS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the residues lining the active site pocket for MgsF-KS6 and OzmH-KS7 are identical (Met-144, Tyr-145, Ser-174, Ser-177, Met-198, Tyr-261, and Ala-461), which makes a nonpolar surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residues in MgsF-KS4 that differ are Thr-144, Lys-145, and Phe-261, and it is likely that the introduction of Thr-144 and Lys-145 into the active site increases the polarity of the tunnel and helps accommodate the -hydroxy substituent over alkenes, as in MgsF-KS6 and OzmH-KS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2 have modest differences in active site residues, which may help bind their respective substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active site residues of MgsE-KS3 are Ser-144, Gly-145, Ala-174, Met-177, Tyr-261, and Phe-461, whereas those of PksJ-KS2 are Gly-144, Asn-145, Ile-174, Val-177, and Tyr-261.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are two striking differences between the active sites of MgsE-KS3 and PksJ-KS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is a difference in the conformation of the residues at position 144 and 145, resulting from the bulky hydrophobic residue Leu-388 in PksJ, which is a serine in MgsE-KS3 and typically a small polar residue in other sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, PksJ-KS2 also has a methionine inserted at position 173, which is unique among members of its sequence cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_the_ATd_Domains_Reveals_Evolution_Caught_in_Action  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The defining characteristic of the AT-less type I PKS is the lack of an AT domain within each module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a few AT-less type I PKSs contain canonical type I PKS KS-AT didomains, suggesting occasional recombination events between these two PKS architectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the AT-less type I PKS KS domain structures reveals that most possess an ATd that has a minimal insertion between positions 613 and 942 in the structure-based sequence alignments (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, certain variants have much larger insertions, and sequence alignments reveal that the insertions are large fragments of an AT domain and may represent evolutionary intermediates between the type I PKS and AT-less type I PKS architectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another set had insertions within the ATd that appears to be a degraded ACP domain near position 535.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many KS0 domains lacked the ATd and C-terminal tryptophan altogether, such as OzmH-KS8, and were typically found at the C terminus of AT-less type I PKS proteins (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of ATd domains from some AT-less type I PKSs reveals that AT binding to the KS is not required for activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OzmQ-KS1 contains extra sequence beyond the ATd core that forms four -helices and three -sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural alignments of the OzmQ-KS1 ATd with the AT domains from EryAII-KS3 and CurL-KS8 reveal structured portions of the AT that remain, and these regions are poorly aligned in sequence alignments and not recognizable as AT fragments (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As OzmN-KS2 does not have this extension, we postulate that the AT domain is in the process of evolutionary degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, this suggests that the AT-less type I PKS KS domains following NRPS modules evolved from type I PKS through the loss of the AT domain with retention of the KS/AT adapters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, this suggests that the other AT-less type I PKS KS domains have evolved from type I PKS through loss of the AT domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taking a high-throughput structural genomics analysis approach to studying the family of AT-less type I PKS KS domains, which has members with varying degrees of sequence similarity and is more akin to a superfamily, revealed the architectural framework on which the various activities and substrate specificities are built.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures reveal that three loops covering the active site have differing conformations that correlate with large clusters of KS sequences, and amino acid residues in the active sites correlate with subclusters of KS sequences and substrate specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the substrates of the AT-less type I PKS KS domains are extremely diverse, the family of AT-less type I PKS KS domains gives us a unique opportunity to study the molecular details for the evolution of substrate specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecular details are beginning to be revealed by this preliminary analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this study captures four of the structural clades and a couple of the sequence subclusters, there remain many other important structures that will provide further insight into the evolution of substrate specificity within the family of AT-less type I PKS KSs (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SSA reveals that the evolutionary relationships among KS domains of canonical, hybrid NRPS/PKS, and AT-less type I PKSs are more complicated than previously reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I PKS KSs accepting -branched and N-acyl amino acids are significantly different from the canonical type I PKS KSs and more similar to those found in AT-less type I PKSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of OzmQ-KS1 and OzmN-KS2 reveal structural insights into the larger family of N-acyl amino acid accepting KSs; most important, the conformation of an active site loop differentiates them from acyl-accepting KS domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures will serve as a platform for understanding the unique chemistry in the biosynthesis of hybrid peptidepolyketide natural products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the family of AT-less type I PKSs, there are modules that contain complete KS-AT didomains from type I PKS; have remnants of the KS/AT adapters and large portions of a nonfunctional AT domain as represented by OzmQ-KS1; have a minimal ATd, as represented by most of our structures; or completely lack the ATd, as represented by OzmH-KS8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large diversity of structural motifs in the AT-less type I PKS family reveals the consequences of extensive horizontal exchange within the AT-less type I PKSs and with the type I PKSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the structures reveal the molecular consequences of a type I PKS KS-AT didomain evolving toward an AT-less type I PKS KS, supporting the conclusion that other AT-less type I PKS KS domains may have evolved from type I PKSs through the gradual loss of the AT domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these studies reveal molecular details of type I PKS evolution, which can be used to guide engineered biosynthesis of novel polyketide natural products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
