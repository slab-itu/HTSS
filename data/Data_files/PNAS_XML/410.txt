miRNA92a targets KLF2 and the phosphatase PTEN signaling to promote human T follicular helper precursors in T1D islet autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The onset of type 1 diabetes autoimmunity is indicated by the development of multiple islet autoantibodies, produced by B cells with the help of T follicular helper (TFH) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate cellular states, as immune activation, making them suitable targets for disease intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show an enrichment of insulin-specific C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5)+CD4+ TFH precursors correlating with high miRNA92a abundance during onset of autoimmunity and identify Krueppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) as a target for miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that miRNA92a inhibition blocks TFH induction and reduces murine islet autoimmunity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose miRNA92a and the phosphatase and tension homolog-phosphoinositol-3-kinase-KLF2 signaling network as possible innovative precision medicine targets to interfere with aberrant immune activation in islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aberrant immune activation mediated by T effector cell populations is pivotal in the onset of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes (T1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T follicular helper (TFH) cells are essential in the induction of high-affinity antibodies, and their precursor memory compartment circulates in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of TFH precursors in the onset of islet autoimmunity and signaling pathways regulating their differentiation is incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide direct evidence that during onset of islet autoimmunity, the insulin-specific target T-cell population is enriched with a C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5)+CD4+ TFH precursor phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During onset of islet autoimmunity, the frequency of TFH precursors was controlled by high expression of microRNA92a (miRNA92a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNA92a-mediated TFH precursor induction was regulated by phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) - phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling involving PTEN and forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1), supporting autoantibody generation and triggering the onset of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we identify Krueppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) as a target of miRNA92a in regulating human TFH precursor induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a miRNA92a antagomir completely blocked induction of human TFH precursors in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, in vivo application of a miRNA92a antagomir to nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with ongoing islet autoimmunity resulted in a significant reduction of TFH precursors in peripheral blood and pancreatic lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, miRNA92a antagomir application reduced immune infiltration and activation in pancreata of NOD mice as well as humanized NOD Scid IL2 receptor gamma chain knockout (NSG) human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ8 transgenic animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that miRNA92a and the PTEN-PI3K-KLF2 signaling network could function as targets for innovative precision medicines to reduce T1D islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Enhancement_of_Insulin-Specific_CXCR5+_TFH_Precursors_During_the_Onset_of_Human_Islet_Autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the critical role of the autoantigen insulin in initiating islet autoimmunity, we studied the TFH precursor characteristics of the insulin-specific target T-cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used CD4+ T cells from nondiabetic children without autoimmunity (islet autoantibody-negative children), with recent onset of autoimmunity (recent activation, multiple autoantibodies for less_than5 y), persistent autoimmunity (multiple autoantibodies for  greater than 5 to less_than10 y), and long-term autoimmunity (multiple autoantibodies for  greater than 10 y without overt T1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied recently developed fluorescent insulin-specific HLA-DQ8 tetramers (14E-22E and 14E-21G 22E tetramers) based on a set of two insulin B-chain 1023 mimetopes to identify human HLA-DQ8restricted insulin-specific CD4+ T cells ex vivo directly (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected no tet+CD4+ T cells using the control tetramers, whereas a population of insulin-specific CD4+ T cells was readily identified ex vivo with the insulin-specific tetramers (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequencies of tet+CD4+ T cells were correlated with CD3 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we provide direct evidence that during onset of islet autoimmunity and in the absence of clinically overt T1D, the insulin-specific target T-cell population is enriched with a CXCR5+CD4+ TFH precursor phenotype (no autoimmunity vs. recent onset of autoimmunity: 14.4 ± 2.9% vs. 42.5 ± 9.2% of tet+CD4+ T cells; P less_than 0.05; Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of note, the frequency of these insulin-specific TFH precursors in nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity was 14.3 ± 3.0% of tet+CD4+ T cells, which was significantly lower than in children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity (P less_than 0.05; Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are in accordance with the fact that nondiabetic children with latency in progression to clinically overt disease can lose some of their earliest islet autoantibodies, especially insulin autoantibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increase_of_Circulating_CCR7lowPD1highCXCR5+_TFH_Precursor_Cells_During_the_Onset_of_Human_Islet_Autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During islet autoimmunity onset, we also identified up-regulated PD1 and ICOS expression levels within circulating CXCR5+ T cells, together with increased frequencies of TFH precursors at the polyclonal level (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the frequency of CCR7lowPD1highCXCR5+CD4+ T cells (gating example in Fig 2A, Upper) was significantly greater in children with onset of islet autoimmunity than in children without islet autoimmunity (no autoimmunity vs. recent onset of autoimmunity: 16.8 ± 1.6% vs. 25.8 ± 2.8% of CD4+CD45RA T cells; P less_than 0.01; Fig 2B), and was significantly reduced in nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (9.0 ± 2.3% of CD4+CD45RA T cells; P less_than 0.01; Fig 2B) compared with the other two groups of children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of CXCR5+CD4+ T cells harboring the highest level of PD1 expression (PD1+++; gating example in Fig 2A, Lower) was significantly greater in children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity than in children without autoimmunity (no autoimmunity vs. recent onset of autoimmunity: 0.14 ± 0.03% vs. 0.53 ± 0.11% of CD4+ T cells; P less_than 0.01; Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of CXCR5+PD1+++CD4+ T cells in nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity was 0.16 ± 0.06% of CD4+ T cells, which was significantly lower than in children with recent onset of autoimmunity (P less_than 0.05) and similar to the abundance in children without autoimmunity (P  greater than  0.05; Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR5+PD1+++CD4+ T cells also harbored the highest ICOS expression level (ICOS mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) within PD1+++ subset = 12,600 ± 1,457 vs. ICOS MFI within PD1+ subset = 3,919 ± 666; P less_than 0.01; Fig 2D, Lower Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings therefore support the hypothesis that during the onset of autoimmunity, these circulating CXCR5+PD1+++CD4+ T cells with the highest ICOS expression level can boost immune activation and trigger autoantibody production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the frequencies of CCR7lowPD1high and CXCR5+PD1+++CD4+ T cells in children or adolescents near to the diagnosis of clinically overt T1D (newly manifest T1D), we studied T cells from the German new onset diabetes in the young incident cohort study (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the abundance of CCR7lowPD1high and CXCR5+PD1+++CD4+ T cells in young individuals with newly manifest T1D to be unaltered compared with nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we analyzed T helper (Th)-like subtypes within the CXCR5+CD4+ T-cell population based on the coexpression of CXCR3 and CCR6 (gating example in Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR3+CCR6 cells mainly secrete IFN- (Th1-like profile) but not Th2 or Th17 cytokines; CXCR3CCR6 cells exclusively secrete Th2 cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13]; and CXCR3CCR6+ cells secrete Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-22) (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR5+ Th2 cells and CXCR5+ Th17 cells were found to induce naive B cells to secrete immunoglobulins via IL-21 but to modulate isotype switching differentially, whereas human CXCR5+ Th1 cells were unable to provide B-cell help (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no differences in the frequencies of Th1 cells and Th17 cells within the CXCR5+CD4+ T-cell compartment between disease groups, including young individuals with new onset T1D (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed a significant increase in the TFH-Th2 subset in children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity compared with T cells from children without ongoing autoimmunity or with long-term autoimmunity (no autoimmunity vs. recent onset of autoimmunity vs. long-term autoimmunity: 24.6 ± 2.5% vs. 35.4 ± 3.8%; P less_than 0.05 vs. 23.9 ± 1.4% of CD4+CD45RA T cells; P less_than 0.05; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel to the increase in the TFH-Th2 subset during onset of islet autoimmunity, we found a significant enhancement in this subset of TFH cells in young individuals with new onset T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in TFH-Th2 cells was significant compared with T cells from nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (long-term autoimmunity: 23.9 ± 1.4% vs. with new onset T1D: 50.9 ± 4.4; P less_than 0.05; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we analyzed individual longitudinal samples from nondiabetic children with ongoing islet autoimmunity, we again observed the highest frequencies of Th2-like TFH cells within recent activation of islet autoimmunity (less_than5 y of islet autoimmunity), whereas frequencies were lower during persistent islet autoimmunity ( greater than 5 to less_than 10 y of islet autoimmunity) and further decreased in children with long-term autoimmunity ( greater than 10 y of islet autoimmunity; Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In accordance, the respective T-cell subset presented with an increased abundance of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, with no change in IL-10 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increase_of_miRNA1792_Family_Abundance_in_CD4+_T_Cells_from_Children_with_Recent_Onset_of_Islet_Autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define involved signaling pathways, we next examined miRNA92a abundance of CD4+ T cells from children with or without islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, miRNA92a expression levels were significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity (no autoimmunity vs. recent onset of autoimmunity: 7.1 ± 0.6 vs. 11.3 ± 0.7; P less_than 0.05; Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its expression was down-regulated in nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (6.7 ± 0.7), in accordance with reduced TFH precursor frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in miRNA92a expression levels in relation to duration of islet autoimmunity were not observed within the CD127lowCD25high regulatory T (Treg)-cell population (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expression profiles of two other members of the miRNA1792 cluster, miRNA-18a and miRNA-19a, were altered in a similar fashion to the abundance of miRNA92a (Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we identified a strong correlation between the abundance of miRNA92a and the frequency of CXCR5+ TFH precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD4+ T cells from children without islet autoimmunity and from nondiabetic children with a slow-progressor phenotype presented with the lowest frequencies of CXCR5+ TFH precursors and the lowest abundance of miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, during onset of islet autoimmunity, in states of strong immune activation, more CD4+ T cells harbored a CXCR5+ TFH precursor phenotype accompanied with increased abundance of miRNA92a (r2 = 0.72; Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no correlation was observed between the duration of islet autoimmunity (months of multiple autoantibodies) and the frequencies of CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ T cells, supporting concepts that point to a relapsing/remitting autoimmunity phenotype (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did find a correlation between miRNA92a abundance in CD4+ T cells and levels of insulin autoantibodies (IAA) within disease groups (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reduced_Abundance_of_Predicted_Signaling_Pathways_Regulated_by_miRNA92a_in_Human_Islet_Autoimmunity__PTEN__PHLPP2__and_Cytotoxic_T-LymphocyteAssociated_Protein_4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next determined mRNA abundances of predicted signaling pathways regulated by miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As bioinformatics tools, we used miRDB [MirTarget (34)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, TargetScan (Human 6.2) was used to predict biological targets for miRNA92a (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the observed enhanced abundance of miRNA92a in CD4+ T cells from islet autoantibody-positive children, we found repression of predicted target genes of miRNA92a (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in CD4+ T cells from children with ongoing autoimmunity, we observed repression of the phosphatase PTEN, which was outlined as a direct target of the miRNA92a family in mice (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our human T-cell setting, we likewise saw reduced abundance of the miRNA92 target PHLPP2 (36), which encodes an Akt phosphatase (37) and functions as a critical negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway as identified in murine studies (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed reduced mRNA abundance of predicted targets of miRNA92a that negatively regulate T-cell activation, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

miRNA92a_Targets_the_Zinc-Finger_Transcription_Factor_KLF2_During_Human_Islet_Autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, using TargetScan analyses (35, 38), we identified an evolutionarily conserved binding site for human miRNA92a in the 3 UTR of KLF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, abundance of KLF2 was found to be critically repressed in CD4+ T cells from children with ongoing islet autoimmunity (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support a potential role of KLF2 as a target of miRNA92a in human CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Down-Regulation_of_PTEN-Foxo1-KLF2_Signaling_Network_to_Promote_Human_TFH_Precursor_Cells_and_Onset_of_Islet_Autoimmunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To dissect involved signaling pathways relevant for TFH differentiation further, we next identified a significantly increased abundance of ICOS in such CD4+ T cells from children with ongoing autoimmunity (pre-T1D), whereas expression levels of Foxo1, which represses Bcl6 transcription, as well as PTEN and KLF2, were significantly down-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with a low abundance of KLF2, we found a high abundance of CXCR5 and low expression of S1PR1 (Fig 4C) in such CD4+ T cells from children with islet autoimmunity compared with children without ongoing islet autoimmunity (no pre-T1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we determined the mRNA abundance of genes involved in T-cell activation and TFH-cell differentiation and function according to the duration of islet autoimmunity, we confirmed that KLF2 abundance was significantly down-regulated, particularly during the onset of islet autoimmunity (P less_than 0.001; Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, during onset of islet autoimmunity, we likewise observed negative regulators of T-cell activation (e.g., CTLA4, PTEN) to be repressed (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Foxo1 expression was significantly reduced in CCR7lowPD1high TFH precursors from children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we observed increased levels of Ascl2 and IL-21 in CCR7lowPD1high TFH precursors from children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity in contrast to cells from nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induction_of_Human_TFH_Precursor_Cells_by_miRNA92a_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether activation of the miRNA92a pathway can induce human TFH precursor cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chitosan-coated poly(d,l-lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (39) were used to deliver mature miRNA92a mimics with a triple-RNA strand design (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake, intracellular localization of labeled nanoparticles, and delivery of fluorescently labeled control miRNAs were verified by confocal microscopy (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed in vitro TFH precursor induction experiments (16, 21) with human naive CD4+ T cells and autologous memory B cells, sorted as CD20+CD27+, in the presence or absence of a miRNA92a mimic (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the miRNA92a mimic significantly increased the frequencies of CXCR5+CD4+ TFH precursors in vitro (vehicle + negative control mimic vs. vehicle + miRNA92a mimic: 37.6 ± 1.8 vs. 54.2 ± 3.1 CD45RACXCR5+CD4+ T cells; P less_than 0.05; Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The miRNA92a mimic also significantly enhanced the frequency of CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ TFH precursor cells using T cells from healthy individuals (vehicle + negative control mimic vs. vehicle + miRNA92a mimic: 1.8 ± 0.2 vs. 4.6 ± 0.8 CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ T cells; P less_than 0.05; Fig 5A) and from T1D patients (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An induction of CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ TFH precursor cells by miRNA92a mimic was observed already after 3 d of incubation (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mRNA_Abundance_of_Predicted_Signaling_Pathways_Controlled_by_miRNA92a_During_miRNA92a-Mediated_TFH_Precursor_Induction_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied whether activation of the miRNA92a pathway in vitro can modulate mRNA abundance of signaling pathways predictively targeted by miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon miRNA92a mimic application, we observed significantly enhanced abundance of ITCH (miRNA92-mimic: ITCH: 2.6 ± 0.3, fold of T cells treated with control mimic; P less_than 0.05; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl6 expression was moderately but significantly up-regulated in line with findings indicating that upon in vitro differentiation, such TFH precursors present with intermediate levels of Bcl6 (41), in contrast to bona fide germinal center TFH cells that harbor high Bcl6 abundance (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, expression levels of Foxo1 (miRNA92a mimic: Foxo1: 0.18 ± 0.04, fold of T cells treated with control mimic; P less_than 0.01) as well as PTEN (miRNA92a mimic: PTEN: 0.27 ± 0.01, fold of T cells treated with control mimic; P less_than 0.05) were significantly reduced compared with T cells that had been incubated with control mimics (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, KLF2 mRNA abundance of CD4+ T cells from miRNA92a-mediated TFH induction assays was significantly down-regulated compared with T cells treated with control mimics (miRNA92a mimic: KLF2: 0.07 ± 0.02, fold of T cells treated with control mimic; P less_than 0.05; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data further support the concept that KLF2 functions as a target of miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

miRNA92a-Mediated_Human_in_Vitro_TFH_Precursor_Induction_Is_Regulated_by_PTEN-PI3K_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TFH precursor induction by miRNA92a was further enhanced upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin in terms of CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ T cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the involvement of the PTEN-PI3K signaling network in the regulation of TFH precursor induction, we performed such assays with a miRNA92a mimic in the presence or absence of a PI3K or PTEN inhibitor, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coapplication of a PI3K inhibitor to the miRNA92a mimic completely abolished TFH precursor induction (CCR7lowPD1high T cells: miRNA92a mimic: 13.3 ± 0.3 vs. miRNA92a mimic + PI3K inhibitor: 1.2 ± 0.6; P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, miRNA92a mimic treatment in the presence of a PTEN inhibitor resulted in a significant boost of TFH precursor cell induction (CCR7lowPD1high T cells: miRNA92a mimic: 12.6 ± 0.7 v. miRNA92a mimic + PTEN-inhibitor: 20.6 ± 0.6; P less_than 0.01; Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

miRNA92a_Targets_KLF2_to_Promote_Human_TFH_Precursor_Induction_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To underline KLF2 as a target of miRNA92a, we used a specific miRNA92a KFL2 target site blocker (TSB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNA TSBs are antisense oligonucleotides that bind to the miRNA target site of an mRNA, thereby preventing miRNAs from gaining access to that site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of a miRNA92a mimic in the presence of a control TSB resulted in a significant increase of CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ TFH precursor cells (vehicle + control TSB: 0.4 ± 0.07 vs. vehicle + miRNA92a mimic + control TSB: 2.5 ± 0.2; P less_than 0.05; Fig 5E) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, coapplication of a specific KLF2 TSB significantly reduced the miRNA92a-mediated induction of TFH precursors (vehicle + miRNA92a mimic + control TSB: 2.5 ± 0.2 vs. vehicle + miRNA92a mimic + KLF2 TSB: 0.9 ± 0.2; P less_than 0.05; Fig 5E), further indicating that KLF2 is a target of miRNA92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blockade_of_Human_TFH_Precursor_Cell_Induction_by_a_miRNA92a_Antagomir_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess a potential relevance of blocking miRNA92a activity to limit islet autoimmunity, we first performed in vitro TFH induction assays in the presence of a miRNA92a antagomir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, application of a miRNA92a antagomir completely blocked the induction of human CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ TFH precursor cells (vehicle + negative control antagomir: 2.1 ± 0.4 vs. vehicle + miRNA92a antagomir: 1.6 ± 0.05; Fig 5 A and B) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of human TFH differentiation was seen with CD4+ T cells from healthy donors (Fig 5A), as well as from individuals with T1D (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, in human Treg-cell induction assays using established protocols with naive CD4+ T cells and limited T-cell receptor stimulation (31), a miRNA92a antagomir resulted in an increase in induced human CD127lowCD25highFoxp3high Treg cells (+ control antagomir: 35.4 ± 0.8 vs. + miRNA92a antagomir: 41.8 ± 0.5; P less_than 0.01; Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibition_of_Murine_TFH_Precursors_by_a_miRNA92a_Antagomir_in_NOD_Mice_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a critical model of human autoimmune T1D, NOD mice share many similarities with human T1D, including the presence of specific autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in humans and mice, the T-cell response to insulin is dominated by a major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) (IAg7)-restricted segment of the insulin B chain comprising residues 923.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to CD4+ T cells from nonautoimmune-prone BALB/c and NOD mice without insulin-specific autoantibodies, CD4+ T cells from NOD mice with IAA+ autoimmunity presented with significantly increased expression levels of miRNA92a, especially in pancreatic lymph nodes (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to test a possible therapeutic value of blocking miRNA92a activity in halting immune activation in vivo, we used NOD mice with IAA+ autoimmunity and a custom-designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) miRNA92a antagomir (Exiqon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, short-term in vivo application of a miRNA92a antagomir (10 mg/kg i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on day 0, day 2, and day 6) to NOD mice significantly lowered TFH precursors in peripheral blood compared both with baseline levels assessed before beginning of the treatment and with mice treated with control antagomirs [baseline before miRNA92a antagomir application: CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ T cells (percentage of CXCR5+CD4+ T cells): 20.9 ± 1.9 vs. after miRNA92a antagomir application: 10.6 ± 1.0; P less_than 0.05; Fig 6C].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of miRNA92a antagomir also resulted in significantly reduced frequencies of CCR7lowPD1high TFH precursors in pancreatic lymph nodes [CCR7lowPD1highCD4+ T cells (percentage of CXCR5+CD4+ T cells): control antagomir: 48.4 ± 5.9 vs. miRNA92a antogomir: 30.4 ± 3.6; P less_than 0.05; Fig 6 D and E].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the miRNA92a antagomir application reduced immune activation directly in the pancreas, because frequencies of CD4+CD44high T cells were significantly lowered in such treated mice compared with control animals [CD4+CD44high T cells (MFI) control antagomir: 2,877 ± 316 vs. miRNA92a antagomir: 1,976 ± 224; P less_than 0.05; Fig 6 F and G].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, upon treatment with a miRNA92a antagomir, frequencies of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells were increased in lymph nodes (Fig 6 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, when we treated NOD mice for a longer period of 14 d (with injections four times per week at 5 mg/kg), the miRNA92a antagomir significantly reduced the frequencies of insulin-specific CD4+CXCR5+ TFH cells in pancreatic lymph nodes (Fig 6 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the longer treatment period resulted in a more pronounced reduction of CD4+CD44high T cells (Fig 6L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the CD44high T cells within the CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ Treg-cell population was affected to a lesser extent (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a reduced autoimmune activation upon miRNA92a antagomir application, we observed lower levels of proliferating Ki67highCD4+ T cells in these NOD mice (Fig 6M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IAA levels had increased from baseline in control animals, IAA levels were found to be decreased in mice that were given the miRNA92a antagomir (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, histopathological evaluation of pancreata from these NOD mice revealed that miRNA92a antagomir application had reduced pancreatic infiltration, resulting in more morphologically intact  cells (Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed using analyses by immunofluorescence in pancreatic cryosections of such NOD mice (Fig S10 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD pancreata of mice that had received a miRNA92a antagomir showed distinctly reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration accompanied by an enhanced abundance of local CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig S10 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to assess a potential human in vivo relevance of miRNA92a antagomir application, we investigated human HLA-DQ8restricted insulin-specific TFH cells in humanized NOD Scid IL2 receptor gamma chain knockout (NSG) human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ8 Tg mice in accordance with previously established procedures (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we focused on human pancreas-infiltrating CD4+ T cells upon treatment with a miRNA92a antagomir (1 wk of treatment, with injections three times per week at 10 mg/kg) or a control antagomir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to humanized mice that were given the control antagomir, mice that received the miRNA92a antagomir showed distinctly reduced frequencies of HLA-DQ8restricted insulin-specific CD4+ T cells in pancreata of humanized NSG HLA-DQ8 mice (Fig 6 N and O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, miRNA92a antagomir application significantly lowered the frequencies of insulin-specific CD4+CXCR5+PD1+ TFH cells in pancreata of humanized mice (Fig 6 N and P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these findings further support a role of blocking miRNA92a activity in limiting autoimmune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aberrant immune activation mediated by effector T-cell populations is pivotal in promoting the onset of autoimmunity, as in autoimmune T1D (2, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In children with ongoing islet autoimmunity, the time to progression to clinically overt T1D is highly plastic, ranging from a few months to more than two decades (2, 5), which highlights the critical contribution of differences in immune activation and pathways of regulation in disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, studies of T cells from nondiabetic children according to the duration of islet autoimmunity can provide important insights into the regulation of aberrant immune activation, as well as into the mechanisms involved in triggering the onset of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently, the role of TFH cells in promoting the onset of human islet autoimmunity remains unclear, especially concerning their potential function in accelerating progression to clinically overt T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our understanding of relevant signaling pathways regulating human TFH induction is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge gap resulted from the fact that previous studies had focused on analyses of TFH-cell characteristics in patients with clinically overt T1D (43, 44), a situation where the main target of the autoimmune attack, the insulin-producing  cells, have been destroyed already.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, the role of human TFH precursors during the onset of autoimmunity before clinically manifest T1D and relevant signaling pathways involved in their induction has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To tame aberrant TFH-cell responses specifically (45), the dissection of molecular mechanisms that regulate TFH differentiation and function during the onset of autoimmunity is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide direct evidence that during the onset of human islet autoimmunity, the insulin-specific target T-cell population is enriched with a CXCR5+CD4+ TFH precursor phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mechanistically, we show that miRNA92a is critically involved in the induction of human TFH precursors and links the frequency of CXCR5+CD4+ T cells and the abundance of miRNA92a with the level of autoimmune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, our findings in CD4+ T cells from nondiabetic children with persistent and long-term autoimmunity demonstrate that a reduced frequency of peripheral CXCR5+ TFH precursors can be indicative of reduced immune activation in accordance with a slow progression to clinically overt T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these results in human CD4+ T cells from nondiabetic children with ongoing islet autoimmunity, we identify miRNA92a to be significantly up-regulated in CD4+ T cells purified from pancreatic lymph nodes of NOD mice upon initiation of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings highlight the importance to study miRNAs in the context of human autoimmunity, particularly in disease-relevant lymphocyte populations, to advance our understanding of gene regulation in autoimmunity, as well as for the identification of novel biomarkers indicative of pathogenic processes (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, such miRNAs could function as future drug targets, because sequence-specific miRNA inhibitors were proven to work in patients (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delivery of such molecules to immune cells has been challenging; however, there are encouraging results for local or systemic application of miRNA inhibitors in autoimmunity and allergy (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in vivo application of a miRNA92a antagomir to NOD mice with ongoing islet autoimmunity reduced TFH precursors in peripheral blood and pancreatic lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, application of a miRNA92a antagomir significantly lowered immune activation directly in the pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of specific miRNA targets and defining their functional relevance remain challenging, because a single miRNA can directly regulate hundreds of genes and the amplitude of control is generally rather modest (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide evidence for repression of PTEN and PHLPP2, thereby permitting a boost of PI3K-Akt kinase signaling to trigger immune activation and TFH differentiation (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with an important role of PI3K in the germinal center response (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-regulation of PHLPP2 was shown to be critical for signaling via ICOS-PI3K, which drives the migration of T cells into B-cell follicles (53), a critical part of the TFH differentiation program (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We likewise found CTLA4 abundance to be significantly down-regulated during the onset of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, T cells in CTLA4-deficient mice differentiate spontaneously into TFH cells in vivo, supporting a model in which CTLA4 mediates regulation of TFH-cell differentiation by graded control of CD28 engagement (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, during the onset of islet autoimmunity, Foxo1 abundance was significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, murine data showed that Foxo1 negatively regulates Bcl6 and that its enforced nuclear localization prevents TFH-cell differentiation (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the fact that ICOS coreceptor signaling inactivates Foxo1 (12), we saw here significantly enhanced abundance of ICOS in CD4+ T cells from children with recent onset of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mice, KLF2 functions as a key modulator of homing receptors involved in lymphocyte migration (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KLF2 serves to restrain murine TFH-cell generation (15), and induced KLF2 deficiency in activated CD4+ T cells promotes TFH-cell generation and B-cell priming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, KLF2 promotes expression of the trafficking receptor S1PR1, and S1PR1 down-regulation was essential for efficient TFH-cell production (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, based on the observed significant down-regulation of KLF2 in CD4+ T cells from children with ongoing islet autoimmunity, we demonstrate that reduced KLF2 abundance can promote human TFH precursor induction during the onset of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with a low abundance of KLF2, we found a high abundance of CXCR5 and low expression of S1PR1 in T cells from children with ongoing islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ICOS was highlighted to maintain the TFH phenotype by repressing KLF2 (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of note, we highlight KLF2 as a potential target of miRNA92a in the regulation of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, during TFH induction assays, a miRNA92a mimic promoted a significant down-regulation of KLF2 mRNA abundance in CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, miRNA92a-mediated induction of TFH precursor cells was significantly blunted in the presence of a specific miRNA92a-KLF2 TSB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, in T cells from such miRNA92a-mediated TFH precursor induction assays, we observed an enhanced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, which was found to be essential for the differentiation of TFH cells (13), and a reduced expression of Foxo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, KLF2 functions as a direct downstream transcriptional target of Foxo1 (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the reduced abundance of KLF2 could be aligned with the fact that during onset of islet autoimmunity, we observed Foxo1 abundance to be significantly down-regulated, whereas ICOS and miRNA92a abundance was found to be up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With respect to a potential future targeting of TFH cells within the autoimmune disease process, we found CXCR5+CD4+ TFH cells at higher frequencies in at-risk children with islet autoantibody conversions within the past 5 y (recent onset of islet autoimmunity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those children with multiple autoantibodies defined as having persistent (510 y) and long-term ( greater than 10 y) autoimmunity usually harbored frequencies similar to autoantibody-negative children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in line with concepts that children with a slow-progressor phenotype might have regulated the disease process or might at least be in a transient state of immune regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these findings also support the hypothesis that autoimmune T1D might have a relapsing/remitting disease phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we observed frequencies of TFH cells to be particularly increased in early stages of the disease process is in accordance with a critical role of TFH cells in promoting B-cell activation and autoantibody production, and would therefore suggest that targeting of this population may be important during the very early disease stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this concept, in a limited set of longitudinal samples of children with various durations of islet autoimmunity, we again found the highest frequencies of TFH cells, and particularly Th2-like TFH cells, in early stages of islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, a more detailed analysis of longitudinal samples from islet autoantibody-positive children will help to clarify further the role of TFH cells in promoting progression to clinical disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the findings of this work provide evidence that during the onset of human islet autoimmunity, the insulin-specific target T-cell population is enriched in CXCR5+ TFH precursor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we present a model in which, during the onset of human islet autoimmunity, miRNA92a-mediated TFH precursor cell induction is regulated by PTEN-PI3K signaling involving up-regulation of ICOS and down-regulation of PTEN, PHLPP2, and Foxo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that KLF2 can function as a target of miRNA92a in promoting induction of TFH precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, miRNA92a antagomir application blocks TFH induction in vitro and significantly reduces islet autoimmunity in NOD mice with ongoing islet autoimmunity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in humanized NSG HLA-DQ8 Tg mice, administration of a miRNA92a antagomir significantly lowered frequencies of pancreas-residing, insulin-specific TFH cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that manipulating miRNA92a or the PTEN-PI3K-KLF2 signaling network may facilitate the development of innovative regimens for the blockade of human T1D islet autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Insulin-Specific_HLA-DQ8Restricted_Tetramer_Stainings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescent HLA-DQ8 tetramers based on insulin B-chain 1023 mimetopes were developed in collaboration with the NIH tetramer facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a 14E-22E tetramer and a 14E-21G-22E-HLA-DQ8-phycoerythrin (PE)labeled tetramer were combined in stainings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untouched CD4+ T cells (as described above) were incubated with tetramers for 1 h at 37 °C in humidified 10% (vol/vol) CO2, with gentle agitation every 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface marker staining was performed directly afterward for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A set of exclusion markers [CD8, CD11b, CD19, CD14, and a dead cell exclusion marker (Sytox)] was used to increase specificity of the staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As negative controls, we used a combination of two HLA-DQ8 tetramers fused to irrelevant peptides (PVSKMRMATPLLMQA and QDLELSWNLNGLQADL) and labeled with PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virtually no CD4+ T cells were detected with the control tetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insulin-Specific_IAg7-Restricted_Tetramer_Stainings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescent IAg7-tetramers based on insulin B-chain 1023 mimetopes were received from the NIH tetramer core facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically a 22E tetramer and a 21G-22E-IAg7-PElabeled tetramer were combined in stainings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A set of exclusion markers [CD8a, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, B220, F4/80, and a dead cell exclusion marker (Sytox)] was used to increase specificity of the staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As negative controls, we used one IAg7 tetramer fused to an irrelevant peptide (AMKRHGLDNYRGYSL) and labeled with PE (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_and_Processing_of_Small_RNAs_miRNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small RNAs/miRNAs were isolated using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop (Epoch; Biotech) and/or RNA Nano Chip and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cDNA synthesis, the Universal cDNA Synthesis Kit II (Exiqon) was used according to the instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using ExiLENT SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Exiqon) in combination with miRCURY LNA primers for miRNA92a-3p, miRNA19a-3p, and miRNA18a-5p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For normalization, miRCURY LNA primers for the housekeeper 5s rRNA were used (Exiqon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was run on a CFX96 real-time system (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

mRNAs were isolated using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA synthesis was performed with either the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing Version 3 (Takara Clontech) when cell material was limited or the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) when cell material was not limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SMARTer kit, cycle numbers for amplification were adjusted for the lower RNA content of T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For qPCR, SsoFast Evagreen Supermix (BioRad) was used (primer information can be found in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For normalization, the primers for the housekeeping genes 18s (Quantitect Primer Assay; Qiagen) and Histone (forward: ACT GGC TAC AAA AGC CGC TC, reverse: ACT TGC CTC CTG CAA AGC AC) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions were run on a CFX96 Real-Time System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_TFH_Precursor_Cell_Induction_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Naive T cells were sort-purified as CD4+, CD3+, CD45RA+, CD45RO, and CXCR5, and memory B cells were sorted as CD20+ and CD27+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cell types were cocultured at a ratio of 1:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were stimulated with 5 g/mL anti-CD3 (Okt3) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2), both from Biolegend; in some experiments, IL-6 and IL-21, both at 50 ng/mL (Peprotech), were added in accordance with previously established procedures (16, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 5, CD4+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACS Aria III for expression of CXCR5, PSGL1, PD-1, and CCR7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some experiments, PMA/ionomycin stimulation (PMA at 50 ng/mL and ionomycin at 1 g/mL) was added to the assay 12 h before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TFH induction assays have likewise been performed in presence of a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002 at 10 M) or a PTEN inhibitor (SF1670 at 325 nM), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Application_of_miRNA92a_Mimic__Antagomir__and_KLF2_TSB_to_Human_CD4+_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PLGA-coated nanoparticles, loaded with miRNA92a mimic (miRCURY LNA microRNA Mimic; Exiqon) were added to the wells of the TFH differentiation assay at a ratio of 1:50 mimic/nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final concentration of mimic was 0.75 ng/L per 100,000 cells (referred to as high).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titration was performed, with medium referring to 0.375 ng/L per 100,000 cells and low referring to 0.1875 ng/L per 100,000 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the miRNA92a antagomir, the final concentration was 2 ng/L per 100,000 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments were performed with nanoparticles and negative miRCURY LNA microRNA Mimic controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The guide strands were found to have no homology to any known miRNA or mRNA sequences in mouse, rat, or human (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For investigation of KLF2 as a possible target of miRNA92a, a KLF2 TSB or control TSB (custom-designed by Exiqon) was added to the assay at 2 ng/L per 100,000 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For ex vivo analysis of miRNA92a abundance in CD4+ T cells, pancreatic lymph nodes from NOD/ShiLtJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory) (according to their insulin autoantibody status; the insulin autoantibody assay protocol is described in SI Materials and Methods) or age-matched BALB/c controls were ground through 70-m cell strainers, stained with antibodies (Materials and Methods, Cell Staining, Flow Cytometry, and Cell Sorting), and magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS)-purified using CD4-Biotin and Streptavidin Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total CD4+ T cells were sort-purified, and miRNA abundance was determined as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the in vivo inhibition of miRNA92a, age-matched, insulin autoantibody-positive female NOD/ShiLtJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were randomized into two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For short-term treatment, the mice were injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 10 mg/kg custom-designed in vivo LNA miRNA92a antagomir (Exiqon) or control antagomir on day 0, day 2, and day 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of insulin-specific or polyclonal TFH frequencies was performed from peripheral blood, pancreatic lymph nodes, and all remaining lymph nodes on day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, pancreata of the treated mice and control mice were analyzed for the activation status of infiltrating T cells on day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, pancreata were digested in 1 mg/mL Collagenase V for 5 min at 37 °C and passed through a 100 M cell strainer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long-term treatment, the mice were injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 5 mg/kg in vivo miRNA92a antagomir or control antagomir every second day for 14 d. Insulin-specific or polyclonal TFH frequencies were analyzed in peripheral blood and pancreatic lymph nodes on day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze pancreas pathology, pancreata were embedded in Cryomold and frozen on dry ice for cryosections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis of the in vivo effect of miRNA92a on the human immune cells, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid H2-Ab1tm1Gru Il2rgtm1Wjl Tg (HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1)1Dv//Sz (NSG HLA-DQ8 Tg) mice, developed by Leonard Shultz, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice lack mouse MHC class II, although they express the human HLA-DQ8 transgenically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSG HLA-DQ8 mice are immunodeficient and develop a human immune system after reconstitution with human hematopoietic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Donors for reconstitution were sex-matched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment of humanized mice with the in vivo miRNA92a antagomir was performed with three i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injections of 10 mg/kg over 7 d. No animals were excluded due to illness or outlier results; therefore, no exclusion determination was required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethical approval for all mouse experimentation has been received by the District Government of Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany (approval nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.2-1-54-2532-81-12 and 55.2-1-54-2532-84-12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigators were not blinded to group allocation during the in vivo experiments or to the assessment of experimental end points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histopathology_of_NOD_Pancreata  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pancreata were embedded with TissueTek O.C.T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound and frozen on dry ice, and serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulitis scoring was performed as previously described (64, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following scores were assigned: 0, intact islets/no lesions; 1, periislet infiltrates; 2, less_than25% islet destruction; 3,  greater than 25% islet destruction; and 4, complete islet destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunofluorescence staining was done using rabbitanti-mouse insulin antibodies (Cell Signaling) and donkeyanti-rabbit Alexa647 antibodies (Dianova).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CD4 staining, ratanti-mouse (Becton, Dickinson and Company) antibodies were used, followed by goatanti-rat AlexaFluor488 (Dianova).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FOXP3 staining, cells were incubated with ratanti-mouse antibodies (eBioscience) and goatanti-ratbio (Becton, Dickinson and Company) combined with TSA Cyanine3 amplification (PerkinElmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were counterstained with HOECHST 33342 dye (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative control slides were incubated with secondary antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Chitosan-Coated_PLGA_Nanoparticle_Preparation_and_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nanoparticles were produced following the method described by Ravi Kumar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39) using PLGA Resomer RG 752H (Evonik) and Protasan UP CL 113 Chitosan (NovaMatrix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For confocal imaging, the nanoparticles were produced with a 5-fluorescineamine (FA)-PLGA conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured hydrodynamic diameter was 146.7 ± 0.8 nm (152.8 ± 1.2 nm), the polydispersity index was 0.068 ± 0.009 (0.056 ± 0.007), and the zeta potential was +29.6 ± 0.3 mV (+29.6 ± 0.7 mV) for the chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles and FA-labeled nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_miRNA_Nanoparticles_Uptake_by_Confocal_Imaging_of_CD4+_T-Cell_Cytospins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles (130 nm in size) with or without fluorescent label (FA) were obtained from Claus-Michael Lehr at the Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Saarland University, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful uptake and delivery of miRNA to human and murine CD4+ T cells was determined: Respective naive CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 18 h in the presence of FA-labeled nanoparticles complexed with miRIDIAN miRNA transfection control (Dy547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake was initially confirmed by identification of a clearly distinguishable FA+ population using FACS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally the uptake was confirmed by confocal imaging: Human naive CD4+ T cells were stimulated as described above for 18 h in the presence or absence of nanoparticles and labeled miRIDIAN miRNA mimic transfection control (Dy547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the stimulation, CD4+ T cells were washed and fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon generation of cytospins, intracellular localization of nanoparticles and delivered miRNA were assessed by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insulin_Autoantibody_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulin autoantibodies were determined using an ELISA system as described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, high-binding, 96-well plates (Costar) were coated with human recombinant insulin (10 g/mL; SigmaAldrich) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unspecific blocking was done using PBS containing 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preincubated serum (diluted 1:10) with or without insulin competition was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After four wash steps, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG1 (Abcam) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/BSA was added for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing the plate, horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was added for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate was washed five times, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution was added (OptEIA reagent set; Becton, Dickinson and Company).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was stopped using sulfuric acid, and fluorescent intensity was determined in the Epoch plate reader (Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was run in duplicate with and without competition using human insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, an index was calculated based on the mean of the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine levels of IAA in NOD mice, a Protein A/G radiobinding assay based on 125I-labeled recombinant human insulin was applied as previously described (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum from nonautoimmune prone BALB/c mice was used as negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
