Epigenetic inactivation of the p53-induced long noncoding RNA TP53 target 1 in human cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are starting to be recognized as critical molecules for cellular transformation, although only a few candidates have so far been characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that TP53TG1 is an lncRNA that is critical for the correct response of p53 to DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cancer growth suppressor features of TP53TG1 are linked to its ability to block the tumorigenic activity of the RNA binding protein YBX1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA methylation-associated silencing of TP53TG1 produces aggressive tumors that are resistant to cellular death when DNA-damaging agents and small targeted molecules are used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides an example of a tumor suppressor lncRNA undergoing an epigenetic lesion in cancer that is placed at the crossroads of DNA damage and oncogenic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of cellular homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their contribution to the cancer phenotype still needs to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we have identified a p53-induced lncRNA, TP53TG1, that undergoes cancer-specific promoter hypermethylation-associated silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro and in vivo assays identify a tumor-suppressor activity for TP53TG1 and a role in the p53 response to DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that TP53TG1 binds to the multifaceted DNA/RNA binding protein YBX1 to prevent its nuclear localization and thus the YBX1-mediated activation of oncogenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TP53TG1 epigenetic inactivation in cancer cells releases the transcriptional repression of YBX1-targeted growth-promoting genes and creates a chemoresistant tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TP53TG1 hypermethylation in primary tumors is shown to be associated with poor outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenetic loss of TP53TG1 therefore represents an altered event in an lncRNA that is linked to classical tumoral pathways, such as p53 signaling, but is also connected to regulatory networks of the cancer cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TP53TG1_Shows_Cancer-Specific_DNA_Methylation-Associated_Transcriptional_Silencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize cancer-specific DNA methylation changes that affect lncRNA expression, we followed the experimental workflow shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took advantage of the existence of an isogenic cell line derived from the colon cancer cell line HCT-116, which shows genetic disruption by homologous recombination of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3b (double knockout, DKO) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DKO cells have drastically reduced DNMT activity, 5-methylcytosine DNA content, and, above all, a release of coding genes and microRNA silencing associated with promoter CpG island hypomethylation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to identify cancer-specific DNA methylation events in lncRNA loci, so we also included two samples of normal colon mucosa in our study design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained the DNA methylation profile of the wild-type HCT-116 cells, the derived DKO cells, and the aforementioned normal colon using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) microarray, which interrogates 482,422 CpG sites (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noting that the platform includes 104 annotated lncRNAs with a 5-CpG island (SI Appendix, Table S1) enabled us to narrow our search to the candidate methylated positions with a possible effect on lncRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify from among these candidates those lncRNAs with cancer-specific differential methylation, we imposed stringent criteria to consider only those CpG island sites with a 70% change in the CpG methylation level between the cancer cell line HCT-116 compared with the demethylated DKO cell line and the normal colon cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, we identified 10 targets: TP53TG1 (TP53 target gene 1), NCRNA00028, LOC157627, MIR155HG, WT1AS, LINC00473, C20orf200, EMX2OS, MIAT, and MYCNOS (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed transcriptional silencing in HCT-116 cells and demethylation-associated reactivation in DKO cells for seven (70%) of the lncRNAs: TP53TG1, NCRNA00028, LOC157627, MIR155HG, WT1AS, C20orf200, and MYCNOS (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all of them were promising candidates for further analysis, we decided to focus our interest on TP53TG1 because of its high-ranking order in the differential methylation (SI Appendix, Table S2) and expression (SI Appendix, Fig S1) data and because of its proposed role in central cancer pathways such as the p53 network (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the latter, TP53TG1 expression is induced in a p53-dependent manner upon conditions of cellular stress that involve the induction of double-strand breaks, such as UV irradiation (27, 28), or exposure to bleomycin or cisplatin (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further demonstrate the silencing of TP53TG1 in cancer cells in association with the presence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation, we proceeded to characterize its transcription start site (TSS) and DNA methylation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we confirmed that the TP53TG1 transcript originates within the CpG island in the DNA methylation microarray, confirming the Refseq database annotation in UCSC (NR_015381.1 from GRCh38/hg38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bisulfite genomic sequencing of multiple clones confirmed the dense methylation of the CpG island in HCT-116 cells and its unmethylated status in normal colorectal mucosa (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended our DNA methylation analyses to another 12 gastrointestinal cancer cell lines (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to HCT-116, TP53TG1 5-end CpG island hypermethylation was also found in the colorectal cancer cell line KM12 and in the gastric cancer cell lines KATO-III and TGBC11TKB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the other cell lines were unmethylated at this locus (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal gastric mucosa and nontumorigenic human colon epithelial cells (HCECs) (29) were unmethylated at the TP53TG1 CpG island (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a loss of TP53TG1 expression in all of the hypermethylated cells, whereas lncRNA was expressed in the unmethylated cases (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the use of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restored TP53TG1 expression in the hypermethylated HCT-116, KM12, KATO-III, and TGBC11TKB cell lines (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subcellular fractioning showed that the TP53TG1 transcript in DKO cells, in addition to being present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, was particularly enriched in the cytosolic compartment (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) corroborated this intracellular localization (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the noncoding nature of the TP53TG1 RNA transcript by using an artificially created recombinant protein followed by Western blot to demonstrate the lack of any TP53TG1-derived protein in the unmethylated HCEC and DKO cell lines (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro transcription/translation assays confirmed the absence of TP53TG1 coding potential (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TP53TG1s lack of coding capacity was also apparent from the negative codon substitution frequency (CSF) score (30) of 402.4488, which was similar to that obtained from the well-characterized lncRNA HOTAIR (354.5062).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicate that tumor-specific promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of the lncRNA TP53TG1 occurs in colorectal and gastric cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TP53TG1_Exhibits_Tumor_Suppressor-Like_Features_in_Cancer_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having observed the CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of TP53TG1 in colorectal and gastric cancer cells, we used in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the ability of the lncRNA to suppress tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the in vitro approach, we stably transfected the HCT-116 cell line, hypermethylated and silenced for TP53TG1, with a plasmid encoding the full-length lncRNA transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of transfection was assessed by measuring TP53TG1 expression by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon TP53TG1 transfection, the cells proved to be significantly less proliferative in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Fig 2B) and had a significantly lower percentage colony formation density (Fig 2B) than empty vector-transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced growth of the TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cell line was associated with apoptosis induction, based on the assessment of the sub-G1 cell population, caspase 3/7 levels, and the annexin V assay (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoration of TP53TG1 expression upon transfection in HCT-116 was also associated with a decreased invasion and migration potential of these cells, as measured by the Matrigel-based xCELLigence real-time assay (31) (Fig 2D) and the wound-healing assay (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the in vivo approach, we first used tumor-formation assays in nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCT-116 cells transfected with either the empty or the TP53TG1 vector were s.c. injected into nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumors originating from TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells had a significantly lower volume and weight than empty vector-transfected/derived tumors (Fig 2E), in addition to a higher apoptosis rate (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also did an orthotopic growth study, implanting equal-sized tumor pieces from the s.c. model into the colon tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that orthotopic TP53TG1-transfected tumors were significantly smaller than the empty vector-transfected tumors (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also proceeded with the converse experiment in which we analyzed the effect of TP53TG1 depletion in nontransformed immortalized colonocytes (HCECs), which have an unmethylated CpG island and express the lncRNA transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon efficient small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of TP53TG1 (Fig 2G), we observed a significant enhancement of cell viability, as measured by the MTT assay, relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig 2G), and a reduced apoptosis rate (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our findings suggest that TP53TG1 has a tumor-suppressor role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TP53TG1_Contributes_to_p53_Response_to_DNA_Damage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
p53 is known to activate TP53TG1 expression upon the induction of double-strand breaks in DNA caused by ionizing irradiation (27, 28) or treatment with DNA-damaging agents (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prompted us to consider whether TP53TG1 hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells affected the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs that directly target DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the TP53TG1-unmethylated HCEC line, which carries a wild-type p53 gene, we observed that treatment with the DNA-damaging agents caused not only the expected induction of p53 but also enhanced TP53TG1 expression (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same effect was observed in two other TP53TG1-unmethylated and p53 wild-type gastrointestinal cell lines: SW48 (colon) and SNU-1 (stomach) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not find increased TP53TG1 expression when using DNA-damaging agents in the unmethylated, but p53 mutant, SW-620 colorectal cancer cell line (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found that the induction of TP53TG1 upon DNA damage was dependent on the presence of a functional p53: siRNA-mediated depletion of p53 in HCECs impaired the overexpression of TP53TG1 when the DNA-damaging drug was used (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then attempted to determine how p53 exerted its control over TP53TG1 transcription at the molecular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that p53 binds to a previously identified enhancer sequence located in intron 2 of TP53TG1 (32, 33) (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association of p53 to the TP53TG1 locus has been previously reported using ChIP followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described enhancer intronic region interacts with the promoter of TP53TG1, as shown by chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) (35) (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p53 binds to this regulatory region of TP53TG1 and transcriptionally activates it when the DNA-damaging agent is used (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the same binding pattern for the classical p53-responding gene p21WAF1 (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having discovered that TP53TG1 restoration in an initially methylation-silenced cell induces apoptosis and that p53 activates TP53TG1 transcription upon DNA damage, we wondered whether the recovery of TP53TG1 expression sensitizes to DNA-damaging agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we measured the IC50 of the HCT-116, TP53TG1-unmethylated, and p53 wild-type cell line, transfected with an empty vector or with the studied lncRNA for four different single-treatment DNA-damaging agents (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cisplatin) and the drug combinations used in the clinical context of colorectal cancer, 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, in all of the cases, the transfection-mediated recovery of TP53TG1 expression significantly increased the sensitivity to these agents (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also extended the in vitro cell viability experiments to an in vivo mouse model of orthotopic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that orthotopic colorectal tumors derived from TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells were significantly more responsive to the common colorectal chemotherapeutic regimen of 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin than empty vector-derived tumors (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that TP53TG1 probably plays an important role in the p53-mediated antitumoral effects of DNA-damaging agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TP53TG1_Binds_to_the_RNA_Binding_Protein_YBX1_and_Prevents_Its_Nuclear_Localization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the exception of its role as a transcript induced by p53 upon DNA damage (27, 28), nothing is known about the functions of TP53TG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify protein partners of TP53TG1 that could characterize its activity in the processes described here, we performed RNA pull-down assays combined with mass spectrometry (MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro-synthesized full-length TP53TG1 RNA, or its antisense version, was incubated in the presence of HCEC extracts and the retrieved proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4A, a protein band of 45 kDa was specifically pulled down by TP53TG1 RNA but not by other control RNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This band was cut out from the gel, trypsin-digested, and further characterized by MS, which identified the isolated band as the Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1, also known as YB-1) through the identification of four distinct peptides (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YBX1 functions as both a DNA and RNA binding protein and has been implicated in numerous cellular processes, including regulation of transcription and translation, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA reparation, and mRNA packaging (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YBX1 activation has been associated with cancer progression (37, 38), the epithelialmesenchymal transition (39), metastasis (40), and drug resistance (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot with a specific antibody confirmed that YBX1 is enriched in the TP53TG1 pull-down (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reciprocal experiment showed that immunoprecipitation of YBX1 from HCECs can copurify the TP53TG1 lncRNA as a binding partner (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control IgG was used as a negative reaction and the YBX1 partner G3BP1 mRNA (43) was used as a positive control for YBX1 binding (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic prediction of protein partners for TP53TG1 using the catRAPID system (44) also indicated that YBX1 was a likely target of the lncRNA studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further characterized the specific RNA sequence in the TP53TG1 transcript that was responsible for the binding to the YBX1 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using various YBX1 deletion mutants, followed by YBX1 Western blot in the RNA pull-down assays, we identified that, from the 710 nucleotides of the full-length transcript, a middle region of 253 nucleotides was responsible for YBX1 binding (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region included five CACC YBX1 binding motifs (45, 46) (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, when we mutated the five CACC motifs, the binding of TP53TG1 to YBX1 was notably diminished (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mobility shift assays showed that the recombinant YBX1 protein was able to bind specifically to this middle region, indicating a direct interaction with the lncRNA (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the intact CACC YBX1-binding sites was necessary to ensure the tumor-suppressor function of TP53TG1 observed here, as transfection of the lncRNA form mutated at the five CACC motifs was unable to inhibit HCT-116 cell growth, as determined by the MTT and colony-formation assay (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the cotransfection of the full-length wild-type YBX1 protein in TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells increased their growth and invasion potential, thus reversing in part the tumor suppressor role of TP53TG1 (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore imply that the multitasked YBX1 protein is a direct target of TP53TG1 involved in its associated tumor suppressor features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then examined the effect that TP53TG1 could have on YBX1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfection-mediated restoration of TP53TG1 expression in HCT-116 did not affect the total mRNA or protein levels of YBX1 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar manner, the siRNA-mediated depletion of TP53TG1 in HCECs affected neither the total transcript nor the amount of the YBX1 protein (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also no association between the presence of TP53TG1 methylation-associated silencing in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and YBX1 RNA levels (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TP53TG1 does not seem to have a significant role in determining the overall levels of YBX1 in a particular cell or tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a key component of YBX1 activity resides in its controlled trafficking between the nucleus and the cytosol related to its dual activities as a DNA- and an RNA-binding protein (36, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the impact of TP53TG1 in YBX1 intracellular compartmentalization, we isolated and studied the nuclear and cytosolic fraction in our experimental system in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that YBX1 was present in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments of TP53TG1-methylated HCT-116 cells (Fig 5B), but the transfection-mediated recovery of TP53TG1 expression in these cells caused the exclusion of YBX1 from the nucleus (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence assays confirmed the localization of YBX1 in the cytosol and nucleus of HCT-116 cells (Fig 5B) and its exclusively cytosolic presence upon the transfection-related restoration of TP53TG1 expression (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a panel of TP53TG1-methylated (KM12, TGBC11TKB, and KATO-III) and -unmethylated (HT-29, SW480, HCEC, GCIY, and NUG-3) gastrointestinal cells, we confirmed that nuclear staining was almost absent in the unmethylated cell lines and the clear detection of both nuclear and cytosolic localization in the hypermethylated samples (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results suggest that the tumor-suppressor role of TP53TG1 identified here could be mediated by preventing the widely described protumorigenic nuclear functions of YBX1 (3642).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YBX1 is known to bind to the promoter of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) gene and to stimulate its transcription (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly for our observed chemoresistant phenotypes, it is known that PI3K stimulates AKT and MDM2 phosphorylation, thus facilitating p53 degradation (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, ChIP demonstrated that the transfection-mediated recovery of TP53TG1 expression in HCT-116 cells reduced the binding of the YBX1 protein to the PI3K promoter (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the diminished binding of YBX1 to the PI3K promoter was associated with the down-regulation of the PI3K protein and the reduced phosphorylation of AKT in comparison with empty vector-transfected cells (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of the TP53TG1 transcript mutated at the five CACC YBX1 binding sites did not affect PI3K protein levels or AKT phosphorylation (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the diminished PI3K/AKT signaling seen when TP53TG1 expression was restored was associated with greater sensitivity to PI3K and AKT inhibitors (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway upon TP53TG1 restitution also decreased MDM2 phosphorylation and estabilized p53 protein levels (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results therefore suggest that the epigenetic silencing of TP53TG1 in cancer cells promotes the YBX1-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which then creates further resistance not only to common chemotherapy DNA-damaging agents but also to small drug-targeted inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding relates to the broad spectrum of chemoresistance that is customarily associated with the YBX1 protein (36, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TP53TG1_Hypermethylation_Occurs_in_Gastrointestinal_Tumors_in_Association_with_Poor_Outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of TP53TG1 cancer-specific promoter CpG island hypermethylation was not an in vitro characteristic restricted to colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data mining of large collections of primary human tumors interrogated by the same DNA methylation microarray platform as used here (26) confirmed the existence of TP53TG1 hypermethylation in 6% (12 of 180) and 10% (9 of 94) of colorectal (49) and gastric (50) tumors, respectively (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA methylation data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for colorectal (51) and gastric (52) primary tumors also show the presence of TP53TG1 hypermethylation in 4% (14 of 369) and 13% (38 of 298) of these cases, respectively (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher frequency of aberrant TP53TG1 DNA methylation noted in the primary stomach neoplasias prompted us to focus our efforts on this tumor type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCGA RNA-sequencing data in gastric carcinomas (52) show that TP53TG1 methylation was associated with transcript down-regulation (MannWhitney U test, P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) the DNA methylation status of the 5-end promoter CpG island of TP53TG1 in a collection of 173 primary gastric tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found TP53TG1 hypermethylation in 26% (45 of 173) of the gastric neoplasms studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied in greater depth the possible clinical impact of the epigenetic alteration in TP53TG1 in the 63 gastric cancer patients for whom we had detailed information about pathological characteristics and disease outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the presence of TP53TG1 hypermethylation was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.018) (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the two groups of early and advanced clinical stage patients separately, we found that the impact of the outcome was due to the gastric patients with locoregional disease (stages I and II): TP53TG1 hypermethylation was significantly associated with shorter PFS in gastric patients with locoregional disease (P = 0.028) (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cox proportional hazard regression models of these conditions showed TP53TG1 methylation to be an independent prognostic factor of worse PFS [hazard ratio (HR) =3.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.1911.11, P = 0.023], compared with other parameters such as gender, age, histology, and tumor location (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we assessed if the intracellular localization of YBX1, determined in part by TP53TG1 expression as we have shown in our in vitro experiments, could help to further discriminate the above described clinical groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using YBX1 immunohistochemistry, we observed that those patients with worse clinical outcome showed TP53TG1 hypermethylation and YBX1 nuclear staining, whereas the best PFS values were found in unmethylated TP53TG1 and cytosolic YBX1 cases (P = 0.001) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of TP53TG1 methylation status in the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients was also found in primary colorectal cancer tumors from the TCGA cohort (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these cases, TCGA RNA-sequencing data showed that TP53TG1 methylation was associated with transcript down-regulation (MannWhitney U test, P less_than 0.0001) (SI Appendix, Fig S6), that TP53TG1 hypermethylation was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.03) (SI Appendix, Fig S6), and that TP53TG1 methylation was an independent prognostic factor of worse overall survival in Cox proportional hazard regression models (HR = 5.44, 95% CI = 1.1525.68, P = 0.032) (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TP53TG1 epigenetic disruption highlights those gastrointestinal malignancies that will be more clinically aggressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with the data obtained from the molecular, cellular, and mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA expression patterns in human tumors that are distorted with respect to their normal tissue counterparts are one of the most commonly observed molecular phenotypes of carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these RNA expression changes, due to genetic and/or epigenetic defects, are potential driver events of tumorigenesis, whereas others may be merely downstream bystander events that accompany cell transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the expanding field of lncRNAs in cancer, it is important to distinguish events directly involved in the acquisition and development of the tumorigenic features from those that may be passengers in the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to do this is to link the studied lncRNA with a well-defined oncogenic or tumor-suppressor pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we have linked the promoter DNA methylation-associated silencing of the lncRNA TP53TG1 to the impaired response of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 to DNA damage that prevents the induction of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the epigenetic inactivation of TP53TG1 can be considered to be another hit taken by the p53 network in cancer cells, in addition to the molecular disruption of other key elements of the p53 tumor suppressor and DNA damage response pathway, such as those occurring with the oncogene MDM2 and the tumor suppressor p14ARF (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another relevant step toward highlighting a functional role for a lncRNA in cancer cells, in addition to the in vitro and in vivo growth assays, is the characterization of a bona fide mechanism of action of the lncRNA with a probable role in tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most difficult aspects in the field of lncRNA research is elucidating the exact cellular mechanism used by the molecule in question (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining RNA pull-down assays and MS, we have established that TP53TG1 binds and regulates the intracellular localization of the RNA binding protein YBX1, a factor that has attracted considerable interest among cancer researchers because it sits at the crossroads of several processes, such as tumor progression (37, 38), epithelialmesenchymal transition (39), metastasis (40), and drug resistance (36, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we have described how YBX1 nuclear enrichment, mediated by TP53TG1 epigenetic loss, activates the growth-promoting PI3K gene and its downstream target, the oncoprotein AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the story goes back to the initial p53 link, because AKT activation induces MDM2 phosphorylation and final increased degradation of the tumor inhibitor p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many other candidate genes and pathways could also be affected by the YBX1 aberrant nucleuscytosol trafficking induced by the epigenetic loss of TP53TG1, and these alternative targets warrant further research in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cellular phenotypes arising upon TP53TG1 CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing have implications beyond the observed molecular chain of events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can have important translational consequences for the management of related neoplasms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cancer cell featuring TP53TG1 epigenetic inactivation has acquired a chemoresistant phenotype affecting a wide repertoire of drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA methylation-associated silencing of TP53TG1 is associated with resistance to compounds that damage DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are commonly used classical chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin, which are administered to treat the most prevalent human tumor types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the loss of TP53TG1 enhances the resistance to more specific next-generation small molecules such as PI3K and AKT inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of this general chemoresistant phenotype partly explains why the oncology patients displaying the aberrant DNA methylation lesion in TP53TG1 have a shorter PFS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the TP53TG1 hypermethylation described here would not only be an example of a tumor-suppressor lncRNA but could become a valuable marker in personalized cancer therapy if other studies were able to validate our findings in large, prospective, independent clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
