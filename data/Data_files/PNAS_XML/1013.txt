Structural predictor for nonlinear sheared dynamics in simple glass-forming liquids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluidity is the key dynamical physical property of the liquid state and is characterized by the transport coefficient, viscosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For slow flow, the viscosity of a liquid is generally independent of the flow rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fast flow, however, the behavior can be much more complicated; for example, supercooled liquids are known to exhibit a drastic decrease in viscosity under high flow rates, thus flowing more easily and dissipating less energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its fundamental and industrial importance, the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon known as shear thinning remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that shear thinning is characterized only by the flow-induced change of the liquid structure along the extensional direction of the flow, providing a hint at understanding this long-standing unresolved problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glass-forming liquids subjected to sufficiently strong shear universally exhibit striking nonlinear behavior; for example, a power-law decrease of the viscosity with increasing shear rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon has attracted considerable attention over the years from both fundamental and applicational viewpoints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the out-of-equilibrium and nonlinear nature of sheared fluids have made theoretical understanding of this phenomenon very challenging and thus slower to progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find here that the structural relaxation time as a function of the two-body excess entropy, calculated for the extensional axis of the shear flow, collapses onto the corresponding equilibrium curve for a wide range of pair potentials ranging from harsh repulsive to soft and finite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-body excess entropy collapse provides a powerful approach to predicting the dynamics of nonequilibrium liquids from their equilibrium counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the two-body excess entropy scaling suggests that sheared dynamics is controlled purely by the liquid structure captured in the form of the two-body excess entropy along the extensional direction, shedding light on the perplexing mechanism behind shear thinning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Systems_Studied  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five different 3D systems are studied in the main text: size polydisperse WCA fluid (38, 47), IPL r12 fluid, Dzugutov liquid (48), KABLJ mixture (49), and the GCM (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WCA fluid particles interact with an LJ pair potential vij(r)=4[ij/r12ij/r6] truncated and shifted at the minimum where ij = (i+j)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size polydispersity for the WCA fluid is 8% to avoid crystallization, and the sizes are sampled from a flat distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dzugutov pair potential has a characteristic maximum, besides the LJ minimum, around the second-nearest neighbor distance of a face-centered cubic crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KABLJ mixture is a 4:1 binary mixture interacting with the LJ pair potential using the parameters AB=0.80, BB=0.88, AB=1.50, and BB=0.50, and the GCM pair potential is v(r)=exp[(r/)2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Materials and Methods, we also present results for the core soft water (CSW) model, which has a ramp-like pair potential and thus two length scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
System sizes used in the simulations (see below for simulation details) are, respectively, N = 10,976, 10,976, 10,976, 10,000, and 4,096 for WCA, IPL, Dzugutov, KABLJ, and GCM (N = 1,024 for CSW; see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply natural reduced units (e.g.,  = 1 and  = 1) for each system when reporting data in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a single-component analysis is applied when calculating the two-body excess entropy and structural relaxation time for the WCA fluid and KABLJ mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulation_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MD computer simulations in the NVT ensemble (NoseHoover dynamics) are used to study equilibrium dynamics, and SLLOD equations of motion combined with LeesEdwards periodic boundary and a Gaussian thermostat are used for sheared dynamics applying the RUMD package (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SLLOD equations of motion realize Couette shear flow where  = vx/y is the shear rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here x, y, and z are the flow, shear gradient, and vorticity direction, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each system, we estimate the highest possible shear rate attainable in our simulations from the strong decrease in the configurational temperature with increasing shear rate (around  = 0.01 for the WCA system) (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate at least t10 (usually much more) before sampling datathat is, we sample steady-state shear flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The viscosity is calculated from  = xy/, where xy is the xy component of the configurational stress tensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angular-dependent two-body excess entropy s2 is defined bys20[g(r,)lng(r,)(g(r,)1)]r2dr,[2]where s2=02s2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anisotropy of g() in the vorticity direction is neglected to enhance statistics with no loss in generalitythat is, g()g(r,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RDF is calculated fromg(r,)=L32r2rN(N1)ik(r|ik|)(ik),[3]using a bin size of r=0.01 and  = /50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is performed for each bin i to obtain s2 as a function of ; we checked that the results are independent of binning size and the integration limit is taken as r=L/2, with L being the box length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural relaxation time  in equilibrium is calculated from Fs(,t)=exp[i] when Fs(p,)=0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wave number |p| is chosen near the first peak of the static structure factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The self-part of the intermediate scattering function under shear is given by Fs(,t)=exp[ii,].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The affine motion of the flow is subtracted via the approximation i,i  (yit), where yi is the absolute coordinate of particle i and x is a unit vector in the x direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression has been shown to approximate the full integral well and does not require extensive bookkeeping (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural relaxation time under shear is defined similarly as Fs(p,)=0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the self-part of the intermediate scattering function under shear is almost independent of the direction for qp, we average only the transverse wave vectors when calculating  (and, for simplicity, the equilibrium wave number is probed for all sheared state points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
