An invasive foundation species enhances multifunctionality in a coastal ecosystem  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The accelerating loss of coastal foundation species impairs the delivery of vital ecosystem services on which nearly half the human population depends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognizing how loss of habitat-forming species such as seagrasses and oysters can be offset is therefore essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper demonstrates that in areas where native foundation species are absent, nonnative habitat formers can amplify the production of diverse ecosystem functions that underpin provisioning of services to humans, such as food production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that in areas where native foundation species have been lost, invasive habitat formers may be considered as a tool to enhance multiple ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While invasive species often threaten biodiversity and human well-being, their potential to enhance functioning by offsetting the loss of native habitat has rarely been considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated the abundance of the nonnative, habitat-forming seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla in large plots (25 m2) on southeastern US intertidal landscapes to assess impacts on multiple ecosystem functions underlying coastal ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document that in the absence of native habitat formers, this invasion has an overall positive, density-dependent impact across a diverse set of ecosystem processes (e.g., abundance and richness of nursery taxa, flow attenuation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulation of invader abundance revealed both thresholds and saturations in the provisioning of ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings call into question the focus of traditional invasion research and management that assumes negative effects of nonnatives, and emphasize the need to consider context-dependence and integrative measurements when assessing the impact of an invader, including density dependence, multifunctionality, and the status of native habitat formers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work supports discussion of the idea that where native foundation species have been lost, invasive habitat formers may be considered as sources of valuable ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ecosystem services, and underlying processes and functions, for Gracilaria supported by this study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the relationships between Gracilaria cover and individual ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether Gracilaria cover affects biological productivity and diversity (underpinning the service of raw materials and food), we sampled the abundance and richness of epifauna in a 0.25-m2 quadrat in each plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found positive, hyperbolic relationships between Gracilaria cover and both epifauna abundance (Fig 2A) and richness (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, saturation was reached rapidly; on average, epifauna abundance and richness were more than three orders of magnitude greater in the presence than in the absence of Gracilaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epifauna community was dominated by small herbivorous crustaceans and gastropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of increasing Gracilaria cover on flow attenuation (measured as the dissolution of gypsum blocks) underlying coastal protection was logarithmic and positive (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find a significant relationship between Gracilaria cover and sediment stabilization, a process that underpins erosion control (Fig 2D), although there was a nonsignificant tendency for plots with higher Gracilaria cover to accumulate sediments (plots with 55% cover appeared to accumulate sediments; Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Gracilaria cover on abundance (Fig 2E) and taxonomic richness (Fig 2F) of nursery species, functions underlying the maintenance of fisheries, were strongly positive, with hyperbolic and logarithmic response functions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots containing Gracilaria had 400% higher abundances of nursery species than those without Gracilaria, dominated by commercially important species, including croaker (fish), blue crabs, and penaeid shrimp (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the epifauna data, nursery function increased more slowly with the abundance of the invader, demonstrating markedly different levels of ecosystem functioning across our density treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any significant relationship between Gracilaria cover and decomposition (Fig 2G), a function underlying carbon sequestration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the effect of increasing Gracilaria cover on the abundance and richness of epifauna and nursery species and flow attenuation was highly significant (P less_than 0.001), positive, and saturating (Fig 2 AC, E, and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the density-dependent effects of Gracilaria on the simultaneous performance of multiple functions (multifunctionality) as described previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed a strong positive, logarithmic relationship between Gracilaria cover and ecosystem multifunctionality, measured as the mean standardized index of all seven functions in percent (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further quantify whether Gracilaria enhances the simultaneous maintenance of multiple ecosystem functions, we assessed the effect of Gracilaria cover on the ability to achieve single ecosystem multifunctionality thresholds by counting the number of functions in each plot maintained above a given threshold (defined between 10% and 90%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the form of this response varied slightly depending on the threshold examined, the relationship between Gracilaria cover and the number of functions maintained above a given threshold was significantly positive across all thresholds up to 90% (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide large-scale experimental evidence for a positive relationship between the abundance of an invasive habitat-forming seaweed and ecosystem multifunctionality in the context of absent native foundation species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ecological functions measured in our experiment were not chosen at random, but rather were selected as proxies for processes that underpin essential services provided by seagrass ecosystems (9), which are among the most important coastal systems worldwide (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that native foundation species have been severely reduced in this region (4, 7, 36, 37), and considering that our sampling encompassed measurements of disparate ecological functions in large plots, included temporal variation, and was conducted more than 5 y after the initial invasion (35), we argue that our findings are representative of how this foundation species affects shallow, soft-bottom ecosystems in which native foundation species have been lost or are absent (23, 31, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas many invasive species threaten biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well-being (1, 15, 16, 43), our field experiment revealed that Gracilaria can provide multiple ecosystem functions by creating novel habitat in an otherwise barren sedimentary landscape, increasing epifaunal biodiversity and the biomass of important fishery species (nursery functions) and decreasing hydrodynamic forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in epifaunal biodiversity is supported by the results of previous investigations (23, 31, 42, 44, 45), although those studies quantified impacts from only a few experimental densities and on smaller spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are also consistent with a growing body of work demonstrating the importance of positive interactions in ecological communities, especially under conditions of elevated physical stress that dominate degraded coastal habitats targeted for restoration (31, 38, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we note that Gracilaria represents a typical foundation species (sensu ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47) because it increases biodiversity through habitat formation and delivers multiple ecosystem functions, analogous to trees in forests (48), salt marshes (38), oyster reefs (8, 12), seagrasses (6), mussel beds (46), and many other sessile taxa (1, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore support the need for an experimental and comprehensive examination of invasive species' effects before ascribing a sign (+ or ) to their overall impact (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we did not identify the underpinning mechanisms by which Gracilaria increases ecosystem multifunctionality, our results suggest that, by forming a complex biogenic habitat, Gracilaria (i) occupies the fundamental niche of a foundation species, (ii) directly increases biodiversity, (iii) indirectly increases ecosystem functioning (via its effect on biodiversity), and (iv) thereby provides density-dependent functions comparable to those of functionally similar natives (2022, 31, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is possible that Gracilaria has negative effects on ecosystem functions that were not measured here (24) or that could emerge if Gracilaria were to accumulate in very large densities in stagnant waters (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no negative effect of Gracilaria on either infauna or waterfowl activity, and only a weak negative effect on ray foraging activity even at the highest densities (SI Text and Fig S2; these additional functions were measured only at the end of the experiment and thus were excluded from the formal analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that decreased ray foraging could facilitate commercially and recreationally important bivalves like clams, mussels, and oysters, similar to how Gracilaria modifies other predatorprey interactions in this system (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ecologists are becoming increasingly aware that native foundation species provide ecosystem functions in nonlinear ways (3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental findings demonstrate similar nonlinearity in ecosystem functions provided by a nonnative foundation species that has invaded thousands of kilometers of coastline throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the slopes and saturation points in these nonlinear functions vary widely for different ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale dependency is likely an important factor contributing to this variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, functions such as wave attenuation and sediment stabilization may manifest on larger scales and at higher densities (39), whereas functions associated with biodiversity, such as productivity and nursery habitats, appear to operate on smaller scales and at lower densities (i.e., with early thresholds as shown here and in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although curve shapes of multifunctionality are likely to depend on the functions included in the analysis, our supplementary analysis (adding four processes measured at the end of our experiment) showed similarly curved functional responses, suggesting that our results are robust (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, to better understand the impacts of nonnative coastal foundation species, future studies should manipulate more densities (including both high and low extremes) and measure more ecosystem functions across different environmental gradients (e.g., salinity, depth, latitude).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Management_Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human activities are accelerating the losses of species that provide the foundation for coastal habitats, including seagrasses, oysters, and salt marshes (3, 4, 68, 12), and, consequently, the services that these species provide (1, 2, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoration is an important tool for mitigating coastal degradation, but despite recent advances (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), current practices have yet to succeed at scales sufficiently large to match the scale of degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent synthesis (13) suggests relatively low survival of restored seagrasses (41%), salt marshes (65%), and oyster reefs (56%) in the short-term (2 y) despite mean restoration costs of $700,000, $1,040,000, and $860,000 (2010 USD) per hectare for these three coastal habitats, respectively (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these appraisals do not take into account that (i) the cost and success of simultaneously eradicating nonnative analogs is uncertain (51); (ii) coastal management is becoming increasingly complicated as global anthropogenic stressors, such as climate change, eutrophication, and overharvesting, alter the context for future native and invasive species interactions (5254); and (iii) managers and researchers often do not know whether invasive foundation species are drivers, passengers, or back-seat drivers of ecological change, even though each of these scenarios requires a unique management and restoration approach (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, it appears that replacement of many native by nonnative foundation species, such as Wadden Sea mussels by invasive oysters and Mediterranean seagrasses by the nonnative seaweed Caulerpa, are driven more by external factors such as warming and eutrophication than by competitive interactions among foundation species (5759).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our case study, we recognize several advantages and disadvantages associated with passive do nothing, laissez faire vs. active remove and replace approaches to the management of invasive foundation species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this Gracilaria invasion in an area where native foundation species have severely declined, our results suggest that a passive approach could help sustain fishery outputs, invertebrate biodiversity, and erosion control, without causing reductions in extant native foundation species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akin to other invasions, however, Gracilaria may still increase global homogenization (60) and could have unknown long-term evolutionary consequences (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Gracilaria could potentially (i) have negative impacts on cryptic and rare endemic species (which would require a massive sampling effort to detect), (ii) decrease the likelihood of native habitat restoration success, and (iii) accumulate in extreme densities, where it may enhance the risk of local anoxia that can cause mortality of fish and benthic invertebrates (49, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an active remove and replace strategy, managers, in contrast, would seek to remove Gracilaria and restore economically and culturally important native foundation species to regain their associated benefits that support high biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, and regulation of erosional forces caused by wind and waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native oysters, seagrasses, and marshes typically have more stable biomass across seasons than Gracilaria, thereby providing more stable ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These native foundation species also have stronger legacy effects, as relic bivalves and macrophyte rhizomes can accumulate over time and thereby enhance ecological functions over longer time scales (63, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in contrast to Gracilaria and other invasive seaweeds, native marshes, oysters, and seagrasses have not been shown to cause large-scale anoxia events and associated faunal die-offs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nevertheless, despite the benefits of a remove and replace strategy, this approach has clear associated risks and costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the initial economic cost is fantastically high, and both the removal of invasive species and subsequent restoration of native species carry a high risk of failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remove and replace approach may also result in reintroduction, and will necessitate long-term monitoring and management of restored natives (13, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, more research is needed to provide better data for evaluating these management approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it will be important to study (i) facilitative vs. antagonistic impacts of Gracilaria on seagrasses, oysters, and marshes, and whether these native foundation species can recolonize invaded areas; (ii) long-term multigenerational impacts of Gracilaria on invertebrates, fish, and birds to, for example, document whether this invasion leads to evolutionary traps or whether there are cryptic native species that are lost or decimated following the invasion (61); and (iii) economic, environmental, and cultural costs and benefits associated with the contrasting management schemes (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, until such research has been carried out, managers should pragmatically acknowledge and incorporate the possibility of positive ecosystem functions delivered by nonnative foundation species into their decision making processes for conservation strategies (17, 18), especially when native foundation species are absent and eradication and restoration is infeasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our large-scale field experiment documented positive density-dependent relationships between Gracilaria abundance and many individual and integrative ecosystem functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, if native foundation species are absent and restoration is infeasible, then actively incorporating established nonnative foundation species into conservation and management strategies may have stronger than expected benefits for the provisioning of coastal ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that this work will stimulate new thinking and innovative research on the impacts of nonnative foundation species, which are likely to become increasingly common community members in our rapidly changing world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment was carried out on intertidal mud and sandflats located within the Zekes Island National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), a shallow lagoon-like estuarine complex in the lower Cape Fear River, NC (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tides are semidiurnal and range from 1.1 to 1.7 m above mean lower low water (MLLW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salinity ranges from 20 to 35 ppt depending on rainfall and tidal currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like much of the Atlantic coast of the southeastern US, this estuary was once dominated by such species as salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in the high-intertidal zone, oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in the mid-intertidal zone, and mudflats in the low-intertidal zone, in which Gracilaria is becoming increasingly common (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infaunal polychaete Diopatra cuprea is relatively common in some locations and can facilitate Gracilaria by incorporating fronds into its tube caps (31, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the study site, Gracilaria forms extensive meadows and is typically the only macrophyte on the intertidal flats (Fig 1 AC); the ephemeral green seaweed Ulva spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is sometimes found in low abundance in spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the potential extent of Gracilaria impacts, we quantified Gracilaria cover along 14 intertidal line transects in Zekes Island NERR (33.95 N, 77.94 W) and eight transects in Masonboro Island NERR (34.14 N, 77.85 W) during 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cover was quantified during low tide in 1015 0.25-m2 quadrats positioned haphazardly (1 m apart) along each transect running from high to low intertidal (0 m MLLW) perpendicular to the water line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replicate transects were separated by at least 5 m. Gracilaria cover was scored within each quadrat using a modified BraunBlanquet method, in which the quadrat was divided into a 5 × 5 grid and each square was scored as 0 for less_than50% cover or 1 for 50% cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In instances where the cumulative score was 0 despite the presence of a small frond of algae in the quadrat, it was scored as 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative scores of each quadrat were divided by the total possible score (i.e., 25) and multiplied by 100 to obtain Gracilaria cover in percent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean cover across all transects and sites was 13.8% (SD = 23.3%, n = 304), suggesting high variability of Gracilaria, consistent with previous reports (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We manipulated Gracilaria cover across six density treatments (n = 8 per treatment) in a large-scale field experiment using 25-m2 plots (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected three low-intertidal flats spanning 1 km in the reserve that differed in terms of area, flow regimes, Gracilaria cover, grain size, and proximity to the Spartina salt marsh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three flats represented the continuum of estuarine habitats where Gracilaria naturally occurs in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established the 48 plots along the mean low water line at 5-m intervals by adding 3-m steel rebar 1.2 m into the substrate at each plot corner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments were randomly assigned to the plots to avoid potentially confounding small-scale effects of site (and all plots had only a few Diopatra tubes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gracilaria was fixed in a plot with metal U-pegs (constructed from clothes hangers; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  66) by physically staking handful-sized clumps of loose thalli to the sediment surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pegs were flushed with the sediment surface to avoid above-surface experimental artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our six treatments were based on the total number of pegs per 25 m2 (arranged in squared grids) as follows: 0 (0 × 0), 9 (3 × 3), 36 (6 × 6), 100 (10 × 10), 225 (15 × 15), and 400 (20 × 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that Gracilaria density thereby covaried with peg density; however, all pegs were flushed with or slightly below the sediment surface and thus did not affect any ecosystem functions above the sediment surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, all peg densities were relatively low, corresponding to a maximum of 16 pegs per m2 (a maximum of 4 pegs per epifauna quadrat and no pegs in any infaunal cores).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific tests of peg artifacts comparing 1-m2 plots with 0 vs. 16 pegs (without any Gracilaria) demonstrated that even at the highest densities used in our experiment, pegs had no effect on the abundance and taxonomic richness of epifauna or infauna, decomposition, dissolution, bird or ray feeding activities, or average multifunctionality (one-way ANOVA, P  0.38 for all responses; Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gracilaria was collected from nearby locations and added to plots in the U-peg grids in August 2013 (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments were maintained and response variables were quantified approximately monthly from September 2013 to June 2014 (treatments were maintained and measured at total of 10 times).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each plot visit, we quantified the cover of Gracilaria (in 10 randomly placed 0.25-m2 quadrats per plot) and seven ecosystem functions (see the next section for details) before maintaining Gracilaria densities by replenishing U-pegs devoid of Gracilaria and manually removing Gracilaria from control plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effect of Gracilaria on epifauna, we positioned a 0.25-m2 quadrat in the center of each plot and collected all Gracilaria and associated epifauna into a zip-top bag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, here epifauna refers to organisms associated with both Gracilaria and the sediment surface (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the laboratory, Gracilaria was rinsed in freshwater and shaken for 1 min to remove epifauna, which were captured in a 500-m sieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wet biomass of Gracilaria was quantified after centrifugation to remove excess water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epifauna were identified and enumerated to broad taxonomic groupings (typically family level) under a stereomicroscope (18×; Nikon SMZ800).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, all faunal data were standardized to unit area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxonomic richness was rescaled to unit area using the speciesarea relationship and assuming a conservative z value of 0.15 (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify whether Gracilaria attenuates hydrodynamic forces, we used gypsum dissolution blocks (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gypsum dissolves at a rate proportional to water velocity and thus represents an integrated proxy for tidal currents and wave exposure (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created gypsum blocks as hemispheres ( = 6.5 cm) from dental plaster (Die Keen; Heraeus Kalzer), covered on the bottom with two layers of polyurethane to ensure that an equal surface area would be subject to dissolution (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gypsum blocks were dried at 60 °C for a minimum of 24 h, after which the initial mass was recorded and one block was deployed flush with the substrate surface in the center of each plot for 4 d. Following retrieval, the gypsum blocks were dried and reweighed, and the dissolution rate was calculated as grams of gypsum dissolved per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because lower dissolution rates indicate greater flow reduction, dissolution rate was calculated using the equation fi + max(fi), so that greater flow reduction corresponds with a positive contribution to ecosystem functioning (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effect of Gracilaria on sediment stabilization, we marked all corner poles at 20 cm above the substrate surface in August 2013, then measured the distance between the marking and the substrate surface with a ruler to the nearest 0.5 cm at the end of each month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the monthly (30 d) change in height in cm by subtracting the final distance from the initial distance to the substrate (using the average of the four corners per plot) and correcting for the time interval between measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accretion and erosion are represented as positive and negative values, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effectiveness of Gracilaria as a nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important species, we sampled the entire plot using a 1.2-m-high × 6.7-m-wide nylon seine net (The Fish Net Company; mesh size 3.175 mm) during a falling tide (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On completion of a pass, we swiftly pulled the net taught, tilted it into a horizontal position, and lifted it from the water into an adjacent boat (R\V Adelaide) in a single motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organisms (1 cm) retained on the boat were identified to the family level and enumerated before being returned to the water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abundances were reported per unit area (dividing by 25 m2), and richness data were rescaled to unit area using the speciesarea relationship and assuming a conservative z value of 0.15 (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We quantified the effect of Gracilaria on decomposition processes as described previously (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standing dead Spartina stems were collected from adjacent salt marshes, washed, and dried at 60 °C for a minimum of 72 h (until no further weight loss occurred).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We pooled multiple stems to achieve an initial mass of 7.0 ± 0.5 g and placed them inside a mesh litter bag, which was closed and deployed on the sediment surface in the center of each plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bags were retrieved just before the next treatment maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remaining stem material was washed, dried, and weighed, and the decomposition rate was recorded as the mass lost in grams per month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated the average response of each function in each plot using the full 10-mo dataset (48 plots sampled each month; Dataset S1), such that each plot is represented by a single value in each plot of Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the abundance and taxonomic richness (of epifauna and nursery species) as separate functions because abundance more directly affects services like carbon sequestration and the maintenance of fisheries, whereas richness reflects taxonomic complementarity (i.e., different taxa support different functions; e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  71) and redundancy (i.e., different taxa support similar functions), which can affect the resilience of ecosystem processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether Gracilaria cover enhances the simultaneous performance of all seven measured functions, we used the multifunc package (version 0.7.0; https://github.com/jebyrnes/multifunc) and the averaging and single threshold approaches outlined previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaging approach determines the average level of a suite of functions by standardizing each function to a common scale and taking their mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reflecting dissolution (presented in its raw form in Fig 2C) to represent a positive contribution to functioning, we calculated an average multifunctionality index (in %) for each plot (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assume that high values of each of our functions correspond to high ecosystem functioning (i.e., higher values of sediment stabilization denote a higher level of performance for this function).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average multifunctionality index can be interpreted as the average level of all seven functions; however, this index cannot be used to interpret whether all functions are being performed simultaneously at a high level, given that functions performed at low levels can be averaged out by those performed at high levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we also tallied the number of functions, at their standardized function value, in each plot that surpassed each of nine threshold levels (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of maximum functioning).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Threshold index scores, which range from none to all seven functions, can be interpreted simply as the number of functions performed above a given threshold level in a plot (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because recent experiments and ecological theory suggest that relationships between the structure and function of coastal habitats are characterized by thresholds and nonlinear limiting functions (3941), we analyzed the relationship between Gracilaria cover and each response variable individually by comparing five models (41, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using nonlinear least squares (73), we fit null, linear, log, hyperbolic, and power relationships for each response using the average Gracilaria cover (in %) of each plot as the explanatory variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model selection was based on AICc (74, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each response variable, we compared the null model (i.e., just the intercept, a straight horizontal line representing the mean response) with the model of best fit using one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the significance of the Gracilaria cover treatment as the probability (P) of obtaining the model, given that the null hypothesis is true.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model fits, AICc values, AICc weights, and parameter estimates for each ecosystem function and multifunction response variable are reported in Dataset S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were conducted in R version 3.3.1 (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the end of the experiment, we measured four additional functions (months 810).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we did not have seasonal data for these responses, we excluded them from the main analysis of multifunction effects; however, here we analyze them using the same statistical analysis described in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To sample benthic infauna, triplicate core samples (5-cm diameter, 15-cm depth, 294.5-cm3 volume) were obtained equidistant along a diagonal transect of each plot on June 25, 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three sediment core samples from each plot were pooled into a zip-top bag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On return to the laboratory, the contents of each bag were drained and rinsed over a 1-mm mesh sieve to remove fine sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infauna retained on the sieve were preserved in 75% ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1-mm mesh size was chosen to concentrate sampling efforts on juvenile and early life stages of crustaceans, mollusks, and larger polychaete taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infauna were identified and enumerated under a stereomicroscope (18×; Nikon SMZ800) to families and, in some cases, phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infaunal data were standardized and rescaled to unit volume (using the reciprocal of 0.8836 L and a conservative z value of 0.15) following the same methods described previously for epifauna and nursery functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the effect of Gracilaria on ray foraging activity, we counted the number of ray holes in each plot on three or four different days in a given month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the average number of ray holes standardized to unit area (by dividing by 25 m2) during a given low tide on a single day (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the association of waterfowl with Gracilaria, we delimited the 48 plots into four sites based on spatial proximity (plots 112, 1324, 2536, and 3748) and surveyed all waterfowl activity occurring within a site (containing 12 plots) over a 15-min period during low tide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bird counts were made through binoculars from our research vessel from a distance of 100 m, to avoid disturbances arising from our presence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tallied the number of birds initially present and that became present within the boundaries of each plot during the observation period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After completing the 15-min observation of a site, we moved to a new vantage point to observe the next 12 plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By repeating this procedure at all sites, we sampled all 48 plots with equivalent effort in a 1-h period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because measurements were made on one to three different days in a given month, we present the average number of birds tallied per unit area (by dividing by 25 m2) per unit time (by multiplying by 4; 15 min × 4 = 60 min = 1 h) of low tide (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We did not observe any significant relationships between Gracilaria cover and infauna abundance (Fig S2A), the number of infauna taxa (Fig S2B), or waterfowl activities (although there was a tendency for waterfowl to be more abundant in plots with intermediate to high Gracilaria cover; Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found an inverse linear relationship between Gracilaria cover and ray foraging activity (Fig S2C), suggesting that Gracilaria may decrease predation on common infauna species (50), including bivalves, such as economically important quahog clams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, because increased survival of these commercially important bivalves is considered desirable, the ray foraging data were considered (similar to dissolution in Fig 2C) before calculating multifunctionality to represent a positive contribution to functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous to our main analysis, our supporting analysis revealed a strong positive, logarithmic relationship between Gracilaria cover and ecosystem multifunctionality, measured as the mean standardized index of all 11 functions in percent (Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the relationship between Gracilaria cover and the number of functions maintained above a given threshold was significantly positive and logarithmic across all thresholds from 10% to 90% (Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, these results corroborate our main analysis and suggest that Gracilaria did not have a substantial negative impact on any of the components of the intertidal community that we measured at the end of the experiment (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
