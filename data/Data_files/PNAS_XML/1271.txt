Harnessing bistability for directional propulsion of soft, untethered robots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major challenge in soft robotics is the integration of sensing, actuation, control, and propulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose a material-based approach for designing soft robots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show an untethered, soft swimming robot, which can complete preprogrammed tasks without the need for electronics, controllers, or power sources on board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve propulsion, we use bistable shape memory polymer muscles connected to paddles that amplify actuation forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of principle, we show that these robots can be preprogrammed to follow specific routes or deliver a cargo and navigate back to their deployment point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed design principle can have a broad impact in soft robotics based on programed materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In most macroscale robotic systems, propulsion and controls are enabled through a physical tether or complex onboard electronics and batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tether simplifies the design process but limits the range of motion of the robot, while onboard controls and power supplies are heavy and complicate the design process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a simple design principle for an untethered, soft swimming robot with preprogrammed, directional propulsion without a battery or onboard electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locomotion is achieved by using actuators that harness the large displacements of bistable elements triggered by surrounding temperature changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powered by shape memory polymer (SMP) muscles, the bistable elements in turn actuate the robots fins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our robots are fabricated using a commercially available 3D printer in a single print.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of concept, we show the ability to program a vessel, which can autonomously deliver a cargo and navigate back to the deployment point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Robot_Design_Principle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To show the underlying principle of our design concept, we first study a robot propelled by a single actuator (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actuator consists of two strips of SMP material acting like a muscle connected to a bistable element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce design complexity and ease prototyping, the robot is decomposed into five parts [outer shell, floaters, fins, bistable element, and shape memory muscle (Fig 1A)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shell supports the bistable element to ensure linear actuation and provide stability for the robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The floaters ensure that, in the vertical direction, the SMP strips are fully submerged in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The groove in the floaters provides the pivot point for the fins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fins are attached to the bistable element with elastomeric joints, ensuring flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The propulsion mechanism follows the forward motion of many organisms with fins submerged in water (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fins, which perform a paddling motion, are driven primarily by destabilizing buckling trusses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SMP muscle used to trigger the bistable element is a pair of 3D-printed curved beams that exhibit shape memory behavior (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation of shape memory materials is their slow activation speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this, we attach the muscle to a bistable element (Fig 1B) with the fins mounted on it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to amplifying the output force (31), the bistability transforms the slow, small motion of the SMP beams into a rapid, amplified one, propelling the robot forward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is often recognized that, in a physical implementation of a bistable element using compliant joints, the two equilibrium states are not equally energetic (i.e., |FBi,min|less_than|FBi,max|).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the rotational stiffness of the flexible joints, the fabricated state is more stable than the activated state (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this is a disadvantage when constructing multistable systems, it can be exploited when directional transformation is desirable (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before deploying the robot, we heat the printed SMP muscle past its glass transition temperature (Tg) and mechanically deform it to the programed shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After deploying the robot in water (state I) with temperature equal to or larger than Tg, the muscle relaxes, transforming back into its original/printed shape (state II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this is a constrained relaxation, the muscle must overcome the activation force of the bistable element at all points between states I and II [i.e., FSMP(x)FBi(x)x=1,,0].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After actuation, the system transitions into state III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in straining the material during printing may eliminate this programing step (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow the presented robots to function immediately after fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vertical equilibrium of the robot is achieved by balancing buoyancy and weight forces; in-plane acceleration occurs when propulsion overcomes drag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forward motion of the robot occurs in the transition between states I and III, consisting of pre- and postsnapping (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the onset of the instability (Fig 1D), the shape memory muscle moves the bistable element and drives the fins backward until they are perpendicular to the direction of motion (state II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a relatively slow motion with low energy output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after, the bistable element snaps to its second equilibrium position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drives the fins rapidly and increases the velocity of the robot (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bistable_ElementMuscle_Pair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To trigger the instability, the actuation force must overcome the energy barrier of the bistable element (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the range of operational actuation forces, we use the finite element method to simulate the constrained recovery of the actuation pair (i.e., the bistable element and the SMP muscle) (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We vary the thickness of the SMP beams between 0.6 and 1.6 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full recovery (i.e., snapping of the bistable element) does not occur for beams with thicknesses lower than 1.2 mm (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thinner beams induce localized stresses in the bistable element, although not enough to cause it to snap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery forces of the muscle range from 0.2 to 2.1 N in simulation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we experimentally observe slightly larger forces at higher thickness values due to the fusion of the two SMP beam strips at both ends of the muscle during polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the activation time needed, we simulate the actuation process using an invariant boundary temperature, while calculating the time for the muscles to reach thermal equilibrium through conductive heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the activation time experimentally, six SMP muscles were first programed and then submerged in hot water simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time of activation is extracted from the recorded video (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At equal length, the force supplied by the muscles as well as the actuation time increase with thickness (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is worth noting, however, that the distance traveled by the robot depends mainly on the bistable element rather than the muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is shown by fabricating and testing the same robot with different muscle thicknesses (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the force output of the muscle, the robot travels the same distance (115% of its length).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such demonstration shows the significance of the bistability and long stroke length for the propulsion of soft robots, regardless of the initial actuation force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since inducing a stroke depends on overcoming the bistable energy barrier rather than the actuator force, the bistable element can be designed with a very small energy barrier (28) and high asymmetry (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also promising for the miniaturization of the actuators and the increase of the number of actuators in a given robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequential_and_Directional_Propulsion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of bistability for propulsion can be expanded from a single-stroke to a multistroke robot (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple bistable elementmuscle pairs can be compacted into the same robot in either a connected or separate fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If N pairs are completely disconnected, they can induce N independent strokes that are either simultaneous (using identical pairs) or sequenced (using different ones).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the pairs are connected in series (e.g., the muscle of pair 2 is attached to the bistable element of pair 1), they can create synchronized strokes based on the propagation of a soliton-like actuation (35) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This guarantees that a stroke n will always be executed before the n+1 stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postactivation of actuation pair 1, muscle 2 is moved into position to activate the bistable element of pair 2 (Fig 3B, II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the combined force of the already activated bistable element and the muscle from pair 1 is greater than the actuation force of muscle 2 (i.e., FAct,1+FBi,maxFAct,2FBi,min), muscle 2 displaces more in the forward direction and activates the second bistable element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This creates a forward chain action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the increased net forward motion, due to the added actuation pairs, propulsion in various directions can be achieved by adjusting the placement of the fins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having two fins (one on each side) induces a symmetric moment that moves the robot forward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When one of the fins is removed, an asymmetric moment arises, giving the robot a push toward the direction of the missing fin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By strategically placing the fins, navigation can be preprogrammed in advance, setting the robot on a predefined path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequential nature of actuation allows for predictable directional change at each stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To show the sequential forward motion of the robot, four fins are placed symmetrically on the sides of two actuation pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force needed to trigger the bistable element is identical to that of the single-stroke robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the rear muscle is 1.2 mm, while the front one is 1.6 mm, which gives a sufficient time gap between the two activations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After deployed, two consecutive forward motions are executed, increasing the overall distance traveled to 190% of a single-stroke robot length (Fig 3C and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we remove the front left fin and deploy the robot again (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rear (symmetric) actuation induces a forward motion followed by a left turn with 23.85° (Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, we deploy the robot with only two fins placed asymmetrically in the front left and rear right positions (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robot takes a left turn of 21.64° followed by a right one of 21.45° (Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By designing different sizes of fins, one can control the turn angle of the robot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cargo_Deployment_and_Reverse_Navigation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many scenarios, such as cargo deployment or retrieval, a robot is required to navigate back to the starting point of its journey after the required operation is completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequential and directional motions of the robot presented so far are based on identical muscles (i.e., same material) with varying thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This thickness variation translates into different activation times at the same temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To design our robot to reverse its navigation path, we incorporate an extra muscle on the other side of the bistable element (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second set of muscles (i.e., for reverse navigation), we add an extra dimension to the design (that is, the activation temperatures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that, by varying the constituting inkjet materials, one can achieve different glass transition temperatures (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this property, we fabricate two identical muscles with two different materials and therefore, activation temperatures TL and TH (Movie S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second muscle induces enough force to overcome both the bistable potential and the first muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such force can trigger the instability, producing a force in the opposite direction to the initial actuation and causing the robot to reverse its navigation direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To show cargo delivery and robot return, we add a shape memory gripper at the front of the robot to hold a 3D-printed penny (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the robot is deployed in water with temperature TL, the first muscle activates and triggers the bistable element, thus propelling the swimmer forward to the delivery point (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the water temperature reaches the glass transition temperature of the gripper, it relaxes to its original shape and releases the penny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature reaches TH, the second muscle triggers the bistable element in the reverse direction, causing the robot to move backward to its original deployment point (Movie S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principle of reverse propulsion can be easily extended to more complex trajectories and multiple cargoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future improvements of this technology could include the use of prestrained materials (34), reversible SMPs (37), or liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) (38, 39) in the muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCEs activated by light (38) or temperature variations (39), for example, could achieve cyclic actuation in response to diurnal/nocturnal cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Outlook  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work presents a 3D-printable swimming robot that requires neither complex onboard components nor a tether to achieve directional propulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, programed SMP muscles are used as the power supply, a bistable element is used as the engine, and a set of fins is used as the propellers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reacting to varying external temperatures, the robot can move forward, turn, reverse, and/or deliver a cargo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At constant temperature, the robot response time can be controlled by varying the geometry and material properties of both the bistable elements and the shape memory strips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows a first step in the realization of soft locomotive robots that are potentially applicable in a variety of applications, such as navigation and delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All components are fabricated with a multimaterial Stratasys Connex printer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SMP muscles are fabricated with VeroWhitePlus plastic (Tg60), with the exception of M1 in Fig 4, which is fabricated with FLX9895 (Tg35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compliant components within the bistable element are fabricated with Agilus30 with Tgless_than5 and therefore, remain in the rubbery state throughout the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All remaining components are fabricated with a high temperature-resistant material, RGD525 (Tg80), which retains its stiffness throughout the activation process (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stiffness values of the materials used in the actuator are 1 GPa (VeroWhitePlus) and 1 MPa (Agilus30), which fall within the range of soft materials (104109 Pa) as defined in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensions for the water container used to show the single and sequential motion are 967 mm (length) × 555 mm (width) × 393 mm (height).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water is heated by an Atwood heating element, which keeps the water temperature consistently above the glass transition temperature of the used materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finite element simulations are implemented using Abaqus 14.1 (geometrical nonlinear solver with thermalviscoelastic material model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
