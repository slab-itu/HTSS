Surveying the sequence diversity of model prebiotic peptides by mass spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peptides and proteins are essential for life as we know it, and likely played a critical role in the origins of life as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding plausible routes from amino acids to peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the diversity of sequences that could have been produced by abiotic condensation reactions on the prebiotic earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, multidimensional separations were coupled with mass spectrometry to detect and sequence mixtures of model proto-peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was observed that, starting with a few monomers, proto-peptide diversity increased rapidly following cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental proto-peptide sequences were compared with theoretically random sequences, revealing a high sequence diversity of plausible monomer combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rise of peptides with secondary structures and functions would have been a key step in the chemical evolution which led to life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with modern biology, amino acid sequence would have been a primary determinant of peptide structure and activity in an origins-of-life scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a commonly held hypothesis that unique functional sequences would have emerged from a diverse soup of proto-peptides, yet there is a lack of experimental data in support of this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the majority of studies in the field focus on peptides containing only one or two types of amino acids, here we used modern mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques to separate and sequence de novo proto-peptides containing broader combinations of prebiotically plausible monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a drywet environmental cycling protocol, hundreds of proto-peptide sequences were formed over a mere 4 d of reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence homology diagrams were constructed to compare experimental and theoretical sequence spaces of tetrameric proto-peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS-based analyses such as this will be increasingly necessary as origins-of-life researchers move toward systems-level investigations of prebiotic chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental overview and example dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Hydroxy and amino acid monomers used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroxy acids are abbreviated with lowercase letters corresponding to their analogous amino acids (e.g., glycolic acid=g; glycine = G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All chiral species were in their l form only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Depsipeptides formed by esteramide exchange contained a mixture of ester and amide backbone linkages and were initiated by a hydroxy acid at the N terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depsipeptides were formed from hydroxy acid and amino acid mixtures by alternating polymerizing (85 째C dry-down, 18 h, open vial) and hydrolyzing (65 째C aqueous, 6 h, closed vial) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each cycle consisted of one polymerization and one hydrolysis step over a period of 24 h. (C) General workflow of depsipeptide separation and sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depsipeptides were separated by UPLC and traveling-wave IM (TWIM) before data-dependent MS/MS acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate MS/MS data, an algorithm was developed which created all possible sequences (based on monomer inputs and polymer length).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical MS/MS spectra were generated and were matched to experimental data using commercial MS software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Example UPLC chromatogram of a mixture of a-, G-, A-, and l-containing depsipeptides formed after four dry-wet cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) The extracted TWIM signal of m/z 231.11, which eluted at 9.4 min, is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Negative-mode MS/MS spectrum of m/z 231.11 from D.

Proto-Peptidomics_Workflow_for_the_Analysis_of_Depsipeptide_Mixtures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary justification for using a proteomics-inspired methodology in this work stems from the chemical similarities between peptides and depsipeptides, as demonstrated by several studies (3336).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In designating monomers and/or residues, a similar nomenclature system to that of Deechongkit et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34) was used, where an amino acid residue is capitalized (e.g., glycine = G) and its corresponding hydroxy acid residue is lowercase (e.g., glycolic acid=g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A general overview of the experimental workflow is provided in Fig 1; detailed methods and raw data are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three prebiotic amino acids, glycine (G), l-alanine (A), and l-leucine (L), were mixed with one hydroxy acid: glycolic acid (g), l-lactic acid (a), or l-malic acid (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mixture contained one hydroxy acid and three amino acids (g+G+A+L, a+G+A+L, and d+G+A+L) and was subjected to one, two, or four 85 째C-dry/65 째C-wet cycles chosen to model a daily evaporating pool environment on the early Earth (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting nine depsipeptide libraries were examined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography ion mobilitytandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-IM-MS/MS) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to traditional proteomics experiments, experimental and theoretical sequences were matched following a ranking score (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence matching was achieved by the development of a script that generated accurate masses and fragment ion databases for all possible compositions and oligomer lengths within the experimental mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Databases were then uploaded into a software package for comparison with experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sequence identifications were manually validated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Example UPLC-IM and MS/MS data are shown in Fig 1 D and E, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the datasets were highly complex, even after one drywet cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When depsipeptides eluted from the UPLC column and the precursor ions were selected for MS/MS activation, their fragmentation patterns were generally consistent with those for biological peptides (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, standard peptide fragmentation nomenclature (39) was used (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mapping_Depsipeptide_Chemical_Space  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across all cycles, a total of 467 unique features, or unique m/z, UPLC retention time (Rt), and IM drift time (dt) combinations were observed in the glycolic acid (g+G+A+L) dataset, 624 features were observed in the lactic acid (a+G+A+L) dataset, and 426 features were observed in the malic acid (d+G+A+L) dataset (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total number of depsipeptide compositions (e.g., 2a+1G+1A) confirmed by accurate mass was 176 for the g+G+A+L dataset, 239 for the a+G+A+L dataset, and 45 for the d+G+A+L dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional maps (m/z, Rt, dt) of confirmed depsipeptide compositions are shown in Fig 2 AC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All depsipeptides contained at least one hydroxy acid residue (at the N terminus) and at least one amino acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features that tentatively matched depsipeptide masses but were not mass-selected for MS/MS during DDA, or were not abundant enough to generate quality MS/MS spectra, were excluded from these plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the results presented in Fig 2 revealed highly complex mixtures, with hundreds of detected species even after a few environmental cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An interesting observation from the data in Fig 2 AC is that malic-acid-containing depsipeptides were much fewer in number than glycolic acid or lactic-acid-containing depsipeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the overall number of features observed in the d+G+A+L dataset was similar to the g+G+A+L and a+G+A+L datasets, the number of confirmed linear depsipeptide sequences was significantly lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially hypothesized that malic-acid-based depsipeptides would be numerous, as malic acid (d) is similar to aspartic acid (D) used to form Foxs proteinoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carboxylic acid moiety of the malic acid side chain could be capable of polymer branching (Fig 1A), and its polarity was expected to improve oligomer solubility characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it was somewhat surprising to observe that malic acid generated the fewest detectable depsipeptides of the three hydroxy acids investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cyclic depsipeptides lose an additional water molecule when formed, and thus have a mass 18.0106 Da lower than their corresponding linear depsipeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our initial data analysis, water-loss species were not included in the m/z databases, as they can also occur through unavoidable in-source collision-induced dissociation processes of linear species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manual reinvestigation of the d+G+A+L dataset, however, indicated that malic acid and leucine cyclic species (cyclo-dL)isobaric with water-loss fragments, but with unique Rt and dt valueswere indeed present in moderate abundance (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize steric hindrance from bulky leucine side chains in cyclic dL products restricted water access to ester bonds and, in turn, led to reduced hydrolysis rates of those species back to the linear form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could result in a reduced amount of reactive groups available to form new depsipeptides in the d+G+A+L system, potentially similar to diketopiperazine formation in amino-acid-only experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the diversity of depsipeptide mixtures is dependent upon not only the formation of new oligomers but also the hydrolysis of previously formed oligomers during the wet phase, less-reversible cyclization of malic-acid-containing depsipeptides may have hindered further sequence diversification and chain elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the chemical structure(s) of cyclo-dL and related products will be the subject of future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depsipeptide chemical space maps enabled comparisons of relative abundance, composition, and hydrophobicity of the three types of linear depsipeptide systems examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative abundances were found to vary across several orders of magnitude (Fig 2 AC; log relative abundance corresponds to sphere size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all three systems, species with primarily ester linkages, mixtures of ester and amide linkages, and exclusively amide linkages were observed (Fig 2 AC; amide bond content corresponds to sphere color).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that exclusively amide-linked oligomers are technically not depsipeptides; for clarity purposes, however, these have been included under the depsipeptide umbrella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depsipeptide hydrophobicity, evaluated via UPLC Rt, varied as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leucine-containing species typically eluted later in the chromatographic separations due to the more favorable association of its nonpolar side chain with the C18 stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IM measurements revealed an interesting linear correlation between neutral depsipeptide arrival times and oligomer length (SI Appendix, Fig S6), indicating that the oligomers detected were likely unstructured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviation from such ion mobility trends could be useful in future searches of proto-peptide chemical space to find species with significantly different structures from the population mean, with such characteristics potentially indicating the emergence of secondary structure (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-dimensional chemical space maps (Rt and dt) were also generated for one, two, and four environmental cycles to gain insight into depsipeptide evolution (Fig 2 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was observed that, with increased number of cycles, a number of new glycolic-acid-containing depsipeptides were formed (yellow areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For lactic-acid-containing species, new depsipeptides were formed as well, although within similar regions of Rt and dt space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned earlier, the length of malic-acid-containing species did not evolve appreciably, which is attributed to the formation of cyclic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, linear depsipeptides typically ranged from 2 to 8 residues in length, which is comparable to previous observations (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomers up to 14 residues in length have been previously observed (12), but such length typically requires a larger number of environmental cycles and/or a replenishing of monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Depsipeptide_Sequence_Isomers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of theoretically possible sequences increases greatly with oligomer length (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we chose a multidimensional separation method with a high peak capacity, on the order of 105106 (4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method led to the detection of hundreds of sequences of glycolic-and lactic-acid-containing depsipeptides (Table 1), even separating sequence isomers on certain occasions (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By nature, sequence isomers have identical precursor ion m/z values which are indistinguishable by the quadrupole mass filter used to isolate species before fragmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite our methods peak capacity, a significant number of sequence isomers still overlapped in both UPLC and IM dimensions, resulting in coelution and MS/MS coselection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of these coselection cases, between two and five individual sequence isomers were found by manual interpretation of MS/MS fragmentation data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For longer depsipeptides (58 residues in length), up to 12 potential sequence isomers were found in selected cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed examples of longer depsipeptides fragmenting at internal ester linkages in the ion source region of the mass spectrometer, even under relatively soft electrospray ionization conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is why a number of short sequences were detected multiple times in the same dataset (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative abundances of certain species were found to change in a systematic fashion during the cycling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most commonly observed trend was the accumulation of new sequences with cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences composed of  greater than 50% amino acid typically increased in relative abundance over time (selected examples in Fig 3A), suggesting the rate of formation by ester condensation and subsequent esteramide exchange outweighed the rates of hydrolysis and elongation into different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposite trend was observed for ester-rich sequences of short-to-moderate length, as well as very short sequences (selected examples in Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also observed species whose relative abundances were rather consistent over cycling (selected examples in Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize such sequences, over this short time period, formed and hydrolyzed at relatively similar rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such species may also be hydrolysis products of longer, ester-rich sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparing_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Depsipeptide_Sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homology diagrams (45) were generated for all theoretically possible combinations and experimental sequences of tetrameric species to examine sequence space as a function of the number of environmental cycles (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these diagrams, the height of a letter corresponds to residue conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taller letters indicate low sequence diversity (that is, low entropy) at a given position, whereas shorter letters indicate high sequence diversity (high entropy) at a position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a visual comparison tool, the theoretical homology diagram shown in Fig 4A is what would be obtained if all possible tetramers were produced in equal yields and differences in monomer reactivity were ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this diagram, the likelihood of forming any backbone linkage, either ester or amide, would be equivalent, and positions 24 would be random in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homology diagram shown in Fig 4B is what would result if all ester linkages had been hydrolyzed and only amide linkages remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, all depsipeptides would still be initiated by a hydroxy acid, but would contain only amino acids of a random nature at positions 24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although theoretical diagrams in Fig 4 A and B assume equal reaction rates between various amino acids for purposes of simplicity, recent kinetic studies by our team do suggest experimental differences in monomer reactivity (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental sequence data for g+G+A+L, a+G+A+L, and d+G+A+L tetramers across one, two, and four environmental cycles were compiled into homology diagrams (Fig 4C), and revealed the N-terminal residue to be a hydroxy acid for essentially all species, as expected from the proposed esteramide exchange mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent positions along the chain contained both amino acid and hydroxy acid residues, with varying degrees of randomness depending on cycle and hydroxy acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After one drywet cycle, glycolic-acid- and lactic-acid-containing tetramers contained little leucine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with additional cycling their sequence diversity increased, leading to approximately even mixtures of hydroxy acid, glycine, alanine, and leucine at positions 24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the reaction rate between leucine and glycolic or lactic acid may have been slower than that with glycine and alanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internal sequence stretches for g+G+A+L and a+G+A+L tetramers demonstrated high sequence diversity after only 4 d of reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of more diverse tetramers as the system evolved is consistent with the hypothesis that a vast array of sequences may have been present on the prebiotic earth before the initiation of template-directed peptide synthesis (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considering a prebiotic timescale, it seems reasonable to conclude that proto-peptides of short to moderate length would have had sufficient time to diversify into an innumerable set of sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast with g+G+A+L and a+G+A+L tetramers, the sequence diversity of d+G+A+L tetramers did not change significantly with cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Malic-acid depsipeptides contained more leucine than glycine or alanine after one cycle, and very few malic-acid depsipeptides were found to contain solely glycine and/or alanine without leucine (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Position 2 of these depsipeptides appears similar to Fig 4B in which few, if any, hydroxy acids would be present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is attributed to the presence of nonlinear species in d+G+A+L mixtures which limit hydrolysis and elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the presence of only amino acids at position 2 is consistent with the formation of cyclo-dL species containing one ester and one amide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical structure(s) of malic-acid-containing depsipeptides of a cyclic and/or branched nature will be the subject of future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_Origins-of-Life_Research  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, mixtures of depsipeptides were sequenced from three model prebiotic reaction mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hundreds of depsipeptides were formed from a total of six monomers over 4 d of drywet cycling, including a large number of sequence isomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tandem MS allowed for sequencing of species that coeluted in UPLC and IM separation space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence homology diagrams demonstrated a high sequence diversity of depsipeptides containing glycolic acid or lactic acid, two of the most abundant hydroxy acids in model prebiotic reactions and meteorites (13, 14, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of these sequences as well as their peptide character increased with the number of cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior studies on proto-peptide sequence diversity have taken either a purely computational approach (50) or a top-down approach in which libraries were made through existing biochemical means (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies are informative, but could still benefit from complementary bottom-up studies to investigate the plausibility of the libraries themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides direct experimental evidence in support of de novo proto-peptide libraries, and suggests the following concerning their composition: (i) overall sequence diversity would have been high; (ii) such diversity would have increased with time; and (iii) proto-peptide sequences capable of branching and/or cyclizing would have been less diverse than linear sequences due to competing reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all systems studied here, it is important to note the number of confirmed sequences was lower than the number of theoretically possible sequences (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this to specific challenges associated with studying vast proto-peptide libraries using a bottom-up, de novo approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ever-present challenge of using MS-based approaches is that peptides must be detected with sufficient signal intensity to be sequenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in peptide ionization efficiency play a role in overrepresenting species with higher yields, an electrospray bias phenomenon that is well documented in proteomics studies (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although negative-ion mode was exclusively used in this work, the use of dual-polarity MS in future experiments may be beneficial (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the specific methodology for selecting peptide precursor ions before MS/MS can influence the number and confidence of sequence identifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDA, which was used in this study, has a high specificity but is biased toward high-abundance peptides (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, hundreds of features in our mixturesmany of which are likely lower-abundance depsipeptideswere not selected for fragmentation and thus were not sequenced (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods which fragment all coeluting peptides without mass selection could increase the number of sequence identifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the confidence of individual sequence assignments could decreaseparticularly for proto-peptide mixtures like the ones examined here which contain a number of sequence isomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that using DIA methods, or methods which combine aspects of both DDA and DIA (56), could enhance sequencing capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An additional challenge is related to the chemistry used to make de novo proto-peptides: model prebiotic reactions which occur over short timescales may bias our understanding of plausible sequences toward species which are most kinetically favored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is obviously impossible to perform experiments on a prebiotic timescale, it is important to consider reaction time, or in this instance the number of evaporative cycles, as a key variable in generating proto-peptide libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that glycine and alanine residues incorporated into glycolic-acid- and lactic-acid-based depsipeptides earlier than leucine (Fig 4C, left two columns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in reactivity should be further studied in detail to gain a clearer picture of the proto-peptide inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, both the consumption of free monomer(s) and the evaporation of hydroxy acids upon heating have been shown to affect the observed product distributions (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better feed approaches to replenish monomers in esteramide exchange reaction cycles, and more diverse monomer sets, would thus be expected to produce even higher sequence diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been recently argued that origins-of-life studies concerning proto-peptides are often too narrowly focused on biologically coded amino acids, and should consider the vast diversity of nonproteinogenic monomers that would have also been present in the prebiotic milieu (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our use of hydroxy acids to form depsipeptides demonstrates the utility of this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS-based approaches may be used in the future exploration of the vast chemical space of plausible proto-peptides containing not only hydroxy acids and proteinogenic amino acids but also nonproteinogenic amino acids, or mixtures of the three.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long as a nonproteinogenic monomer has a unique m/z among the other monomers in the reaction, it should be readily identifiable within peptide sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptions would be structural isomers of nonproteinogenic amino acids (e.g., -alanine and norvaline) which are isobaric with their proteinogenic forms (-alanine and valine, respectively); however, it is possible IM could resolve these species (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As broader sequence space is explored, it is possible that catalytic peptidesand perhaps even autocatalytic speciesmay arise which directly increase proto-peptide length and function (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to using a broader set of monomer residues, other molecules and ligands such as proto-nucleic acids, proto-lipids, proto-glycans, and inorganic species could be introduced as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such molecules would have certainly influenced the solubility, formation, and hydrolysis of proto-peptides, and may have coevolved together with proto-peptides in primordial environments (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental observation of proto-peptide function such as catalysis or self-replication within a more realistic model of the prebiotic soup will provide a more robust picture of chemical evolution in an origins-of-life context, highlighting systems-level interactions within highly complex chemical networks (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
