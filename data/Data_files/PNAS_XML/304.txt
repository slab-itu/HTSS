The retrovirus HTLV-1 inserts an ectopic CTCF-binding site into the human genome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The retrovirus human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes inflammatory and malignant diseases in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maintain latency and avoid immune detection in vivo, HTLV-1 minimizes expression of genes on the plus-strand of the integrated provirus but allows constitutive expression of the minus-strand gene, which maintains clonal persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not understood how this gene expression is regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that CTCF, a master regulator of chromatin structure and gene expression, binds to HTLV-1, forms loops between the provirus and host genome, and alters expression of proviral and host genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a typical HTLV-1infected host carries 104 infected T-cell clones, each containing a provirus integrated in a different genomic site, CTCF binding gives HTLV-1 the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in the human genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes malignant and inflammatory diseases in 10% of infected people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical host has between 104 and 105 clones of HTLV-1infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that CTCF, a key regulator of chromatin structure and function, binds to the provirus at a sharp border in epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the HTLV-1 provirus in T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BSs) have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain primate lineages, but CTCF binding has not previously been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of an ectopic CTCF-BS introduced by the retrovirus in tens of thousands of genomic locations has the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in host cell chromatin structure and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Epigenetic_Border_in_the_HTLV-1_Provirus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to identify epigenetic marks over the HTLV-1 provirus (Fig 1A), including H3K36me3 and H3K9Ac, each associated with actively transcribed genes; H3K4me3, characteristic of enhancer and promoter regions; and H2A.Z, a histone variant frequently observed in promoter and enhancer regions (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed a sharp border in each of these epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the provirus in both a nonmalignant primary T-cell clone (Fig 1B) and an ATL cell line (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenetic border was more sharply defined in the ATL cell line, in which the spliced HBZ transcript (sHBZ) is transcribed but plus-strand transcription is significantly suppressed (Fig S1), than in nonmalignant T-cell clones, in which both tax, a plus-strand transcript, and sHBZ, a minus-strand transcript, are actively transcribed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same pattern was also observed in three other HTLV-1infected T-cell lines (Fig S2 AC) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) freshly isolated from patients with ATL (Fig S3 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a border was observed in DNA methylation, consistent with previous observations (6) (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are summarized schematically in Fig 1F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed pattern of epigenetic modifications was consistent with the observation that transcription of the proviral minus-strand exceeds transcription of the plus-strand both ex vivo (4) and frequently in HTLV-1infected clones in vitro (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the provirus of another human retrovirus, HIV-1, the mark H3K36me3 showed a progressive rise, with no border (Fig 1G); this result was expected, because H3K36me3 is characteristic of actively transcribed gene bodies, increasing toward the 3 end of the gene (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations, together with previous reports (5, 6), suggested the presence of a regulatory mechanism that establishes the distinctive pattern of respective epigenetic modifications in the 5 and 3 portions of the HTLV-1 provirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Host_Insulator-Binding_Protein_CTCF_Binds_to_the_HTLV-1_Provirus_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulator elements demarcate the boundary between transcriptionally active (euchromatic) and inactive (heterochromatic) regions of the genome (11) and prevent enhancers from activating inappropriate promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested the hypothesis that CTCF binds to HTLV-1 at the observed boundary in epigenetic modifications (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we searched for the consensus CTCF DNA-binding motif (9) (Fig S4 AC) in the HTLV-1 genome and identified several candidate binding sites (Fig 2A); the site in pX showed the highest similarity to the consensus sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF ChIP assays revealed CTCF binding in pX [viral CTCF-binding site (vCTCF-BS)], but not in the other proviral regions tested (Fig 2 B and C); similar results were obtained in fresh PBMCs from patients with either HAM/TSP (Fig 2D) or ATL (Fig 2E), demonstrating that CTCF binds to the pX region of HTLV-1 in natural infection in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CTCF did not bind to the provirus of HIV-1 (Fig 2F), consistent with the absence of a border in the epigenetic mark H3K36me3 within the HIV-1 provirus (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP-Sequencing_Analysis_Showed_a_Sharp_Peak_of_CTCF_Binding_in_the_Region_of_the_Epigenetic_Border  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define CTCF binding and the epigenetic border in the HTLV-1 provirus with greater precision, we performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of a cell line (ED) derived from a patient with ATL, which contains a single-copy HTLV-1 provirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the 5 LTR and 3 LTR are identical in sequence, sequence reads that lie within the LTR cannot be specifically mapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTR reads were therefore randomly mapped to either the 5 or 3 LTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed a single peak of CTCF binding in the pX region, consistent with the ChIP-quantitative PCR result (Fig 3 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of histone modifications and the histone variant H2A.Z also changed at the CTCF-binding region, extending a short distance beyond the binding site in each case, as observed by others (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CTCF_Binds_Directly_to_HTLV-1_pX_DNA_in_a_Sequence-Dependent_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CTCF exerts its pleiotropic functions by interacting with various cofactors (8, 13), suggesting that CTCF might bind indirectly to HTLV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we performed an EMSA using recombinant CTCF and three synthetic oligonucleotides, each corresponding to a candidate CTCF-BS in the HTLV-1 genome, and one from the well-characterized CTCF-binding DNA region H19/DMR, the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene (14, 15) (Fig S6A); each oligonucleotide contained a different variant of the consensus sequence for CTCF binding (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed specific binding of CTCF to vCTCF in the HTLV-1 pX region, but not to either the LTR or env (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competition assays confirmed these results (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of six nucleotide substitutions in the consensus CTCF-binding sequence in vCTCF abrogated the ability of the oligonucleotide to compete with the WT pX sequence in binding to CTCF, showing that CTCF binds directly to HTLV-1 DNA in the pX region in a sequence-dependent manner (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consensus sequence for the CTCF-BS in pX is conserved both in the HTLV-1 sequences in the GenBank (Fig S7A) and in all cases of ATL and asymptomatic carriers examined (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HTLV-1_pX_Has_Enhancer-Blocking_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CTCF bound to DNA between an enhancer and a promoter can block the activation of the promoter by the enhancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1-kb DNA fragment of pX containing the CTCF-BS showed strong enhancer-blocking (EB) activity, similar to the positive control, H19/DMR (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EB function was observed with pX inserted in either orientation between the enhancer and the promoter, and it was reduced, but not eliminated, when the pX fragment was inserted outside the promoter-enhancer region, suggesting that pX contains a bidirectional insulator function (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EB activity was detected using 1-kb, 300-bp, or 100-bp fragments (Table S2) of the pX sequence, with each containing the CTCF-binding region (Fig 4B); the progressively stronger EB effect observed with longer fragments suggests that additional host factors bind the provirus near the CTCF site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was no EB activity with the HTLV-1 env sequence, which does not bind CTCF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A degree of promoter suppression was observed even when the pX sequence was located beyond the promoter-enhancer (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, we used circular plasmids, in which the enhancer might affect the promoter either upstream or downstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore repeated the EB assay after linearizing the plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that 300-bp or 100-bp pX fragments exerted EB activity only when inserted between the promoter and the enhancer (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EB activity of the pX region was significantly reduced by mutation of the CTCF-BS (Fig S6B), indicating that CTCF plays an important role in the EB function (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CTCF_Influences_Proviral_Transcription_and_RNA_Splicing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the effect of CTCF on proviral transcription, we transfected an ATL cell line (MT-1) with shRNA to knock down CTCF expression (Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a slight suppressive effect of CTCF knockdown (KD) on the proviral transcriptome (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay with transcript-specific primers (Fig S8D) revealed significant repression of the HTLV-1 p30 gene (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further analyzed the effect of mutations in the viral CTCF-binding region by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system in another ATL cell line, ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the loss of CTCF binding by mutating six key nucleotides (Fig S6B; vCTCF-mut1) in the proviral core CTCF-BS (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, there was no significant change in expression of tax or HBZ (Fig 5B), but a slight change was evident in the border of H3K36me3 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HBZ expression plays a critical role in the proliferation of ATL cells (3), ED cells with low HBZ expression may be counterselected during in vitro growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the dependency of ED cell proliferation on HBZ, we cultured the cells in the presence of IL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 wk, the loss of the vCTCF-BS (vCTCF-BS) resulted in a significant decrease in sHBZ transcription (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tax gene was not reactivated; the provirus of ED cells appears to be epigenetically stabilized by DNA hypermethylation in the 5 LTR (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the results shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3 and S8, these data indicate that CTCF plays a role in the regulation of HTLV-1 proviral transcription and RNA splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HTLV-1_Alters_Local_Higher_Order_Chromatin_Structure_and_Gene_Expression_in_the_Host_Genome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that the HTLV-1 provirus forms CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions with the flanking host genome, we used the chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay to analyze chromatin from ED cells containing either WT HTLV-1 or the mutant HTLV-1 vCTCF-BS, in which CTCF binding was abrogated (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong CTCF ChIP-seq signal [cellular CTCF (cCTCF)] was observed in the host genome, 48 kb upstream of the proviral integration site (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative 3C analysis demonstrated that the cCTCF sites made long-range interactions with the WT provirus significantly more frequently than with the vCTCF-BS mutant (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CTCF sites are oriented toward the provirus, which is integrated in the genome in the negative orientation (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vCTCF-BS and host CTCF-BS are therefore oriented toward each other; convergent CTCF-BSs appear to be required for chromatin loop formation (1618).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the effect of the vCTCF-BS on local host gene expression: TCHP, GIT2, and C12orf76 (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription of two host genes near an upstream CTCF-BS was affected by vCTCF-BS mutation (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that the integrated HTLV-1 provirus can form CTCF-dependent chromatin loops with the flanking host genome and may cause CTCF-dependent changes in host gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that the chromatin insulator protein CTCF binds directly to the HTLV-1 provirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF-BSs have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain nonhuman primate lineages (19), and CTCF has been shown to regulate latency programs in the herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (20) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CTCF binding has not been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diverse functions ascribed to CTCF include enhancement or repression of transcription, promoting or blocking communication between enhancers and promoters, acting as a barrier to the propagation of epigenetic changes, and regulation of mRNA splicing (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that KD of CTCF changed the pattern of splicing of the p30 transcript, in which the CTCF-BS is present near the splicing junction (Fig S8 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actions of CTCF at a given location depend on the local context, involving selective interactions between CTCF and both transcriptional cofactors and the primary DNA sequence (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homodimerization of CTCF bound to two genomic sites can cause chromatin looping (8), forming structural chromatin loops (1 Mb in size), known as topologically associating domains (TADs), which are largely shared between cell types, and smaller functional loops (sub-TADs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sub-TADs, typically contained within TADs, appear to regulate transcription by bringing a distant enhancer near the respective promoter (8, 16, 18, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although CTCF plays a central role in establishing chromatin structure, epigenetic borders, and transcriptional activity, removal of CTCF does not invariably lead to changes in chromatin looping (26) and epigenetic marks flanking the border (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, gene expression can be changed in cis at some distance from the abrogated CTCF-BS (12, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenetic pattern and chromatin structure may be maintained in the absence of CTCF by cohesin or by other DNA-binding factors, such as transcription factors, other zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF143), or RNAs (8, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that CTCF binding to HTLV-1 plays a role in EB (Fig 4) and proviral gene expression (Fig 5); however, abolition of CTCF binding did not cancel the effect completely (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4D and 5C), suggesting that other cofactors also contribute to these mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Binding of CTCF to the HTLV-1 provirus may serve several functions that benefit the virus, among which we identify three possibilities that are not mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, by forming a barrier to epigenetic modifications, CTCF may cause or perpetuate differential transcription of the 5 and 3 parts of the provirus, resulting in persistent expression of HBZ, which is required for clonal persistence (2, 7), while promoting escape from the strong host immune response to the plus-strand gene products Tax, Pol, and Gag (4) by temporary silencing of the plus-strand genes (3, 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reported here and the previous observation of partial DNA methylation in the provirus (3, 5, 6) suggest that CTCF establishes an epigenetic border in the provirus, which may be stably maintained thereafter by DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, CTCF may block aberrant activation of the 5 and 3 viral promoters by the enhancer present in the 3 LTR and 5 LTR, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, CTCF might tether the provirus to the nucleolar periphery (28), allowing cell cycle-dependent proviral silencing, and thereby promoting immune escape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is consistent with our observation (29) of selective survival in vivo of HTLV-1 proviruses integrated in acrocentric chromosomes, which are associated with the nucleolar periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of the HTLV-1 provirus on higher order host chromatin structure and the consequent effects on gene expression are adventitious, because they depend on the proviral integration site: They are therefore unlikely to benefit the virus systematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of CTCF binding will differ between clones of HTLV-1infected cells, because the proviral integration site is unique to each clone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A chromatin loop that brings either the 5 LTR or the 3 LTR adjacent to a host gene may dysregulate cell growth and cause or contribute to malignant transformation of the cell (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HTLV-1infected individuals typically possess 104 infected T-cell clones, each containing one provirus in a unique genomic location (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HTLV-1 therefore has the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in chromatin structure and gene expression of the human genome by inserting ectopic CTCF-BSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These abnormalities may, in turn, contribute to the HTLV-1associated diseases ATL and HAM/TSP (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the review boards of the respective institutions (National Research Ethics Service, UK; Ethics Committee of Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details of the materials and methods used are provided in SI Materials and Methods, including cell culture, qRT-PCR, EMSA, ChIP assay, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation assay, EB assay, shRNA KD of CTCF, RNA-sequencing, CRISPR modification of the HTLV-1 genome, quantitative 3C, and identification of candidate CTCF-BSs in the HTLV-1 genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Six HTLV-1infected cell lines were used in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four [(ED, ATL-43Tb(), ATL-55T, and MT-1] are derived from patients with ATL, identified as clones by either a monoclonal integration site of the HTLV-1 provirus or a monoclonal recombination of the T-cell receptor gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBX-4B and 11.63 are CD4+ T-cell clones derived by limiting dilution of PBMCs from patients with nonmalignant HTLV-1 infection; each clone contains a single integrated HTLV-1 provirus (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T-cell lines and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI plus 10% (vol/vol) FCS and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant IL-2 was added in culture medium for TBX-4B and 11.63 (200 IU/mL; Peprotech) T-cell clones or CRISPR-modified ED cells (100 IU/mL; Peprotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were also analyzed from clinical cases, including one patient with HAM/TSP, 11 patients with ATL, and eight asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers; each subject provided written informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood of the patients using Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the review boards of the respective institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell line U1, chronically infected with HIV-1 (34), was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH (U1/HIV-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using ReverTra Ace reagent (TOYOBO), which contains a mixture of random and oligo dT primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression level of CTCF, TCHP, GIT2, C12orf76, tax, env, p30, p13, and HBZ was evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (StepOne Plus; ABI) relative to 18S rRNA as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the primers are detailed in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of expression was calculated by the Ct cycle threshold method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For absolute quantification, we generated TA-cloning vectors (pGEM-T Easy; Promega) containing sequences from Tax, HBZ, or 18S rRNA RT-PCR, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMSA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CTCF EMSA was performed as described previously (25) with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF was synthesized in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation reaction, with the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the probes were as follows: H19 DMR (5-TGGCACGGAATTGGTTGTAGTTGTGGAATCGGAAGTGGCCGCGCGGCGGCAGTGCAGGCTCACACATCACAGCCCGAG CCCGCCCCAACT-3), LTR (5-GAGAAACAGAAGTCTGAAAAGTCAGGGCCCAGACTAAGGCTCTGACGTCTCCCCCCGGAGGGACAGCTCAGCACCGGCTCGGGCTAGGCCCTGACGTGTC-3), Env (5-GCTAGTTCTGCCCAGTGGATCCCGTGGAGACTCCTCAAGCGAGCT GCATGCCCAAGACCCGTCGGAGGCCCCGCCGATCCCAAAGAAAAAGACCACCAA-3), and pX 5-CCGATCACGATGCGTTTCCCCGCGAGGTGGCGCTTTCTCCCCTGGAGGGCCCCGTCGCAGCCGGCCGCGGCTTTCCTCTTCTAAGGATAGCAAACCGT-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probes corresponding to the different HTLV-1 proviral sequences were prepared by amplifying the respective segments with the primers detailed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For supershift assays, 2 L of anti-CTCF Ab (612149; BD Biosciences) was included in the reaction mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For competition assays, an excess of nonlabeled probe containing specific mutations, as shown in Fig S6B, was added to the reaction mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear cell lysates were sonicated with a Bioruptor USD-200 (Diagenode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following Abs were used for the immunoprecipitation step: anti-CTCF (07-729; Millipore), anti-H2A.Z (ab4174; Abcam), anti-H3K4me3 (07-473; Millipore), anti-H3K9Ac (17-658; Millipore), anti-H3K36me3 (ab9050; Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal control IgG (ab46540; Abcam).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA enrichment in the ChIP samples was determined by qPCR using Thunderbird SYBR mix (TOYOBO) and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the primers targeting the different regions within the HTLV-1 and HIV proviruses are detailed in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a positive control for CTCF binding, we used TC-1 primers to amplify a well-characterized CTCF-binding region (35) in the human genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are expressed as the percentage of input DNA (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One representative result from three independent experiments is shown depending on the availability of the samples (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For ChIP-seq analysis, ChIP-DNAs of ED cells were prepared as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of between 2 ng and 1,000 ng of ChIP or input DNAs was used for library generation with a NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The libraries were quantified by qPCR and diluted to the optimal concentration for cluster generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy-five base-pair single-end reads plus a 6-bp index read were acquired on the Illumina NextSeq 500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each DNA sequence was mapped using the BurrowsWheeler Alignment (BWA)-MEM algorithm (36) to the human reference genome hg19, modified by insertion of the HTLV-1 sequence (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AB513134.1) into the integration site of ED cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak detection was performed using the model-based analysis of the ChIP-seq algorithm (37) in Strand NGS software (Strand Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF binding or histone modification at each region was identified by the significant enrichment of each signal over input-DNA peaks at a P cutoff value of 105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of ChIP-seq data was done using Strand NGS software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed ChIP-seq analysis of CRISPR-modified ED cells according to the protocol described above, with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the sequencing efficiency of HTLV-1, we enriched HTLV-1 sequences with 120-bp biotinylated DNA probes covering the whole HTLV-1 sequence according to the manufacturers instructions (Integrated DNA Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methylated_DNA_Immunoprecipitation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The level of DNA methylation within the HTLV-1 provirus was quantified by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MeDIP assay was performed with MethylCollector Ultra (ActiveMotif) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HTLV-1 molecular clone pACH (38) was methylated in vitro by CpG methyltransferase (M.SssI; New England Biolabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MeDIP value of the methylated pACH was taken as 100% methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative DNA methylation was analyzed by qPCR, using the primers shown in Tables S1 and S2 in each respective region of the HTLV-1 provirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EB_Assay_with_Luciferase_Reporter_Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vectors pIHL, pIHLE, pIHLEI, and pIHLIE were constructed as previously described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter vectors were constructed, containing 1,000 bp (pX), 300 bp (pX300), and 100 bp (pX100) segments of the HTLV-1 pX region, respectively, using the primers detailed in Table S2 to amplify the specific fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences containing the same mutations described for the competitor probes in the EMSA were also prepared using the pX100 reporter plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A deletion mutant with a 20-bp deletion in the consensus sequence for CTCF binding was also generated using the pX100 reporter plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter vectors (0.025 pmol) were transfected into HeLa cells (5 × 104 cells) in a 24-well plate, using HilyMax reagent (Dojindo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some experiments, the plasmids were linearized with the restriction enzyme MluI before transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h later, using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphs show the mean ± SD of triplicates of one of at least three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

An shRNA expression vector targeting CTCF (pSilencer CTCF-1) was constructed by using pSilencer-3.1-H1-puro vector (pSilencer-NC; Ambion) as previously described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligonucleotides used for pCTCF1 were as follows: 5-GATCCGTGTCTAAAGAGGGCCTTGTTCAAGAGACAAGGCCCTCTTTAGACACTTTTTTGGAAA-3 and 5-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGTGTCTAAAGAGGGCCTTGTCTCTTGAACAAGGCCCTCTTTAGACACG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To transfect MT-1 cells, we used NEPA21 (Nepagene) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One million cells were transfected with 510 g of plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, transfected cells were selected with puromycin (2 g/mL), and they were harvested 24 h and 48 h later; dead cells were removed by Ficoll separation before RNA extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed the efficiency of CTCF KD by Western blotting as described previously, with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead cells were removed by Ficoll separation before protein extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNAs were extracted from MT-1 cells as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library Kit (Agilent Technologies) to prepare libraries for high-throughput sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 with a TrueSeq Rapid PE cluster kit (Illumina) and an SBS kit (200 cycles; Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained 49,570,644 and 54,813,994 reads from negative control and CTCF KD MT-1 cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removal of reads with low-sequencing quality, reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) or HTLV-1 genome (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AB513134.1) using TopHat, a spliced read mapper for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping rate visualization of RNA-seq was done using Strand NGS software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_CTCF_Consensus_Sequence_in_HTLV-1_Genome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first identified possible CTCF-BSs by using EMBOSS 6.3.1:fuzznuc (mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py?#forms::fuzznuc) within the HTLV-1 genome (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AB513134.1) as those sites with the same nucleotide as the consensus motif identified by Kim et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9) at positions 6, 11, 14, and 16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated a similarity score for each possible site based on the observed frequencies of 14 core nucleotides of the consensus CTCF-binding sequence (position 5 to position 18 inclusive) (details are provided in the legend for Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Establishment_of_ED_Clones_with_a_Mutated_CTCF-BS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate ED cells containing a mutated CTCF-BS, lentiCas9_gRNA retroviral vectors were prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The guide RNA (gRNA) oligonucleotides (5-CACCGGAGAAAGCGCCACCTCGCG-3 and 5-AAACGCGCGAGTGGCGCTTTCTCC-3) were annealed and cloned into the BsmBI site of lentiCRISPRv2 (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52961; Addgene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting plasmid was transfected into 293T cells, together with pCMV-VSV-G (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8454; Addgene) and psPAX2 plasmids (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12260; Addgene), to obtain the lentiCas9_gRNA vectors in the culture supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five million ED cells were transfected by electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector; Lonza) with 30 pmol of single-stranded template DNA (5-CTTAGAAGAGGAAAGCCGCGGCCGGCTGCGACGGGGCCCTCCAGGGGAGAAAGCCCCGCCAAGAGGTGAAACGCATCGTGATCGGCAGCGACGGGCTGAGGAGAAGAGGAAGCGAAAAAA-3) (Integrated DNA Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations within the CTCF-BS are indicated in bold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hours later, transfected cells were transduced with the lentiviral vector lentiCas9_gRNA by spinoculation (1,000 × g, 60 min) in the presence of 8 g/mL polybrene (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days later, selection with 2 g/mL puromycin was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 wk of selection, single clones were obtained by limiting dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clones were maintained in RPMI 10% (vol/vol) FBS supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long-term cultivation, recombinant IL-2 (100 IU/mL; Peprotech) was added to the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_3C_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then lysed with lysis buffer [10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei (5 × 106 cells) were digested with 1,000 units of NlaIII (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C, and DNA was diluted (0.5 ng/L) and ligated with 1,600 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 16 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reversing the cross-links at 65 °C overnight in the presence of proteinase K (100 g/mL) followed by treatment with RNase A (40 g/mL) at 37 °C for 1 h, the circular DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 400 L of 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA (3C library) was repurified by an additional ethanol precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six 3C libraries were made from three independent cultures of ED cells with WT HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 with the CTCF-BS deletion mutant of HTLV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time 3C qPCR was then performed in quadruplicate or triplicate on each library, using a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System utilizing TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the interaction between the viral CTCF-BS and cCTCF-BS, we primers used were vCTCF_1 (5-CAAGGATAATAGCCCGTCCA-3) and cCTCF_1 (5-TGTCCAAGGCCAGACAAA-3) and the probe A (5-TCCGGGCATGGTGGTACTGCTA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, we assessed the interactions between the vCTCF-BS and two regions adjacent to the view point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the interaction shown as b in Fig 6A, the primers used were vCTCF 3C_2 (5-CTCCTCCTCCTTGTCCTTTAAC-3) and Control_B (5-GCTCAGCTCTACAGTTCCTTATC-3), and the probe used was probe B (5-TCCGGGCATGGCCTGGAGGAA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the interaction shown as c in Fig 6A, the primers used were vCTCF 3C_3 (5-TAATAGCCCGTCCACCAATTC-3) and Control_C (5-TCTGTTCTGGGCAGCATAC-3), and the probe used was probe C (5-CCTCCGGGCATGAGGTGGACAAAGATA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To normalize the qPCR, we amplified a 101-bp sequence from the provirus using the primers IC_1 (5-CGCGGCTTTCCTCTTCTAA-3) and IC_2 (5-ATTGGTGGACGGGCTATTATC-3) and the probe (5-AAGCACAGCTTCCTCCTCCTCCTT-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis was done with LinRegPCR software (version 2014.5) The Welch two-sample t test was used to test whether the mean interaction frequency was significantly different between the WT and mutant samples (three biological replicates for each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
