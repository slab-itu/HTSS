title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial mutation patterns as markers of early colorectal tumor cell mobility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thanks to improved screening technologies, many small premalignant tumors are now detected and treated, which reduces late-stage disease and cancer mortality, but also leads to overdiagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it remains uncertain if the starts of benign and malignant tumors differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine mathematical multiscale models with multiregional sequencing to infer that the starts of benign and some malignant tumors differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abnormal cell mobility eventually needed for invasion and metastasis is already expressed at the start of growth for some malignant tumors but not benign tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, some malignant tumors start with more invasive potential (born to be bad), and this early abnormal cell mobility can potentially be used to identify patients more likely to benefit from aggressive treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A growing body of evidence suggests that a subset of human cancers grows as single clonal expansions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a nearly neutral evolution scenario, it is possible to infer the early ancestral tree of a full-grown tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that early tree reconstruction can provide insights into the mobility phenotypes of tumor cells during their first few cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explored this hypothesis by means of a computational multiscale model of tumor expansion incorporating the glandular structure of colorectal tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After calibrating the model to multiregional and single gland data from 19 human colorectal tumors using approximate Bayesian computation, we examined the role of early tumor cell mobility in shaping the private mutation patterns of the final tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations showed that early cell mixing in the first tumor gland can result in side-variegated patterns where the same private mutations could be detected on opposite tumor sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, absence of early mixing led to nonvariegated, sectional mutation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the patterns of detectable private mutations in colorectal tumors may be a marker of early cell movement and hence the invasive and metastatic potential of the tumor at the start of the growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In alignment with our hypothesis, we found evidence of early abnormal cell movement in 9 of 15 invasive colorectal carcinomas (born to be bad), but in none of 4 benign adenomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If validated with a larger dataset, the private mutation patterns may be used for outcome prediction among screen-detected lesions with unknown invasive potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor ancestral trees are physically embedded within their tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The typical colorectal adenocarcinoma is spherical, and its cells are compartmentalized into glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Present-day tumor cells coalesce back in time to progressively fewer ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final common ancestor is the progenitor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell mobility is relatively limited in solid glandular tumors, so a cell on one side of a large tumor will tend to remain on that side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the ancestral tree is physically embedded within the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Only a portion of the embedded tree can be sampled because the tree has billions of tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With neutral evolution and a single expansion, sampling glands from opposite tumor sides misses most later branches but reliably samples earlier branches that coalesce to the progenitor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of growth, only mutations acquired early during growth attain allelic frequencies detectable by current sequencing technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, most of the detectable information recorded by private mutations reflect the cell divisions and movements during the first few divisions after a tumor starts to grow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model presented here is an extension of the computational model in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 and explicitly accounts for the spatial configuration of cells inside the glands (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we fit the model to multiregional sequencing data from 19 human colorectal tumor specimens using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior parameter distributions for the mutation burst rate, the number of stem cells per gland, and the cellular mobility, as well as posterior checks that illustrate goodness-of-fit, are found in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we used the model to predict several features of tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected in a neutral evolution scenario, only mutations acquired by the second growth division could be reliably detected in the final tumor (Fig 2B), because private mutations acquired during later divisions had allelic frequencies of less_than10%, the detectability threshold for current exome sequencing (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, this indicates that most detectable ITH in the final tumor is due to private mutations acquired during the first few divisions of growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the single gland level, ITH disappeared rapidly because, through exponential expansion, most glands eventually originated from only one of the early genotypes, and their cells had the same public and private mutations (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the star-shaped genealogies of the neutral evolution dynamics, substantial ITH was maintained within bulk regions of the tumor as adjacent glands often had distinctly different genotypes (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above model predictions were corroborated by the data from human colorectal tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all 19 specimens, private mutations differed between opposite sides (Fig 3A and Dataset S1), indicating at least two different subclones per tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many private mutations had subclonal mutation frequencies (Fig 3B), suggesting more than one subclone per bulk region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the neutral model indicates that these mutations arose early during tumorigenesis (Fig 2B), mutation rates may have been elevated early during growth (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the simulations (Fig 2B), genotypes often differed between glands isolated from the same tumor side (Fig 3A), with an average of 2.4 different gland subclones (range 14) per bulk tumor region (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally consistent with the simulations (Fig 2C), individual glands were clonal populations as demonstrated by comparable mutation frequencies of public and private mutations (Fig 3B and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the proposed multiscale model of neutral evolution was in agreement with key features observed in the human tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reconstructing_Early_Ancestral_Trees  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both the simulations and the experimental data indicated stereotypic private mutation topographies, where ITH was consistently present between tumor sides, sometimes present within small bulk regions, and inevitably disappeared within individual tumor glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In consequence, the clonal gland genotypes could be used to reconstruct ancestral trees that coalesced to single common ancestors (Fig 3C and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the early ancestral trees reflected past cell divisions because the genotype of each clonal gland represents the genotype of a single cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the detectability thresholds, these trees reflected the earliest growth divisions (i.e., the base of the full ancestral tree) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One way to distinguish selection from neutral evolution is to compare the relative frequencies of private and public driver mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With neutral evolution, selection for growth is conferred by driver mutations in the progenitor cell, and therefore most driver mutations are public mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With selection during growth, each branch of the early ancestral tree should have a unique driver mutation, and therefore most driver mutations should be private mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While at least one canonical driver mutation was identified per tumor, and an average of 2.9 public drivers per tree trunk, most individual branches lacked private driver mutations with an average of only 0.25 drivers per branch (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 17 nonmutator tumors (excluding tumors E and W; Table 1), there was an average of 2.4 public drivers per trunk and only 0.04 private drivers per branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we found little evidence that tree branching was due to the selection of new private driver mutations because most driver mutations were public mutations and most branches lacked driver mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Starting_Points_of_Benign_and_Malignant_Tumors_May_Be_Different  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If driver mutations are infrequently acquired during tumor growth, the early growth of the final tumor largely depends on the drivers present in the founding cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reasoning further implies that phenotypes of benign and malignant progenitor cells differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fundamental phenotypic difference between benign and malignant tumors is cellular mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to normal tissue growth, as exemplified by the patch-like distributions of G6PDH-stained crypts in normal human colon (12), the cells of benign tumors remain localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cells of malignant tumors invade the surrounding tissue and seed metastases to distant organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore potential fingerprints of progenitor cell mobility in the final tumor specimen, we simulated different degrees of cell mobility during growth (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the benign phenotype scenario without cellular mobility (Fig 4A), daughter cells remained adjacent after division of the mother cell and did not intermix (i.e., move between sides of the first tumor gland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the mutation topography of the final tumor was hemispheric, and the same private mutation was rarely detected when sampling opposite tumor sides (Fig 5A; p = 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the malignant scenario (Fig 4B), abnormal cell movement was simulated by allowing daughter cells to randomly move and intermix after cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daughter cells with the same private mutation could thus move to opposite tumor sides during the early growth phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further growth and expansion resulted in the same private mutation on opposite tumor sides (Fig 5A; p  0) because the final tumor was essentially a larger, expanded version of its smaller state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of cell intermixing was critical because it had to occur in the first tumor gland to be reliably detectable in the final tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell intermixing after the first gland division rarely led to the same private mutation on opposite final tumor sides because increasing spatial separation hindered hemispheric mutation cross-over.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimentally, none of the four adenomas had private mutations on opposite tumor sides (Table 1), indicating a lack of early abnormal cell intermixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, private mutations were detected on both sides of 9 of 15 cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abnormal movements of daughter cells to opposite sides of their first tumor glands are reflected by trees where private mutations acquired on one tumor side branch over to the other tumor side (Fig 3C and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from statistical inference corroborated the role of early cell mobility in explaining these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posterior mean of the mixing strength p was elevated in 9 of 15 carcinomas and reduced in all four adenomas (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the posterior probability of a complete lack of cellular mobility (p = 0) was 5% in 8 of 15 carcinomas and 25% in adenomas (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cell mixing was assumed to be stochastic, mixing did not inevitably result in variegated mutation distributions, and simulations showed that even with extensive mixing (p = 1), the probability to detect a private mutation in both bulk regions did not exceed 60% (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Bayesian model selection suggested that early cell mobility provided a more likely mechanism for the side-mixing of carcinomas compared with models where mixing could arise through alternative mechanisms, e.g., selection, delayed onset of cell mobility, and tumor self-seeding (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the impracticability of longitudinal sampling, the evolutionary dynamics of human tumors can rarely be observed directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, an attractive systematic method to study human tumorigenesis is to reconstruct their ancestries from mutations, which is facilitated by the widespread ITH in most human tumors (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor phylogenies can be reconstructed with many different types of data, sampling schemes, and methods that have different strengths and weaknesses (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real tumor trees are complex and bushy because there are billions of cells or tips (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most tips cannot be experimentally sampled, inferred trees are limited representations of the past history, and it is often unclear or unstated what exact events are reconstructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have previously modeled tumor growth and the role of cell migration (1417), including simulations that describe how early cell mixing determines the topography of mutations in the final tumor (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combined simulations with experimental spatial sampling of natural tumor subclones (glands) to infer that much of the ancestral information recorded by easily detectable somatic mutations comes from the early divisions when a tumor starts to grow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then showed that the spatial distribution of private mutations in the final tumor could provide insights into the founding phenotype, particularly with respect to cellular mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abnormal cellular mobility constitutes one of several phenotypic traits that distinguish benign from malignant tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, important hallmarks of tumor malignancy are invasion and metastasis, which both require abnormal cell mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model of stepwise sequential selection implies that increasingly more malignant phenotypes arise during tumor growth due to the acquisition of additional private driver mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, under the model of neutral evolution, the founding cancer cells already have a malignant phenotype, and additional private driver mutations are rarely acquired during growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the first founding cell of a cancer should already have the mobile phenotype needed for eventual invasion and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that some cells present in the founding tumor gland already express a phenotype of abnormal cell mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can be detected because mobile and immobile phenotypes leave different footprints in the final tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mobile cells born next to each other may end up on opposite sides of the final tumor, whereas immobile cell phenotypes are more likely to cluster together in the final tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our early tree reconstruction and statistical inference of the cellular mobility parameter, there was evidence of early cell mobility in more than half the invasive colorectal carcinomas, but none in the benign adenomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small sample size precludes definite conclusions, and based on the simulations, even if there was abnormal cell mobility in all of the cancers, such mobility could be detected by our sampling in only about half the cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these observations suggest that benign and malignant tumors may have different mobility patterns early on and that their footprints remain visible in the clinically detected tumor specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed patterns of side-mixing in many carcinomas and lack thereof in adenomas could potentially be attributable to factors other than early cell mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, selection during growth could reduce heterogeneity and hence increase the likelihood to observe side-mixing in the final tumor through the formation of clonal patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, cellular mobility may not be present in all cells, but be delayed to a later mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, side-mixing may be caused by tumor self-seeding whereby cells are seeded to opposite sides of primary tumor via the circulation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, formal model selection (Fig 5D) favored the early cell mobility model to explain the observed patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior studies using some of the same tumors as described in this study indicated that many human colorectal tumors grow through neutral evolution as single Big Bang expansions (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such single neutral expansions (Fig 1) emphasize the relationship between spatial tumor growth and phylogenetic branching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutral evolution is relatively easy to simulate because all tumor cells have similar fitness, which is conferred by the public driver mutations in the progenitor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subdivision of tumor cells into small glands may inherently limit selection during growth because competition between cells is limited to neighboring cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with neutral evolution and single expansions, canonical driver mutations were predominately public mutations and most tree branches lacked private drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, other unmeasured private alterations could confer selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consistent with single star-shaped expansions, small bulk tumor areas often contained individual glands with different private mutations, indicating that selection was at best very weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any selective mechanism compatible with our data would require private drivers to be as common as branches on the underlying tree and yet be sufficiently weak to preserve the local ITH between individual glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The single expansion hypothesis of neutral evolution provides a very simple model of tumorigenesis because no further driver mutations are needed once the tumors start to grow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early expression of abnormal cell mobility is consistent with neutral evolution and the hypothesis that a cancer progenitor already has the driver mutations necessary for malignancythey are born to be badand can help explain the occurrence of metastases very early during tumorigenesis (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another clinically relevant observation is that neutrality maximizes ITH (5) and thus the potential for variants that may be responsible for subsequent therapeutic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other tumor types such as breast, lung, and kidney cancers show evidence of selection during growth (3, 4, 7, 22), but at least subsets of these tumors have mutation frequencies consistent with neutral evolution (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To some degree, selection likely occurs in most tumors, and further evolution in response to new environmental stresses such as chemotherapy is likely to collapse and remodel a tumor tree (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our findings further corroborate that most clinically detectable colorectal tumors are single Big Bang expansions (6), where highly capable progenitors start with the drivers sufficient for tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated the possibility to infer certain phenotypic traits of the progenitor cells based on their spatial footprints in the clinical tumor specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If validated in a larger dataset, these footprints could potentially be used for outcome prediction in small screen-detected lesions with unknown invasive potential, where early cell mixing could herald a much greater future propensity for invasion and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiscale_Model_of_Colorectal_Tumor_Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cells of the human colon are partitioned into a large number of individual glands (crypts), arranged in a regular, locally 2D lattice (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gland contains 2,000 cells, and growth occurs through crypt fission in the normal colon (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor glands are larger (10,00050,000 cells), and growth also occurs through gland fission, resulting in tumors filled with glands (i.e., adenomas and adenocarcinomas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although clinical tumors appear spherical, if unfolded, the locally flat arrangement of glands can be recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we modeled tumor growth in two spatial dimensions by arranging the glands on a regular lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gland was assumed to contain n spatially arranged stem cells responsible for renewal of the gland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transit-amplifying and fully differentiated cells were not modeled because they only remain in the gland for a few weeks and are unlikely to contribute substantially to the process of carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumorigenesis was initiated by a single founding tumor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the founding cell and its progeny kept dividing, they accumulated mutations and replaced the resident population of noncancerous stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for high mutational activity during tumor initiation (11), cells acquired mutations in bursts of size M  Poisson ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mutations arising after the second generation are rarely detectable (Fig 2B), mutations were only tracked until the fifth generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the tumor cells made up the entire stem cell population of the first tumor gland, cell mobility was modeled by having each stem cell exchange its position with a neighboring cell with probability p. After cell mixing, the gland underwent fission, and each of the new daughter glands inherited half of the mother glands stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two daughter glands then grew back to carrying capacity through repeated stem cell division before undergoing fission themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Space for new glands was created by pushing neighboring glands toward the periphery of the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through repeated cell division and gland fission, the tumor grew in a spatially structured and spherical manner (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After birth of the first tumor cell, growth can broadly be divided into two main phases: an exponential growth phase from first gland to carrying capacity and a maintenance phase where birth and death are in equilibrium and the tumor no longer grows in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mutations arising during the latter phase are unlikely to reach detectable allelic frequencies (they are trapped within glands), we only modeled the exponential expansion phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor growth was simulated until a final tumor size of 750,000 glands (1010 tumor cells, 3 × 3 × 1.5 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were performed in MATLAB (Version 2017a; The MathWorks, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are found in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Inference  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical inference on the model parameters n (number of stem cells per gland),  (mutation burst rate), and p (cellular mobility) was performed by using a rejection sampling-based version of ABC (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter space was discretized over plausible ranges, and 100 tumors were simulated on a total of 15,000 grid points that covered the plausible range in parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between simulated and real tumors was ascertained based on the L2 distance of multivariate summary statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rejection sampling was then applied to obtain approximate posterior distributions for the model parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior checks were used to evaluate goodness of fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bayesian model selection through rejection sampling on the joint modelparameter space (29) was performed to compare the early cell mobility model against alternative modes with selection, delayed cell mobility, and self-seeding, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are found in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_from_Human_Tumor_Specimens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sampled small (0.5 cm3) bulk regions from opposite sides of 4 colorectal adenomas and 15 colorectal adenocarcinomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each bulk sample, DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations detected on both tumor sides were labeled as public, and mutations detected only on a single side were labeled as private.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to five individual glands per bulk were used for targeted deep resequencing of candidate mutations as identified by the whole-exome sequencing (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
