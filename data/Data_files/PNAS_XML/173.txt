title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine mixotrophy increases trophic transfer efficiency, mean organism size, and vertical carbon flux  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine plankton commonly combine the autotrophic use of light and inorganic resources with the heterotrophic ingestion of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mixotrophs blur the strict boundary between producers and consumers and allow energy and biomass to enter the food web across multiple trophic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating this flexibility into a global simulation of the surface ocean food web reveals that mixotrophy enhances the transfer of biomass to larger organisms at higher trophic levels, which in turn increases the efficiency of oceanic carbon storage through the production of larger, faster-sinking, and carbon-enriched organic detritus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mixotrophic plankton, which combine the uptake of inorganic resources and the ingestion of living prey, are ubiquitous in marine ecosystems, but their integrated biogeochemical impacts remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We address this issue by removing the strict distinction between phytoplankton and zooplankton from a global model of the marine plankton food web.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplification allows the emergence of a realistic trophic network with increased fidelity to empirical estimates of plankton community structure and elemental stoichiometry, relative to a system in which autotrophy and heterotrophy are mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixotrophy enhances the transfer of biomass to larger sizes classes further up the food chain, leading to an approximately threefold increase in global mean organism size and an 35% increase in sinking carbon flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emergent global mean community structure in the two-guild (A) and mixotrophy (B) models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular nodes represent global carbon biomass (surface area proportional to the annual mean), and black links represent global carbon fluxes (thickness proportional to the square root of the annual mean, with all fluxes directed upwards).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal position of the nodes denotes plankton size, whereas the vertical position denotes trophic level (T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each population, T is calculated as 1 plus the average trophic level of each prey item, weighted by the contribution of each prey to the total carbon intake, including photosynthesis (T is calculated sequentially from small to large; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colors represent the balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon assimilation in each population (Inset, color scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Representation of the total annual carbon flux across each trophic level in the two-guild (blue) and mixotrophy (red) models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluxes were calculated for each value of T by summing all fluxes beginning at a lower level and ending at a higher level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines represent the total flux, whereas dotted lines represent only the photosynthetic flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Relationship between mixotrophic dominance and the relative increase in global carbon export (A) and global geometric mean plankton size (B) in the sensitivity experiments (Supporting Information), relative to the two-guild model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dots represent the global average from each simulation, whereas the error bars show the degree of spatial variability in the annual average for each simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the legend, the parameter  describes the strength of the tradeoff (a larger number represents a stronger penalty for mixotrophy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This penalty may be applied to the resource affinities and the maximum resource uptake rates (affinity and saturation) or just to the maximum resource uptake rates (saturation) (Supporting Information and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative uptake functions for the mixotrophs in each experiment are illustrated schematically in B (Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With no tradeoff, the mixotrophs have identical uptake functions to the specialists (black line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trophic_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a standard definition of trophic level (28, 29), defined in terms of carbon and modified slightly to allow for mixotrophic nutrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a community of N plankton populations, the trophic level Ti of population i is given byTi=1+j=1NTjpij.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, Tj is the trophic level of each prey population j, and pij is the relative contribution of prey population j to the total carbon assimilation by population i (including photosynthesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas strict autotrophs have a trophic level of exactly 1, the trophic levels of mixotrophic or heterotrophic plankton are computed sequentially from the smallest to the largest groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this definition, a strict herbivore consuming only strict autotrophs is assigned T = 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drawing nutrition from sources across multiple trophic levels allows populations to occupy intermediate trophic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a mixotroph gaining exactly half of its organic carbon from photosynthesis and half through grazing on a strict autotroph (T = 1) would be assigned T = 1.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simplified_Analytic_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The emergent behavior of the global model can interpreted under a number of simplifying assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 (Supporting Information) describes the rate of change of biomass for each plankton class, and we focus here in particular on carbon and phosphorus biomass (BC and BP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we look at the behavior of just one plankton size class in a homogenous physical environment, and we neglect mortality from higher predators to consider the balance between resource acquisition and basal mortality (m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photosynthetic carbon fixation and predatory carbon assimilation are both down-regulated when the cellular quota becomes carbon enriched (phosphorus starved), whereas phosphate uptake and predatory phosphorus assimilation are up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, for simplicity, we assume that both the autotrophic and heterotrophic regulation terms are identical in each case.dBPdt=(VPmaxPP+kP+GCmaxFCFC+kgQF)(QmaxQQmaxQmin)BCmBP,[2]dBCdt=(VC+GCmaxFCFC+kg)(1QminQ)BCmBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, VC represents the light-limited rate of photosynthesis, whereas Q represents the cellular P:C ratio, bounded by minimum and maximum values Qmin and Qmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorus uptake is dictated by the maximum uptake rate, VPmax, the half-saturation concentration kP, and the ambient phosphate concentration P. The grazing rate, GC, is a function of the available prey carbon biomass, FC, and the half-saturation concentration for grazing kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here,  is the maximum prey assimilation efficiency, and the P:C ratio of prey items is denoted as QF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shift_Toward_Larger_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assuming equilibrium, we can solve Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 for P=RP, which represents the minimum resource concentration required for the population to overcome the basal mortality m. For a phytoplankton population, RP is simply a function of the organisms physiology, the light-limited growth rate VC, and the mortality rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, in size-structured phytoplankton communities, RP increases with organism size, such that the smallest phytoplankton are able to exclude larger groups that are outcompeted for scarce nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a mixotroph population, RP is given by a very similar function, but we must also account for the ingestion of prey, as represented by GC=GCmax[Fc/(Fc+kg)]:RP=kPVPmax(mQminQ[Qmax(1mVC+GC)Qmin]1GCQF)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the right-hand side of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, the terms GC and GCQF are unique to the mixotroph, whereas the other terms are common to the phytoplankton and mixotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive values for GC and GCQF will always decrease RP, demonstrating that the additional carbon and phosphorus acquired by grazing both serve to make the mixotrophs more competitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Smaller_Equilibrium_P_C_Quota  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 can be solved to find the equilibrium P:C ratio, Q¯:Q¯=Qmin1m(GC+VC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 gives the equilibrium stoichiometry of the cell when photosynthetic and predatory carbon assimilation are balanced by mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to a specialist zooplankton (frequently dominant in the two-guild model), the additional carbon acquisition term VC serves to decrease Q¯ (i.e., increase C:P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Model_Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The global plankton food-web model is as previously described (9, 33) but with a number of modifications to simplify the representation of the plankton and with phosphorus now included in inorganic, planktonic, and detrital forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of unique plankton size classes is reduced to 10 [compared with 35 previously (9, 33)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplification initially reduced model stability but was counteracted by extending the active switching term (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S23) to all available prey (34) and by increasing the geometric SD of the predator:prey grazing ratio (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Environmental concentrations of inorganic nutrients ([Rii]), plankton biomass ([Bib,j]), and organic matter ([OMio,k]) have units of mmol element m3 or mg chlorophyll m3 and appear inside square brackets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subscript ii refers to a distinct inorganic nutrient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All plankton are described using the same general biomass equations, with subscript j denoting an individual population, and with subscript ib denoting either carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, or chlorophyll (Chl) biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subscript k indicates either dissolved (DOM) or particulate (POM) organic matter, and subscript io denotes the organic nutrient element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model equation for inorganic nutrients is as follows:[Rii]t=(u[Rii])+(K[Rii])j=1J[BC,j]Vii,j+SiiR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]The model equation for plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton, or mixotrophs) is as follows:[Bib,j]t=(u[Bib,j])+(K[Bib,j])+[BC,j]Vib,j+[BC,j]ib,jjprey=1JGib,j,jpreyjpred=1J[BC,jpred]Gib,jpred,j[Bib,j]m.[S2]The model equation for organic matter (dissolved and particulate) is as follows:[OMio,k]t=(u[OMio,k])+(K[OMio,k])zwk[OMio,k]rio,k[OMio,k]+Sio,kOM,[S3]where:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous versions of the model (9, 33) applied different nitrogen quotas and mortality rates to the phytoplankton and zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the same background mortality and size-independent scalings for minimum and maximum quotas were applied to all plankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum nutrient uptake rates and half-saturation concentrations for N and P were updated according to recently published allometries (19, 35) (parameters are listed in Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biomass_and_Nutrient_Quotas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growth of plankton type j is calculated as the acquisition of carbon and other essential elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion in which these elements are assimilated is variable but within finite limits that prevent excessive accumulation of any one type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of cellular nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and chlorophyll a to cellular carbon can be specified in terms of the cellular quota Q:Qib,j=[Bib,j][BC,j].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uptake and assimilation of each nutrient element decreases to zero as the respective quota becomes full, preventing excessive accumulation of N, P, or Fe biomass in relation to carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generic form of the uptake regulation term for element ib (Chl) is given by a linear function of the nutrient status, modified by an additional shape parameter (h = 0.1) that allows greater assimilation under intermediate resource limitation:Qib,jstat=(Qib,jmaxQib,jQib,jmaxQib,jmin)h.[S5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nutrient limitation is given by the internal nutrient status (3638), according to a linear function for N,N,j=QN,jQN,jminQN,jmaxQN,jmin,[S6]and a normalized hyperbolic function for P and Fe (ib= P or Fe),ib,j=1Qib,jmin/Qib,j1Qib,jmin/Qib,jmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temperature affects a wide range of metabolic processes through an Arrhenius-like equation that is here set equal for all plankton:T=eA(TTref).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parameter A describes the temperature sensitivity, T is the ambient water temperature in °C, and Tref is a reference temperature (also in °C) at which T=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Autotrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nitrogen_Uptake  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nitrogen uptake (VN,j) is the sum of ammonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2), and nitrate (NO3) uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the overall N uptake rate is given byVN,j=VNH4,j+VNO2,j+VNO3,j,[S9]whereVNH4,j=VNH4,jmax[NH4][NH4]+kNH4,jQN,jstatT,[S10]VNO2,j=VNO2,jmax[NO2][NO2]+kNO2,jQN,jstatTe[NH4],[S11]VNO3,j=VNO3,jmax[NO3][NO3]+kNO3,jQN,jstatTe[NH4].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]Uptake of all three forms of nitrogen is modified according to the quota status and the temperature function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ammonium represents the most energetically efficient form of nitrogen, followed by nitrite and nitrate, and preferential uptake of ammonium is included in the model by exponentially reducing the uptake rates for nitrite and nitrate with increasing environmental ammonium (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorus_and_Iron_Uptake  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphate and dissolved iron (ii=ib= P or Fe) are taken up as functions of environmental availability ([Rii]), maximum uptake rate (Vii,jmax), the half-saturation concentration for uptake (kii,j), quota satiation (Qib,jstat), and temperature limitation (T):Vii,j=Vii,jmax[Rii][Rii]+kii,jQib,jstatT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S13]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Photosynthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The photosynthesis and photoacclimation model is modified from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41 and 42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light-limitation term (I,j) is calculated as a Poisson function of local irradiance (I), modified by the iron-dependent initial slope of the P-I curve (Fe,j) and the chlorophyll a-to-carbon ratio (QChl,j):I,j=[1exp(Fe,jQChl,jIPC,jsat)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S14]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gross carbon-specific photosynthetic rate (PC,jsat) is modified from an absolute maximum reference value (PC,jmax) by light and temperature dependence, as well as the cellular status of the most limiting nutrient:PC,j=PC,jmaxI,jTmin[N,j,P,j,Fe,j].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S15]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Net carbon uptake, after removal of the metabolic cost of biosynthesis, is given byVC,j=PC,jVN,j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S16]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Photoacclimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio is regulated as the cell attempts to balance photon capture with the maximum rate at which energy can be used to fix carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on this ratio, a certain fraction of newly assimilated nitrogen is diverted to the synthesis of new chlorophyll a:Chl,j=NmaxPC,jFe,jQChl,jI,[S17]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Chl,j is the amount of chlorophyll a that is synthesized for every mmol of nitrogen assimilated [mg Chl (mmol N)1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If nitrogen is assimilated at carbon-specific rate VN,j [mmol N (mmol C)1 d1], then the carbon-specific rate of chlorophyll a synthesis [mg Chl (mmol C)1 d1 isVChl,j=Chl,jVN,j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S18]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monomodal_Size_Dependence_of_Maximum_Photosynthetic_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contrary to other size-dependent parameters, which are all monotonic power law functions of plankton volume (V) (Table S2), a monomodal function was used to relate the maximum photosynthetic rate to plankton size (35, 43, 44):PCmax=pa+log10(V)pb+pclog10(V)+log10(V)2,[S19]where pa=3.08, pb=5.00, and pc=3.80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equation was fit to log-transformed empirical data (35) with r2=0.79, as shown in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Heterotrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PredatorPrey_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predator biomass-specific grazing rate of predator (jpred) on prey (jprey) is given byGC,jpred,jprey=TGC,jpredmaxmax.rateFC,jpredFC,jpred+kC,jpredsaturation.jpred,jpreyswitching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1eFC,jpred)preyrefuge,[S20]where TGC,jpredmax is the temperature-dependent maximum grazing rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variable is modified by a saturating function of total food availability (FC,jpred) and the predator specific half-saturation constant for grazing kC,jpred, whereFC,jpred=jprey=1Jjpred,jprey[BC,jprey].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S21]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative availability of each prey population is given by jpred,jprey, which is an approximately log-normal function of the predator-to-prey length ratio, jpred,jprey, with an optimum ratio of opt and a geometric SD jpred:jpred,jprey=exp[(ln(jpred,jpreyopt))2/(2jpred2)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S22]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Predators are assumed to preferentially attack prey that are relatively more available (i.e., with larger jpred,jprey[BC,jprey]), according to an active prey switching function:jpred,jprey=(jpred,jprey[BC,jprey])2jprey=1J(jpred,jprey[BC,jprey])2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S23]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a prey refuge function is incorporated, such that the overall grazing rate is reduced when the availability of all prey (FC,jpred) is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the prey refuge is dictated by the coefficient .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall grazing response is calculated on the basis of prey carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grazing losses of other prey elements are simply calculated from their stoichiometric ratio to prey carbon, with different elements assimilated according to the predators nutritional requirements (see Prey Assimilation below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prey_Assimilation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prey biomass is assimilated into predator biomass with an efficiency of ib,jpred (ib Chl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has a maximum value of max that is modified according the quota status of the predator (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For elements ib = N, P, or Fe, prey biomass is assimilated as a function of the respective predator quota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the quota is full, the element is not assimilated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the quota is empty, the element is assimilated with maximum efficiency (max):ib,jpred=maxQib,jpredstat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S24]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C assimilation is regulated according to the status of the most limiting nutrient element (N, P, or Fe), modified by the same shape-parameter, h, that was used to modify Qib,jpredstat (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all three quotas are full, C is assimilated at the maximum rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If any are empty, C assimilation is down-regulated until sufficient quantities of the limiting element(s) are acquired:Qib,jpredlim=(Qib,jpredQib,jpredminQib,jpredmaxQib,jpredmin)h,[S25]C,jpred=maxmin(QN,jpredlim,QP,jpredlim,QFe,jpredlim).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S26]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sources_of_Organic_Matter  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plankton mortality and grazing are the only two sources of organic matter, with partitioning between nonsinking dissolved and sinking particulate phases determined by the parameter j, as a function of organism size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For x=log10(Vj),j=0.90.71+e(2.0x)[S27]andSio,DOMOM=j=1J[Bio,j]jmPmortality+jpred=1J[BC,jpred]jprey=1Jjprey(1ib,jpred)Gio,jpred,jpreymessyfeeding,[S28]Sio,POMOM=j=1J[Bio,j](1j)mPmortality+jpred=1J[BC,jpred]jprey=1J(1jprey)(1ib,jpred)Gio,jpred,jpreymessyfeeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S29]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biogeochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biogeochemical component of the model is as described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40 and 45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_Environment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
State variables in the food-web model are transported according to daily resolved advection and diffusion fields from an empirically constrained version of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (46) with 1° horizontal resolution and 24 vertical levels (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was run for 15 y, from 1992 to 2006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global maps and averages are based on output from 2003.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seasonal cycles of chlorophyll a and nutrients shown in Fig S3 include years 2003 to 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details can be found in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Resource_Uptake_Diagnostics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The carbon fluxes shown in Fig 1 represent carbon assimilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autotrophic carbon assimilation is given by photosynthesis minus the cost of biosynthesis (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterotrophic carbon assimilation is given by the overall grazing rate (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20) multiplied by the carbon assimilation efficiency (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The balance (a:h) of autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition for nutrient element ib in the nanoplankton size class (Fig 4) is given by the ratio of depth-integrated inorganic nutrient uptake (or photosynthetic carbon assimilation) and assimilated grazing:a:h,ib=a,iba,ib+h,ib,[S30]wherea,ib=0j=jnanoVib,jdz[S31]is depth-integrated assimilated photosynthesis or inorganic uptake of element ib, andh,ib=0j=jnanoioGib,jdz[S32]is depth-integrated assimilation of element ib from grazing on prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, jnano is an index of all members of the nanoplankton size class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ratio of nanoplankton photosynthesis to uptake of the most-limiting nutrient applied in Fig 3J requires knowledge of the most limiting nutrient X at each grid point, which is found for the mixotrophic model, according to a nanoplankton carbon biomass-weighted, water-column average of the nutrient limitation terms given in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 and S7, such thatX={N,ifNless_thanP&Nless_thanFeP,ifPless_thanFe&Pless_thanNFe,ifFeless_thanN&Feless_thanP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The community nutrient exploitation efficiency shown in Fig 3J is calculated as the ratio of depth-integrated photosynthetic carbon fixation to the depth-integrated uptake of the most-limiting inorganic nutrient.C:Xuptake=0(j=jnanoVC,j)dz0(j=jnanoVX,j)dz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S33]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_to_Tradeoffs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the mixotrophy model used in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 of the main text, it is assumed that all plankton have both autotrophic and heterotrophic traits, with no physiological penalty associated with being a mixotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conceptual view that mixotrophs are generalists relative to specialist phytoplankton and zooplankton suggests that there should be a metabolic cost associated with supporting both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is explored here in a sensitivity experiment, in which six additional model runs were performed, each resolving three trophic strategies in each size class: specialist phytoplankton, specialist zooplankton, and mixotrophs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two specialist guilds were parameterized as in the two-guild model, and the mixotroph class was parameterized as for the mixotrophy model but with an additional penalty imposed on autotrophic and heterotrophic resource-acquisition parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, mixotroph generalists are made to compete directly with specialists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In practice, the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic traits is described by a parameter , which is set to 1 for phytoplankton, 0 for zooplankton, and 0.5 for mixotrophs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for different tradeoffs,  is modified by an exponent .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each size class, the autotrophic parameters listed in Table S3 are multiplied by , whereas the heterotrophic parameters are multiplied by (1) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tradeoffs involved in mixotrophy are not empirically well constrained, so we apply three different values for  (0.74, 1.00, and 1.32), such that mixotrophs are assigned autotrophic and heterotrophic traits that are 40%, 50%, or 60% of the specialist values (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [The mixotroph model used in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 of the main text essentially assumes that =0, such that the mixotrophs have the full resource acquisition traits of both specialists (which are assumed to be fully outcompeted), whereas the two-guild model assumes the limit , such that the mixotrophs have zero resource acquisition traits.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, the tradeoffs for nutrient affinity (maximum uptake rate/half-saturation concentration) and grazing clearance rate (maximum grazing rate/half-saturation concentration) depend on whether uptake at low resource concentrations is limited by the rate of encounters with resources (scenario S, only the maximum uptake rate is affected by ) or the rate of handling of resources once successfully captured (scenario A+S, both the resource affinity and the maximum uptake rate are affected by ) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine both possibilities, as outlined in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tradeoffs result in six alternative parameterizations for the mixotrophs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5 and Table S4 show that the ecological and biogeochemical effects of adding mixotrophs are somewhat sensitive to their relative success, as a function of the imposed tradeoffs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker the tradeoff, the more mixotrophs dominate the global plankton community and the stronger the effects on carbon export and mean plankton size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the results presented in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 of the main text outline a scenario where mixotrophs have the strongest ecological and biogeochemical impact, the effects are still relatively large when mixotrophs are assigned a reasonably strong tradeoff, as long as no tradeoff is imposed on the nutrient affinities and grazing clearance rates (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, when the mixotroph maximum uptake and maximum grazing rates are reduced to 40% of equivalent specialist values (yellow colors in Fig 5), global C export is still increased by 20%, relative to the two-guild model, whereas mean plankton ESD is still almost doubled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
