Synchronous volcanic eruptions and abrupt climate change 17.7 ka plausibly linked by stratospheric ozone depletion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cold and dry glacial-state climate conditions persisted in the Southern Hemisphere until approximately 17.7 ka, when paleoclimate records show a largely unexplained sharp, nearly synchronous acceleration in deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed measurements in Antarctic ice cores document exactly at that time a unique, 192-y series of massive halogen-rich volcanic eruptions geochemically attributed to Mount Takahe in West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than a coincidence, we postulate that halogen-catalyzed stratospheric ozone depletion over Antarctica triggered large-scale atmospheric circulation and hydroclimate changes similar to the modern Antarctic ozone hole, explaining the synchronicity and abruptness of accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glacial-state greenhouse gas concentrations and Southern Hemisphere climate conditions persisted until 17.7 ka, when a nearly synchronous acceleration in deglaciation was recorded in paleoclimate proxies in large parts of the Southern Hemisphere, with many changes ascribed to a sudden poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies and subsequent climate impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used high-resolution chemical measurements in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide, Byrd, and other ice cores to document a unique, 192-y series of halogen-rich volcanic eruptions exactly at the start of accelerated deglaciation, with tephra identifying the nearby Mount Takahe volcano as the source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive fallout from these massive eruptions has been found 2,800 km from Mount Takahe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur isotope anomalies and marked decreases in ice core bromine consistent with increased surface UV radiation indicate that the eruptions led to stratospheric ozone depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than a highly improbable coincidence, circulation and climate changes extending from the Antarctic Peninsula to the subtropicssimilar to those associated with modern stratospheric ozone depletion over Antarcticaplausibly link the Mount Takahe eruptions to the onset of accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation 17.7 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Changes in climate indicators during the last glacial termination relative to the 17.7 ka glaciochemical anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shading shows the 192-y glaciochemical anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Annually integrated (12) 65째S insolation and (B) WD 18O (12); (C) WD CO2 (15) and (D) Taylor Glacier 13C of CO2 synchronized to the WD CO2 record (46); (E) WD CH4 (60) and (F) WD mineral acidity; SH dust proxies (G) nssCa in the WD core, (H) Ca in the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C (EDC) (11) synchronized to WD using volcanic events, and (I) Fe in a South Australian ocean sediment core (9); (J) the surface UV indicator Br in the WD core; and (K) Botuvera speleothem 18O that is a proxy for summertime precipitation in southeastern Brazil (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selected high-resolution elemental and gas phase measurements through the 192-y glaciochemical anomaly in the WD ice core at 17.7 ka (gray shading) showing nine distinct pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acidity, low-boiling-point heavy metals (e.g., Bi), and halogens (e.g., Cl) other than Br (Fig 1) were highly elevated throughout the anomaly (SI Appendix, Fig S1), with REE (e.g., Ce) enhanced only during the first 120 y. SH dust indicators (e.g., nssCa) were elevated only slightly, and slowly increasing greenhouse gas [CH4 (60), CO2 (15)] concentrations accelerated during the event (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements in the Byrd core are similar (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated break points (1 uncertainty) suggest that long-term changes in nssCa, CH4, and CO2 concentrations in the WD core began during the 17.7 ka anomaly (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial extent of the glaciochemical anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence of the 192-y anomaly has been found 2,800 km from Mount Takahe in ice core (circles) chemical records (SI Appendix, Fig S3) as well as radar surveys from much of West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also shown are area volcanoes (triangles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  September/October horizontal wind vectors at 600 hPa based on 19812010 National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis fields show transport patterns consistent with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mount_Takahe_177_ka_Volcanic_Event  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elements and chemical species associated with seawater (e.g., sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium), fallout from biomass burning (e.g., black carbon, ammonium, nitrate), and continental dust (e.g., aluminum, calcium, vanadium, iron, rubidium, barium) showed little or no change during the glaciochemical anomaly in both the WD and Byrd cores (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other elements increased by up to 50 times background concentrations, however, including rare earth elements (REE) that normally are associated with insoluble particles and low-boiling-point heavy metals linked, in past studies, to Antarctic volcanic emissions (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentration changes differed between elements (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2), with increases above background levels during nine distinct pulses of 1.7-fold for sulfur; up to sixfold for chlorine; 10-fold for lead; 20-fold for cerium, lanthanum, and thallium; and 50-fold for bismuth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While no increases were observed in the smaller (0.8 m to 2.4 m) insoluble particle size fraction, 2.5- and 11-fold increases were found for the medium (2.4 m to 4.5 m) and larger (4.5 m to 9.5 m) fractions, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all of our 35 chemical measurements, only bromine and bromide concentrations (SI Appendix, Bromine and Bromide) declined during this 192-y period (Fig 1) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with the initial interpretation of the original Byrd measurements (17) but in contrast to subsequent interpretations (21) (Materials and Methods), the very pronounced enrichments of low-boiling-point heavy metals (20) and halogens (22), as well as elevated concentrations of medium and larger insoluble particle fractions in the WD core (Fig 2) (SI Appendix, Fig S1), clearly indicate a volcanic source for the glaciochemical anomaly (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although sulfur during the anomaly was relatively low (Fig 4), the S/Cl mass ratio was 0.1, which is nearly identical to the 0.095 ratio reported for modern emissions from nearby Mount Erebus (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, tephra particles from the anomaly (Materials and Methods), analyzed by electron microprobe, showed mineralogy of a trachytic volcanic eruption (SI Appendix, Table S1) geochemically consistent with tephra from nearby Mount Takahe (24, 25) (76.28째S, 112.08째W), a recently active, flat-topped stratovolcano in West Antarctica located 360 km north of the WD coring site (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we refer to the 192-y series of volcanic eruptions as the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe Event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of emissions from Mount Takahe from enhancements in chlorine fluxes measured in the WD, Byrd, and Taylor Glacier cores, as well as radar-based evidence on the extent of the fallout plume (Fig 3), suggest that average and peak chlorine emissions were 100 Ggy1 and 400 Ggy1, respectively (SI Appendix, Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Takahe Emission Estimates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These levels are 10 and 40 times higher than modern emissions estimated for Mount Erebus (23), as well as 0.4 and 1.6 times those reported for Mount Etna, currently the largest point source of chlorine on Earth (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that transport of only 1% of the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe emissions to the high-latitude SH stratosphere would have yielded chlorine concentrations comparable to those responsible for modern chlorofluorocarbon-driven ozone depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of our measurements in the WD, Byrd, and Taylor Glacier (Materials and Methods) cores clearly indicate that the 17.7 ka event resulted from a series of massive halogen-rich, volcanic eruptions in West Antarctica (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explosive volcanic eruptions inject large amounts of sulfur and other aerosols, often including halogens, into the stratosphere, frequently leading to stratospheric ozone depletion even for small eruptions (2628) and to an increase in UV radiation at Earths surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photolysis and precipitation scavenging at warmer, lower-latitude sites limit atmospheric lifetimes of volcanic halogens and thus the impacts on stratospheric ozone, although transport of even a small fraction of halogen emissions to the stratosphere can deplete ozone (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Halogen lifetimes during the 17.7 ka event, however, were extended at Mount Takahe by the extremely cold and dry LGM conditions, particularly during dark winter months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a massive and persistent (192-y) series of halogen-rich volcanic eruptions is unique within the 68-ky WD ice core record, and the event straddles the most significant abrupt climate change recorded in Antarctic ice cores and other SH climate proxies during the 10-ky period of the last deglaciation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) which occurred many thousands of years after the 65째S LGM insolation minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that these two unique events coincided by chance is the product of the two individual probabilities, and on the order of one in a million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than a highly improbable coincidence, we hypothesize that these massive halogen-rich eruptions are linked causally, by stratospheric ozone depletion, to large-scale changes in SH climate and related changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation analogous to those from modern, halogen-catalyzed ozone depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evidence_for_Stratospheric_Ozone_Depletion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence for ejection of volcanic material from the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe Event into the stratosphere and/or enhanced tropospheric UV radiation was found in sulfur isotope anomalies in the WD and Byrd cores (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur concentrations during the 192-y event were 1.7 times higher than background, and 34S values were lower, indicating a volcanic source of the elevated sulfur, since background marine and volcanic sources have 34S signatures of 15 to 21 and 0 to 5, respectively (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, exposure to UV radiation, such as when volcanic sulfur is ejected into the stratosphere above the ozone layer, generates distinct changes in sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (MIF; expressed as nonzero values of 33S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that MIF from a single eruption into the stratosphere follows a distinct evolution from positive to negative 33S during the course of sulfate deposition (31), so low-resolution sampling and multiple overlapping explosive events may result in small values of 33S even for stratospheric eruptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 33S of sulfate from before the 17.7 ka event was within 2 uncertainty of zero, as expected for nonstratospheric sulfate (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonzero 33S measured in the ice during the 17.7 ka event indicated that the volcanic sulfur was indeed bombarded by enhanced UV radiation, either in the stratosphere as a result of ejection above the ozone layer and/or in the troposphere after significant stratospheric ozone depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of the WD and Byrd samples, the multiple explosive phases of the Mount Takahe eruptions, and the low concentration of volcanic sulfur above background levels, however, meant that the magnitude of the MIF anomaly was significant outside of 2 only for a few samples (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence for stratospheric ozone depletion and enhanced near-surface UV radiation also comes from changes in bromine concentration in the WD and Byrd ice core records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photochemical reactions in near-surface snow cause rapid cycling between the snow and air for a broad range of reactive and volatile chemical species, including bromine and nitrate, and a net loss in the snow through time, known as reversible deposition (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of this loss primarily depends on the duration and intensity of exposure of the snow to UV radiation, with duration determined by the burial rate (SI Appendix, Evidence for Reversible Bromine Deposition in Antarctic Snow), since light penetration below 0.3 m in the snowpack is much reduced and exposure intensity is determined by the level of impinging UV radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During 27 ka to 6 ka in the WD record, there were only two sustained declines in bromine concentration, and the longest and most pronounced decline exactly coincided with the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe Event (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual layering in fine insoluble dust particle concentrations in the WD record indicates that the snowfall rate did not change during this period, eliminating burial rate variations as the cause of the bromine decline and implicating increased surface UV radiation (SI Appendix, Snowpack Modeling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While bromine release from the snowpack is sensitive to changes in UV radiation, and that sensitivity increases with snow acidity (33), photochemical model simulations as well as examination of the WD record show that acidity alone is not sufficient to explain the observed bromine depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, bromine concentrations in the WD and Byrd cores remained low even during periods between the nine volcanic pulses of the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe Event when concentrations of nearly all elements and chemical species, including acidity, returned to near-background concentrations (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WD snow accumulation was relatively high (100 kgm2y1) during this period (18), so the regions of high acidity in the core were well separated from regions of low acidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, consistent with modern observations in which some but not all volcanic eruptions are associated with ozone depletion (26), evaluation of the 100 highest acidity events (annual average concentration 3.0 쨉eqL1) in the 10 ka to 25 ka WD record shows that 30% were not associated with bromine depletion and that depletion was not proportional to acidity (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly demonstrates that acidity alone did not lead to bromine depletion and suggests that both increased acidity and increased UV radiation were required, as predicted by modeling (SI Appendix, Snowpack Modeling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is unclear whether modern ozone depletion and enhanced surface UV have resulted in bromine depletion in near-surface snow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, modern chlorofluorocarbon-driven ozone depletion largely has been confined to spring, while volcanically driven Mount Takahe ozone depletion may have persisted throughout the austral summer when the impact on snowpack photochemistry was greater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, there was no recent increase in acidity in Antarctic snow, so the sensitivity of bromine reemission to enhanced UV radiation was low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, no suitable Antarctic ice core record of bromine was available to assess the modern period (SI Appendix, Comparisons to Modern Ozone Depletion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plausible_Linkages_to_Rapid_SH_Deglaciation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observations and climate model simulations indicate that modern anthropogenic ozone depletion is linked to surface climate changes throughout the SH substantially similar to those 17.7 ka, as documented in paleoclimate archives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a poleward shift and acceleration of the westerly winds around Antarctica (35), acceleration of midlatitude easterly winds (35), and southward expansion of the summertime Hadley cell, leading to changes in temperature and precipitation extending from the Antarctic Peninsula (36) to the subtropics, especially during austral summer (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific climate changes include subtropical moistening and midlatitude drying (37) (Fig 5), as well as pronounced warming in the northern Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia, with cooling over the Antarctic continent, particularly in East Antarctica (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced deep-ocean ventilation around Antarctica with reduction in oceanic uptake of CO2 (38) also is associated with these modern changes in the westerlies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quasi-equilibrium simulations of the potential impacts of a sustained ozone hole at 17.7 ka using a coupled Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) initialized to LGM conditions predict qualitatively similar responses compared with the modern ozone hole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations include surface warming of 0.4 째C to 0.8 째C over all of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, in agreement with quasi-equilibrium simulations of the modern ozone hole (39, 40) (SI Appendix, AOGCM Simulations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These longer-term surface temperature responses are separate from the initial cooling simulated for modern stratospheric ozone depletion (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) suggested that rising insolation initiated melting of Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets at 19 ka, which triggered a reduction in the strength of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and, through the bipolar seesaw, resulted in SH warming and CO2 release from the Southern Ocean, although the exact mechanisms driving the CO2 release are still debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that the 192-y series of halogen-rich eruptions of Mount Takahe and the subsequent ozone hole (26) initiated a series of events analogous to the modern ozone hole that acted to accelerate deglaciation at 17.7 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, stratospheric ozone depletion changed SH atmospheric circulation, resulting in a rapid increase and poleward shift in the westerlies (35) (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, consequent widespread perturbations in SH hydrometeorology, including increased austral summer subtropical precipitation between 15째S and 35째S (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1F and 5), led to enhanced CH4 wetland emissions (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the combination of increased subtropical and decreased midlatitude precipitation, lower wind speeds between 35째S and 50째S (Fig 5) (8, 37, 44), and warming centered at 60째S (35) (SI Appendix, Fig S7), altered climate throughout SH LGM dust source regions (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result was a pronounced, synchronous, 50% decline in SH dust deposition (Fig 1), reducing ocean biological uptake (10, 46) and thereby sharply reducing the ocean CO2 sink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Patagonia and New Zealand, warmer and dryer conditions south of 35째S (37) led to the well-documented retreat of glaciers (46) that starved glacial outwash plains of their fine-sediment resupply (45), with lower wind speeds possibly also contributing to reduced dustiness (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aridity-driven SH dust source regions located north of 35째S (Australia, Africa, extratropical South America), a cooler and wetter climate (37) sharply reduced aridity and hence dust export (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, westerlies shifted poleward (SI Appendix, Fig S8) and thus altered sea ice extent, leading to changes in upwelling of deep ocean carbon and nutrients, particularly in austral summer when, because of minimal sea ice and generally lower wind speeds, impacts on the carbon cycle were most pronounced (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net effect of these physical and biological pumps on the carbon cycle (16) likely started the release of CO2 and initiated the rise in atmospheric CO2 that followed the 17.7 ka Mount Takahe Event (Fig 1) (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with modern increases in greenhouse gases (49), the atmospheric and oceanic circulation as well as hydroclimatic changes initiated by stratospheric ozone depletion were reinforced by rising CO2 (15) and CH4 (12, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the climate system already was primed for the switch from a glacial to interglacial state by insolation changes (1) and NH land ice loss (42), the 192-y ozone hole resulting from the halogen-rich eruptions of Mount Takahe plausibly provided supplementary forcing during the last termination that drove the westerly wind belt poleward and altered SH hydroclimate, providing a straightforward explanation for the synchronicity and abruptness of the SH climatic changes and global greenhouse gases that occurred 17.7 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ice_Core_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A nearly contiguous set of longitudinal WD samples from 1,300 m to 2,710 m depth was analyzed using a state-of-the-art continuous ice core analytical system (5053) (SI Appendix, Fig S8), in addition to replicate WD samples from 2,419.3 m to 2,435.2 m and all samples of the Byrd core (17) available from the University of Copenhagen archive between 1,242.06 ma and 1,303.39 m depth (SI Appendix, Continuous Ice Core Measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples from Taylor Glacier in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (54) also provided a record of the Mount Takahe event (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional measurements, including fluoride, bromide, and methane sulfonic acid, were made on discrete samples (SI Appendix, Discrete Ice Core Measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sulfur isotopes were measured on selected discrete samples using multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured isotopic ratios were converted to  values (Vienna-Canyon Diablo Troilite) using the International Atomic Energy Agency standards S5 and S6 and the standard NBS127.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 34S and 33S values of NaSO4 (33S = 0) were used to calibrate the instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instrumental uncertainty for 33S, defined as 2 times the SD (2) of replicate measurement of the internal standards, was 짹0.42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volcanic events in ice cores previously sampled for sulfur isotope studies contained volcanic sulfur concentrations typically 3- to 10-fold greater than background sulfur concentrations (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur concentrations during the 17.7 ka event were only 1.7 times background (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a reinterpretation of the original Byrd core measurements (17), LaViolette (21) proposed an extraterrestrial origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helium (He), and especially 3He, is much higher in extraterrestrial matter than in terrestrial components (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 3 kg of discrete meltwater samples were collected from the outer ring of the melter head for He concentration and isotope measurements above, within, and below the 17.7 ka event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average 3He concentrations were 4.4e-17 (짹2.5e-17) cm3g1 and 3.7e-17 (짹2.5e-17) cm3g1 in the five background and four 17.7 ka event samples, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the 3He/4He ratios were 6.8e-5 (짹1.7e-5) in the background samples and 7.3e-5 (짹1.9e-5) in the event samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interplanetary dust fluxes calculated from these data were in agreement with past measurements (57), indicating no evidence for an extraterrestrial source for the 17.7 ka anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Volcanic_Tephra_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insoluble tephra particles were captured on 10-쨉m stainless steel filters during continuous analyses for a background section of WD ice with no chemical evidence of volcanic fallout, as well as two sets of filters representing the early and later stages during the extended volcanic period (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional tephra was filtered from larger-volume, discrete samples collected as part of targeted replicate coring at WD (SI Appendix, Tephra Sampling and Geochemistry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small concentrations of silicate particles were detected for the depth interval corresponding to the early stages of the 17.7 ka event (2,430 m to 2,426 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No glass shards were found in the background sample or in the sample corresponding to the later stages of the 17.7 ka event, consistent with the continuous insoluble particle measurements (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the particles identified in the sample were fine (10 쨉m), and some had cuspate shapes suggestive of volcanic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative geochemical analysis of the particles indicates the presence of volcanic glass with an iron-rich trachytic composition characteristic of West Antarctic volcanism (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two main eruptive source volcanoes in West Antarctica, Mount Takahe (76째18.8S, 112째4.8W) and Mount Berlin (76째3S, 136째0W), are located 350 km north and 670 km northwest of the WD drilling site, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of tephra erupted from these two volcanoes is similar but can be distinguished by examining the MgO content of the volcanic glass, which is significantly higher in Mount Takahe eruptions (up to 0.5 wt.%) than in Mount Berlin eruptions, many of which have undetectable levels of MgO (24, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Break_Point_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The break function regression algorithm BREAKFIT (59) was used to estimate the timing and uncertainty (1) of concentration changes in nssCa, CH4, and CO2 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intersecting linear trends were fit to nssCa and CH4 measurements corresponding to 17.0 ka to 20.0 ka, and CO2 measurements corresponding to 16.0 ka to 20.0 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimated break points for nssCa and CH4 were 17.882 ka (짹0.179 ka) and 17.759 ka (짹0.075 ka), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the break point for CO2 was 17.612 ka (짹0.051 ka).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
