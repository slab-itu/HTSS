Nat1 promotes translation of specific proteins that induce differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that novel APOBEC1 target 1 (NAT1), which is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), is essential for differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we demonstrate that Nat1 supports the translation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Map3k3) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (Sos1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Nat1 resulted in decreased protein levels of these factors, resulting in suppression of the Erk and Akt signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation in Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus Nat1 is involved in the translation of proteins that are required for the differentiation of mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Novel APOBEC1 target 1 (Nat1) (also known as p97, Dap5, and Eif4g2) is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (Eif4g1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously showed that Nat1-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells) are resistant to differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we found that NAT1 and eIF4G1 share many binding proteins, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF3 and eIF4A and ribosomal proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NAT1 did not bind to eIF4E or poly(A)-binding proteins, which are critical for cap-dependent translation initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, compared with eIF4G1, NAT1 preferentially interacted with eIF2, fragile X mental retardation proteins (FMR), and related proteins and especially with members of the proline-rich and coiled-coilcontaining protein 2 (PRRC2) family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that Nat1-null mES cells possess a transcriptional profile similar, although not identical, to the ground state, which is established in wild-type mES cells when treated with inhibitors of the ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Nat1-null mES cells, the ERK pathway is suppressed even without inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ribosome profiling revealed that translation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Map3k3) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (Sos1) is suppressed in the absence of Nat1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation of Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data collectively show that Nat1 is involved in the translation of proteins that are required for cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nat1-Null_mES_cells_Show_a_Status_Similar_but_Not_Identical_to_the_Ground_State  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nat1-null mES cells maintained in the standard ES cell-culture condition with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) showed a round, dome-like morphology resembling that of WT mES cells cultured with the two kinase inhibitors and LIF (2i+LIF) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare gene expression in Nat1-null and WT mES cells, we performed microarray analyses (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mES cells, the mRNA expressions of several transcription factors, including Nanog, Esrrb, Klf2, Klf4, Tbx3, Pou5f1 (also known as Oct3/4), and Tfcp2l1 were increased significantly when treated with 2i+LIF (shown in red in Fig 1B, Upper Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without the two kinase inhibitors, Nat1-null mES cells showed higher expression levels of transcription factors that are more highly expressed in the ground state than in the primed state (Fig 1B, Lower Left), comparable to the levels seen in WT mES cells treated with 2i+LIF (Fig 1B, Upper Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2i treatment did not induce a further increase of these genes in Nat1-null mES cells (Fig 1B, Lower Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) also demonstrated that Nat1-null mES cells were similar to the ground state in terms of higher and more uniform expression of several key transcription factors (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the global gene expression was not identical in Nat1-null mES cells and ground-state mES cells: Many genes were differentially expressed (Fig 1B, Upper Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed that the gene expression profile of Nat1-null mES cells was similar but not identical to that of ground-state mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracellular_Signaling_in_Nat1-Null_ES_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the effects of Nat1 deletion on intracellular signaling, we performed Western blot analyses (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the expression of OCT3/4, NANOG, and TBX3 increased to a similar degree in Nat1-null mES cells and ground-state mES cells (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we found that the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 decreased markedly, whereas that of STAT3 was increased in Nat1-null mES cells, similar to levels in the ground state (Fig 2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, phosphorylation of other signaling molecules, including GSK3 and p38, did not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed decreased phosphorylation of AKT in Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrated that specific signaling pathways are altered as a result of Nat1 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NAT1_and_EIF4G1_Form_Unique_Translational_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify NAT1-binding proteins, we prepared mES cells in which the 3Ã—FLAG tag was knocked into the 3 end of the Nat1 or Eif4g1 coding region by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig 3A) (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After IP with an anti-FLAG antibody, we identified coimmunoprecipitated proteins by MS analysis with the iTRAQ system, which measures relative peptide abundances precisely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that NAT1 and eIF4G1 shared many binding proteins, such as eIF4A1 and 2, ribosomal proteins, and all 13 eIF3 subunits except eIF3j, which is a loosely associated subunit (Table 1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAT1 did not bind to eIF4E, as previously reported (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, eIF4G1, but not NAT1, strongly bound to the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 and to the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor CPSF3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, NAT1 preferentially bound to eIF2 (15), FMR1, FXR1 (16), and members of proline-rich coiled-coilcontaining protein 2 family, including PRRC2A, PRRC2B, and PRRC2C (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot confirmed preferential binding of eIF2, FMR1, and FXR1 to NAT1 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, NAT1 and eIF4G1 form overlapping but unique protein complexes (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Suppressed_Translation_of_MAP3K3_and_SOS1_in_Nat1-Null_mES_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify mRNAs translationally regulated by NAT1, we performed ribosome profiling (17), which quantifies the ribosome-protected mRNA fragment (RPF) to determine translationally active regions on mRNA (Fig 4B and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared WT, Nat1 heterozygous (Nat1+/), and Nat1-null (Nat1/) mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nat1+/ mES cells showed a normal phenotype in development and had the same characteristics as WT mES cells (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we visualized mapped fragments for the Nat1 gene locus (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total mRNA signals showed that exons 1 and 2 were not expressed in Nat1-null mES cells, consistent with our targeting strategy with which we eliminated the second exon containing the translational initiation codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the remaining exons were still expressed, but the signals of the 3 half decreased compared with WT and Nat1+/ mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease may be attributable to nonsense-mediated RNA decay (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, RPF signals in Nat1-null mES cells were not detected throughout the coding-sequence regions, reflecting a depletion of Nat1 translation resulting from the absence of the start codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared the normalized counts of total fragments and RPFs mapped to each gene using the Xtail pipeline (19), which has been developed to identify differentially translated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 18 genes (14 decreased and four increased) whose translation differed by more than twofold between in WT and Nat1-null mES cells and between in Nat1+/ and Nat1-null mES cells (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, translationally suppressed genes included Map3k3 and Sos1, which have been reported to be upstream of Erk1/2 in the MAPK pathway (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratios of RPF/total fragments of Map3k3 and Sos1 were significantly lower in Nat1-null mES cells than in WT or Nat1+/ mES cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both Map3k3 and Sos1 mRNAs possess alternative ORFs in the 5 UTR (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analyses confirmed that protein levels of MAP3K3 and SOS1 decreased markedly in Nat1-null mES cells (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, their mRNA levels decreased only slightly (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the protein/mRNA ratios of Map3k3 and Sos1 in Nat1-null mES cells were approximately 5% and 25% of those in WT mES cells (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Forced_Expression_of_Map3k3_Induced_Differentiation_in_Nat1-Null_mES_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether Map3k3 and Sos1 can rescue the differentiation-defective phenotypes of Nat1-null mES cells, we introduced tetracycline (tet)-inducible Map3k3- or EGFP-, Sos1-, or DsRed-expressing cassettes into Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of doxycycline, these cells maintained the round, dome-shaped morphology typical of Nat1-null mES cells (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, Map3k3-expressing Nat1-null mES cells showed a morphological change indicative of differentiation after the addition of doxycycline at a final concentration of 0.02 g/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cells, phosphorylation of ERK reverted to the WT level (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA expression of several pluripotency-related transcription factors, including Nanog, Pou5f1, Sox2, Esrrb, and Klf4, decreased significantly in these cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the mRNA expression levels of differentiation markers including Gata3, Gata6, Sox17, and Foxa2 increased (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript levels of Brachyury (also known as T) and Fgf5 did not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sos1-expressing Nat1-null mES cells did not change morphologically after the addition of doxycycline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicated that the suppressed translation of Map3k3 partially contributes to the impaired differentiation of Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we showed that Nat1 deletion results in a status similar but not identical to the ground-like state, which normally is induced by kinase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IP followed by MS analyses demonstrated that NAT1 interactions are distinct from those of eIF4G1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ribosome profiling showed that NAT1 is involved in the translation of proteins that play critical roles in cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MEK inhibition is critically important in the induction of the ground state (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It alone can induce the ground status, although in an unstable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that translation of MAP3K3 and SOS1 was suppressed in the absence of Nat1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two proteins are involved in the ERK signaling pathway at different levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Map3k3 is one of many MAP kinase kinase kinases and activates ERK and other MAP kinases (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sos1 is one of the Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors that convert Ras from inactive RasGDP to active RasGTP (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of these genes in mice resulted in defects in MAPK activity and in utero development (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation in Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the translational suppression of these two proteins contributes, at least in part, to the observed attenuation of the ERK signal and the ground-statelike property in Nat1-null mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both Map3k3 and Sos1 mRNAs have short upstream ORFs (uORFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because uORFs are considered to be translational repressors (25, 26), we hypothesize that these elements repress the translation of these mRNAs after cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mES cells, we propose that Nat1 alleviates this translational repression through direct mRNA recruitment without involving eIF4E (see the model in Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further mechanistic studies will be required to determine whether NAT1 mediates cap-independent translation of these mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One important question is how NAT1 associates with mRNA to support cap-independent translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our MS analyses showed that NAT1 was coimmunoprecipitated with many eIFs and RNA-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some were preferentially bound to NAT1 rather than to eIF4G1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include FMR1, its homolog FXR proteins, and PRRC2 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, NAT1, together with FXR1 was shown to mediate noncanonical translation initiation of specific mRNA in quiescent and immature oocytes (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRRC2 proteins have been listed in three previous articles (2729) that systemically identified RNA-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, little is known about the functions of PRRC2 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to understand the roles of these and other RNA-binding proteins in the translation of Map3k3 and Sos1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Nat1 promotes the translation of differentiation-promoting proteins in mES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the abundant and ubiquitous expression of Nat1, we speculate that its role is not confined to Map3k3 and Sos1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also showed that the translation of certain mRNAs may be suppressed by NAT1 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Nat1-null mES cells, the mRNA expression levels of numerous genes are altered from those of WT counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alteration makes it difficult to estimate translation efficiency from ribosome profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies, such as conditional deletion of Nat1 and identification of Nat1-binding proteins for translational regulation, are required for a better understanding of Nat1s cap-independent translational mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The RF8 WT mES cell line was derived from 129/TerSv mice, and Nat1+/ and Nat1-null mES cells were generated from the RF8 mES cell line in our previous study (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mES cells were maintained in DMEM (Nacalai Tesque, 08459-64) containing 15% (vol/vol) FBS (Gibco, 10437-028), 50 units50 g1mL1 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15149-122), 0.11 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985-023), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco, 25030-081), 0.1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco, 1140-050), and LIF, as previously described (30), on dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma, G1890-500G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We called this mES cell standard medium LIF and called the medium with two added inhibitors [MEK inhibitor (1 mM PD0325901; Stemgent 04-006) and Gsk3 inhibitor (3 mM CHIR99021; Stemgent 04-004)] 2i+LIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers and antibodies used for the qRT-PCR and Western blot experiments using these ES cells are listed in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Nat1-_or_Eif4g1-3Ã—FLAG_Knock-In_mES_cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3Ã—FLAG knock-in target regions for Nat1 and Eif4g1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned with the 3Ã—FLAG sequence before the stop codon into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector as 3Ã—FLAG knock-in targeting vectors using the Cold Fusion Cloning Kit (System Biosciences, MC010A-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guide RNA (gRNA) vectors for Eif4g1 contained the gRNA target sequences gRNA Eif4g1 R1, ACAACCGTGATCTACCATCC, and gRNA Eif4g1 F1, GTCTTTTTGGGAGGGATCTC; gRNA vectors for Nat1 contained the gRNA target sequences gRNA Eif4g2 R1, GGAAAGGGCCACCGGACCCT, and gRNA Eif4g2 F1, GTGGCCCTTTCGGGCTGCCG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate Nat1-3Ã—FLAG knock-in ES cells and Eif4g1-3Ã—FLAG knock-in ES cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (14), the targeting vectors, gRNA vector sets, and nickase (D10A) (31) expression vectors were cotransfected into WT mES cells (RF8) using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, 11668-019) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were selected with puromycin (final concentration 1 g/mL) for three passages and picked to isolate each clone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The ORFs of Map3k3 and Sos1 were amplified by PCR and reacted with the pENTR/D-TOPO vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Map3k3 ORF or EGFP ORF was cloned into PB-TAC-ERP2 (32), and each Sos1 ORF or DsRed ORF was cloned into PB-TAG-ERP2 using a Gateway LR reaction (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate tet-inducible Map3k3-, Sos1-expressing Nat1-null mES cells, the PB-TAC-ERP2/Map3k3, PB-TAC-ERP2/EGFP, PB-TAG-ERP2/Sos1, or PB-TAG-ERP2/DsRed vector was transfected into Nat1-null mES cells using Xfect mESC Transfection Reagent (Clontech, 631320) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were selected with puromycin (final concentration 1 g/mL) for three passages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To express the genes, doxycycline (final concentration 0.02 g/mL for Map3k3 and EGFP or 0.125 g/mL for Sos1 and DsRed) was supplemented with standard mES cell medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IP-MS_Sample_Preparation_and_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein reduction/alkylation, Lys-C/trypsin digestion (enzyme ratio: 1/100), and desalting of the samples were performed as described previously (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After labeling with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ, AB Sciex), each peptide sample was suspended and mixed in the loading buffer [0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 4% (vol/vol) acetonitrile] for subsequent nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a TripleTOF 5600 System (AB Sciex) equipped with an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loaded samples were separated on a self-pulled analytical column (150-mm length, 100-m i.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobile phases consisted of (A) 0.5% acetic acid with 5% (vol/vol) DMSO and (B) 0.5% acetic acid in 80% (vol/vol) acetonitrile with 5% (vol/vol) DMSO (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-step gradient condition of 510% (vol/vol) B in 5 min, 1040% (vol/vol) B in 60 min, 40100% (vol/vol) B in 5 min was used with a flow rate of 500 L/min, and a spray voltage of 2,300 V was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS scan range was 3001500 m/z every 0.25 s. Triplicate analyses were conducted for each sample, and blank runs were inserted between different samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IP-MS_Data_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The raw data files were analyzed by ProteinPilot v5.0 (AB Sciex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak lists, which were generated from the ProteinPilot.group file, were analyzed by Mascot v2.5 (Matrix Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both database search engines were used against UniProt/Swiss-Prot release 2015_06 (27 May 2015) with the previously described parameters (33), with the exception of a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein identification, peptides were grouped into protein groups based on previously established rules (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then at least two confidently identified peptides per protein were used for the identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum peptide length of six amino acids and single peptides with higher confidence (P less_than 0.01) were also used for the identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  False discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated by searching against a decoy sequence database (less_than1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein quantification, the intensity of the iTRAQ label spectra was normalized by i-Tracker Perl script (36), and the median value of the iTRAQ label ratio was calculated for each protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To prepare anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads, 240 L of Dynabeads protein G (Novex, 10004D) per 30 mg of protein from the cell lysate were washed three times with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS using a DynaMag magnetic separator (Invitrogen) and were resuspended in 240 L of ice-cold PBS on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty micrograms of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F1804-1MG) per 240 L of washed Dynabeads protein G were added, and the mixture was rotated gently overnight at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells attached to 10-cm dishes were washed twice with 8 mL of ice-cold PBS on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBS was removed completely, and 2 mL of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer [50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 120 mM NaCl, 0.10% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 1Ã— cOmplete EDTA-free (Roche, 1873580)] were added to the cell dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 Â°C in this condition and then were collected into a new tube and homogenized at 7,000 rpm (KINEMATICA, PT 1300 D) for 3 min on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã— g, 4 Â°C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant of the centrifuged cell lysate was transferred into a new tube, and the protein concentration was measured as input using DU730 (Beckman Coulter) with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, 500-006).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLAG antibody-conjugated beads were washed three times with 1 mL of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer and were added to the input, and then the mixture was rotated for 3 h at 4 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three more washes with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer and another three washes with TrisHCl (pH 8.0) buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 50 mM NaCl), the beads were resuspended with 3Ã—FLAG-peptide buffer [100 mM 3Ã— FLAG peptide (Sigma, F4799-4MG), 12 mM sodium deoxycholate, 12 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mM TrisHCl (pH 9.0)] and were rotated for 1 h at 4 Â°C twice to elute the sample from FLAG antibody-conjugated beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extract was subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses or Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
