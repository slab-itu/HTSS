Endogenous dendritic cells from the tumor microenvironment support T-ALL growth via IGF1R activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a malignancy of developing T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cell growth is often driven by cell-intrinsic alterations in signaling pathways as well as extrinsic signals from the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify tumor-associated dendritic cells as a key endogenous cell type in the tumor microenvironment that promotes murine T-ALL growth and survival at both primary and metastatic tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that tumor-associated dendritic cells activate the insulin-like growth factor I receptor in T-ALL cells, which is critical for their survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of primary patient T-ALL samples reveals phenotypically analogous tumor microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that targeting signals from the tumor microenvironment could expand therapeutic options for T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells require stromal-derived signals to survive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many studies have identified cell-intrinsic alterations in signaling pathways that promote T-ALL growth, the identity of endogenous stromal cells and their associated signals in the tumor microenvironment that support T-ALL remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By examining the thymic tumor microenvironments in multiple murine T-ALL models and primary patient samples, we discovered the emergence of prominent epithelial-free regions, enriched for proliferating tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic evaluation of the functional capacity of tumor-associated stromal cells revealed that myeloid cells, primarily DCs, are necessary and sufficient to support T-ALL survival ex vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DCs support T-ALL growth both in primary thymic tumors and at secondary tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify a molecular mechanism by which DCs support T-ALL growth, we first performed gene expression profiling, which revealed up-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (Igf1r) on T-ALL cells, with concomitant expression of their ligands by tumor-associated DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Pdgfrb and Igf1r were activated in ex vivo T-ALL cells, and coculture with tumor-associated, but not normal thymic DCs, sustained IGF1R activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IGF1R signaling was necessary for DC-mediated T-ALL survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies provide the first evidence that endogenous tumor-associated DCs supply signals driving T-ALL growth, and implicate tumor-associated DCs and their mitogenic signals as auspicious therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Primary_T-ALL_Cells_Require_Tumor_Stroma_for_Survival_ex_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the contribution of tumor stroma to T-ALL growth, we used the LN3 murine model of T-ALL in which endogenous TCR rearrangements promote spontaneous lymphomagenesis (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the oncogenic lesions driving T-ALL in LN3 mice have not been elucidated, activation of NOTCH1 and NFAT were previously implicated (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notch1 exon sequencing revealed nonsynonymous mutations in the heterodimerization or PEST domains in 64% (9/14) of primary LN3 tumors, with premature STOP codons in the PEST domains of 42% (6/14) of LN3 T-ALLs (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, T-ALL in the LN3 model shares characteristics with human NOTCH-driven cortical T-ALL, including constitutive NOTCH signaling and NFAT activation (Table S1) (19, 21, 22), as well as expression of CD8 with variable levels of CD4 (21), and elevated expression of the NOTCH1 transcriptional targets Hes1, Dtx1, and pTCRa (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 60% of LN3 mice developed T-ALL by 1 y of age (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether endogenous tumor stromal cells support T-ALL growth, we cultured primary LN3 T-ALL cells in the presence or absence of stroma from WT or tumor-bearing thymi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas tumor cells cultured alone or with WT thymic stroma underwent cell death, T-ALL cells cultured with tumor-associated stroma survived (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of viable T-ALL cells proliferated in the presence of tumor-associated stroma (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that stromal cells in the thymic microenvironment become altered to support T-ALL survival and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Thymic_Epithelial_Compartment_Is_Progressively_Disrupted_During_T-ALL_Tumorigenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because tumor-associated, but not WT thymic, stromal cells supported lymphoma growth, we investigated compositional changes in the thymic microenvironments of LN3 mice during T-ALL progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first evaluated TECs because they provide signals essential for thymocyte development, including IL-7 and NOTCH ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mice, the thymic epithelium consists of central Keratin-5+ medullary TECs (mTECs) surrounded by Keratin-8+ cortical TECs (cTECs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In LN3 mice, TEC organization was abnormal as early as 1 mo of age, with enlarged mTEC regions extending to the thymic capsule by 3 mo (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with small isolated epithelial-free regions that can be found in the interior of some WT thymi (Fig 2A) as previously described (23), strikingly large peripheral epithelial-free regions were abundant in LN3 thymic lymphomas, as seen in higher-magnification images (Fig 2A) and in whole-thymic sections (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These epithelial-free regions first appeared at the perimeter of pretumor LN3 thymi at 1 and 3 mo of age (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the thymic epithelium is progressively disorganized, culminating in expansion of extensive epithelial-free regions during LN3 T-ALL development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thymic_Epithelial-Free_Regions_Are_Enriched_for_Proliferating_Lymphoma_Cells_Surrounded_by_Vasculature__Fibroblasts__and_DCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TECs are essential for thymocyte development and can support T-ALL survival in vitro (18), which led us to question whether tumor proliferation could be supported in epithelial-free regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, CD8+ tumor cells proliferate extensively in these regions, suggesting that nonepithelial cells in the tumor microenvironment likely support T-ALL growth (Fig 3A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify such alternate cell types, we quantified stromal cells from WT versus tumor-bearing LN3 thymi (phenotypes and gating strategies in Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cTECs were largely absent in LN3 tumors, whereas mTECs were expanded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, both the number and percentage of Sirp+ DCs (CD11chiEpCAMCD45+MHCII+Sirp+CD80+ cells), one of two conventional thymic DC subsets (24), were greatly increased in tumor-bearing thymi (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining revealed that Sirp+ DCs were present in peripheral epithelial-free regions of LN3 thymic lymphomas; in contrast, DCs localize within central medullary regions of WT thymi (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epithelial-free regions in LN3 thymic tumors were also highly vascularized and contained extensive fibroblast/extracellular matrix (ECM) networks (Fig 3E), consistent with a microenvironment supportive of tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar epithelial-free regions containing DCs, vasculature, and fibroblast networks were observed in thymic lymphomas from LMO2 transgenic mice, which overexpress an oncogene frequently up-regulated in human T-ALL (25) (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary patient T-ALL mediastinal mass sections also consisted of extensive epithelial-free regions containing dense DC networks, in contrast to the encompassing epithelial network and central DC localization in normal human thymi (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All thymic lymphomas analyzed from the two mouse models and patient samples contained extensive epithelial-free regions with DC networks, suggesting commonality between tumor microenvironments in murine T-ALL of diverse oncogenic origins and in human T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in overt tumors, early epithelial-free thymic regions in young asymptomatic LN3 mice contained proliferating thymocytes (Fig S3A), Sirp+ DCs (Fig S3B), vasculature, and fibroblasts (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the number and percentage of Sirp+ DCs increased with age in pretumor LN3 thymi but not in WT thymi (Fig S3 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, microenvironments comparable to those in overt lymphomas emerge early and expand during T-ALL progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-ALL_Cells_Require_Contact_with_Tumor_Stroma_for_Survival_and_Interact_Extensively_with_DCs_in_the_Thymic_Microenvironment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transwell assays revealed that T-ALL cells required close contact with tumor stroma to survive (Fig 4A), similar to reports for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we determined whether T-ALL cells made preferential contacts with stromal subsets in intact 3D thymic microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our previously established two-photon imaging approach (27), we compared the migration of WT thymocytes with LN3 tumor cells in live thymic slices containing EYFP+ DCs (Fig 4B) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LN3 T-ALL cells were in contact with thymic DCs twice as often as WT thymocytes (Fig 4C) and exhibited a 190% increase in dwell time upon DC contact (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, LN3 tumor cells require contact with tumor stroma for survival ex vivo and interact extensively with thymic DCs in situ, which are positioned to provide mitogenic signals in epithelial-free regions within the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Myeloid_Cells_from_Primary_Tumor_Microenvironments_Promote_Lymphoma_Survival_ex_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the endogenous tumor stromal cell types capable of supporting survival of LN3 T-ALL cells, we cocultured primary tumor cells with sorted stromal subsets from the same tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cocultures containing a combination of all sorted stromal subsets (All Stroma) resulted in an average of 52% lymphoma viability after 6 d (range of viability, 2478%; stromal phenotypes and sort purities in Fig S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for variable survival between experiments with different primary tumors, we normalized T-ALL viability to cultures containing All Stroma for each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of epithelial cells or fibroblasts had no effect on tumor survival ex vivo (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, depletion of myeloid cells or DCs alone resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of T-ALL cells (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, sorted tumor-associated DCs and/or CD11cCD11b+ myeloid cells were sufficient to support T-ALL survival (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when an equal number of DCs or CD11cCD11b+ myeloid cells were cocultured with T-ALL cells, DCs promoted growth of 6.5-fold more viable T-ALL cells on average (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD3 and CD8 expression confirmed that the majority of viable cells were T-ALL cells and not stromal subsets in all coculture conditions (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results demonstrate that myeloid cells, and particularly DCs from the thymic tumor microenvironment, are necessary and sufficient to support T-ALL survival and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thymic_DCs_Are_Functionally_Altered_in_T-ALL  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unique ability of tumor-derived stroma to support T-ALL growth ex vivo (Fig 1 CE) could reflect functional changes in DCs or an increase in DC cellularity during tumor progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we compared the ability of an equivalent number of WT versus tumor-associated thymic DCs to support T-ALL survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only tumor-associated DCs supported significant T-ALL viability, demonstrating that DCs in the tumor microenvironment have enhanced tumor-promoting capabilities (Fig 5C; DC purity shown in Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinguishing DCs from macrophages based on CD11c expression is not always dependable, especially in tumor microenvironments (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LN3 tumor-associated DCs are phenotypically consistent with assignment to the DC lineage in that they express high levels of CD11c, MHC-II, and CD80 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the DC identity of tumor-supportive cells, we transcriptionally profiled DCs from LN3 thymic lymphomas and WT thymi, revealing that tumor-associated DCs express the DC-specific transcription factor Zbtb46 (30) (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hierarchical clustering of transcriptional profiling data from tumor-associated DCs, WT thymic DCs, and other WT myeloid subsets revealed that tumor-associated DCs were most closely related to their WT thymic DC counterparts and were distinct from macrophages and monocytes (Fig 5D) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DCs_from_Metastatic_Tumors_Support_T-ALL_Growth_ex_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in the primary thymic tumor, T-ALL cells from metastatic lymph nodes and spleens died when cultured alone but survived in the presence of tumor-associated stroma from their respective organs (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analyses revealed a significant increase in the number of DCs (CD11c+B220) and a consistent, although nonstatistically significant, increase in the number of CD11cCD11b+ myeloid cells in tumor-bearing lymph nodes and spleens, resulting in maintenance of the DCs proportional representation in these metastatic organs (Fig 6B and Fig S5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, tumor-associated splenic DCs were necessary and sufficient to promote survival of splenic T-ALL cells (Fig 6C) and could also support survival of T-ALL cells from primary thymic lymphomas and metastatic lymph nodes (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, splenic versus thymic DCs from the same tumor-bearing mice had a comparable capacity to support survival of splenic T-ALL cells (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that tumor cells from primary and metastatic tumor sites require DC-mediated support for survival and that DCs at both primary and metastatic sites are comparably poised to promote survival of circulating T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDGFR_and_IGF1R_Are_Up-Regulated_on_T-ALL_Cells_with_Concomitant_Expression_of_Cognate_Ligands_by_Tumor-Associated_DCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify potential pathways governing DC-mediated lymphoma survival, we analyzed gene expression profiles of sorted murine T-ALL cells for overexpression of growth factor receptors whose ligands were expressed by tumor-associated DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pdgfrb and Igf1r were highly expressed by T-ALL cells (Fig 7A), whereas the ligands Pdgfa, Pdgfb, Pdgfc, and Igf1 were expressed by tumor-associated DCs (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these ligands was specific, because Pdgfd and Igf2 were not expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-associated Sirp+ DCs expressed higher levels of Pdgfc and Igf1 than Sirp DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression data from tumor-associated and WT thymic DC subsets, T-ALL cells, and WT thymocyte subsets are provided in a searchable model within Gene Expression Commons (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunostaining and flow cytometry confirmed high expression of PDGFR protein on T-ALL cells in thymic and metastatic tumors from LN3 and LMO2 mice (Fig 7C and Fig S6 A and B), while PDGFR is expressed mainly on pericytes in WT thymi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PDGFR expression is apparent on sparse thymocytes in some pretumor tissues (Fig 7D and Fig S6C), suggesting PDGFR up-regulation is a characteristic of T-ALL development rather than a general peculiarity of thymocytes in LN3 and LMO2 murine T-ALL models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also evaluated PDGFR expression in T-ALL patient thymic and metastatic lymph node samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of eight patient lymph nodes evaluated displayed elevated PDGFR expression on tumor cells (Fig 7E), indicating that PDGFR overexpression occurs in a subset of T-ALL patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of previously reported expression profiling data from primary patient samples revealed higher expression of PDGFRB in the early T-cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL subset (Fig 7F) (25, 33), suggesting elevated PDGFR expression is associated with a more aggressive form of T-ALL (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medyouf et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  previously reported that IGF1R is a transcriptional target of NOTCH1 that is expressed on human T-ALL cells (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings reveal that elevated expression of PDGFR and IGF1R are shared characteristics of mouse and human T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor-Associated_DCs_Activate_IGF1R_in_T-ALL_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the T-ALL tumor microenvironment supplies endogenous signals that activate PDGFR and IGF1R, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of these receptors in tumor cells directly ex vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of PDGFR (pPDGFR) and IGF1R (pIGF1R) was elevated in T-ALL cells relative to WT thymocytes (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated whether tumor-associated and/or WT DCs could activate PDGFR and IGF1R in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-associated DCs sustained activation of IGF1R in lymphoma cells throughout 7 d of culture, whereas WT DCs did not (Fig 8 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After only 24 h of culture, a time point that precedes apoptosis of T-ALL cells cultured alone, the majority of T-ALL cells cocultured with tumor-associated DCs had activated IGF1R (Fig 8B), indicating that tumor-associated DCs signal to the majority of T-ALL cells, rather than to a rare tumor-initiating subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of pIGF1R and pPDGFR staining on T-ALL cells was verified using fluorescence minus one (FMO) and isotype controls, along with specific IGF1R inhibitors (Fig S7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of tumor-associated, but not WT, DCs to sustain IGF1R activation is consistent with higher gene expression of Igf1 by tumor-associated Sirp+ DCs relative to WT DCs (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumor-associated DCs secrete elevated levels of IGF1 protein relative to WT DCs (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that up-regulation of IGF1 by tumor-associated DCs could enable them to support T-ALL survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PDGFR was not activated by tumor-associated DCs (Fig 8B), despite high expression of the Pdgfc transcript by tumor-associated DCs and activation of PDGFR in ex vivo T-ALL cells (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7A and 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because PDGF-C is latent and thought to inhibit PDGFR signaling until proteolytically activated in the extracellular compartment (36), PDGF-C made by DCs in culture may not be activated to promote PDGFR signaling in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activation_of_the_MAPK_Pathway_Is_Associated_with_IGF1R_Signaling_in_T-ALL_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of the MAPK pathway has been implicated in pathogenesis of several cancers (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with WT thymocytes, ex vivo thymic lymphoma cells had elevated MAPK signaling, as indicated by increased levels of phosphorylated Erk (pErk) (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coculture with tumor-associated, but not WT, thymic DCs sustained pErk over 7 d (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IGF1R signaling can activate the MAPK cascade, supporting survival of mature T cells and other tumors (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we evaluated coexpression of pIGFR1 with pErk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of pIGF1R consistently correlated with pERK levels both in ex vivo T-ALL cells and following coculture with tumor-associated DCs (Fig S8 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity of pERK staining was verified with FMO and isotype controls (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, inhibiting IGF1R signaling resulted in decreased pErk levels (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IGF1R activation also correlated with T-ALL cellular proliferation (Ki67+) (Fig S8F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that IGF1R signaling activates the MAPK pathway and promotes proliferation of T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DC-Mediated_T-ALL_Survival_Is_Dependent_on_IGF1R_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IGF1 has been shown to directly support growth of solid and hematological malignancies (35, 3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether IGF1R signaling was required for DC-mediated T-ALL survival, we treated thymic and splenic T-ALL:DC cocultures with graded concentrations of three structurally distinct IGF1R inhibitors: AG-1024 (42), picropodophyllin (PPP) (43), and BMS-754807 (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three inhibitors decreased survival of primary and metastatic T-ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 9A), with IC50 values in the range reported for other tumor studies (40, 41, 4446).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AG-1024 and PPP were chosen because they are reported to have few off-target effects (45, 46); we validated that AG-1024 and PPP inhibited IGF1R activation (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably siRNA-mediated knock down of Igf1r also resulted in a reduction in T-ALL cells expressing pIGF1R (Fig 9B), with a concomitant decrease in T-ALL survival (Fig 9C) and proliferation (Fig 9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that DC-mediated T-ALL survival in the LN3 model is IGF1R-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether DC-mediated survival and activation of IGF1R, ERK, and PDGFR are common features of independent models of T-ALL, we evaluated LMO2 transgenic tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the LN3 model, LMO2 T-ALL cells survived only if cocultured with tumor-associated DCs (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examined directly ex vivo, LMO2 T-ALL cells had elevated levels of pIGF1R, pErk, and pPDGFR relative to WT thymocytes (Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IGF1R phosphorylation correlated with Erk phosphorylation in T-ALL cells analyzed ex vivo and correlated with ERK activation and proliferation in T-ALL cells cocultured with tumor-associated DCs (Fig S9 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as in the LN3 model, inhibition of IGF1R signaling abrogated DC-mediated survival of LMO2 T-ALL cells (Fig S9E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these studies provide the first indication to our knowledge that DCs in the tumor microenvironment directly support survival and growth of T-ALL cells in an IGF1R-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we demonstrate that the thymic microenvironment becomes altered during LN3 T-ALL progression such that DCs gain the capacity to support T-ALL growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human primary T-ALL samples require stromal-derived signals for survival (10, 16), suggesting such signals, if identified, could be viable therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies revealed that in the presence of exogenous cytokines, TECs from healthy thymi and bone marrow (BM) cell lines could support T-ALL (10, 1618).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, endogenous tumor stromal cells capable of supporting T-ALL growth in the absence of exogenous cytokines have not been previously identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We initially focused on TECs because they express IL-7 and NOTCH ligands, which have been implicated in supporting T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that epithelial-free regions enriched for proliferating lymphoma cells emerged at the periphery of thymic tumors in two distinct T-ALL models, consistent with epithelial-free regions in thymic tumors that arise in AKR mice (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epithelial-free regions also comprised the majority of tissue in mediastinal mass sections from T-ALL patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, along with the fact that TECs are confined to thymi and, thus, are not present to support T-ALL growth at metastatic sites, indicated that other stromal subsets must support T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpectedly, we found that tumor-associated myeloid cells, particularly DCs, were necessary and sufficient to support survival and growth of T-ALL cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that thymic DCs generally induce negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes, it was surprising that these DCs would provide survival signals to tumors derived from developing T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DCs in secondary lymphoid organs prototypically promote T-cell proliferation and survival during T-cell activation and in homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this function in the periphery, a previous study demonstrated that DCs could directly support survival of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells in vitro (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, T-ALLpromoting activity was not exclusive to DCs located in primary thymic tumors, because DCs from tumor-bearing spleens and thymi promoted T-ALL survival equivalently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumor cells at both primary and metastatic sites required the presence of DCs for survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, T-ALL cells first interact with altered DCs in the thymic tumor environment that can promote their survival, and as T-ALL cells seed metastatic sites, they encounter peripheral DCs poised to sustain their growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DCs were also present throughout patient mediastinal mass sections and lymph nodes, indicating that DCs are positioned to support human T-ALL growth as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that targeted therapies against DCs or their tumor-promoting signals would affect tumor growth at both primary and metastatic tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that IGF1R signaling was required for DC-mediated murine T-ALL growth in two molecularly distinct murine models of T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exon sequencing revealed that many LN3 tumors have activating Notch1 mutations, and some LMO2 tumors are also NOTCH-driven (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DCs and IGF1R signaling can promote survival of NOTCH-driven murine T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the LN3 and LMO2 tumors analyzed required DC-mediated support for survival in vitro, but some of the LN3 tumors did not have detectable activating mutations in Notch1, suggesting that DCs may also support growth of other molecular subsets of T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IGF1R activation is likely relevant to human T-ALL growth as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activating mutations in NOTCH1 have been reported in  greater than 50% of T-ALL cases (22), and activated NOTCH1 induces IGF1R expression in mouse and human T-ALL cells (35, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, IGF1R expression contributes to T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell activity in vivo, and inhibition of IGF1R signaling prolongs survival following transplantation of T-ALL in mice (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in other cancers have demonstrated that IGF1R signaling confers resistance to traditional therapies (49), providing a rationale for combining IGF1R-targeted therapy with standard treatments (e.g., chemotherapy and radiation) or in conjunction with inhibitors of other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we found that IGF1R signaling was necessary for DC-mediated T-ALL survival, other myeloid-derived factors likely contribute to T-ALL progression in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transwell assays revealed that T-ALL cells required close contact with tumor stroma to survive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because IGF1 is secreted, other transmembrane molecules may therefore mediate interactions between tumor cells and DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TumorDC interactions could promote localized delivery of IGF1 to T-ALL cells and/or could induce signaling through alternate mitogenic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, gene ontology (GO) analysis comparing tumor-associated versus WT thymic DCs revealed that tumor-associated DCs have increased expression of genes involved in response to wound healing (P = 21.4 × 1011) and inflammatory responses (P = 1.3 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these genes, which are associated with alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and TAMs (Chi3l3, Retnla, and Arg1), have been implicated in growth of several tumors (4, 50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like Igf1, these genes were up-regulated to a greater degree in the Sirp+ subset of thymic DCs, which are numerically expanded in thymic lymphomas (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that Sirp+ DCs are most capable of supporting T-ALL growth, although our data demonstrate that other myeloid cells likely contribute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, monocytes differentiated into M2 macrophages were shown to directly promote proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it will be important to evaluate the respective roles of tumor-associated Sirp+ and Sirp DCs, as well as other myeloid subsets in supporting T-ALL growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not clear why Pdgf genes expressed by tumor-associated DCs did not sustain activation of PDGFR in T-ALL cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Pdgfa and Pdgfb may not be expressed at sufficiently high levels, Pdgfc was expressed robustly by tumor-associated Sirp+ DCs; however, PDGF-C stimulates PDGFR and  heterodimers, instead of the PDGFR receptor found to be up-regulated on LN3 T-ALL cells (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, PDGF-C and -D block binding to PDGFR before their activation by extracellular proteolytic cleavage, which may not occur in in vitro DC cocultures (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tumor-associated DCs were not sufficient to sustain activation of PDGFR in cocultures, the receptor was phosphorylated in T-ALL cells analyzed ex vivo, indicating the tumor microenvironment activates PDGFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive vascularization and fibroblast/ECM networks were present in the aberrant T-ALL tumor microenvironment, and fibroblasts and endothelial cells may provide high levels of PDGFs and activating proteases in vivo (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, PDGFR signaling may be sustained by DCs and/or other tumor stromal subsets in the tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to T-ALL progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesize that PDGFR is also relevant to human T-ALL, because PDGFRB expression was elevated in a subset of T-ALL patient samples, and PDGFR was overexpressed on T-ALL cells in a primary patient lymph node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, PDGF receptors are up-regulated in mature T-cell lymphomas (5356), and a translocation involving PDGFRB has been identified in a T-ALL patient (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that PDGFR is up-regulated preferentially in ETP T-ALLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression profiling of WT thymocytes demonstrates that PDGR is normally expressed on ETPs and subsequently down-regulated as the cells differentiate (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, inappropriate maintenance of this growth factor receptor may contribute to tumorigenesis of the immature and aggressive ETP T-ALL subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, remission of a patient with refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma was recently achieved with a PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib (55), highlighting the potential of targeting PDGFR in other T-cell malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our studies demonstrate that DCs promote T-ALL survival through IGF1R activation in the absence of PDGFR signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas targeting PDGFR may be warranted in a subset of T-ALL patients with up-regulated receptors, PDGFR inhibition may be efficacious only in combination with other standard regimens or targeted agents, such as IGF1R inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we identify DCs as an endogenous cell type in the tumor microenvironment that becomes altered during T-ALL progression to gain the capacity to directly support tumor growth through IGF1R signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that (i) DCs from the tumor microenvironment directly support T-ALL survival, (ii) DCs are a source of IGF1 mitogenic signals that promote T-ALL survival, and (iii) PDGFR is up-regulated on an aggressive subset of human T-ALLs and is activated by the tumor microenvironment in two distinct murine T-ALL models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, DCs can prime antitumor adaptive immune responses; thus, different DC subsets likely have the opposing roles of either promoting T-ALL growth, as shown here, or controlling T-ALL growth via activation of antitumor immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important to determine which specific DC subsets directly support T-ALL growth, so as to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting these subsets and their tumor promoting signals in vivo, while leaving intact the capacity to mount antitumor immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings provide a strong rationale for further investigation of DC-mediated T-ALL growth to identify novel therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LN3 mice were provided by Tom Serwold, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6J and CD11c-EYFP [B6.Cg-Tg(Itgax-EYFP)1Mnz/J] mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LN3 and LMO2 (B6.CD2-Lmo2) (25) mice were euthanized upon lymphoma detection, as identified by enlarged lymph nodes, hunched posture, reduced motility, ruffled fur, and/or labored breathing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health (NICHD/NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UT Austin or the Animal Care and Use Committee at the NICHD/NIH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Notch1_Exon_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA was extracted from 5 × 106 WT thymocytes or primary LN3 T-ALL cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notch1 exons 26 and 27 were amplified with the following primer sets: 26 forward, 5-ACGGGAGGACCTAACCAAAC-3; 26 reverse, 5-CAGCTTGGTCTCCAACACCT-3; 27 forward, 5-CGCTGAGTGCTAAACACTGG-3; and 27 reverse, 5-GTTTTGCCTGCATGTACGTC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exon 34 was amplified in two fragments using the following primer sets: 34.1 forward, 5-GCTCCCTCATGTACCTCCTG-3; 34.1 reverse, 5-TAGTGGCCCCATCATGCTAT-3; 34.2 forward, 5-ATAGCATGATGGGGCCACTA-3; and 34.2 reverse, 5-CTTCACCCTGACCAGGAAAA-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These primer sets have been previously described (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly at the UT Austin Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology Genome Sequencing and Analysis Facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notch1 sequences from T-ALL were compared against those from WT thymocytes using the novoSNP analysis program (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cutoff score of 1 and F score of 1 were used to identify mutations that were then verified only if forward and reverse primers revealed the same mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ApE program (A plasmid Editor version 2.0.49 by M. Wayne Davis, University of Utah, Salt Lake City) was used for translating exon-sequencing results into protein sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Patient_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lymph node and mediastinal mass tissue samples from T-ALL patients were collected and provided by the Texas Childrens Hospital, and deidentified, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were provided for analysis with approval from the institutional review board committees at UT Austin and Texas Childrens Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining_and_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunostaining of murine tissue was performed on 7-m acetone-fixed cryosections according to standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following antibodies were used: anti-CD11c (N418), antiPan-Endothelial Cell Antigen (MECA-32), anti-fibroblast/ECM (ER-TR7), anti-Keratin5 (polyclonal; Covance), anti-Sirp (p84), antiPan-Cytokeratin (C-11), anti-Keratin8 (TROMA-1), anti-CD3 (17A2), and anti-PDGFR (APB5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect proliferation, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 20 min before euthanasia, and thymic cryosections were stained with anti-BrdU and anti-CD8 (53-6.7) per standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded patient tissue samples followed standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were incubated with: antiPan-Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), anti-CD11c (EP1347Y), and anti-PDGFR (28E1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies were detected with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch), or streptavidin (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images were acquired using an Axio Imager A1 microscope (Zeiss), with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss); Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 5×/0.16, Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.45, and Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 objectives; and AxioVision 4.8 software (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adobe Photoshop version 12.0 was used for overlays of fluorescent channels and to adjust exposure uniformly across the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Composite immunofluorescence images were acquired with an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon), a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Photometrics), and a 10×/0.3 CFI Plan Fluor objective (Nikon) and were stitched using NIS Elements 3.0 (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For thymic stromal subsets, WT and tumor-bearing thymi were enzymatically digested with a combination of Collagenase IV and Dispase as described (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell suspensions were immunostained with Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-1), anti-CD3 (145-2C11), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-TER-119 (TER-119), anti-CD31 (390), anti-EpCAM (G8.8), anti-Sirp (P84), anti-Ly-51 (6C3), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD80 (16-10A1), or anti-PDGFR (APB5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular phosphorylated protein levels were evaluated using the FIX & PERM (fixation and permeabilization) kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers methanol-modified protocol, and stained with anti-pPDGFR (J24-618), anti-pIGF1R (K74-218), or anti-pErk1/2 (20A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal concentrations of mouse IgG1 isotype antibodies (MOPC-21) were used as negative controls for intracellular staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viability for in vitro studies was assessed by flow cytometry with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI), and DNA content was assessed using DyeCycle Violet (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viable lymphoma cells were identified with anti-TCR (H57-957), anti-CD8a (53-6.7), anti-CD4 (RM4-5), and anti-CD3e (145-2C11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An LSRFortessa or a FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis and sorting, and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_Media  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complete cell culture media consisted of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RMPI 1640) supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, 55 M -mercaptoethanol, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1× penicillinstreptomycinglutamine (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, 292 g/mL glutamine), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Gibco), and 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Thermo Scientific HyClone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor__Stromal_Cocultures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cocultures of ex vivo lymphoma cells with bulk stroma isolated from tumors or WT thymi were prepared and cultured as previously described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, lymphoma cells were isolated by straining either thymic, lymph node, or splenic tumor-bearing tissue through a 40-m filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stromal cells were acquired by mincing tumor-bearing or WT tissue in complete RPMI on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragments were then suspended in 10 mL of complete RPMI and vortexed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After aggregates settled for 3 min, 7 mL of supernatant was replaced with fresh RPMI to deplete lymphoma cells in solution, and the aggregates were vortexed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was repeated a total of three times before remaining cells were counted; 5 × 105 lymphoma cells were then cultured alone, or 2.5 × 105 lymphoma cells were cultured with 2.5 × 105 bulk stromal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For transwell assays, 5 × 105 lymphoma cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a 0.4-m transwell insert dish (Corning Incorporated Costar), and 5 × 105 cells were seeded in the lower chambers; when both lymphoma cells and thymic tumor stromal cells were present in the lower chambers, they were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 2.5 × 105 cells each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For cocultures of tumor cells with FACS-sorted thymic stromal subsets, 2 × 106 T-ALL cells were cultured with sorted stromal subsets (5 × 105 All Stroma, 5 × 105 depleted populations, 2.5 × 105 sorted myeloid, 1 × 105 sorted DCs, or 1 × 105 sorted CD11cCD11b+ cells) in 1 mL of RPMI in 48-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enriched DCs from tumors and WT tissue were isolated from tissue using biotinylated anti-CD11c (N418) and streptavidin microbeads with MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myeloid cells were further depleted using biotinylated anti-CD11b (M1/70), as indicated; 2 × 106 lymphoma cells were cultured alone or with 1 × 105 DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DC purities were determined by flow cytometry using anti-biotin (Bio3-18E7), anti-Sirp (P84), and anti-I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IGF1_ELISA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DCs were enriched from WT thymi or LN3 thymic lymphomas, as described in Tumor: Stromal Cocultures; 1 × 105 DCs or T-ALL cells were then plated in 250 L in 48-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were collected after 24 h and snap frozen at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IGF1 levels were measured using a sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturers protocol (RayBiotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibitor_and_siRNA_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IGF1R inhibitors picropodophyllin (EMD Millipore), tyrphostin AG-1024, and BMS-754807 (Selleckchem) were resuspended in DMSO according to the manufacturers protocols for use in cell cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal volumes of DMSO were used as vehicle controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IGF1R siRNA knockdown experiments, 2 × 106 T-ALL cells with 1 × 105 DCs were cultured for 24 h in 0.4 mL and then treated with 2.5 M Accell IGF1R-targeted SMARTpool siRNA or Accell Nontargeting Pool siRNA for an additional 6 d according to the manufacturers protocol (Dharmacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Photon_Fluorescence_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-photon imaging of thymocytes or tumor cells migrating within thymic slices was carried out as described previously (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 400-m thymic slices from CD11c-EYFP transgenic mice (28) were prepared using a vibratome (Leica), and WT thymocytes or LN3 tumor cells, labeled with CellTracker CMTPX Red or CMF2HC Blue (Invitrogen), were incubated with thymic slices for 14 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired every 15 s, through a depth of 40 m, in 5-m intervals with an Ultima IV microscope (Prairie) equipped with two MaiTai lasers (Spectra-Physics) and PrairieView acquisition software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation wavelengths of 840 nm, or 740 and 900 nm for three-color imaging, were used; 480/40, 535/50, and 607/45 bandpass filters (Chroma Technology) were used for detection of CMF2HC, EYFP, and CMTPX fluorescence, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaris software version 7.6 (Bitplane) was used for cell tracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular interactions were scored when the distance between cell surfaces was less than 3 m. The percentage of time contacting DCs equals the percentage of all tracked time points in which a cell contacts a DC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dwell time equals the total time during which thymocytes contact DCs in consecutive time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Gene_Expression_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome-wide expression analysis was performed on T-ALL cells and DC subsets sorted from LN3 thymic tumors using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (n = 3, LN3 tumor Sirp+ DCs and Sirp DCs; n = 3, T-ALL cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported expression profiling of WT thymic DCs and thymocytes (32, 60) [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE34723 and GSE56928]; 1 g of total RNA from 3 × 104 sorted tumor-associated Sirp+ DCs, Sirp DCs, or T-ALL cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized according to the manufacturers specifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were uploaded to Gene Expression Commons (32) for normalization and analysis; an in silico model containing these datasets, along with WT thymocytes and DCs from C57BL/6J mice at 6 mo of age, is available in Gene Expression Commons (https://gexc.stanford.edu/models/1118/genes); the data have also been deposited in GEO (GSE54609).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hierarchical clustering (Euclidean complete with average linkage), we used R package Easy Microarray data Analysis (EMA) (61) to cluster thymic 6-mo WT or tumor-associated LN3 DC subsets, WT CD4+CD8 thymocytes, and the following peripheral myeloid subsets: common myeloid progenitors (CMP), CD8+ DCs, CD8 DCs, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), monocytes, BM macrophages (BM Mac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and peritoneal macrophages (Mac.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference datasets were downloaded from GEO (accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE10246 and GSE34723) (31, 32) and normalized with thymic DC datasets using GC robust multi-array average (GCRMA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO analyses were carried out using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Database (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human T-ALL gene expression datasets were generated with Affymetrix U133A chips and comprised ETP and non-ETP cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CEL files were kindly provided by Charles Mullighan from cases at St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, and have been previously described (GEO accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE33315) (25, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray data were normalized using the Robust MultiChip Averaging (RMA) algorithm (58), as implemented in the Bioconductor package Affy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pairwise group comparisons, we used t test in the Limma package (59) in Bioconductor to identify differentially expressed probe sets between ETP and non-ETP cases under comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implementation of t test in Limma uses an empirical Bayes method to moderate the SEs of the estimated log-fold changes, and P values were corrected using the false-discovery method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical significance was determined with one sample, paired and unpaired Students t tests using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
