Galápagos hydroclimate of the Common Era from paired microalgal and mangrove biomarker 2H/1H values  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The equatorial Pacific is centrally important in Earths climate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes there cause disruptions to global economies and food and water security.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, projected tropical precipitation changes in response to higher greenhouse gas concentrations remain uncertain, due in part to a scarcity of paleoclimate records to validate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore applied a new method in Galápagos lakes for reconstructing rainfall and salinity using sedimentary lipids from microalgae and mangrove trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data revise the understanding of changes over the Common Era to provide a spatially and temporally coherent view of tropical Pacific rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We separate convergence zone from El Niño-driven changes and observe substantial fluctuations even in the absence of perturbations as large as current anthropogenic forcing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropical maritime precipitation affects global atmospheric circulation, influencing storm tracks and the size and location of subtropical deserts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paleoclimate evidence suggests centuries-long changes in rainfall in the tropical Pacific over the past 2,000 y, but these remain poorly characterized across most of the ocean where long, continuous proxy records capable of resolving decadal-to-centennial climate changes are still virtually nonexistent despite substantial efforts to develop them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we apply a new climate proxy based on paired hydrogen isotope ratios from microalgal and mangrove-derived sedimentary lipids in the Galápagos to reconstruct maritime precipitation changes during the Common Era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that increased rainfall during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (14001850 CE) was likely caused by a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and that this shift occurred later than previously recognized, coeval with dynamically linked precipitation changes in South America and the western tropical Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the LIA, we show that drier conditions at the onset of the Medieval Warm Period (8001300 CE) and wetter conditions ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 ka were caused by changes in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the large natural variations in tropical rainfall we detect, each linked to a multicentury perturbation of either ENSO-like variability or the ITCZ, imply a high sensitivity of tropical Pacific rainfall to climate forcings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Precipitation data and base map for Isabela lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Average wet- (FebruaryApril) and (B) dry-season (AugustOctober) precipitation (19972008; NASA GPCP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locations: Galápagos (star), Cariaco Basin (diamond), Lake Pumacocha (square), Makassar Straight (circle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Niño1+2 precipitation anomaly shows influence of eastern Pacific El Niño and La Niña events on Galápagos precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anomalies in figure are the difference between years where Niño 1+2  1 °C and years where Niño 1+2 less_than 1 °C (dataset from A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison between Niño 1+2 and Niño 3.4 is shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Map shows locations of Isabela Island lakes within the Galápagos archipelago (Map data: Google, DigitalGlobe) and coring locations in each lake (Diablas, red; Verdes, green; Escondida, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bnb, Bainbridge Crater; EJ, El Junco Lake; Is, Isabela lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison between Niño 1+2 and Niño 3.4 precipitation anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Niño 1+2 precipitation anomaly as shown in Fig 1C, or the difference between years where Niño 1+2  1 °C and years where Niño 1+2 less_than 1 °C (dataset from Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) As in A, but for Niño 3.4 index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Galápagos to eastern Pacific El Niño events but also demonstrate that the region is sensitive to ENSO activity as defined by both indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Site_Characterization_and_Sedimentology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface water 2H values were 13, 10, and 4 for Poza de las Diablas, Pozas Verdes, and Poza Escondida, respectively, with corresponding 18O values of 2.4, 2.6, and 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the water level in each of these systems changes daily with the tides, indicating active connections to the sea, the modern salinities in Poza de las Diablas (7 gL1), Poza Escondida (33 gL1), and Pozas Verdes (44 gL1) indicate variable inputs of freshwater and seawater as well as degrees of evaporative enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poza de las Diablas sediments were pink cyanobacterial deposits and contained few lithological changes between the sedimentwater interface and 340-cm depth (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediments from Poza Escondida were mangrove peat throughout the entire 83-cm recovered sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pozas Verdes surface sediments were light tan in color and composed of gelatinous material with minimal sedimentary structure to a depth of 50 cm, below which sediments transitioned to mangrove peat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronological uncertainty varied due to combined analytical and calibration errors but averaged 36 ± 16 y for all sediment samples in all lakes based on Monte Carlo simulations (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biomarkers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biomarker distribution in Poza de las Diablas sediments primarily included nC24-alkanol and compounds that were tentatively identified as glycolipids based on comparison with published mass spectra from Ace Lake, Antarctica sediments (17) and also as described from Lake Malawi (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nC24-alkanol in Diablas sediment was interpreted as a degradation product of the glycolipids and used as a cyanobacterial marker in this system, based on interpretation of ion fragments in the glycolipid mass spectra and the relationships described from Ace Lake (Supporting Information) (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taraxerol was used as a biomarker for Rhizophora mangroves in the Diablas, Verdes, and Escondida catchments (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this location these mangroves are the sole source of this triterpenoid, making it much more specific than more commonly used higher plant leaf wax n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids that are produced by all vascular plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dinosterol, a dinoflagellate biomarker (20), was used as a secondary algal compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poza de las Diablas 2HDino, 2HTarax, and 2HC24OL values show generally consistent patterns, with negative trends from 13501850 CE, positive trends after 1800 CE, and average 2H values that are 79 more depleted between 16001850 CE than those from after 1900 CE (Fig 2 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field survey data show that salinity effects dominate over other factors for algal lipids at global scale (15), but changes in temperature, humidity, growth rate, and biological sources can also alter 2H/1H fractionation in algae and higher plants (12, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, temperature and humidity changes at sea level are likely to have been small in the Galápagos given limited modern seasonal and interannual changes compared with precipitation (Supporting Information and Table S1) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High relative humidity also limits the impact of transpiration on 2HTarax values (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variable biological sources are unlikely to be a factor given the source specificity of the targeted biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional factors, such as nutrient or light-induced growth rate changes, would not be expected to similarly influence all lipid producers, leaving changing 2HWater values as the most probable remaining mechanism to explain temporal changes in lipid 2H values in Poza de las Diablas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taraxerol and dinosterol 2H values from Poza Escondida and Pozas Verdes share the major features described in the Poza de las Diablas 2H values, with the exception of post-1800 CE Pozas Verdes taraxerol values, which were highly variable (Fig 2 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may indicate increased importance of salinity changes in this lake, which receives limited freshwater input as evidenced by modern hypersaline conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lake-Water_Isotope_and_Salinity_Reconstructions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
2HTarax and 2HC24OL values were used to calculate original source water salinity and 2HWater values by combining the definition of the fractionation factor,  = (2HLipid + 1)/(2HWater + 1), with   salinity calibrations for each lipid to describe paired systems that were solved directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, mTarax * salinity + bTarax = (2HTarax + 1)/(2HWater + 1), and mC24OL * salinity + bC24OL = (2HC24OL + 1)/(2HWater + 1), where m and b are the respective slope and intercept for each lipid calibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify uncertainties arising from the measurements as well as the calibrations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of this reconstruction with an independent diatom-based salinity record from different sediment cores from the same lake shows that both are entirely overlapping within their respective uncertainties and indicates maximum salinities of about 12 gL1 ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1400 CE (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effectively cross-validates both methods and supports the fidelity of the new 2HWater record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reconstructed_Lake-Water_Changes_and_Mechanisms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combined 2,000-y salinity record (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4) decreases from 14.3 ± 4.0 to 5.8 ± 4.0 gL1 from 100 to 600 CE, then increases to 12.9 ± 3.0 gL1 by 1400 CE, and finally decreases to reach measured values in June 2008 of 7.4 gL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2HWater values increased from 9.8 ± 8.9 to 17.5 ± 8.9 between 0 and 700 CE, where they remained elevated until declining from 19.1 ± 5.5 to 10.3 ± 5.0 between 1200 and 1350 CE, followed by an increase to 17.6 ± 5.4 by 1500 CE, a drop to 1.6 ± 5.0 at 1800 CE, and a final increase to the June 2008 value of 13.5 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most striking features of the salinity and 2HWater records are the prolonged opposing trends before the Little Ice Age (LIA), which are difficult to explain in the context of changing precipitation balance alone, because wetter or drier conditions would be expected to cause concurrent decreases or increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing El Niño frequency, intensity, or centennial-scale mean state shifts are mechanisms that would allow for these patterns to coexist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although chronological uncertainty prevents distinguishing between these, all would explain the observations because El Niño events are associated with increased precipitation and lowered 2H values (4, 5) as well as increases in sea level of up to 400 mm in the Galápagos (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, reduced El Niño activity would cause reduced fluxes of both seawater and precipitation to the lake, higher 2H values of precipitation and runoff, and increased evaporative enrichment of the lake water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposing salinity and 2HWater trends are therefore interpreted as periods when ENSO-like variability was the dominant control on precipitation in the eastern equatorial Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intervals where 2HWater changes occur without opposing shifts in salinity require another mechanism, which is provided by differences in rainfall associated with additional impacts of changes in ITCZ latitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would alter precipitation patterns, but the passage of the ITCZ is not associated with large modifications in sea level (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation was evaluated using a mass balance model to confirm that reconstructed salinity and 2HWater values are attainable with realistic variations in precipitation and seawater influx alone (Supporting Information and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Other_Factors_Affecting_Seawater_Connectivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the relationship between climate and lake-water chemistry, changes in coastal geomorphology, island subsidence, seismic uplift events, sediment accumulation in the lake, and eustatic sea level also have the potential to affect the difference in elevation between the lake floor and local sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in considering the likely impact of each of these factors on the sediments, none can as plausibly explain the divergent relationship between salinity and 2HWater values, or the centennial and shorter-scale variability in the reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If coastal processes caused significant seawater incursions, or if seismic uplift events occurred, these would likely have resulted in step changes in the sediment character and deposition rates and caused disconformities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abrupt changes in sediment lithology did occur in Poza Diablas sediments before 2 ka, suggesting possible tectonic or morphological changes before this time, and as a consequence the hydroclimate reconstructions are not extended further despite the fact that the sediment sequence is much longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 ka no lithological disturbances were observed (Fig S2) even though large uplift events have occurred in other areas of the Galápagos in recorded history, including the 4.5-m uplift in Urvina Bay in 1954 (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Poza de las Diablas sector of Isabela Island is subsiding at 0.46 mmy1 (29), but average sedimentation rates over the past 2,000 y have been 1.7mm y1, and modeled eustatic sea level has steadily declined 0.075 mmy1 over the same interval (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these processes yields an estimated lake floor to sea level difference ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 ka that was 2.6 m smaller than the modern difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these potential nonclimate mechanisms for altering the seawater connection are unidirectional, and therefore they cannot account for decadal and centennial-scale fluctuations in both signals, and they also do not explain the divergent salinity and 2HWater values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Galápagos_Hydroclimate_of_the_Common_Era  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the interpretation framework based on sea level and precipitation changes, the major features of the reconstructed salinity and 2HWater values from Poza de las Diablas before 1550 CE are interpreted in the context of a dominant role for ENSO-like patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with adjacent time intervals, low 2HWater values (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 4A) and high salinity (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B and 4B) from 0400 CE and 12001400 CE are taken to indicate stronger or more frequent El Niño events or a more El Niño-like mean state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low salinity with high 2HWater values from 5001000 CE, and decreasing salinity with increasing 2HWater values from 14001500 CE are interpreted to indicate drier conditions resulting in reduced El Niño-like conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Declining 2HWater values occurred without synchronous salinity increases from 15501850 CE, suggesting added impacts from the ITCZ (Supporting Information and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Poza de las Diablas data provide a critical compliment to existing Galápagos hydroclimate records from the last 2,000 y, in particular to a number of records from El Junco Lake in the highlands of San Cristobal Island (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diablas age model uncertainty averages 40 y, and is similar to that from El Junco (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, comparisons between these and other sites are limited to centennial scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major features of the Poza de las Diablas record before 1550 CE (Fig 3 A and B) are consistent with ENSO changes identified from El Junco sand content (5) (Fig 3C), 2H values of botryococcene lipids (Fig 3D) (7, 8), and 2H values of dinosterol (4) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ENSO patterns are also consistent with interpretations of sediment lithology changes identified from Bainbridge Crater (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence for wetter conditions at Poza de las Diablas in response to ITCZ changes from 15501850 CE are less consistent with other records in the Galápagos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rainfall indices (Fig 3 DF) calculated from El Junco biomarker 2H data do not indicate an ITCZ response (4) despite the fact that lower botryococcene 2H values from El Junco beginning as early as 750 CE were previously interpreted as evidence for a southward ITCZ shift (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The El Junco sand record also displays few changes after 1550 CE apart from the anthropogenic disturbances near the core top (Fig 3C) (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent discrepancies suggest differences in climate between the highlands and lowlands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the 670-m elevation of El Junco Lake, for reasons that are not well understood, Galápagos highlands receive the majority of annual precipitation as frequent light rains in the cool season when the ITCZ is furthest north and the lowlands remain dry (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highland sites also receive 26 ± 16% of cool season rainfall from direct cloud water interception associated with garua fog (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes to the intensity and or distribution of either of these moisture sources may have altered the hydrologic balance of El Junco in ways that did not manifest equally in the sand and biomarker isotope records and may have caused an earlier onset of wetter conditions (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, lowland sites are not affected by these complexities and may therefore serve as better locations to detect canonical ITCZ precipitation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Regional_Significance_of_Observed_Changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The later onset of wetter conditions and shorter duration of the LIA response detected at Poza de las Diablas compared with El Junco agrees more closely with the timing and duration of the southward ITCZ shift identified in titanium concentrations in the Cariaco Basin (9) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased South American summer monsoon precipitation associated with the LIA ITCZ changes inferred from sedimentary calcite 18O values (31) also demonstrate the direct regional temporal coherence of this response (Fig 4E), as do cave and terrestrial runoff records (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is consistent with dynamical arguments that the mean ITCZ latitude is regulated by the meridional temperature gradient (34, 35), with lowest northern hemisphere temperatures of the last 1.7 thousand years occurring in the core LIA ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16501750 CE (36) (Fig 4F), coincident with changing 2Hwater values in Poza de las Diablas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western Pacific seawater 18O values were also low in the Makassar Straight in Indonesia within the primary LIA interval, indicating wetter conditions (37) (Fig 4C) and basin-wide zonal precipitation symmetry, consistent with an ITCZ mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This record also offers additional support for the proposed ENSO-like patterns identified in Poza de las Diablas through opposing, zonally asymmetric changes in water isotope values that imply drier conditions from 0 to 400 CE when Diablas was wet, wetter conditions from 5001000 CE when Diablas was dry, and drier conditions from 12001400 CE when Diablas was wet (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applied here for the first time to our knowledge are new hydroclimate proxies based on 2H values of paired microalgal and mangrove-biomarkers tailored to high-accumulation-rate saline coastal lakes that are common in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are in broad agreement with previous results but offer several important insights on tropical hydroclimate over the Common Era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data confirm that maritime precipitation increased during the LIA and are consistent with a southward ITCZ shift but also reconcile the timing of these changes to show temporal synchronicity across the Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data also show that before the LIA, ENSO-like mechanisms were more important than the ITCZ in regulating decadal-to-centennial-scale maritime rainfall patterns in the eastern tropical Pacific, highlighting the unique nature of the LIA in the context of the past 2,000 y, and confirming the capacity for multidecadal and longer timescale changes in ENSO-like variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides an important complement to subannually resolved reconstructions from short-lived corals (38) or mollusks (39) that are ideally suited for detecting changes in ENSO variance but lack the continuous duration to assess long timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centennial-scale changes in both ENSO mean state and ITCZ dynamics that characterized the last 2,000 y highlight the importance of adequately capturing these climate modes in future climate projections forced by a radiative perturbation far in excess of any that occurred in the last 2,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment cores were collected from the lakes on southern Isabela Island in June 2008 with a universal corer (Aquatic Research) and a Livingstone-type piston corer (Geo-Core).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface cores were sectioned in the field at 1-cm intervals, and remaining cores were split longitudinally after transport to the University of Washington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, an 8.79-m continuous sediment sequence was recovered from Poza de las Diablas, 5.4 m from Pozas Verdes, and 83 cm from Poza Escondida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake water was filtered onto combusted 0.7-m-pore-size glass fiber filters and aquatic and terrestrial vegetation samples were collected to aid in the interpretation of down-core geochemical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface water isotope samples were also collected from each lake and analyzed at Georgia Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Kim Cobb by cavity ring-down spectroscopy with a Picarro water isotope analyzer (Picarro Inc.) using standard methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake-water temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, and temperature were recorded on-site using a portable data sonde (Geo Scientific Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sediment_Age_Control  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sediment cores were split, photographed, and described at the University of Washington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terrestrial macrofossils and bulk sediment total organic carbon were used for radiocarbon dating (Fig S4 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were sent to the Xian Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Centre at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, or to Direct AMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples analyzed by Direct AMS were pretreated at the University of Washington following an acidbaseacid procedure (40), whereas samples sent to the Xian laboratory were pretreated at that facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiocarbon ages were calibrated using SH13 (41) and the bomb curve extension (42) in Calib 7.0 (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-depth models were constructed for each lake using the median calibrated age and applying a monotone piecewise cubic interpolation function (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronological uncertainty was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations to generate 1,000 realizations of alternative age-depth models for each lake that incorporate the non-Gaussian probability density function of each calibrated radiocarbon age (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biomarker_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsamples (1 to 2 cm thick) were removed from split cores or from sectioned material for lipid analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were transferred to combusted glass vials, frozen, and then freeze-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dry material was extracted in 9:1 dichloromethane and methanol (MeOH) on an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE) 200 (Dionex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before extraction, nC21-alcohol (1-heneicosanol), nC21-acid (heneicosanoic acid), and nC36-alkane (hexatriacontane) quantification/recovery standards were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ASE was operated at 100 °C and 1,500 psi with three 5-min static phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solvent was evaporated under N2 from the total lipid extract (TLE) (Turbo-vap; Caliper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial set of 45 samples was analyzed, 20 additional samples were extracted following a modified protocol that included saponification of the TLE to improve compound yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saponification was performed using 1 N potassium hydroxide in MeOH and Nanopure water (Barnstead Nanopure Infinity water system; Thermo-Fisher) at 70 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The saponified TLE was acidified to pH 2 with HCl, recovered from the aqueous MeOH using hexane liquidliquid extractions, rinsed once with Nanopure water, and dried over sodium sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alcohol and polar fractions were isolated with column chromatography following published methods (15, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers were identified from subsamples that were either silylated [20 L N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and 20 L pyridine, at 60 °C for 60 min] or acetylated (20 L acetic anhydride and 20 L pyridine, at 70 °C for 30 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derivatized aliquots were evaporated to dryness under N2 and dissolved in toluene, and a 5-cholestane quantification standard was added to the samples before analysis by GC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were injected in splitless mode at 300 °C using helium carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min on an Agilent 6890N GC with 5975 inert mass selective detector equipped with an Agilent (formerly Varian) VF-17ms column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oven program began at 110 °C for sample injection, then increased to 170 °C at 15 °C/min, then to 325 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 24 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcohol fractions were acetylated and analyzed by GC-MS following the same procedure and compounds were identified by comparison with literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsamples of acetylated alcohol fractions were taken for later hydrogen isotope analysis of the compounds present at highest abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcohol fractions that contained dinosterol (4, 23, 24-trimethyl-5-cholest-22E-en-3-ol), and some that contained taraxerol (3-d-friedoolean-14-en-3-ol), were further purified using HPLC-MS following published methods (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2H values of acetylated dinosterol and taraxerol were analyzed following published methods (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nC24-alkanol (1-tetracosanol) 2H values were analyzed similarly, but for these the GC oven was held at an initial temperature of 120 °C for 10 min, then increased to 325 °C at 8 °C/min and held for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were corrected for the hydrogen added during acetylation following published methods (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An overall analytical uncertainty for each compound was calculated from the pooled uncertainty of replicate analyses conducted across multiple days in most cases (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were 4.0, 4.4, and 4.8 for dinosterol, taraxerol, and C24 n-alkanol from Poza de las Diablas; 4.4 and 5.1 for dinosterol and taraxerol from Pozas Verdes; and 4.7 for taraxerol from Poza Escondida (Fig S3 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Salinity_and_Water_2Hwater_Reconstructions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The opposing salinity sensitivities but common 2HWater responses for microalgal and mangrove lipids were used to calculate down-core salinity and 2HWater values from Poza de las Diablas sediments for the past 1,350 y using taraxerol (2HTarax) and nC24-alkanol (2HC24OL) values (Fig 2, Fig S3, and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific or sufficiently detailed salinity calibrations for each compound are unavailable, so these relationships were established by combining literature values with measurements from the modern environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of salinity sensitivities for 2H/1H fractionation was applied for each compound that encompass those from existing studies of similar compounds, or 0.4 to 2.2 for algae and 0.7 to 1.7 for mangroves (1316, 46, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were combined with core-top sediment lipid values and measured lake-water salinity and 2H values to calculate a regression equation for the sensitivity of biosynthetic 2H/1H fractionation to salinity for each compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1,000) were used to account for calibration uncertainty, as well as the analytical uncertainty in the lipid 2H values, and the calibrated radiocarbon ages (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although alkenone batch cultures from pelagic species have suggested greater salinity sensitivity for 2H/1H fractionation than our assumed range (50), no similarly large effect has been observed in coastal or inland species or samples, and there is debate about the use of hydrogen isotope values from multiple compound C37 alkenone chromatographic peaks, as well as the use of batch cultures for this purpose (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salinity and 2H values of lake water were calculated by starting with the definition of the fractionation factor, , as (2HLipid + 1)/(2HWater + 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was substituted into   salinity regression equations for taraxerol and nC24-alkanol:mTarax*salinity+bTarax=(2HTarax+1)/(2HWater+1),mC24OL*salinity+bC24OL=(2HC24OL+1)/(2HWater+1),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where mx and bx are the respective slope and intercept values of the -salinity relationships for each lipid, 2HWater is the unknown 2H value of the lake water, and 2HTarax and 2HC24OL are the values from the sediment biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intercept value for each compound (bx) was calculated using the definition of  and the modern 2HWater value as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2HTarax and 2HC24OL were measured, leaving two equations with two unknowns, 2HWater and salinity, which were solved for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2HWater values were also calculated using the 2HC24OL data and salinity calibration using a diatom-based salinity reconstruction (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear interpolation was used to map the higher temporally resolved signal onto the age scale of the lower temporally resolved signal for calculations that used two measurements that were not made on the same sediment sample, as was the case for all diatom-biomarker pairings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuous 2,000-y records shown in Fig 4 were produced by splicing the 2HTarax and 2HC24OL-based salinity and 2HWater reconstructions with the diatom and 2HC24OL-based salinity and 2HWater reconstructions (splice point between 1140 and 1160 CE) as well as the measured lake-water data from 2008 CE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach was selected over an averaging procedure to minimize dampening variability in the records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Sedimentology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The upper sediment sequence from Poza de las Diablas (0 to 340 cm) consisted of pink, gelatinous cyanobacterial to clay matrix material with white nodules or clasts and no distinct layering (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were restricted to sediments above this interval to avoid complications from potentially large changes in lake basin geomorphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median calibrated age model for Poza de las Diablas indicates sedimentation rates between 1 and 3 mm/y (Fig S4), with higher rates ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 ka that gradually declined toward the most recent sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is 3 y of deposition for each 1-cm-thick layer in the early part of the record increasing to 10 y per 1-cm-thick layer in the most recent sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agedepth relationships from the cores collected for this study are consistent with those from previous work conducted on this lake (25) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median agedepth relationships from Pozas Verdes and Poza Escondida were also in stratigraphic order and consistent with age-depth relationships from the two separate core chronologies from Poza de las Diablas (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sufficient terrestrial plant macrofossils were present for radiocarbon dating in Poza de las Diablas, but the sediments did not resemble mangrove peat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to different sediment cores from Poza de las Diablas used for a diatom study (25), which were characterized by two distinct lithologies with a readily identified visual boundary at 145 cm below the modern sedimentwater interface that divided the upper cyanobacterial sediments from underlying mangrove peat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this significant lithological transition and associated bulk sediment geochemical changes in these cores, sedimentation rates did not change across this boundary, and a more detailed follow-up assessment of this interval based on these samples found no evidence for whole ecosystem scale changes at this time (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biomarker_Identification_and_Source_Attribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The distribution of lipids in the Poza de las Diablas sediments were limited to a relatively small number of dominant compounds that included middle-chain-length aliphatic alcohols (primarily nC24), taraxerol, and compounds identified as glycolipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional compounds, including dinosterol, were not present above the detection limit at sample concentrations required to avoid severely overloading the dominant nC24-alkanol and glycolipid GC-MS peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to Antarctic glycolipids, which contained a fragment at m/z 368 characteristic of a C22 aliphatic side chain, side-chain mass fragments in the dominant Diablas glyclolipids were m/z 396, corresponding to a C24 chain length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compound was therefore tentatively identified as tetracosanyl 3-O-methyl--rhamnopyranoside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycolipid abundance varied between chromatograms in proportion to the abundance of the middle chain length (C24 and C26) n-alkanols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these observations, the sediment lithology, and following the interpretation of similar depositional patterns from Ace Lake (17), the presence of middle-chain-length n-alkanols in the Diablas sediments was attributed to degradation of cyanobacteria glycolipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although dinosterol was identified in some sediment samples from Poza de las Diablas, concentrations were low relative to other coeluting compounds and were typically only detectible above background through selective ion extraction from the total ion chromatogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, dinosterol concentrations were highest near the sedimentwater interface and diminished gradually with depth, and no dinosterol was detected in sediments deposited before 1000 CE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dinosterol and taraxerol were both present in the Pozas Verdes sediment samples that were analyzed, but, similar to Poza de las Diablas, dinosterol abundance was very low and intermittent with depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycolipids were also found in the Pozas Verdes samples, but here these were not dominant compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poza Escondida sediments contained abundant taraxerol but minimum dinosterol and no glycolipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the relative abundances of available compounds in the lakes used in this study, the nC24-alkanol degradation product of cyanobacteria glycolipids was used as the primary microalgal biomarker from Poza de las Diablas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dinosterol hydrogen isotope values were also measured where possible because it has been the target of detailed calibration work (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dinosterol in Poza de las Diablas surface sediment and suspended particles exhibited an anomalous relationship between hydrogen isotope fractionation and salinity (15), suggesting that dinosterol H values in this system should be limited to qualitative applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Humidity_Effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reconstructed lake-water 2H values are interpreted to primarily reflect changes in the relative proportions of freshwater vs. seawater and changes in the 2H value of precipitation, rather than changes in the magnitude of isotopic fractionation that occurs during evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires that changes in humidity be small compared with changes in precipitation and precipitation 2H values (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is supported by the limited extent of annual and interannual changes in available station data (Table S1) (23), which demonstrates that large precipitation changes have historically not been associated with large humidity changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These limited changes are likely regulated by the close proximity of the sites to the vast equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the hypothetical circumstance that humidity values were to change appreciably with precipitation, it is likely that the effect would move the lake-water 2H values in the same direction as precipitation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effects of evaporative enrichment are initially larger at higher humidity, the capacity for enrichment also saturates more quickly as evaporation progresses, such that the maximum degree of isotopic enrichment increases as humidity decreases (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the total fraction of lake water evaporated will be greater when humidity is lower, leading to overall increased lake-water evaporative enrichment at lower humidity, and decreased evaporative enrichment at higher humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If humidity were to increase at Poza de las Diablas, and all other factors were held constant, the result would likely be decreased lake-water 2H values and decreased salinity in response to reduced evaporation and evaporative enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would move the lake-water 2H values in the same direction as an increase in precipitation, which would increase the volume flux of the freshwater end member while reducing its 2H value (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that humidity increased with increased precipitation, as opposed to decreasing, the combined effects on the lake water would be additive and lead to more depleted lake-water 2H values than would be caused by either humidity or precipitation changes alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, decreased humidity associated with reduced precipitation would have the opposite effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_for_Interpretation_of_Down-Core_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A monthly iterative mass balance model was used to evaluate the plausibility of the interpretations of reconstructed salinity and 2HWater values in the context of ITCZ and ENSO changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unit areas were assumed for the lake and catchment, such that the sum of freshwater inputs was equal to double the rate of direct on-lake precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seawater inflow represented a third input, and loss terms were included for evaporation and outflow, which was permitted when lake depth exceeded 1 m. The water budget of the lake was therefore described asdVLake/dt=P+I+SWEO,[S1]where VLake is the unit area lake volume (i.e., depth), t is time, P is the precipitation input, I is inflow, SW is the seawater input, E is the water lost by evaporation, and O is the outflow, which was calculated to maintain the spill depth at 1 m. The salt and 2HWater budgets of the lake were described in separate equations by including these terms in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1:d(VLakeSLake)/dt=PSP+ISI+SWSSWESEOSo,[S2]d(VLake2HLake)/dt=P2HP+I2HI+SW2HSWE2HEO2Ho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Measured salinity and 2HWater values from June 2008 seawater (S = 34.3 gL1, 2HWater = 2.7) and lake water (S = 7.4 gL1, 2HWater = 13.2) were used to set initial conditions, and seawater was assumed to be constant over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To constrain the hydrogen isotopic composition of evaporating moisture (2HE), equilibrium and kinetic fractionations were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium fractionation for hydrogen [eq; eq = (eq 1)*1,000] was calculated from annual mean temperature (T) (Table S1) (56):eq=e24.844T210376.248T+52.612103.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]The kinetic fractionation for hydrogen was calculated from annual mean humidity (h) (Table S1) (54, 57):k=12.5(1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]Temperature and relative humidity values were obtained from weather station data at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island (2 m above sea level) (www.darwinfoundation.org/en/) (Table S1) and were held at fixed values over all modeling exercises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation data were also obtained from this source, but this and the seawater input were changed in some modeling exercises to test interpretive models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fixed evaporation rate of 1.83 mm/d was used, taken from the mean value in the gridded data product from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society Forecast Division ECHAM5 T42 History ensemble (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2H value of atmospheric vapor was assumed to be at equilibrium with seawater (2HA  2HSW  eq) (57) and was used to calculate the 2HE value (53, 57):2HE=[eq2HWaterh2HA(eq+k)]/(1h+103k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]The salinity and 2H value of outflow were assumed to equal mixed lake water, and evaporating water was assumed to be freshwater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation and inflow were also assumed to be freshwater, but 2H values of these inputs were calculated from the precipitation rate for different model scenarios based on the amount effect relationship between monthly mean precipitation totals and 2H values from the Pacific Island stations on Yap, Wake, Chuuk, Guam, and the Galápagos (R2 = 0.84) (55, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was run at monthly time steps, with calculated lake-water values from the previous month serving as the initial values for the following month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was run for 80 mo for all scenarios, which allowed the lake to reach stable salinity and 2H values (i.e., equilibrium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With modern climatological inputs, 17% of inflow water must be seawater to maintain lake-water salinity and 2H values comparable to observations (Table S2), a realistic value given the site characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values characteristic of reconstructed LIA lake water were achieved by increasing precipitation from 1.29 mm/d to 6.04 mm/d, maintaining seawater inflow at 17% and holding temperature and humidity constant (Table S2)a hydrological regime consistent with a southward-shifted ITCZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a regime is expected to be characterized by (i) increased precipitation, (ii) decreased precipitation 2H values, and (iii) minimal change in the relative proportion of seawater inflow to the lagoon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a precipitation rate of 6.04 mm/d is wetter than present for the Galápagos, this is still less precipitation than is received at the Pacific Island stations on Yap (8.17 mm/d), Chuuk (9.76 mm/d), and Guam (7.28 mm/d) today (59) and is therefore not unreasonably large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying a similar approach to other time periods in the records of reconstructed salinity and 2H values also demonstrates that these changes are consistent with the proposed mechanisms (Table S2) while still realistic in terms of the magnitude of change required (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed mapping of the lake catchment and it morphometry would be required to further constrain the fluxes of freshwater and seawater into the lake, and longer-term monitoring of lake salinity and 2H-water would be needed to reconstruct precipitation rates in the past (57, 60), but this simple model demonstrates that the lake-water salinity and 2H values reconstructed from Poza de las Diablas sediments, and their interpretation in terms of climate, are plausible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
