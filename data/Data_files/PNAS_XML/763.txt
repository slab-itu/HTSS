Carbohydrate microarrays and their use for the identification of molecular markers for plant cell wall composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant cell wall (PCW) composition determines the nature and quality of many biologically derived products and, therefore, is a major target for genetic improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the identities and functions of many genes involved in PCW synthesis are still not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide association mapping studies (GWAS) are one of the few ways to identify these genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, collecting precise and quantitative PCW phenotype data at the scale required for GWAS is a significant challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that high-density carbohydrate microarrays can be used as a PCW phenotyping strategy suitable for GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results presented in this study will aid in the understanding of PCW genetics and crop breeding for improved PCW composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic improvement of the plant cell wall has enormous potential to increase the quality of food, fibers, and fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the identification and characterization of genes involved in plant cell wall synthesis is far from complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association mapping is one of the few techniques that can help identify candidate genes without relying on our currently incomplete knowledge of cell wall synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, few cell wall phenotyping methodologies have proven sufficiently precise, robust, or scalable for association mapping to be conducted for specific cell wall polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we created high-density carbohydrate microarrays containing chemically extracted cell wall polysaccharides collected from 331 genetically diverse Brassica napus cultivars and used them to obtain detailed, quantitative information describing the relative abundance of selected noncellulosic polysaccharide linkages and primary structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We undertook genome-wide association analysis of data collected from 57 carbohydrate microarrays and identified molecular markers reflecting a diversity of specific xylan, xyloglucan, pectin, and arabinogalactan moieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These datasets provide a detailed insight into the natural variations in cell wall carbohydrate moieties between B. napus genotypes and identify associated markers that could be exploited by marker-assisted breeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identified markers also have value beyond B. napus for functional genomics, facilitated by the close genetic relatedness to the model plant Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our findings provide a unique dissection of the genetic architecture that underpins plant cell wall biosynthesis and restructuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The use of high-density carbohydrate microarrays as a phenotyping method for association mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) An overview of phenotyping strategy: We collected stem tissue from 475 accessions, derived from 331 cultivars, and sequentially fractionated them in duplicate, releasing four glycan-rich fractions (approximately 3,800 extracts in total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Microarray layouts: Twofold dilution series (n = 8) of each cell wall extract were printed together, as duplicate 96 × 96 square arrays consisting of approximately 100-µm-square features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each slide contained approximately 15,500 features extracted by using the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We probed each extract by using 19 glycan-specific antibodies (76 slides in total, images: SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Example of fluorescence measurements collected from a single slide, grouped by dilution: Boxes indicate the interquartile range (IQR), and the central line indicates the median fluorescence for these features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whiskers and points indicate data 1.5 x IQR inside or outside of the quartiles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boxplots show that no single dilution, even in the middle of the range (diluted 32 times), would bring all fluorescence measurements of all samples into the linear range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to obtain accurate quantification for all samples, we used nonlinear regression to fit best-fit lines to each dilution series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these lines, we interpolated the dilution that would be required to produce a feature with a set fluorescence within the linear range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inverse of the dilution was then used to derive a nominal relative abundance of each epitope relative to the original sample weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Relative abundance measurements taken from the same genotype were averaged, and their abundance was expressed relative to the mean cultivar: An example histogram showing the distribution in mean-centered relative abundance of a single epitope between 331 cultivars is shown here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, relative quantification was obtained for 57 slides (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5S8), amassing data collected from more than 1 million data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data were used for association mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation matrix comparing the relative abundance measurements for 330 different B. napus cultivars collected from 56 arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat-map displays pair-wise Spearmans rank correlation coefficients between data collected from each array (key located in the top left corner), ordered by hierarchical clustering by the complete linkage method (dendrograms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For legibility, array identities including the extract and primary antibody (157) are listed on the right side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left color key depicts the chemical used for extraction and the upper color key depicts the general polymer class commonly associated with each primary antibody following Pattathil et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Please note, the binding specificities of some mAb are not exclusive to a single polymer class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlated epitopes are more likely to have a common genetic basis and are likely to produce more similar GWA profiles after mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a proof of concept, we mapped the relative abundance of two epitopes recognized by two xylan-specific mAbs, CCRC-M150 and CCRC-M139, in a xylan-rich extract (4 M KOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Likely differences in antibody binding to xylan: Although the precise binding specificities of these mAbs are not known, CCRC-M150 is thought to bind to most xylan structures, whereas CCRC-M139 preferentially binds to long unsubstituted sections 6 Xyl residues in length, at least for arabinoxylan oligomers known to differ in composition (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Manhattan plots, which show the degree of association (y axis) of all SNPs located on chromosome A1 (x axis) with the genotypic variation in CCRC-M150 or CCRC-M139 binding to the 4 M KOH extracts: SNPs with a higher log10(P) value show a greater statistical association with each trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those above the Bonferroni threshold (gray dotted line) pass a conservative level of genome-wide statistical significance (P = 0.05/256598 markers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hemi-SNPs and Simple-SNPs (not assigned/assigned to a specific ancestral genome, respectively) are colored light and dark blue, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs associated with genome-wide significance to the variations in CCRC-M150 and CCRC-M139 binding to the 4 M KOH extracts, coincide with regions harboring orthologs of Arabidopsis IRX14 and GUX1, respectively (x positions shown in red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These marker associations are consistent with the respective substitution patterns that these mAbs are thought to recognize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most highly associated markers on chromosome A1 have been indicated for both traits (gray text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Boxplots showing variations in relative mAb binding to the 4 M KOH extracts, grouped by the alleles at these significantly associated SNP loci: The number of cultivars tested with a particular allele and the mean relative abundance of each epitope are written in each box in black and red, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, most cultivars (n = 188) had a T allele at SNP Cab020414.1:492.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultivars with a G allele at this position (n = 91) tended to contain less of the epitope recognized by CCRC-M150 in the 4 M KOH extract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All B. napus straw accessions were grown in 5-L plant pots at randomized locations in a 30 m × 7 m polytunnel located at the University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Leicestershire (+52° 49' 56.65, 1° 14' 57.73) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stems were left to dry in their pots, and basal stem material from 2 cm above the hypocotyl to approximately 60 cm above the ground was collected from each accession at maturity (August 2022, 2014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stem material from individual plants were then milled by using a Cyclone Mill TWISTER (Retch) fitted with a 0.5-mm screen to produce fine, uniform powders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After milling, approximately 84, 61, and 24% of the sample by weight was able to pass a 250-, 150- and 53-µm sieve, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 475 stem accessions derived from 330 different cultivars were analyzed in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Milled straw (approximately 3.5 g) from each accession was rinsed in 50 mL of ethanol [99.8%, 1 h, room temperature (RT)], followed by acetone (99.8%, 1 h, RT), separating solid and liquid components by centrifugation (4000 RPM, 15 min, Eppendorf 5810R with A-4-81 rotor) and discarding the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets surface area was increased with a spatula, and acetone was left to evaporate (3 d, RT), producing a cold alcohol/acetone insoluble residue (AIR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequential_Extraction_of_Cell_Wall_Polysaccharides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In total, 950 AIRs derived from 475 stem accessions collected from 330 different B. napus cultivars were sequentially extracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls containing a mixture of AIRs from 10 randomly selected accessions were also included with each set of 88 to observe any plate-to-plate variations (extraction control: A12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bulk extract containing 2 g of combined AIR, 40 mL of extractant, was also included with each plate (quantification control: position B12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIR from each accession (0.5 g) was weighed into 15-mL polypropylene tubes in duplicate on a three-decimal-place balance, and order was randomized before extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was mixed with ammonium oxalate (10 mL, 50 mM) and extracted overnight (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sample of each supernatant (1 mL) after centrifugation was loaded into two 96-well, 2-mL, deep-well polypropylene plates (Nunc) (positions A1 to H11) by using an Andrew Liquid Handling Robot (Andrew Alliance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining supernatant from each sample was discarded, and the pellet was washed thrice in ddH2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was repeated by using Na2CO3 (50 mM) + NaBH4 (0.5% wt/vol), 1 M KOH + NaBH4 (1% wt/vol) and 4 M KOH + NaBH4 (1% wt/vol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellets were not washed between collection of the 1 M and 4 M KOH fractions (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An antifoaming agent, 1-Octanol (10 µL), was added to each Na2CO3, 1 M KOH, and 4 M KOH extract before gradual neutralization to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid (9, 50, and 200 µL, respectively) by using a multichannel pipette and stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relative_Quantification_Using_Carbohydrate_Microarrays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell wall extracts held in 96-deep-well plates were mixed (20 aspiration and dispense cycles of 80 µL), and subsamples were transferred to 384-deep-well plates (80 µL) by using a Tecan Freedom Evo 100 workstation fitted with a 96-well MultiChannel Arm (MCA96) with disposable tips (Tecan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven sequential, twofold dilutions of each sample (500.78% original) were made across separate 384-deep-well plates (final volume 20 µL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were printed onto FAST Slides (Whatman) by using a bespoke Stanford-designed microarray printer (cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/mguide/) equipped with SMT-S75 silicon printing pins (Silicon Microarray).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplicate 96 × 96 square arrays consisting of 75- to 110-µm square features at 175-µm intervals were printed on each slide in 20 slide batches, at elevated humidity (60% relative humidity, 1823 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After printing, slides were stored over P2O5 before mAbs probing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were blocked with 1% nonfat milk in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (1% MTBS, pH 7.6, 2 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrays were incubated overnight with CCRC, JIM, and MAC-series primary mAbs (50 µL, sourced from Carbosource), diluted 500 times in 0.1% MTBS with 0.01% thiomersal added to prevent microbial contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were rinsed at least thrice in 0.1% MTBS (50 mL), and incubated with a secondary antibody (anti-Rat or anti-Mouse IgG produced in goat conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555, diluted to 5 µg/mL in 0.1% MTBS, 1 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary antibody was removed by rinsing five times in 0.1% MTBS (50 mL each) and dried by centrifugation (500 RPM, 3 min, RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were read at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm by using an Axon 4200AL microarray scanner and analyzed by using GenePix Pro-6.1 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gain of the photomultiplier tubes was adjusted to maximize the dynamic range across each array (maximum fluorescence 66,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were fitted to the Gompertz equation, and the dilution was required to generate a midrange fluorescence calculated by using R (SSgompertz, www.r-project.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broad exclusion criteria were set to remove samples that were outside the limits of detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data included either sample features that were not discernible from the background (blanks) or where the most extensive dilution used here (1/128) was not sufficient to bring the feature fluorescence into the linear range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were then aggregated by calculating the mean relative abundance of each epitope (1/dilution factor) for each genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SNP_Detection__Gene_Expression__and_Associative_Transcriptomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mapping and associative transcriptomics was conducted by using described methods and scripts (3, 7, 42, 43), with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For full details, see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 9,839 simple SNPs and 246,558 hemi SNPs, along with 53,889 significantly expressed coding DNA sequence models (0.4 mean RPKM) were used for associative transcriptomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
