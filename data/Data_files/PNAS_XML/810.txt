Indoles from commensal bacteria extend healthspan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increases in human life expectancy over the next century will be accompanied by increased frailty and massive and unsustainable health care costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing means to extend the time that individuals remain healthy and free of age-related infirmities, called healthspan, has therefore become a critical goal of aging research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that small molecules produced by the microbiota and related to indole extend healthspan in geriatric worms, flies, and mice, without attendant effects on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indoles act via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cause animals to retain a youthful gene expression profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indoles may represent a new class of therapeutics that improve the way we age as opposed to simply extending how long we live.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple studies have identified conserved genetic pathways and small molecules associated with extension of lifespan in diverse organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extending lifespan does not result in concomitant extension in healthspan, defined as the proportion of time that an animal remains healthy and free of age-related infirmities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, mutations that extend lifespan often reduce healthspan and increase frailty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question arises as to whether factors or mechanisms exist that uncouple these processes and extend healthspan and reduce frailty independent of lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that indoles from commensal microbiota extend healthspan of diverse organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mice, but have a negligible effect on maximal lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effects of indoles on healthspan in worms and flies depend upon the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a conserved detector of xenobiotic small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C. elegans, indole induces a gene expression profile in aged animals reminiscent of that seen in the young, but which is distinct from that associated with normal aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in older animals, indole induces genes associated with oogenesis and, accordingly, extends fecundity and reproductive span.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that small molecules related to indole and derived from commensal microbiota act in diverse phyla via conserved molecular pathways to promote healthy aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data raise the possibility of developing therapeutics based on microbiota-derived indole or its derivatives to extend healthspan and reduce frailty in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Indoles_Derived_from_Commensal_E_coli_Extend_Healthspan_of_C_elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate effects of indoles secreted by commensal bacteria on survival, wild-type C. elegans (N2) were grown on plates seeded with either an E. coli K12 variant (called K12) that produces and secretes indole and indole derivatives, or an isogenic mutant E. coli strain that contains a deletion in the tryptophanase gene (tnaA), which is required to convert tryptophan into indole (called K12tnaA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K12 was selected for its capacity to colonize the intestinal tract and grow as a commensal in mice (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing C. elegans on K12tnaA, compared with K12, shifted the KaplanMeier survival curve to the left (Fig 1A) but was without significant effect on maximal lifespan (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli OP50, the normal food source for C. elegans, which also produces indoles, induced a survival curve similar to that seen with K12 (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth of animals on K12tnaA supplemented with 250 M indole, compared with K12tnaA supplemented with vehicle (methanol), shifted the KaplanMeier survival curve to the right (Fig 1C) but was without significant effect on maximal lifespan (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift of the population survival curves with K12 or indole, even without an attendant increase in maximal lifespan, raised the possibility that indole produced by K12 augments healthspan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, growth of animals on K12 supplemented with 100 M indole further shifted the survival curve to the right compared with animals grown on K12 alone, and marginally extended maximal lifespan, suggesting that exogenous indole may provide a therapeutic effect even beyond that of commensal bacteria (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aging in C. elegans is accompanied by a decline in locomotion and pharyngeal pumping (19), and decreased resistance to thermal stress (20), which are direct measures of healthspan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motility, pharyngeal pumping, and resistance to thermal stress were thus assessed over the lifespan of animals grown on K12tnaA supplemented with either indole or vehicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to indole increased survival of both young (2 d) and old (18 d) adult worms following thermal stress (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, brief preexposure (72 h) of young (1 d) adults to indole in the absence of K12tnaA still rendered animals more resistant to heat stress compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig 1F), suggesting that indole acts directly on the host rather than via an intermediate produced by bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worms grown until day 8 on K12tnaA with or without indole exhibited similar rates of thrashing motility and pharyngeal pumping, and exhibited no paralysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, differences were evident after day 15; animals grown with indole exhibited more thrashing motility and pharyngeal pumping, and exhibited delayed onset of paralysis, compared with animals grown without indole (Fig 1 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects were evident when animals were grown on K12 compared with K12tnaA (Fig S1 B and C), or on K12 supplemented with indole (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a means of quantifying overall healthspan, the percentage of animals displaying at least 50% of the maximal response for each parameter at each time point were counted as healthy, whereas those falling below this mark were considered frail (1) (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When normalized to maximum lifespan, these data indicate that indole increased healthspan and concomitantly decreased frail span (Fig 1K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that indole provided either exogenously, or via K12, extends healthspan of C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_Indole_on_Healthspan_Are_Conserved_in_Drosophila_melanogaster  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether indole effects on healthspan were conserved across phyla, germ-free D. melanogaster w1118 were gnotobiotically monoassociated with either K12 or K12tnaA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flies grown on K12 showed a significant extension of the KaplanMeier curve compared with animals grown on K12tnaA (P less_than 0.0001; Fig 1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas no difference in climbing motility was evident in very young flies (day 2) grown on K12 or K12tnaA, day 20 flies grown on K12 were approximately twofold more motile than those grown on K12tnaA (Fig 1M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether indole regulated responses to thermal stress, conventionally raised flies were treated with streptomycin to reduce commensal flora, and transferred to media containing either K12 or K12tnaA, or, alternatively, media supplemented with 250 M indole or vehicle for 57 d. Flies exposed to K12 or indole displayed increased resistance to heat stress compared with those exposed to K12tnaA or vehicle (Fig 1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that exposure to indole or indole-producing bacteria augments healthspan in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, survival, motility, and stressor assays in flies and worms, indicate that K12 or indoles augment healthspan across a broad range of evolutionarily diverse species from different phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indoles_Extend_Healthspan_in_C_elegans_and_Drosophila_via_AHR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify genes mediating the effects of indoles on healthspan, we assessed the effects of indoles on loss-of-function alleles in genes known to mediate conditioning, regulate lifespan, or modulate stress responses in C. elegans (11, 13, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included the FOXO homolog DAF-16, the insulin receptor homolog DAF-2, the sirtuin homolog SIR2.1, the Nrf-2 homolog SKN-1, the dopamine receptor DOP-3, the tyrosine hydroxylase CAT-2, and AHR-1 (22), which encodes an ortholog of the mammalian AHR, a xenobiotic receptor that can bind to a variety of small molecules including indole (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to N2, shift in the survival curves was still evident with K12 compared with K12tnaA in daf-16(m26), daf-2(e1370), sir2.1(ok434), skn-1(zu169), dop-3(vs.106), and cat-2(e1112) animals (Fig S2), ruling out these genes as mediators of indole effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although ahr-1 mutants ahr-1(ia3) and ahr-1(ju145) both displayed longer maximal lifespan compared with wild-type (N2) animals, irrespective of presence of indole or K12 (compare Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B and 2C), neither K12 nor indole significantly shifted the KaplanMeier curves compared with K12tnaA (Fig 2 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ahr-1(ia3) mutants exposed to indole showed no improvement in thrashing motility, pharyngeal pumping, or resistance to thermal stress compared with those treated with vehicle (Fig 2 FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of overall healthspan scores indicated that indoles did not extend healthspan; thus, ahr-1(ia3) animals grown on K12 or indole had an identical healthspan/frail span ratio to that seen with ahr-1(ia3) mutants or N2 worms grown on K12tnaA plus vehicle (Fig 2 I and J; compare with Fig 1 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether AHR mediates effects of indoles in Drosophila, climbing assays were carried out with w1118 animals or with the isogenic ss1 mutant, which harbors a loss-of-function allele for the Drosophila ahr-1 homolog (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas K12 increased climbing motility and resistance to heat stress in wild-type animals compared with K12tnaA, ss1 mutants fed either K12 or K12tnaA displayed similar levels, which resembled that seen with w1118 flies grown with K12tnaA (Fig 2 K and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the effects of indoles on healthspan in C. elegans and Drosophila depend upon functional AHR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indole_Limits_Age-Dependent_Changes_in_Gene_Expression_and_Regulates_a_Distinct_Set_of_Healthspan_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next identified genes regulated by indole and AHR-1 that are associated with healthspan, and determined how indole impacted the expression of these genes during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, transcript levels were assessed by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in RNA samples derived from young (day 2) or older (day 12) adult N2 or ahr-1(ia3) animals grown in either K12 or K12tnaA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of expression levels by RT-PCR in several growth conditions of two genes, ahr-1 and fmo-2, validated expression levels obtained from RNA-Seq (Fig S3 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of RNA-Seq data from N2 animals from day 12 grown in either K12 or K12tnaA identified TnaA-dependent genes (Fig 3A), and comparison of N2 and ahr-1(ia3) animals from day 12 grown on K12 yielded Ahr-dependent genes (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of these two groups yielded 494 TnaA- and Ahr-dependent genes (blue box, Fig 3A), and 883 TnaA-dependent and Ahr-independent genes (beige box, Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following z-score normalization, expression levels of TnaA- and Ahr-dependent genes were compared across four conditions: young N2 animals with K12 or K12tnaA, and older N2 animals with K12 or K12tnaA (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth in K12 versus K12tnaA had little effect on expression levels in young animals (compare Fig 3B, columns 12 vs. 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of levels in young animals grown in K12tnaA or K12 with old animals grown in K12tnaA (Fig 3B, compare columns 15 with 89) showed that genes expressed at low levels in young animals increased with age (blue  red), whereas those expressed at high levels decreased with age (red  blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to young animals, indole treatment in aged animals limited the effects of age, such that genes expressed at low levels in young animals showed less increase with age, and genes expressed at high levels showed less decrease (Fig 3B; compare columns 67 with 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal-component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the variance in expression from young animals in K12 or K12tnaA was similar, and that the variance of expression in young animals more closely resembled old animals grown on K12 than old animals grown in K12tnaA (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effects were not as robust, similar results were evident with TnaA-dependent and Ahr-independent genes (Fig S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, indole delays or limits changes in expression of Ahr-dependent and Ahr-independent genes associated with healthspan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the effects of indole on genes specifically associated with aging and longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies with C. elegans comparing young and old N2 worms with long- or short-lived mutants identified 1,254 genes associated with aging and longevity (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes are regulated by the GATA transcription factors ELT-5 and ELT-6, whose expression increases with age, and by ELT-3, whose expression declines with age (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TnaA- and Ahr-dependent genes showed only 7% overlap with these genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, indole was without effect on expression of elt-3, elt-5, or elt-6, and had little impact on the expression profile of this gene set overall (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA confirmed that with respect to this gene set, variance in young animals grown with K12 or K12tnaA were clustered, and distinct from that of old animals grown with K12 or K12tnaA, which were likewise clustered (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that indoles regulate a set of genes associated with healthspan but distinct from GATA-regulated genes associated with aging and longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indole_Extends_Reproductive_Span_of_C_elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene ontology (GO) analysis of TnaA- and Ahr-dependent genes indicated that, by day 12, indole caused significant down-regulation of genes associated with sex determination (dosage compensation), and up-regulation of genes associated with meiosis, cell cycle, cytokinesis, and egg shell formation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of TnaA-dependent and Ahr-independent genes likewise showed up-regulation by day 12 of genes associated with meiosis, mitosis, cell division, sex organ formation, and larval development (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes contribute to maturation of oocytes and reproduction, which was highly unusual because C. elegans normally cease reproduction by day 4 and oocyte generation by day 8 (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prompted by the expression profile data, we confirmed that indole had a positive effect on the production of eggs and viable offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although N2 animals grown on K12 or K12tnaA produced similar numbers of fertilized eggs through day 5 (average of 273 and 287, respectively; n = 12), animals exposed to K12 exhibited a slightly delayed onset in egg production, and produced offspring for a day longer (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, animals grown in K12 produced significantly more unfertilized oocytes after day 4 compared with animals grown on K12tnaA (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with animals grown to day 10 on K12tnaA plus indole compared with K12tnaA plus vehicle (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether oocytes produced at day 10 could still be fertilized, day 911 hermaphrodites were mated with young males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this scheme, more viable progeny were produced by hermaphrodites grown on K12 compared with those grown on K12tnaA (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeling of males with MitoTracker indicated that sperm was, in fact, deposited, and that K12tnaA did not cause mating anomalies (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, indoles induced an extension of reproductive span, possibly owing to an increase in oocyte quality or viability (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with other healthspan measures, no increase in oocyte production was evident in day 10 ahr-1(1a3) animals grown on K12 compared with K12tnaA (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ahr-1 appeared necessary for increased fecundity, GO analysis suggested an additional role for ahr-1independent genes (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that indoles increase reproductive span, which is consistent with the induction of a more youthful state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effects_of_Indole_on_Healthspan_Are_Conserved_in_Mammals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess effects of indoles on healthspan in mammals, we assessed sensitivity to stressors in young mice, and multiple health metrics in geriatric animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve- to 16-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with streptomycin and recolonized with either K12 or K12tnaA (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 wk, the animals were subjected to lethal total body irradiation (TBI) (12 Gy), and their survival was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonization with K12 enhanced survival following TBI, compared with animals colonized with K12tnaA (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, animals were administered ICA [150 mgkg1d1 per os (p.o.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ); ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12] or vehicle beginning 1 d before TBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICA was chosen rather than indole because of the difficulties in providing the latter compound to mice other than by slow dissolving capsule or enema (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like K12, ICA proved protective against TBI (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that indoles produced by commensal bacteria increase the tolerance of young mice to TBI, and exogenous ICA provided as a supplement to indoles produced by commensal bacteria enhance protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in accordance with previous reports from our laboratory and others showing protective effects of indoles against stressors in mice (12, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed whether indoles extended healthspan in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aged BALB/c mice (28 mo old) were treated with streptomycin and then recolonized with either K12 or K12tnaA, and health score parameters were assessed over a 3-mo period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable and equivalent colonization was achieved with these strains over this time period (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indole metabolite 3-indoxyl sulfate, an indirect measure of indole production by intestinal microbes (29, 30), was readily detected in urine from animals colonized with K12, but appeared at significantly lower levels in animals colonized with K12tnaA (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the 3-mo period, animals colonized with K12 were better able to maintain their weight (Fig 5F) and showed improved survival compared with those colonized with K12tnaA (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on assessment of hunching, skin and coat condition, activity level, facial grimacing, curiosity, and grip strength, animals colonized with K12 had significantly greater composite health scores (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of total displacement in the cage (Fig S5) confirmed that older animals colonized with K12 exhibited greater mobility than those colonized with K12tnaA, although a statistically significant difference was only apparent after 90 d (Fig 5I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No change in dwell time or total number of rearing events was evident over this time period (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, indoles provided by commensal bacteria increase healthspan in both young and geriatric mice, and indicate that its effects on healthspan are broadly conserved across evolutionarily diverse species from different phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Youth is characterized by the capacity to move without impairment, to reproduce, to tolerate diverse environmental stressors with minimal attendant damage (damage tolerance), and to regenerate following damage, conditions that define healthspan (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As animals age, health decreases and frailty increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dietary factors, as well as dysregulation of the microbiota (dysbiosis), have been implicated in various disease states, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and diabetes (3437).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such maladies are often associated with dysregulated inflammatory responses, or with susceptibility to damage caused by such responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it has been postulated that altering the diet or the microbiota may augment damage tolerance and limit pathology (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We and others have implicated indoles and other products of bacterial TnaA in protective responses to damage by stressors and pathogens in both C. elegans and mammals (1113, 16) (Fig 5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented here show that indoles also augment other healthspan readouts associated with youth and with healthy aging, such as motility (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indole-regulated genes required to augment healthspan in C. elegans are generally distinct from those associated with longevity per se (Fig 3 D and E), and by shifting gene expression in the aged toward healthy patterns seen in the young (Fig 3C and Fig S4C), indoles in effect uncouple effects of aging on health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While readouts such as stressor tolerance and motility define healthspan, the transcriptomic data suggest that this description is nevertheless incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, indoles up-regulate genes associated with reproduction in aged animals, and accordingly extend reproductive span, a phenotype normally only expressed in young adults (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous reports suggested that AHR-1 limits lifespan in C. elegans grown on OP50, which, like K12, produces indoles (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We likewise found that both ahr-1(ia3) and ahr-1(ju145) exhibited longer lifespan compared with N2 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B and 2C); however, characterization of nematode locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, and heat stress in ahr-1 mutant animals, and normalization of these measures to lifespan, indicated that AHR-1 mediates effects of indoles on these aspects of healthspan, as well as on reproductive span (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 I and J and 4E), an effect corroborated in Drosophila (Fig 2 K and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While AHR-1 appears necessary for the healthspan measures assessed herein, Ahr-dependent genes represent only 36% of indole-regulated genes while Ahr-independent genes comprise 64% (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, genes from both the Ahr-dependent and Ahr-independent groups map to pathways controlling meiosis and oogenesis, suggesting both may contribute to reproductive span (Fig 4A and Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also raise the additional possibility that receptors besides AHR-1 mediate effects of indole on reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although Ahr-independent genes do not contribute to differences in survival curves with indole (Fig 2 AE), the possibility exists that they may do so when animals are grown under conditions that pose different exigencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulation of AHR-1 expression may control healthspan responses during normal aging in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of ahr-1 increases with age (Fig S3A), and although no changes in expression are evident with indole, age-dependent increases in AHR-1 expression may amplify responses to indole in older animals, and so favor gene expression patterns associated with youthfulness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mammals, indoles and AHR have been implicated in repair and/or protection of intestinal epithelia via IL-22 produced by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) (16, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to evaluate a direct role for AHR in mammalian healthspan because Ahr/ mice lack ILC3s (40), which themselves may mediate indole effects in aged mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Ahr/ mice also exhibit diminished reproductive capacity, which is at least in part due to deficiencies in sperm production, motility, and sensitivity to oxidative stress (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, indole and ICA bind AHR and activate AHR-dependent transcriptional responses (23), AHR-independent mechanisms may also mediate effects of indole or its derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of aging, epithelial barrier integrity is important in limiting dissemination of bacterial products (42, 43), and the subsequent hyperinflammatory responses that can cause widespread tissue damage, a process termed inflammaging (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barrier integrity limits enteritis and extends survival following TBI (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether augmenting intestinal barrier integrity or systemic antiinflammatory effects contribute to indole effects on healthspan and motility in geriatric animals is currently under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas data presented here show protective effects of E. coli K12 versus K12tnaA, recent data suggest that other intestinal eubacteria, including many Bacteroides and Lactobacillus species, likewise use TnaA to produce protective indole derivatives, including ICA and indole-3-carbinol (I3C)) (16, 4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responsiveness to particular indoles may differ and be tuned to the precise complement of indoles produced by the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, different indole species may offer different levels of protection depending on the stressor, or affect different aspects of healthspan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing of combinations of indoles is thus warranted and may offer the most comprehensive means to extend healthspan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Production of indoles may be a general property of eubacteria, and coevolution of indole-producing bacteria with animals over the last 500 My may explain how indoles coordinate responses to a myriad of stressors in such diverse organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants, particularly cruciferous vegetables such as kale and broccoli, also produce indoles including ICA and IAA, which is also known as auxin (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain indoles [e.g., I3C or 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM)] are available as dietary supplements or plant extracts (52), although it remains to be determined whether indoles provided in this fashion have sufficient bioavailability to provide protection against diverse stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fecal transplants, or oral probiotic treatments with known indole-producing bacteria, offer potential advantages in limiting infirmity associated with dysbiosis (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, durable repopulation with the transplanted species requires an open niche within the intestinal tract, which may necessitate coordinate administration of antibiotics, and the procedure is less well tolerated in cases of severe colitis (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High levels of tryptophan in the diet can likewise augment production of indoles by intestinal bacteria, and increasing consumption of tryptophan may represent a viable therapeutic strategy in the context of a microbiota with adequate TnaA activity (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in worms and mice, exogenous administration of indole or ICA alone can supplement that provided by the microbiota, and further augment healthspan (12, 16) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data raise the possibility that exogenous administration of bioactive indoles might both compensate for a suboptimal microbiota, and bypass limitations associated with fecal transplants, probiotic treatments, or dietary interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial strains used include a nalidixic acid and streptomycin-resistant E. coli variant selected for its capacity to grow in mice (MG1655* referred to as K12) obtained from Dr. P. Cohen, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, that is an efficient colonizer of the murine intestinal tract (18), and a MG1655*tnaA constructed by us from MG1655* (called here K12tnaA) by deletion of TnaA gene (tnaA) using lambda red-recombinase system (57), and E. coli OP50 (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All MG1655* strains were cultured in Luria Broth (LB) (Difco) containing streptomycin (100 g/mL), whereas OP50 was cultured in LB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C_elegans_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C. elegans strains obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center include wild-type Bristol strain N2, ahr-1(ju145), ahr-1(ia3), daf-16(m26), daf-16(mu86), skn-1(zu169), sir2.1(ok434), cat-2(e1112), and dop3(vs.106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) at 16 °C under standard culturing conditions with E. coli OP50 as food source (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C_elegans_Lifespan_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lifespan assays were performed at 16 °C on NGM plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial strains grown overnight in LB broth at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.81.0 were used to seed the plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gravid C. elegans adult worms were transferred to assay plates with bacteria and allowed to lay eggs for 45 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates with synchronized eggs were then transferred and maintained in 16 °C (to ensure slow bacterial growth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lifespan assays were performed without 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which has been used previously to limit appearance of the progeny, because the compound itself affected lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, adult worms developing from the synchronized eggs were transferred daily for the first 810 d and every other day thereafter so as to avoid mixing with next generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some assay plates, indole (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 250 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanol was added to control plates, which were then seeded with K12tnaA bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of indole was reduced to 100 µM in the assay plates used to transfer older adult (post-day 5) worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
