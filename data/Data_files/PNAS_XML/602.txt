Intestinal NCoR1, a regulator of epithelial cell maturation, controls neonatal hyperbilirubinemia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many parts of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) is associated with substantial mortality and long-term morbidities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the immediate and rapid rise in total serum bilirubin (TSB) originating from lysis of red blood cells has been linked to genetic predisposition, preterm births, and blood type incompatibilities, the inability to efficiently metabolize bilirubin results from delayed expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the mechanism associated with delayed expression of the human UGT1A1 gene in neonatal mice that are humanized for the UGT1 locus is described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neonatal humanized UGT1 (hUGT1) mice develop SNH and control TSB levels by nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1)-directed repression of intestinal epithelial cell maturation, an event linked to expression of the UGT1A1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) and the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus result in part from delayed expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and the inability to metabolize bilirubin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is a good understanding of the early events after birth that lead to the rapid increase in serum bilirubin, the events that control delayed expression of UGT1A1 during development remain a mystery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humanized UGT1 (hUGT1) mice develop SNH spontaneously, which is linked to repression of both liver and intestinal UGT1A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report that deletion of intestinal nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) completely diminishes hyperbilirubinemia in hUGT1 neonates because of intestinal UGT1A1 gene derepression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptomic studies and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrate that NCoR1 plays a major role in repressing developmental maturation of the intestines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derepression is marked by accelerated metabolic and oxidative phosphorylation, drug metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and intestinal maturation, events that are controlled predominantly by H3K27 acetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of NCoR1 function and derepression is linked to IKK function, as validated in hUGT1 mice with targeted deletion of intestinal IKK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiological events during neonatal development that target activation of an IKK/NCoR1 loop in intestinal epithelial cells lead to derepression of genes involved in intestinal maturation and bilirubin detoxification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide a mechanism of NCoR1 in intestinal homeostasis during development and provide a key link to those events that control developmental repression of UGT1A1 and hyperbilirubinemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Intestinal-Specific_NCoR1_Deletion_Ameliorates_Neonatal_Hyperbilirubinemia_in_Mice_with_a_hUGT1_Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humanized mice harboring the UGT1 locus encoding nine functional UGT1A proteinsincluding UGT1A1in a Ugt1-null background, termed hUGT1 mice, develop neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (17, 35) because of delayed UGT1A1 expression in both the liver and GI tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that knockdown of SMRT and NCoR1 in primary neonatal hepatocytes by siRNA leads to derepression of UGT1A1 (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects are seen after HDAC1 or HDAC3 ablation (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings implicate NCoR1 along with HDAC1/3 in controlling UGT1A1 gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first generated floxed NCoR1 mice under a hUGT1 background (TgUGT1/Ugt1//NCoR1F/F), named as F/FUN, and then further knocked out NCoR1 in liver (HEPUN mice) and intestinal tissue (IECUN mice) of hUGT1 mice (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we examined TSB levels in neonatal mice, we found that wild-type F/FUN and HEPUN mice exhibited a similar pattern of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia as hUGT1 mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bilirubin accumulation in these mice was observed as early as postnatal day 1 (P1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSB levels gradually increased, reaching 12 mg/dL at P14, then declined rapidly after P18 and eventually returned to a normal range (less than 2 mg/dL) at P21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, following intestinal-specific deletion of NCoR1, the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was completely diminished in IECUN mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of TSB levels in IECUN mice was exclusively the result of the NCoR1 intestinal deletion, as hUGT1/NCoR1IEC/wt mice still exhibited high levels of TSB (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting bilirubin clearance in IECUN mice also had a significant effect on its accumulation in fat tissue compared with that in control F/FUN mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Developmental_Stage-Dependent_Derepression_of_UGT1A1_Expression_Resulting_from_Intestinal_NCoR1_Deletion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Up-regulation of the intestinal UGT1A genes in IECUN neonates in comparison with the F/FUN littermate controls as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) analysis suggests the occurrence of transcriptional derepression of the UGT1A locus in IECUN intestines (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the induction of intestinal UGT1A1 in IECUN mice is most prominent throughout the developmental stage, starting at embryonic day 19 (E19) and continuing through to P19 (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prominent derepression of the UGT1A1 gene in IECUN neonates at P12 is clearly demonstrated in both the longitudinal axis and the cryptvilli axis (CVA) (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, derepression of UGT1A1 expression in the absence of NCoR1 did not occur after weaning or in adulthood (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S2 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, the UGT1A1 gene was expressed even in NCoR1-positive mice, suggesting that derepression of intestinal UGT1A1 following NCoR1 deletion is age-dependent, only taking place in the embryonic and suckling periods and having a direct impact on bilirubin glucuronidation in IECUN neonates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NCoR1_Deletion_Alters_Lipid_and_Energy_Metabolism_in_IECUN_Neonates__Primarily_Through_Modification_of_Histone_Acetylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the molecular events following deletion of NCoR1 in intestinal tissue, we performed global transcriptional profiling in F/FUN and IECUN mice using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scatter plot (Fig 3A) showed considerable variability in gene expression between F/FUN and IECUN mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a false discovery rate (FDR) of less_than0.05, 1,023 genes were up-regulated and 830 genes were down-regulated (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology analysis identified that the metabolic pathway was the most significantly altered pathway in IECUN mice, followed by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and drug metabolism (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deleting NCoR1 promotes expression of PPAR target genes but also enhances expression of Ppar, Ppar, and their coactivator Pgc1 (Fig 3C), which would have an extensive impact on FA and energy metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other lipid metabolism-associated genes that are subject to LXR regulation were also derepressed significantly in IECUN intestines, such as cholesterol transport-related genes, and genes associated with unsaturated FA synthesis and lipogenesis (Fig S3A); genes related to the retinol metabolism pathway are largely regulated through RAR following the deletion of NCoR1 (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Messenger RNA levels of TCA cycle genes and OXPHOS genes were coordinately increased in IECUN neonates (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we examined mitochondria by electron microscopy, mitochondria in IECs were tethered with adjacent mitochondria and displayed more compacted cristae than those in F/FUN IECs (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondrial organization in IECs of IECUN mice may structurally enhance the interactions between adjacent mitochondria to allow more efficient energy transfer and communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion of intestinal NCoR1 leads to derepression of genes related to lipid and energy metabolism, simultaneously boosting both FA metabolism and lipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These global transcriptomic alterations were further confirmed when we carried out ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses in IECs isolated from F/FUN and IECUN mice to assess histone modifications across the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined histone marks associated with active transcription toward acetylated H3K27ac and H3K9ac, methylated H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, as well as transcriptional repression through H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant changes resulting from NCoR1 deletion were revealed in H3K27ac levels with the identity of 527 genes and 1,304 elevated peaks generated across the genome (Fig S3D), which are associated with transcriptional activation of over 50% of genes in IECUN intestines identified by RNA-seq analyses and the similar KEGG analysis (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derepressions were significantly increased in transcription start site (TSS) regions of genes that were up-regulated in IECUN mice (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in identified sequence is illustrated with the Scd2 gene and the human UGT1A1 gene (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data collectively indicate that removing the corepressor NCoR1 changes the chromatin structure and promoter accessibilityprimarily through acetylation modificationresulting in alteration in transcription activities of NCoR1-targeted genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Gene_Regulation_in_Neonatal_Versus_Adult_IECUN_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we have confirmed that UGT1A1 is also a target gene of PPAR and LXR/, we considered that the activation of these NRs may target the UGT1A1 gene and lead to its developmental-dependent derepression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility in greater detail, RNA-seq experiments were conducted using intestinal tissue from adult F/FUN and IECUN mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 1,022 genes up-regulated in neonatal tissue and the 1,265 genes up-regulated in adult tissue following NCoR1 deletion, there were 462 common genes (Fig 4A), among which key biological processes involved in membrane synthesis, FA metabolism and transport, retinol synthesis, and PPAR signaling were shared between neonatal and adult tissue in NCoR1-deleted IECs (Fig S4A), with some specific genes demonstrated in Fig S4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, other regulatory patterns as illustrated by the Cyp4a10 gene were enhanced in adult IECUN mice (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, a host of genes encoding proteins linked to drug metabolism were highly derepressed in IECUN neonates but much less affected in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we analyzed the expression profiles of a few representative genes in this class (i.e., Cyp2c55, Cyp2c65, Cyp3a11, Ugt2a3) at various developmental stages, we found that the derepression of these genes, which peaked in the middle suckling period, was developmentally stage-dependent in IECUN neonates, remarkably like the derepression pattern of UGT1A1 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that NCoR1 expression impacts gene expression differentially between neonatal and adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NCoR1_Deletion_Accelerates_IEC_Migration_and_Cell_Maturation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of gene expression profiles further enlightened our speculation that NCoR1 deletion led to precocious development of the intestines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in total body weight between F/FUN and IECUN littermates at P12 (n = 10, P  greater than  0.05) (Fig S5A); however, the average length of the small intestine was 8% longer (n = 10, P less_than 0.01) (Fig 5A), and the average weight of the intestines 15% greater (n = 10, P less_than 0.01) in IECUN (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E-stained intestinal sections displayed similar morphological characteristics between F/FUN and IECUN mice (Fig S5B), and well-developed brush border and microvilli were visualized by electron microscopy (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of NCoR1 on cellular proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining and BrdU incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ki-67positive proliferating cells were slightly increased in both duodenum and jejunum but not ileum of IECUN mice, compared with those in F/FUN mice (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After neonatal mice were exposed to BrdU for 2.5 h, the number of BrdU-positive cells had increased by 15.6% in duodenum and 18.7% in jejunum in IECUN mice (n = 5, P less_than 0.05), with no significant difference being observed in ileum (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h BrdU exposure, BrdU-positive cells migrated a significantly greater length in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of IECUN mice than those of F/FUN mice (n = 4, P less_than 0.05) (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrated that NCoR1 deletion accelerated cell proliferation and promoted epithelial cell migration in IECUN mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sucrase isomaltase (Sis), a brush border glucosidase, only exists in differentiated duodenal and jejunal enterocytes and has been used as a marker of enterocyte maturation (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sis gene expression along the CVA was up-regulated in IECUN mice (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated Sis expression was also observed longitudinally in both duodenum and jejunum in IECUN (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of other maturation markers in IECUN, including the duodenal-specific Akp3 gene and jejunal-specific Krt20 gene (3841), further supports the occurrence of cell maturation in the absence of NCoR1 (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, expression of Glb1, Nox4, and Lrp2, which is down-regulated at the suckling to weaning transition (38, 39), was also decreased in IECUN (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered expression of these genes is indicative of intestinal tissue maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NCoR1_Expression_Is_Regulated_by_Activation_of_Intestinal_Kinase_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The linkage recently disclosed between the phosphorylation of NCoR1 by IKK leading to the cytoplasmic accumulation of NCoR1 (42) urged us to evaluate the potential involvement of NCoR1 in IKK deletion-induced UGT1A1 repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had previously demonstrated the targeted deletion of intestinal IKK in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice leads to greater neonatal accumulation of TSB (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in TSB levels in neonatal hUGT1/IkkIEC mice is a direct result of the reduction in intestinal UGT1A1 expression (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-QPCR analysis demonstrated that following deletion of intestinal IKK in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice, intestinal NCoR1 gene expression was significantly induced (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this change, superrepression initiated by NCoR1 was apparent in decreased gene expression of UGT1A1, along with other target genes, including Scd1, Scd2, Hmgcs2, Cpt1a, and Cyp4a10 (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of the small intestine maturation markers, including Sis, Akp3, and Krt20, were also significantly down-regulated in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of IKK in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice reverses gene expression patterns that are observed in IECUN mice, demonstrating that NCoR1 in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice has enhanced transcriptional repressive properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cDNA clone encoding a constitutively active variant of IKK was cloned into plasmid containing the 12.4-kb Villin promoter and used to generate IKK(EE)IEC transgenic mice that expressed constitutively active IKK in IECs (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we examined constitutively active intestinal IKK activity in IKK(EE)IEC neonates at P12, IEC maturation marker genes Sis, Akp3, and Krt20 were dramatically induced, and Glb1, Nox4, and Lrp2 genes are significantly reduced in IKK(EE)IEC mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig 7 D and E), a pattern like that observed in IECUN mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly implicate a role for IKK-directed phosphorylation in control of NCoR1 function during neonatal intestinal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNH is of significant clinical concern in many parts of the world and is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent comprehensive reviews that examined the burden of SNH in LMICs have shown very limited progress on the epidemiological profile since earlier reports over 55 y ago (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the most part, an understanding of the environmental and genetic parameters that lead to the rapid rise in TSB levels has been the primary focus in attempting to describe the mechanisms leading to hyperbilirubinemia, with limited insight on those events that developmentally limit expression of UGT1A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important inroad toward examining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control the metabolism of bilirubin has been accomplished by the development of hUGT1 mice (17), an animal model that can be used to replicate SNH and characterize the events controlling UGT1A1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now understood that delayed expression of hepatic UGT1A1 in neonatal hUGT1 mice is a controlled event, with the UGT1A1 gene being actively repressed through participation with PXR (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported that complete interruption of the hepatic Ugt1 locus through targeted knockout in Ugt1HEP mice is not sufficient to induce SNH (45), implicating an important role for the metabolism and clearance of bilirubin by other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, selective induction of only intestinal UGT1A1 in neonatal hUGT1 mice is sufficient to reverse SNH (35, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding, and others, provides evidence that intestinal UGT1A1 is repressed during development but can be successfully induced to alter bilirubin metabolism and reverse the development of hyperbilirubinemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The centerpiece in controlling intestinal UGT1A1 expression is regulation of NCoR1 function, which has a direct impact on UGT1A1 gene expression and IEC maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When NCoR1 is selectively deleted in IECs in IECUN mice, newborns do not display the escalating TSB levels that are prominent in neonatal hUGT1 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, they show significantly elevated levels of UGT1A1 throughout the longitudinal range of the SI in addition to the IECs ranging from the crypts to the ends of the villi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-seq experiments validated that deacetylated histone regions were prominent in NCoR1 binding, adding support that histone deacetylases, such as HDAC3, are associated with NCoR1 binding (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq studies demonstrated that the deletion of NCoR1 promotes activation of PPAR and LXR/ target genes involved in lipid and energy metabolism, as evident by increases in metabolic pathways, OXPHOS, and FA metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these steps are necessary for successful IEC maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UGT1A1 gene can be actively induced in the presence of PPAR/ and LXR/ ligands, so the possibility exists that deletion of NCoR1 and activation of these NRs are underlying the induction of UGT1A1 in IECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, NCoR1 controls large sets of genes that are differentially regulated during the neonatal period or once the mice become adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important class of developmentally regulated genes during the neonatal period are those involved in the transition of neonatal to adult intestinal epithelium, indicating that NCoR1 functions along with the transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (38) in events involved in IEC maturation and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because NCoR1 deletion leads to IEC proliferation in neonatal mice, an event that does not occur in adult tissue, the action of IEC proliferation may underlie UGT1A1 derepression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCoR1 ChIP-seq analysis can markedly increase the novelty of this work in elucidating the mechanism of NCoR1 repression on UGT1A1 gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the commercial antibodies available for this work were successful in ChIP-seq experiments using neonatal intestinal tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar limitations were also encountered when Yamamoto tried to address the function of NCoR1 as an important regulator of muscle mass and oxidative function (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize this antibody limitation, our work has included ChIP-seq data by using different methylation and acetylation histone marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3K27ac is the primary player in response to the removal of the corepressor NCoR1 and the changes in chromatin structure and promoter accessibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The functional ability of NCoR1 to promote its repressive properties with NRs as well as its potential to activate gene transcription have been linked to specific phosphorylation events (23, 26), with a host of different kinases implicated in NCoR1 regulation (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of nuclear NCoR1 in malignant melanoma was associated with IKK-dependent phosphorylation of specific NCoR1 serine resides (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we deleted IKK selectively from IECs in hUGT1/IkkIEC mice, UGT1A1 gene expression was superrepressed along with other target genes involved in IEC maturation, followed by elevations in TSB levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, IEC maturation genes analyzed by RT-QPCR during neonatal development were expressed in a highly concordant pattern in intestinal tissue from IKK(EE)IEC mice, directly implicating a key role for IKK expression toward control of NCoR1 release from repressed genes, such as UGT1A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We are proposing that there is a link between intestinal IKK activity and events that lead to NCoR1 repression of intestinal UGT1A1 gene expression shortly after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human breast milk (BM), especially colostrum, contains glycans that inhibit Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and prevent downstream mediated inflammation (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon ligand binding by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), expressed by microflora (51), TLRs are activated and initiate intracellular signaling events resulting in regulation of genes activated by the IKK/NF-B pathway (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to term infants or adults, preterm infants express higher concentrations of TLRs, which upon activation may increase the risk for neonatal sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (53) through the IKK/NF-Bmediated inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The components of BM block this response by inhibiting the TLRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon our findings, we hypothesize that components of BM attenuate IEC TLRs, limit PAMP-induced IKK activity and downstream phosphorylation events, and minimize UGT1A1 gene expression through an NCoR1-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delayed expression of the UGT1A1 gene can be reversed by agents that activate TLRs, such as LPS (35), or components of BM, such as FAs, which are ligands for activation of PPAR, a NR linked to NCoR1 repression and activation of the UGT1A1 gene (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oral administration of high concentrations of FAs, such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, to neonatal hUGT1 mice resulted in lowering of TSB levels (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a diet of formula, as we have previously shown (35), lacking TLR-bound glycans, allows downstream activation of the IKK/NCoR1 loop and expression of the UGT1A1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the transition of intestinal epithelial tissue from its immature status shortly after birth to an advanced network of crypts and villi, as observed in adult mice, can be viewed as a carefully programmed event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulation of neonatal intestinal UGT1A1 and its impact toward the control and onset of hyperbilirubinemia is intimately tied with IEC maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings that we have outlined in this animal model, such as the linkage of IKK with the inhibition of NCoR1, may be of value in identifying chemicals, therapeutics, or dietary agents that would be useful in lowering TSB levels in children exhibiting SNH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
hUGT1 mice were previously generated by introducing a human UGT1 transgene into mice with a Ugt1-null background (17, 55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed hUGT1 with NCoR1F/F mice (26, 27) to generate hUGT1/NCoR1F/F (F/FUN) mice, which were further bred with Villin-Cre (57) or Albumin-Cre transgenic mice (Jackson laboratory) (58, 59) to obtain the compound mutants Vil-Cre/TgUGT1/Ugt1//NCoR1F/F (IECUN) and Alb-Cre/TgUGT1/Ugt1//NCoR1F/F (HEPUN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of mouse strains hUGT1/IkkIEC (43) and IKK(EE)IEC (44) have been previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the mouse strains were housed in a pathogen-free University of California, San Diego (UCSD) vivarium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSD Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cre-negative mice (F/FUN) served as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Siblings were preferred for all of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intestinal_Tissue_Sections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Entire small intestines were dissected from mice, sectioned, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen tissues were pulverized for further RNA and protein extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI segments were sectioned as duodenum (D), proximal jejunum (Jp), terminal jejunum (Jt), proximal ileum (Ip), and terminal ileum (It).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markers specific for duodenum (Akp3), jejunum (Sis), and ileum (Nox4, Lrp2) were measured by RT-QPCR, and the results were consistent with a previous publication (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IEC_Isolation_and_IEC_Sequential_Isolation_Along_CVA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IECs were isolated with a modified method (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated IECs were collected by centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequential isolation of IECs along the CVA was carried out according to a previous description (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, jejunums were dissected and cut longitudinally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing briefly in buffer A (DPBS with 27 mM sodium citrate), tissue was incubated in buffer B (DPBS with 1.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM DTT) at 37 °C with very gentle shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a series of incubations (2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, 15, and 15 min), a total of 11 fractions of IECs were isolated, and the gradient of cells from villus tip to the lower villus and crypt area was confirmed by the protein expression pattern of PCNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells isolated from three mice of each strain were pooled for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Total_RNA_Preparation__RT-QPCR__and_RNA-Seq_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA from cell and tissue samples were prepared for RT by using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time (Q) PCR experiments were carried out on a CFX96 QPCR system (BioRad) by using Ssoadvanced SYBR Green reagent (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were designed through mouse primer depot (https://mouseprimerdepot.nci.nih.gov/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isoform-specific primers for hUGT1A are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intestine RNA was prepared from F/FUN and IECUN mice at either 12 d old (neonates) or 10 wk old (adults) for RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA from two mice were pooled, and a total three samples per strain were used for RNA-seq studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyadenylated mRNA was purified with the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (ThermoFisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA libraries were prepared for strand-specific sequencing as previously described (62) and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 by running 36 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image deconvolution, quality value calculation, and the mapping of exon reads and exon junctions were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing reads were aligned to the Mus musculus (UCSC mm9) genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE86927.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP-Seq_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IECs were freshly isolated from both IECUN and F/FUN neonates at P12 and were subjected to ChIP (MAGnify ChIP system, ThermoFisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reverse cross-linking, library preparation was carried out by using the MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit V2 (Diagenode, C05010012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster generation and 50 cycles of single-end sequencing were carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence tags were aligned (mapped) to the unmasked mouse (mm9) or human (hg19) reference genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following antibodies were used: anti-H3K4me1 (Abcam, ab8895), anti-H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580), anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898), anti-H3K27me3 (Active Motif, AM61017), anti-H3K9ac (Active Motif, AM39137), and anti-H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE86996.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology__Immunohistochemistry_(IHC)__and_Immunofluorescence_(IF)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paraffin-embedded sections were used for routine H&E staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BrdU IHC was performed according to the manufacturers instructions (eBioscience, 88006599-45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, neonates at day 12 (BrdU exposure for 2.5 h) or at day 10 (BrdU exposure for 48 h) were treated with BrdU at 50 mg/kg by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin-embedded SI sections were applied for IHC staining and detected by the ABC detection system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were examined under an upright Imager A2 microscope (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen sections were prepared in OCT compound for IF staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the overnight incubation with primary antibodies, slides were then washed and stained with Alexa-488conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies), alongside a DAPI counterstaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounted slides were examined under Leica TCS SPE confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following antibodies were used: anti-Ki67 (GeneTex, GTX16667), anti-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1496), and anti-sis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc27603).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Preparation_and_Western_Blots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue or cell lysates were prepared in a RIPA buffer for gel electrophoresis [Nupage 412% (wt/vol) Bis-Tris gradient gel ThermoFisher].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots were developed and imaged using a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human UGT1A1 (Abcam, ab170858), anti-PCNA (BD Pharmingen, 555566), and anti-Tubulin (Sigma, T9026).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All results were subjected to statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Students t test analyses were performed for most of the studies unless specified otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistics and graphs were generated by using GraphPad Prism software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, and P values smaller than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant: *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001, ****P less_than 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Transmission_Electron_Microscope  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electron microscope imaging was performed at the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR) at UCSD according to modification of a method of Antonucci (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly described, IECUN and F/FUN neonates were euthanized on day 12, and jejunums were dissected and fixed in a freshly made solution of 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde, and 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were washed with ice-cold 0.15 M sodium cacodylate containing 2 mM CaCl2 and then postfixed with 1.5% (wt/vol) KFe(CN)3, 0.15 M cacodylate buffer, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2% (wt/vol) OsO4(aq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were washed with ice-cold water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were dehydrated with graded ethanol solutions before embedding in Durcupan ACM resin (Fluka) for ultramicrotomy by using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were poststained with Sato Lead Solution before TEM imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron micrographs were taken on a FEI Technai 12 (Spirit) (120 kV) with a Teitz TemCam F224 2k by 2k CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Montages of intestinal villi were obtained using Serial EM software at 4,400× magnification in a 10 × 10 or 20 × 20 region of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosaics were constructed using the Blendmont feature in 3dmod (IMOD version 4.7, University of Colorado), and the resulting mosaics were binned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hepatocytes_Isolation_and_SiRNA_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary hepatocytes were isolated from neonatal mouse livers and treated with gene-targeted siRNA as previously described (19, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, hepatocytes were dissociated through liver perfusion with Hanks buffer with liberase (Roche, 05401020001) and plated in six-well collagen-coated plates (BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four hours later, hepatocytes were transfected with Silencer select siRNA (ThermoFisher-Ambion) by using lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (ThermoFisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siRNA included siControl, siNCoR1, siSMRT, siHDAC1, siHDAC2, and siHDAC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected 48 h after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
