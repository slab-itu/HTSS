Scale-dependent portfolio effects explain growth inflation and volatility reduction in landscape demography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population demography is central to many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology, yet there is a gap between the information needed about the demography of population over multiple spatial scales and the available data, which are largely local.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by concepts from landscape ecology and Markowitz's investment portfolio theory, we address this lacuna by developing a method for quantifying and predicting the demography of multiple populations across spatial scales and apply it to gypsy moth populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that population demography is scale-dependent due largely to a tilted portfolio effect from skewed population size distributions and covarying population growth rate; this explains why population ensembles can have growth rates greater than the mean with variance smaller than the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population demography is central to fundamental ecology and for predicting range shifts, decline of threatened species, and spread of invasive organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a mismatch between most demographic work, carried out on few populations and at local scales, and the need to predict dynamics at landscape and regional scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by concepts from landscape ecology and Markowitzs portfolio theory, we develop a landscape portfolio platform to quantify and predict the behavior of multiple populations, scaling up the expectation and variance of the dynamics of an ensemble of populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate this framework using a 35-y time series on gypsy moth populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the demography accumulation curve in which the collective growth of the ensemble depends on the number of local populations included, highlighting a minimum but adequate number of populations for both regional-scale persistence and cross-scale inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attainable set of landscape portfolios further suggests tools for regional population management for both threatened and invasive species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analytical_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let there be z populations in the landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The landscape portfolio is the weight vector of populations: w={w1,w2,...wz} subject to wi0 and iwi=1, with wi=ni/nU, where nU is the sum of population sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, ni follows a lognormal distribution (10) and thus the RGR, ri, a Gaussian, with expectation i, variance i2, and ij=cov(ri,rj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensemble RGR isrU=ln(ieriwi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]Following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15, we first present the formulae of landscape demographies for constant weights (called the rebalancing strategy in economic theory) and then extend the formulae later to connect with other stochastic demography theories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the possible demographies of landscape ensembles are addressed here by exploring the entire feasible range of weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find the expectation (U) and variance (U2) of the ensemble (U) RGR, let =iei+i2/2wi and 2=ijei+i2/2ej+j2/2(eij1)wiwj; we then haveU=ln(2/(2+2)1/2)U2=ln((2+2)/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]Two landscape ensembles are also synchronized to some extent due to covarying populations (Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The attainable set is the set of all possible landscape portfolios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is useful to describe the attainable set by its projection in the growth-volatility (U,U2) plane; its boundaries (Fig 1A) describe demographies for combinations of two or more populations, with single-population portfolios at the ends of each two-population curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top-left boundary (Fig 1A) is of particular interest as it represents portfolios with minimum variance for a given ensemble RGR, or equivalently maximum RGR given a level of volatility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In economics, this represents ideal portfolios of investments, and is thus called the efficient frontier (32, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In landscape demography it represents ensembles of populations with minimum collective risk from reduced volatility and maximum potential for regional-scale persistence from growth inflation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ensemble portfolios within the attainable set often have reduced volatility and inflated RGR (shifting toward the efficient frontier in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A paradoxical result is that the expected RGR for the ensemble as a whole, U, can be positive even with all negative local RGRs (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, growth inflation occurs when the expected ensemble RGR is greater than the weighted arithmetic mean of local RGRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Portfolios including many populations generally also have smaller U2 than those including a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covariance between the RGRs of populations, ij, is critical in causing volatility reduction and growth inflation; this can be enhanced by negative covariances (compare Fig 1A with Fig 1B), but positive covariances can dampen this effect or even exacerbate volatility (Fig 1 C and D); the latter was an important factor that precipitated the Great Recession of 2008 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volatility reduction and growth inflation in landscape demography result from a tilted portfolio effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, due to skewed distributions of ni, the growth (U) and volatility (U2) of a landscape ensemble covary with each other (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), tilting the efficient frontier from the left corner of the growth-volatility (U,U2) plane in classic portfolio theory to the top-left corner in a landscape portfolio (Fig 1), permitting growth inflation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differs from the classic portfolio theory of investment, where the two quantities are independent and thus the portfolio effect refers only to volatility reduction (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the covariance of RGRs between local populations determines the degree to which the ensemble demographies are shifting toward the efficient frontier, analogous to classic portfolio theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volatility reduction and growth inflation can be severely damped or even reversed if there are large discrepancies in i2 (compare Fig 1B with Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a two-population ensemble (Fig S1), the effect of growth inflation and volatility reduction reverse when d2212d for some threshold d. The existence of this threshold confines the portfolio effect of volatility reduction and growth inflation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because (with increasing d) the denominator of the function for U (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) grows faster than its numerator, while the denominator of the function for U2 grows more slowly than its numerator, eventually reversing the portfolio effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covariance also plays a role, with highly synchronized dynamics having small d and weak effects on volatility reduction and growth inflation (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Connecting_Demographic_Theories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This framework of landscape demography can be connected to stochastic demography theories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After relaxing the assumption of constant weights and allowing temporal autocorrelation of ri, we have the expected regional RGR of the ensemble (Supporting Information):U=ln(i(cov(i,wi)+w¯iexp(i+1+i1ii22))).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This expected ensemble RGR can explain the growth inflation from existing demographic theories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First,  represents intertwined U and U2, as well as the temporal autocorrelation of rU, reflecting the tilted portfolio effect (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a positive covariance between multiplicative growth rate and population weight, cov(i,wi)0, can add to ensemble growth as highlighted in scale transition theory (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, connecting multiple random variables (w¯i and i2) can lead to elevated growth of the combined variable through both the tilted portfolio effect and stochastic resonance (16, 17), with the extreme case of a Parrondo game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, positive temporal autocorrelation (0less_thaniless_than1) in stochastic growth rate can further enhance regional growth via the inflation effect of red environmental noise (9, 10, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these quantities are interconnected in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 to enhance the persistence and growth of landscape ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expanded framework of landscape demography could contribute to the eventual design of a unified platform for multisite population viability analysis and regional inference (19, 37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Demography_Accumulation_Curve  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We define the demography accumulation curve (DAC) as the parametric forms of rU and U2 with an increasing number of local populations in the ensemble (z); see Supporting Information for an example (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, the DAC can be estimated as the rarefaction curve of ensemble demographies for a given number of randomly selected nonoverlapping local populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAC serves two purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it can serve to examine the adequacy of a regional survey; that is, whether a sufficient number of local populations have been included in the sampled ensemble so that the DAC starts to approach its asymptote, if one exists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional inference (e.g., whether the species is expanding or contracting at regional scales) and cross-region comparison can be made on asymptotes of landscape demographies or rarefied values under equal survey coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the DAC implies changes in behavior of a landscape ensemble at different ensemble sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistence and survival at regional scales require a minimum number of local populations, and this minimum threshold of ensemble size is related to multiple demographic quantities (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3): Negative covariance of growth (ijless_than0), positive growth-density covariance (cov(i,wi)0), red environmental noise (0less_thaniless_than1), and large fluctuations (large i2; Fig S2) can reduce this threshold of regional persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Management could target these quantities to ensure that the ensemble size for threatened (invasive) species is above (below) the threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_DAC_of_Gypsy_Moth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The level of defoliation from the forest pest L. dispar, used as a proxy of population size, has been intensively surveyed in northeastern United States since 1975 (3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed annual time series (19752010) for 84 64 × 64-km quadrats based on the USDA Forest Service dataset, covering ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  350,000 km2 (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence that the RGR is an unbiased metric of population demography for L. dispar is provided in Fig 3, with the notable statistical artifact of Taylors power law from a skewed size distribution (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to calculate means and (co)variances of local population RGRs (Dataset S1) for 38 quadrats (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAC of U demonstrated a clear upward trend with an increasing number of included populations, shifting from negative to positive at z = 30 (Fig 4A), indicating growth inflation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAC of U2 eventually declined when z  15 (Fig 4B), indicating volatility reduction through portfolio diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual ensemble RGRs (blue lines in Fig 4C) fluctuated strongly within a belt perpendicular to the efficient frontier, showing that the annual ensemble RGR and its variance are negatively correlated (as expected in a system prone to massive outbreaks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DACs of gypsy moths point to a minimum of 30 local populations to be monitored for meaningful, qualitatively correct, regional inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The theory developed here provides tools for estimating ensemble mean RGRs and their variances, which may change nonlinearly across scales (i.e., the DAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Useful extensions of this theory may include the role of nonstationarity, density dependence, and spatial autocorrelation in time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gypsy moth example suggests a strategic approach for invasive species: If we can drive ensembles below the sizes at which growth inflation and/or volatility reduction operate, we may be able to achieve regional control; for threatened species, there can be a critical threshold for the number of populations below which regional extinction is likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results point to mechanisms of regional persistence that do not follow from local demographic results and are not possible under classic metapopulation models, where regional persistence results from a dynamic colonizationextinction balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistence in a landscape portfolio can be enhanced through inflated growth and reduced volatility largely due to the tilted portfolio effect for covarying populations with comparable magnitudes of variability, which is distinct from existing stochastic demography theories that focus on the roles of growth-density covariance, temporal autocorrelation, and stochastic resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the attainable set of landscape portfolios and the DAC of ensemble mean and variance suggest tools for regional population management for both threatened and invasive species through changing the relative weights and other demographic quantities of, as well as the covariance between, target populations and pinpointing the minimum number of populations for reliable regional-scale decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used population time series to calculate annual RGRs of local populations and their means, variances, and covariances; expected ensemble RGR and its variance are found from these using properties of the lognormal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting the expected ensemble RGR and its variance, for all possible relative weights of local populations, permits visualization of the possible ensemble growth rate and its variance and identification of the maximum RGR given a level of volatility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derive a general expression for the expected ensemble RGR, permitting connections to other theories of stochastic demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduce the DAC, the expectation and variance of ensemble RGR as a function of the number of local populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAC, as estimated with rarefaction curves from gypsy moth populations, permits inference on the action of growth inflation and volatility reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
