Case for the genetic code as a triplet of triplets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genetic code for life is a triplet base code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that adjacent codons can influence translation of a given codon and that codon pair biases occur throughout nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that mRNA translation at a given codon can be affected by the two previous codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented here support a model in which the evolutionary selection pressure on a single codon is over five successive codons, including synonymous codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work provides a foundation for the interpretation of how single DNA base changes might affect translation over multiple codons and should be considered in the characterization of the effects of DNA base changes on human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The efficiency of codon translation in vivo is controlled by many factors, including codon context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a site early in the Salmonella flgM gene, the effects on translation of replacing codons Thr6 and Pro8 of flgM with synonymous alternates produced a 600-fold range in FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synonymous changes at Thr6 and Leu9 resulted in a twofold range in FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of FlgM activity produced by any codon arrangement was directly proportional to the degree of in vivo ribosome stalling at synonymous codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synonymous codon suppressors that corrected the effect of a translation-defective synonymous flgM allele were restricted to two codons flanking the translation-defective codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The various codon arrangements had no apparent effects on flgM mRNA stability or predicted mRNA secondary structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that efficient mRNA translation is determined by a triplet-of-triplet genetic code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the efficiency of translating a particular codon is influenced by the nature of the immediately adjacent flanking codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A model explains these codon-context effects by suggesting that codon recognition by elongation factor-bound aminoacyl-tRNA is initiated by hydrogen bond interactions between the first two nucleotides of the codon and anticodon and then is stabilized by base-stacking energy over three successive codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_Effects_of_Synonymous_Codon_Changes_Adjacent_to_Ser7_on_FlgM_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The assay system described below involves the FlgM protein of Salmonella, which coordinates flagellar gene expression and flagellum assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FlgM binds and inhibits a flagellum-specific transcription factor, 28, before completion of the flagellar motor (the hook basal body).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the flagellar motor is completed, unassociated FlgM is conducted out of the cell through the completed flagellar motor, thereby freeing internal 28 and stimulating the transcription of flagellar genes whose products are needed following motor completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins include the external flagellar filament and chemosensory proteins (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our work on the effect of synonymous mutations in codon translation began with the isolation of a tRNA mutant in which translation of flgM mRNA was reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant resulted from a GA base change at position 10 within the D-stem of the essential serT tRNA [tRNA(cmo5UGA)(Ser)] (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation resulted in a defect in the translation of the UCA codon for amino acid 7 of FlgM (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are dozens of UCA codons in the more than 50 genes required for flagellum production and chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we were surprised that this serT mutant was perfectly motile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why did the mutant apparently translate the many UCA codons of all the flagellar genes normally but fail to translate the UCA codon efficiently in flgM?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seemed possible that the defect in flgM translation might be caused by context effects of codons flanking the UCA codon for amino acid 7 (Ser7) of FlgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Ser7 UCA codon in flgM is flanked at the 5 side by a threonine codon, ACC (Thr6), and at the 3 side by the proline CCU (Pro8) codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to determine whether codons adjacent to the UCA codon for Ser7 affected its translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid effects of amino acid substitutions on FlgM activity, we focused on synonymous codon changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synonymous changes at Thr6 and Pro8 would not affect the amino acid sequence of FlgM protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any effects of adjacent, synonymous substitutions would be limited to effects on mRNA secondary structure and mRNA stability or translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If synonymous changes at Thr6 and Pro8 affected the ability of the ribosome to translate the Ser7 UCA triplet because of codon-context effects, then the levels of FlgM protein could increase or decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slight changes in the level of this protein are detected easily because of the effect of FlgM on the regulation of flagellar gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four triplets encode Thr (ACN), and four others encode Pro (CCN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are 16 possible silent change combinations at codons 6 and 8 of flgM that do not change the translated FlgM amino acid sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assayed the effects of these 16 combinations on FlgM production in a wild-type serT+ background by scoring 28-dependent transcription of luminescence operon transcribed from a 28-dependent promoter (PmotA-lux) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of FlgM causes an increase in 28-dependent transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of synonymous changes at Thr6 and Pro8 on FlgM activity are presented in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 16 context backgrounds exhibited a  greater than 600-fold range in FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that codon context has a profound effect on flgM mRNA translation through the UCA Ser7 codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, various pairs of synonymous changes at positions Thr6 ACN and Pro8 CCN showed synergistic context effects on translation of the central Ser7 UCA codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single change of the Pro8 codon in the wild-type sequence from CCU to CCG (with the Thr6 codon unchanged) resulted in about a 20-fold reduction in FlgM activity (FlgM activity was 0.053 of wild type).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single change in the wild-type sequence of the Thr6 codon from ACC to ACU resulted in an 11-fold increase in FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the synonymous changes at Thr6 ACN and Pro8 CCN affected flgM translation independently, then the effect of combining codon changes at these positions should be additive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combination of CCU to CCG at Pro8 and ACC to ACU at Thr6 produced a synergistic effect on flgM mRNA translation that resulted in a 34-fold increase in FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synonymous codon changes had no apparent effects on flgM mRNA secondary structure or stability (SI Results, Table S1, Dataset S1, and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our results demonstrate that translation of the Ser7 UCA codon is dependent on both the 5 and 3 flanking codons and that the synergistic effects on translation of the central codon depend on context effects extending over three codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these synonymous changes had no apparent effect on flgM mRNA secondary structure or stability, our results suggests that the ribosome senses at least three consecutive triplet codons during the process of translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Reduced_Translation_at_Pro8_CCG_of_flgM_Is_Context_Dependent  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The severely reduced FlgM activity caused by the synergistic effects of the Pro8 CCG codon and the Thr6 ACC codon were not seen with the other Thr6 synonymous codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the Thr6 ACC codon was replaced by ACU, ACA, or ACG in combination with CCG at Pro8, we observed FlgM activities increased by 34-, 11-, and 6.7-fold above wild type, respectively (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the defect in translation of flgM mRNA with the Pro8 CCG substitution was caused by context, we wondered if translation of Pro8 CCG could be sensitive to synonymous changes on the 3 side of Pro8 at Leu9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If synonymous changes at Leu9 did not affect Pro8 CCG translation, then FlgM activities would be expected to remain low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All six Leu9 codons were constructed adjacent to Pro8 CCG with wild-type codons at Thr6 (ACC) and Ser7 (UCA), and the cells were assessed for FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An 11-fold range in FlgM activity levels was observed for the six Leu9 codons when adjacent to Pro8 CCG (Thr6 ACC), suggesting that translation at CCG could be context dependent on both 5 and 3 codons (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Severe_Translation_Defect_at_Thr6_ACC-Ser7_UCA-Pro8_CCG_of_FlgM_Results_in_Ribosome_Pausing_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the tests described above, it was assumed that the 20-fold reduction in the in vivo FlgM activity for the CCU-to-CCG synonymous codon change at Pro8 was caused by reduced translation of flgM mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this assumption, we set up an assay for ribosome pausing to see if the reduction in flgM translation correlated with a pause in ribosome translation of Pro8 CCG in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pausing assay uses a flgMlacZ gene fusion that allows lacZ to be translated independently of flgM if translation is stalled at Pro8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flgM and lacZ genes were placed in a single operon where they were transcribed into a single mRNA but could be translated independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells with this structure were phenotypically FlgM+, LacZ+, and the LacZ protein was easily identified by Western blot using anti-LacZ antibody, as shown in Fig 3A, lane 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flgM and lacZ genes were fused so that the 5 end of the flgM coding sequence contained a ribosome-binding site (RBS), and the lacZ part of the fusion started with a GTG start codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With no stalling, translation would produce a single fusion protein including both FlgM and LacZ sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If ribosomes stalled upstream in flgM at Pro8 CCG codon, this stalling would expose the downstream RBS and allow lacZ to be translated independently of flgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When full-length flgM was fused to lacZ, the larger FlgMLacZ protein fusion product was observed (Fig 3A, lane 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased transcription of the flgM promoter allowed us to detect a small amount of LacZ in addition to the FlgMLacZ fusion (Fig 3A, lane 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower-molecular-weight (MW) LacZ band could result from translation restart at lacZ or from protein degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introduction of the CCUCCG codon change at Pro8 resulted in decreased FlgMLacZ fusion product (Fig 3A, lane 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in a strain allowing increased transcription from the flgM promoter, the CCUCCG codon change at Pro8 resulted in a substantial increase of the lower band corresponding to LacZ alone as well as in the FlgMLacZ fusion band (Fig 3A, lane 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the lower-MW LacZ band resulting from the CCUCCG synonymous change at Pro8 is consistent with a pause in translation at Pro8 that resulted in translation reinitiation downstream within the flgMlacZ coding sequence to produce the shorter LacZ band observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this observation, a UAG stop codon was introduced at the Pro8 position in the flgMlacZ gene fusion construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the Pro8 CCU-to-UAG (stop codon) change produced no full-length FlgMLacZ protein; only the lower-MW LacZ band was observed, indicating translation of lacZ independent of flgM translation in the flgMlacZ fusion construct (Fig 3A, lane 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result also indicated that the flgMlacZ mRNA was stable in the absence of full flgM translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the stalling of translation at codon Pro8 CCG, which resulted in a substantial reinitiation of translation downstream and producing the lower-MW product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the effect of the serT tRNA mutant that previously was shown to be defective in translating the Ser7 UCA codon of flgM on flgMlacZ translation of the Pro8 CCU and Pro8 CCG constructs (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of a flgMlacZ transcriptional fusion in which flgM and lacZ are translated independently (Fig 3A, lane 1) is repeated in Fig 3B, lane 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, reduction in the level of FlgMLacZ fusion was observed by the Pro8 CCUCCG change (Fig 3B, lanes 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a strain background with increased transcription from the flgM promoter, the lower-MW LacZ band accumulates in the presence of Pro8 CCG change (Fig 3B, lanes 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the serT mutant we observe a decrease in FlgMLacZ levels but not in the lower-MW LacZ band (Fig 3B, lanes 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the serT mutant is significantly defective in flgMlacZ translation relative to translation of lacZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Effects_of_Synonymous_Codon_Changes_at_Thr6_and_Leu9_on_FlgM_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We looked for synergistic effects of synonymous changes at codons Thr6 and Leu9, which are separated by two triplet codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, there are four synonymous codons for Thr (ACN) and six codons for Leu (UUA/G and UCN), including 24 possible silent change combinations that do not change the translated FlgM amino acid sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assayed these 24 combinations for FlgM regulatory activity; the results are shown in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the range in FlgM regulatory activity varied from a 10% reduction in FlgM activity to a 22-fold increase in FlgM activity over wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the most part, the contributions of synonymous changes at Thr6 and Leu9 were additive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any dramatic synergistic effects as we did with synonymous combinations of Thr6 and Pro8 codons on Ser7 reading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did observe small synergistic effects resulting in an approximately twofold synergistic effect on FlgM activity for the Thr6 ACG substitution in combination with the Leu9 CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG substitutions (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining changes in FlgM activity caused by the synonymous Thr6 and Leu9 combinations could be accounted for by additive changes of the single synonymous substitutions at Thr6 and Leu9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports the conclusion that if the ribosome does sense more than three consecutive triplet codons during the process of translation, the effect is small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_Synonymous_Suppressor_Mutations_of_Pro8_CCG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above data suggest that the translation of a specific codon can be influenced significantly by the adjacent two codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither mRNA secondary structure nor mRNA stability appeared to be a factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is very difficult to rule completely out the effects of mRNA secondary structure and mRNA stability on translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to rule out further the effects of mRNA secondary structure and stability on translation, we set up a genetic assay to look for more long-distance effects of flgM mRNA changes affecting codons for amino acids 2 through 25 on translation of the Pro8 CCG allele of flgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A doped oligonucleotide mutagenesis of the region of flgM mRNA encoding amino acids 225 was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technical details of the doped oligonucleotide synthesis limited our experiment to codons 225.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligonucleotide mutagenesis was designed so that, on average, each oligo had one synonymous codon change for amino acids 225.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that if the 20-fold reduced FlgM activity of the Pro8 CCU-to-CCG change was caused by an effect on mRNA secondary structure, suppressors might be obtained throughout the amino acid 225 region that significantly increased FlgM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if translation of a given codon is influenced by the two adjacent codons, we expected significant suppression of the Pro8 CCG translation defect to occur in the region including the two codons before (Thr6 and Ser7) and the two codons after (Leu9 and Lys10) Pro8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the doped synonymous mutagenesis of amino acids 225 in the Pro8 CCG background are presented in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synonymous changes that significantly suppressed the FlgM inhibitory activity of Pro8 CCG are shown in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes resulting in partial suppression are shown in blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show that the doped oligonucleotide mutagenesis covered the entire region, 10 colonies that showed no suppression of the Pro8 CCG allele were sequenced and are shown in black.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The synonymous changes that suppressed the Pro8 CCG alleles to give wild-type FlgM activity included all three possible synonymous substitutions at Thr6, all three possible synonymous substitutions at Ser7, and the UUG-to-UUA substitution at Leu9, which we earlier showed increased FlgM activity of the Pro8 CCG allele sixfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For technical reasons, the CUN Leu9 synonymous substitutions, which also suppressed the CCG translation defect (Fig 2B), were not included in this experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only synonymous changes in the two codons (Thr6 and Ser7) preceding Pro8 and the Leu9 codon following Pro8 CCG resulted in restoration to levels near that of wild-type FlgM inhibitory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support our assertion that the efficiency of translation of a specific codon is dependent on the flanking two codons and that our observed effects are caused primarily by codon context and not by mRNA secondary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Effect_of_Gene_Location_on_the_CCU-to-CCG_Translation_Defect_in_the_Context_of_Thr-Ser-Pro-Leu-Lys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Codon bias effects on translation are enriched at the N terminus of genes (913).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered if the translating ribosome might transition from a translation initiation mode through the N terminus, which is strongly influenced by the presence of rare codons, codon context, mRNA secondary structure, tRNA modifications, and other translation factors, into a more robust translation machine that is less affected by these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Boël et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  determined that the codon choice in the initial 20 codons of Escherichia coli transcripts correlated with translation efficiency and mRNA stability (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the translational defect of Pro8 CCG in flgM was caused by its N-terminal location and whether translational reinitiation affected mRNA stability, we constructed two fusion constructs with the Thr6-Ser7-Pro8-Leu9-Lys10 codons of flgM at different gene locations with either CCU or CCG at the Pro position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One construct placed codons 185 of flgM to a lacZ under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter to remove any possible autoregulatory effects of flgM on its own transcription and lacked both the RBS region at the C terminus of flgM and a separate start codon for lacZ (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second construct was identical except that codons 160 of flgM in the fusion were replaced with codons 160 of fliA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring -gal activity under arabinose-inducing conditions, we are measuring a direct effect of the Pro8 CCG change on flgMlacZ translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the flgM(185)lacZ construct, a change from Pro8 CCU to CCG reduced -gal activity about sevenfold, but in this case mRNA levels also were reduced by about fourfold (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of a duplicated copy of codons Thr6 through Lys10 of flgM after amino acid codon 26 still produced a translation defect of 30% when the middle Pro codon was changed from CCU to CCG in the inserted fragment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insertion of flgM codons Thr6 through Lys10 alone resulted in a twofold reduction in mRNA levels, but here the CCU to CCG change had no effect on mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inserting flgM codons Thr6 through Lys10 after codon 56 had no effect on either -gal activity or mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the fliA(160)flgM(6185)lacZ construct, flgM codons Thr6 through Lys10 were separately inserted after amino acids 5, 26, and 56 with either the CCU or CCG proline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both -gal and mRNA levels were reduced similarly with Pro-CCG at all three positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support our hypothesis that translation of a given codon can be influenced by the two preceding codons and that a given codon can influence the translation of the following two codons, at least within the first 60 codons of a gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effect_of_Synonymous_Changes_at_Codons_Thr6_and_Pro8_of_flgM_on_mRNA_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To rule out effects of the Thr6 and Pro8 substitutions on flgM mRNA stability, we determined the flgM mRNA levels for the different Thr6Pro8 synonymous combinations by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substitution combinations with a wide range of FlgM activities chosen for comparison with the wild type (Thr6:ACC Pro8:CCU) were Thr6:ACU Pro8:CCU (FlgM activity increased 11-fold), Thr6:ACG Pro8:CCU (FlgM activity increased 13-fold), Thr6:ACU Pro8:CCG (FlgM activity decreased 20-fold), Thr6:ACC Pro8:CCG (FlgM activity increased 34-fold), and Thr6:ACG Pro8:CCG (FlgM activity increased 6.7-fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant effect on flgM mRNA levels was observed, suggesting that the synonymous substitutions did not affect flgM mRNA stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assayed mRNA levels of the 28-dependent fliC gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the levels of fliC mRNA varied in accordance with the FlgM activities reported in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Synonymous_Changes_at_Codons_Thr6_and_Leu9_of_flgM_on_mRNA_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the effects of Thr6Leu9 synonymous combinations on flgM mRNA stability for six combinations, including wild-type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substitution combinations with a range of FlgM activities chosen for comparison with the wild type (Thr6:ACC Leu9:UUG) were Thr6:ACG Leu9:UUG (FlgM activity increased 13-fold), Thr6:ACC Leu9:CUC (FlgM activity increased 1.1-fold), Thr6:ACG Leu9:CUC (FlgM activity increased 4.5-fold), Thr6:ACC Leu9:CUG (FlgM activity decreased 0.9-fold), and Thr6:ACG Leu9:CUG FlgM activity (increased 4.9-fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight (20%) reduction for only the Thr6:ACC Leu9:CUC was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other synonymous codon effects on flgM mRNA levels were observed, suggesting that the synonymous substitutions did not affect flgM mRNA stability (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again the mRNA levels for the 28-dependent fliC gene were determined for the Thr6 Leu9 synonymous combinations, and the levels of fliC mRNA varied in accordance with FlgM activities reported in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Predicted_mRNA_Secondary_Structural_Effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for possible mRNA secondary structure effects, predicted folding energies of the flgM mRNA were calculated on a window-by-window basis for all 16 codon variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted folding energies were calculated using RNAfold of ViennaRNA package v2.0.2 (25) on overlapping 30-nt windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check whether the codon variants of flgM cluster in the RNA secondary space, an alignment- and folding-free clustering algorithm for RNA secondary structures, called NoFold, was used (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm clustered the 16 variants into four clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of each cluster and the consensus structure for each cluster are presented in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find no clear pattern between the identities of the sequences within a cluster and the luminescence patterns observed in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the predicted secondary structure of the 16 variants for Thr6 and Pro8 of flgM mRNA to determine if the rank order of folding energies in any window correlates with the rank order of expression in the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the predicted mRNA folding energies in windows around the Ser6 codon varied considerably with synonymous changes in codon context, we found no clear pattern between the folding energies of flgM mRNA and its activity based on luminescence assays (Table S1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that variations in mRNA secondary structure are not the cause for the variations in FlgM activity observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe a sensitive translation assay involving a regulatory gene, flgM, and show that translation of a particular codon is heavily influenced by two adjacent codons 5 and one adjacent codon 3 to the codon being translated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression assays used in this study took advantage of FlgM being a regulatory gene that works in a one:one stoichiometry with the 28 transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, small changes in FlgM protein levels would result in signal amplification on 28-dependent transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amplification of signal allowed us to observe the effects of small changes in flgM mRNA translation on the expression of reporter constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed synonymous codon-context effects on translation and conclude that the translation of a given codon can be influenced significantly by up to two flanking codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, when EF-Tu bound to an aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site at a particular codon, two preceding codons can affect the correct-fit determination by EF-Tu and the resulting translation efficiency of that codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar fashion, that codon can influence the translation of the next two codons being translated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since 1980 investigation of the effects of codon context on translation has focused primarily on codon pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their seminal paper, Bossi and Roth determined that the translation of a UAG codon by an amber suppresser tRNA was highly influenced by the adjacent codons (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been known for decades that highly expressed genes in bacteria and yeast exhibit codon pair biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern high-throughput technologies (genetic selection being the classical high-throughput technology) can identify adjacent codon pairs through tens of thousands of combinations that modulate translation efficiency (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing codon-pair biases on a genomic scale has proven an effective way to attenuate viruses in making effective live vaccines (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the effects of biased codon pairs are caused by changes in the translation speed of various proteins (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar methods that include codon pair speeds in designing attenuated essential genes may aid in the design of live bacterial vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data suggest that in thinking about context effects one should consider codon triplets in addition to codon pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that the translation of a specific codon can depend on the two codons flanking the codon being translated in a nonadditive manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the second codon of a given gene, both the P-site and E-site of the ribosome are occupied when elongation factor EF-Tu bound to a charged aminoacyl-tRNA species brings nascent charged tRNA to an empty A site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that upon docking an aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site, the efficiency with which EF-Tu translates that codon is influenced by adjacent codons and bound tRNA species in addition to the specific codonanticodon interaction at the A site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our working model for the effect of two adjacent codons on specific codon translation is diagrammed in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, GTP-bound elongation factor EF-Tu (purple) directs a charged tRNA to the A site of the ribosome through WatsonCrick pairing of the first two bases in the translating triplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency with which this codon is translated depends on the stability of the anticodoncodon interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this stability is dependent on base-stacking energy, which is influenced by at least the two flanking codons in the mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also propose that the stability of the anticodoncodon interactions is influenced by modifications of the tRNAs that affect interaction with the ribosomal A, P, and E sites and by protein or noncoding RNA translation factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synonymous changes will lead to differences in translation rates that, especially when different tRNAs are used, have different binding efficiencies, abundances, and charging rates and result in differential mRNA stabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the same tRNA reads different codons with different efficiencies, as was determined in an in vivo translational speedometer assay system (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that codon recognition is initiated by codonanticodon hydrogen bonding between the first and second bases of the translated codon followed by sensing the correct fit at the wobble base and base-stacking interactions contributed by the preceding two codons and bound tRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tRNA molecules of every organism are modified extensively, and the majority of modifications occur at the antiwobble position of the anticodon loop and at the base immediately 3 to the anticodon (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [Thirteen other bases positions are modified to a lesser extent in tRNA species of E. coli and Salmonella enterica (7).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The base adjacent to the 3 anticodon position, the cardinal nucleotide, also varies among species and is thought to affect codon recognition significantly (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modifications influence the stacking energy of the bases during codonanticodon pairing (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translation proofreading steps catalyzed by EF-Tu and EF-G, which sense hydrogen bonding and stacking energy to determine if the correct codonanticodon pairing has occurred, are influenced by the adjacent codons, possibly resulting in the codon-context effects we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, many tRNA-modifying proteins are present in only one of the three kingdoms of life (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, specific tRNA modifications that affect wobble base recognition and contribute to the base-stacking forces during translation can determine specific codon-context effects by adjacent synonymous codons on specific codon translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such effects of specific tRNA modifications on codon translation could account for the different codon pair biases observed in species that are evolutionarily distant (possessing different specific tRNA modifications) and also could account for the difficulty in expressing proteins in heterologous systems, i.e., expressing proteins from plant and mammalian systems in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MiaA (i6A37) modification has recently been shown to affect mRNA translation in E. coli in a codon context-dependent manner, supporting our overall hypothesis (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translation of proline codons in the mgtL peptide transcript of Salmonella was recently shown to be affected by mutations defective in ribosomal proteins L27, L31, elongation factor EF-P, and TrmD, which catalyzes the m1G37 methylation of proline tRNA (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modification of tRNA species in E. coli also has been shown to vary with the growth phase of the cell (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific codon-context effects could represent translation domains of life based on tRNA modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difficulty for natural selection would be in finding codon optimization for a given gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the speed through a codon is dependent on the 5 and 3 flanking codons, and the flanking codons are dependent on their 5 and 3 flanking codons, then selection pressure on a single codon is exerted over five successive codons, which represent 615 or 844,596,301 codon combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If modified tRNAs interact with bases in a codon context-dependent manner that differs among species depending on differences in tRNA modifications, ribosome sequences, and ribosomal and translation factor proteins, it is easy to understand why many genes are poorly expressed in heterologous expression systems in which codon use is the primary factor in the design of coding sequences for foreign protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential impact of differences in tRNA modifications represents a significant challenge in designing genes for maximal expression whether by natural selection or in the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Targeted chromosomal mutagenesis was carried out via the tetRA insertion and replacement with the -Red recombinase system as described previously (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, the DNA synthesis Core Facility of the University of Utah, or Eton Biosciences, Inc. All PCR and fillin reactions were performed using a proofreading polymerase (Phusion; Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant products mediated by -Red were confirmed by sequencing analyses at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility of the University of Utah or Eton Biosciences, Inc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Construction_of_FlgM_Thr6_and_Pro8_Synonymous_Codon_Combinations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synonymous changes at amino acid positions Thr6 and Pro8 in FlgM were constructed by -Redmediated recombination using a large primer, FlgM-ACN-TCA-CCN, which was made double stranded with primer flgMfillinNNN using Phusion polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA fragment was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 10 L of Milli-Q water (Millipore), and electroporated into strain TH18446, which contained a tetRA cassette deleting amino acids 68 of FlgM [pKD46/fla-5398 (serT) flgM8081::tetRA (AA68) flgG-L2157 fliC5050::MudJ].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were plated on ATc plates at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinants were isolated on LB plates and were assessed on MacConkey lactose and X-gal plates for color variation; the colonies with the largest range of colors were sent for sequencing analysis to obtain the maximum codon combination in the initial screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Codon combinations not obtained in the initial screen were constructed individually to cover the 16 codon combinations with the same sequence primer as for FlgM-ACN-TCA-CCN but with the specific codons instead of N. Strain combinations in a serT+ background were obtained by moving the serT+ allele from strain LT2 into the 16 strains produced by P22 transduction as described above and selection for growth at 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The third base was doped with 97, 98, or 99% of the correct base (third base indicated) and was replaced with the mixture in parenthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-base doping was 99% correct and was 1% A, C, G, or T. Two-base doping was for only a single triplet att at 98% with mixture M (A,C) added at 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-base doping is 97% correct base with mixtures H (A,C,T), B (C,G,T), V (A,C,G), or D (A,G,T) added at 3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This oligonucleotide was made double-stranded by primer fillin with the primer flgM1fillin and was electroporated into strain TH21456 and plated on ATc plates at 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve hundred colonies were picked and patched on ATc plates, replica-printed onto Tz-Lac indicator plates, screened for Tz-Lac red colonies, and analyzed by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
