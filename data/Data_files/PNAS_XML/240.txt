Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient cost-effective single-molecule sequencing platforms will facilitate deciphering complete genome sequences, determining haplotypes, and identifying alternatively spliced mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a single-molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis approach that accurately distinguishes four DNA bases by electronically detecting and differentiating four different polymer tags attached to the terminal phosphate of the nucleotides during their incorporation into a growing DNA strand in the polymerase reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With nanopore detection, the distinct polymer tags are much easier to differentiate than natural nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After tag release, growing DNA chains consist of natural nucleotides allowing long reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing is realized on an electronic chip containing an array of independently addressable electrodes, each with a single polymerasenanopore complex, potentially offering the high throughput required for precision medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers a robust platform to decipher nucleic acid sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we reported a single-molecule nanopore-based SBS strategy that accurately distinguishes four bases by electronically detecting and differentiating four different polymer tags attached to the 5-phosphate of the nucleotides during their incorporation into a growing DNA strand catalyzed by DNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further developing this approach, we report here the use of nucleotides tagged at the terminal phosphate with oligonucleotide-based polymers to perform nanopore SBS on an -hemolysin nanopore array platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed and synthesized several polymer-tagged nucleotides using tags that produce different electrical current blockade levels and verified they are active substrates for DNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A highly processive DNA polymerase was conjugated to the nanopore, and the conjugates were complexed with primer/template DNA and inserted into lipid bilayers over individually addressable electrodes of the nanopore chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When an incoming complementary-tagged nucleotide forms a tight ternary complex with the primer/template and polymerase, the tag enters the pore, and the current blockade level is measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels displayed by the four nucleotides tagged with four different polymers captured in the nanopore in such ternary complexes were clearly distinguishable and sequence-specific, enabling continuous sequence determination during the polymerase reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, real-time single-molecule electronic DNA sequencing data with single-base resolution were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of these polymer-tagged nucleotides, combined with polymerase tethering to nanopores and multiplexed nanopore sensors, should lead to new high-throughput sequencing methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously demonstrated the ability to identify PEG tags of different lengths by their distinct blockade currents in membranes traversed by a single HL nanopore (8, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instrumentation and testing method used made it possible to record rapid, submillisecond deviations from open current readings (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip containing an independently addressable array of 264 electrodes supporting independent bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the prototype chip, there was a minimum measurement period of 1 ms, which required a revised approach for tag detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows the nanoporepolymerase sequencing engine with a single Phi29 DNA polymerase molecule (26) covalently attached to HL (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polymerase binds primer and template DNA, along with the complementary tagged nucleotide, allowing placement of the tag within the nanopore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The schematic in Fig 1B shows the sequential capture and detection of tagged nucleotides by the nanopore as they are being incorporated into the growing primer strand during the polymerase reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary experiments using streptavidin-bound 3-biotinylated oligonucleotides following published procedures (25) confirmed that it is possible to capture and hold oligonucleotides in chip-based pores and to measure current blockade levels over a period of 502,000 ms or longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A survey of oligonucleotide tags, all based on modifications of oligo dT30, was conducted, yielding the four tags shown in Fig S1 that generate distinguishable current blockade signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sequencing we decided to mimic the experiment that generates the current blockade data shown in Fig S1 by replacing the streptavidintag complex with a DNA polymerase ternary complex that holds the tagged nucleotides (Fig 2), allowing the monitoring of current while the tags are still attached to the nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, detection of the tag occurs before nucleotide incorporation by phosphoryl transfer, rather than after the tags are detached from their nucleotides to pass through the nanopore channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tag detection can be accomplished if the rate of the nucleotide incorporation is slower than the combined rate of nucleotide tag capture by the nanopore and current blockade measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of appropriate polymerase mutants and refined reaction conditions can increase the time the tagged nucleotide is present in the ternary complex, and close tethering, via covalent attachment, of the polymerase to the nanopore can result in rapid tag captures on the order of microseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesis_and_Testing_of_Tagged_Nucleotides_for_Nanopore_SBS_Reactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We designed and synthesized a wide variety of tagged nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After characterization of their properties and performance, we selected a subset of four tagged nucleotides that produce distinct and reproducible reduction in nanopore ionic currents with minimum background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of these tagged nucleotides are shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic strategy is to attach an azide group via a chemical linker to the terminal phosphate of the deoxynucleoside-5-hexaphosphate (dA6P, dC6P, dG6P, and dT6P, the dN6Ps) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tags were oligonucleotide-based polymers synthesized with a 5-alkyne moiety that reacts readily with the desired azido-dN6P by azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (21, 28, 29) to produce the tagged nucleotides (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tagged nucleotides were purified by HPLC, and their molecular weights were determined by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tags consisted of oligodeoxynucleotides (e.g., dT30), some of which are interspersed with modified phosphodiester building blocks having specific base or backbone modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modifications include bulky, charged dyes on the nucleotide base and runs of three or eight abasic (dSpacer, hereafter dSp) sites (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tags were protected at their 3 end from exonuclease activity with 3-phospho-propanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modifications in the dT30 tag sequence were positioned to be at or near the narrowest constriction in the HL channel (24), where they can directly and specifically influence ionic current through the pore when the tagged nucleotide is held by polymerase in the ternary complex attached to the pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate that the nucleotides modified with the polymeric tags were still good substrates for DNA polymerase, single-base extension reactions were performed using Therminator  DNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primerloop templates bearing complementary bases opposite the site of incorporation on the primer were used (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction products were desalted and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S4, successful incorporations of the tagged nucleotides were revealed by the presence of new peaks with the expected mass of the primer-extension products and peaks indicative of the released pentaphosphate tag, along with peaks representing remaining reactants (primer, tagged nucleotide).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional experiments monitoring DNA synthesis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels show that primers can be extended by more than 40 bases using only tagged nucleotides and any of several DNA polymerases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, we show the result of extension reactions using Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (an in silico-designed homologue of Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I, large fragment from New England Biolabs) at 37 Â°C, with reactants and products separated on a polyacrylamide-urea gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primer/template DNA (83-mer) is self-priming and can be extended by 47 nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length products were obtained with either all four natural dNTPs or with the four tagged nucleotides depicted in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assembly_of_HLPolymerase_Complexes_and_Insertion_into_Membranes_on_an_Array_Chip  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To achieve continuous sequencing, we constructed a sequencing engine having a single DNA polymerase molecule attached directly to the heptameric HL nanopore (Fig 1A) using a recombinant technique to make two kinds of HL monomers, one wild type and the other differing only in carrying a specific peptide domain (32) for attaching polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two types of monomers were mixed in appropriate ratios, allowing pore heptamers to self-assemble, followed by isolation of the heptamer pore carrying a single-peptide domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When polymerase engineered to possess the mating protein fragment was added in excess to this heterologous pore, it reacted with the pore monomer tagged with the peptide domain, yielding the desired nanoporepolymerase conjugate (the procedure is described in SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During nanopore SBS, the polymerase attached to the pore tightly binds the DNA template/primer, completing a single structure that integrates itself into a lipid bilayer configured for monitoring transmembrane conductance and ready for sequencing DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When each complementary tagged nucleotide binds the polymeraseprimertemplate complex, its tag rapidly enters the nanopore channel in response to applied voltage to yield a unique current blockade that is recognized for sequence determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequencing experiments were performed using a CMOS nanopore chip (Fig 4) that has an array of 264 Ag-AgCl electrodes (5-Âµm diameter) within shallow wells that support lipid bilayer membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes are individually addressable by a computer interface, allowing voltages to be applied only to the membranes in specific wells and thus effectively permitting independent sequence reads at these locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reagents are introduced into a simple flow cell above the chip using a computer-controlled syringe pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical measurements are made asynchronously at least once every millisecond and are recorded on the computer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An 83-base synthetic primer/template, which self-anneals at both ends to prevent its entry into the nanopore, was added to the porepolymerase complex and pumped over the membranes in a sensor chip flow cell in Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM KCl and 3 mM SrCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied voltage is adjusted to ensure that, in a majority of cases, one and only one pore is inserted into the membranes of each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For preliminary experiments using only a single tagged nucleotide and the noncatalytic divalent metal ion (Sr2+), the tagged nucleotide mix was added to the nanopore chip at room temperature, and current recording was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments established that binding of the tagged nucleotides with the polymerasenanopore conjugate along with the primer and template to form a ternary complex is sequence-dependent and that the current levels for the four nucleotides are readily distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative data for a chemically conjugated polymerasepore complex are shown in Fig S5B and Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nanopore_SBS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For sequencing experiments, a buffer solution containing 150 mM KCl, 3 mM SrCl2, and either 0.1 mM MnCl2 or 3 mM MgCl2 (catalytic divalent cations) and 3 ÂµM each of the four tagged nucleotides was added to the polymerasenanopore chip constructed using the peptide-based conjugation method to start the SBS process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionic currents were measured by applying 80120 mV across the membranes for 310 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequencing data are shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four distinct transient current levels substantially below the open-pore current level [13 pA (Fig 5, Upper) and 16 pA (Fig 5, Lower)] are observed, indicating pore captures of the tags associated with each nucleotide during each cycle of the polymerase reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in accord with the levels observed when only a single tagged nucleotide and only noncatalytic divalent metal (Sr2+) were used (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these traces, the correct sequence order for four (Fig 5, Upper) and 20 bases (Fig 5, Lower), respectively, was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, using the data in Fig 5, Lower as an example, the bulkiest tag, in dA6P-Cy3-dT4-FldT-dT-FldT-dT23-C3, containing two fluorescein-modified dTs (FldT), gave the lowest current (2 pA); the unmodified dT30 tag in dG6P-Cy3-dT30-C3 produced an intermediate current (4 pA), whereas higher currents were observed with the less bulky tags containing stretches of an abasic nucleotide, dSp, in dC6P-Cy3-dT4-dSp3-dT23-C3 (7 pA) and dT6P-Cy3-dT2-dSp8-dT20-C3 (8 pA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many cases (Fig 5, Lower), a nucleotide tag appears to be captured several times in succession (stuttering at a given blockade current level) before the tag of the next nucleotide in the sequence is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stuttering is presumably caused by the tagged nucleotide being repeatedly bound to and released from the polymerase before incorporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stuttering can be reduced by changing experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 6, the use of a 100-mV transmembrane potential and 150 mM KCl, along with 3 mM MgCl2 on the cis side of the membrane and 3 mM SrCl2 on the trans but not on the cis side of the membrane results in less stutter and also decreases the average duration of nucleotide captures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such adjustment in the relative concentration of catalytic and noncatalytic metal cofactors is one means of making the tagged nucleotide incorporation rate slower than the combined rate of tag capture and detection by the pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this example, using a template with alternating homopolymer stretches and carefully considering the duration of each nucleotide capture event, we have obtained nearly perfect sequence reads with minimal stutter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data on homopolymer sequencing are shown in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimization of the average duration of nucleotide capture events should allow further increases in sequencing accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Base calling was carried out by manual inspection of the current level of each deflection, ignoring ones with dwell times less than 10 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the sequencing data (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6 and Fig S6) clearly indicate that our nanopore SBS method is capable of generating clear, sequence-dependent electronic signal streams at the single-molecule level in a continuous process that requires no addition or removal of reagents, sequencing an array of multiple DNA templates in parallel in a short time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the rate of sequencing and overall accuracy of nanopore SBS remain to be established, the system has many parameters that can be optimized further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include synthesis of additional tagged nucleotides that offer better-resolved current blockade signatures, improvement of reaction conditions, and the testing of a variety of DNA polymerases that have improved rates, without the use of SrCl2 to moderate the progression of DNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With careful attention to these details, along with the construction of integrated circuits with many more electrodes and faster measurement capabilities, we expect to be able to create a high-throughput single-molecule electronic DNA sequencing system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conjugation_of_Polymerase_to_the_HL_Nanopore  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Attachment of a polymerase to a single subunit of the HL heptamer was accomplished using either SpyTag and SpyCatcher peptide domains (32) or chemical conjugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SpyTag-based conjugation, an HL pore coupled to a single polymerase molecule was assembled from three proteins: HL native subunits, HL with a C-terminal SpyTag peptide, and 29 polymerase with a C-terminal SpyCatcher peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After first generating the 1:6 (SpyTag monomer/native monomers) HL pore by mixing appropriate ratios of the purified monomers and isolating the 1:6 heptamer by chromatography (33, 34), 29 polymerase-SpyCatcher was added to the assembled HL to allow formation of the polymerasehemolysin conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugates with 1:6 stoichiometry and maintaining the required functionalities were purified and used in subsequent experiments (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For chemical conjugation, we used the DielsAlder fast click reaction (35) shown in Fig S5D to attach Bst DNA polymerase to HL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Bst polymerase molecule containing a single cysteine was reacted with a 100-fold molar excess of 6-methyl-tetrazine (TA)-PEG4-maleimide (Jena Biosciences) for 60 min at room temperature in 1Ã PBS, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a separate tube, an HL heptamer containing a single cysteine at position 46 of only one monomer was reacted with a 100-fold molar excess of trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-PEG3-maleimide (Jena Biosciences) under the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified proteins were concentrated on Amicon 10K spin filters and further purified on a G50 column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TCO-containing pore was reacted overnight at 4 Â°C with a fivefold molar excess of the TA-modified Bst 2.0 polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting polymerasenanopore conjugate was concentrated on a 100K spin filter and isolated on a Superdex 200 column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These protein conjugates were characterized by gel electrophoresis before testing on 264-sensor integrated circuit chips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
