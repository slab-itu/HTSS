Pulses of Ca2+ coordinate actin assembly and exocytosis for stepwise cell extension  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The daynight rhythm in living organisms controls many processes, which then oscillate in a circadian manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there are many processes that appear continuous but the underlying mechanisms oscillate with distinct periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, eukaryotic cells grow by extending their cell periphery in pulses rather than by continuous extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the molecular basis for such oscillatory growth by using the unique tip growth system of filamentous fungi, where actin assembly, exocytosis, and growth rate were observed simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that temporally controlled actin assembly and exocytosis are coordinated by pulsed Ca2+ influxes, resulting in stepwise cell extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism allows the cells to respond more quickly to both internal and environmental cues, including chemical and mechanical stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many eukaryotic cells grow by extending their cell periphery in pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not yet fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a comprehensive model of stepwise cell extension by using the unique tip growth system of filamentous fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live-cell imaging analysis, including superresolution microscopy, revealed that the fungus Aspergillus nidulans extends the hyphal tip in an oscillatory manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of F-actin and secretory vesicles (SV) accumulating at the hyphal tip oscillated with a positive temporal correlation, whereas vesicle amounts were negatively correlated to the growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular Ca2+ level also pulsed with a positive temporal correlation to the amount of F-actin and SV at the hyphal tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two Ca2+ channels, MidA and CchA, were needed for proper tip growth and the oscillations of actin polymerization, exocytosis, and the growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicate a model in which transient Ca2+ pluses cause depolymerization of F-actin at the cortex and promote SV fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby extending the cell tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time, Ca2+ diffuses away and F-actin and SV accumulate again at the hyphal tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide evidence that temporally controlled actin polymerization and exocytosis are coordinated by pulsed Ca2+ influx, resulting in stepwise cell extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oscillation_of_the_Fungal-Tip_Cell-Extension_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the cell-extension rate of hyphae in A. nidulans for 30 min in 10-s intervals (Fig 1A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average cell-extension rate of 1.8 m/min (0.03 m/s) was derived from a kymograph along the growth axis (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the extension distance of the tip position was measured every 20 s (Fig 1C), a line graph showed unevenness and fluctuation of the distance from 0.4 to 1 m in 20 s, indicating pulsed growth of the hyphae (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the dynamics was not reliably measurable as a result of the limited spatial resolution of conventional light microscopy, we applied superresolution photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM) (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We imaged hyphae producing a fusion protein of chitin synthase class III (ChsB), which localizes at the plasma membrane and is transported by the SV (30), and mEosFPthermo using wide-field fluorescence microscopy (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mEosFPthermo, a thermostable, monomeric variant of the green-to-red photoconverting fluorescent protein, EosFP (32, 33), is widely used for conventional fluorescence imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PALM images showed ChsB clusters at the apical membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a moving-window binning technique to generate sequences of PALM images in 20-s intervals for a total duration of 140 s (Fig 1D) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal changes of the apical cell edges were compared in 20-s intervals (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger extensions of the apical membrane were occasionally observed from 40 to 60 s, from 100 to 120 s, and from 120 to 140 s (Fig 1E and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results revealed that the cell-extension rate of hyphae is not constant but varies in an oscillatory manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked whether polymerization of actin and the amount of SV at the hyphal tips correlate with the oscillation of the cell-extension rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F-actin and SV were visualized by fluorescence of GFP-tagged tropomyosin (TpmA) and mCherry-tagged ChsB, respectively (18, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prominent signals were visible at the hyphal tip, and time-resolved recording and frame analysis by kymographs revealed that the signal intensity oscillated (Fig 1 F and G and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The line profiles corresponding to the signal intensity of F-actin (green) and SV (red) indicated oscillations with peaks at similar times (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean interval of the intensity of F-actin peaks was 29 ± 8 s (n = 50 peaks in 20 hyphae), whereas the mean interval of peaks of the SV was comparable to the one of F-actin, 30 ± 7 s (n = 50 peaks in 20 hyphae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the temporal relationship between the presence of F-actin and the SV, we calculated the normalized cross-correlation of their signal intensities (Fig 1I and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value at the central peak is 0.50, indicative of a positive correlation between the signals of F-actin (Fig 1H, green) and the SV (Fig 1H, red) (1 and 1 represent perfect positive and negative correlation, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were a few second delays in the signals of the SV in comparison with the signals of F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that SV accumulate during actin polymerization phases and SV are depleted because of exocytosis during actin depolymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance of tip extension (measured every 20 s) and the SV signal showed a negative correlation (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Negative_Correlation_Between_the_SV_Amount_at_Hyphal_Tips_and_the_Cell-Extension_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, is advantageous for cell imaging because of its larger cell size, faster cell-extension rate, and more distinct Spitzenkörper (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-extension rate of N. crassa was 10 times faster (0.2 m/s) than the one of A. nidulans (Fig 2 A and B and Movie S3) and oscillated between 0.15 and 0.45 m/s (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP-tagged chitin synthase class III (CHS-1) continuously localized to the Spitzenkörper at the hyphal tip (Fig 2A) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal intensity of CHS-1GFP at the Spitzenkörper was displayed in a kymograph along the growth axis (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The line graph indicates oscillations of the GFP intensity (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean period between peaks was 17 ± 6 s (n = 30 peaks in 4 hyphae) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The signal intensity of CHS-1GFP at the Spitzenkörper and the hyphal cell-extension rate were measured every 2 s (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the GFP intensity increased, the cell-extension rate decreased, whereas a decrease in the GFP intensity was accompanied by an increase in the cell-extension rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized cross-correlation analysis yielded a clear negative correlation between CHS-1GFP intensity and cell-extension rate, with a value of 0.54 at the central peak (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results again reveal that SV accumulate at the hyphal tip during slow growth phases and that the SV amount decreases by active exocytosis during fast growth phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sometimes, the Spitzenkörper moved from the center of the hyphal apex to the left or to the right; up and down movement was not resolved in our experiment (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the cell-extension rate in N. crassa was 10 times faster than that of A. nidulans, the oscillation period of SV accumulation of N. crassa was half that of A. nidulans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears that faster growing hyphae exhibit shorter oscillation periods of their cell extension (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracellular_Ca2+_Oscillation_Synchronizes_Actin_Polymerization_and_SV_Accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intracellular Ca2+ levels regulate actin assembly and vesicle fusion (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red-fluorescent Ca2+ biosensor R-GECO was produced in A. nidulans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No obvious morphological changes of the cells because of the expression of the foreign protein were observed under the tested conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R-GECO emission varies with the concentration of Ca2+ (Fig S2A) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When grown in media supplemented with 1 M CaCl2, pulses of the R-GECO signal were observed (Fig 3A and Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R-GECO pulses in Fig 3A were visualized in a kymograph as sharp lines and quantified in a line graph (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean interval between peaks was 26 ± 7 s (n = 52 peaks in 15 hyphae) (Fig 3D), comparable to the one of F-actin and the SV (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R-GECO signal appeared as a tip-high gradient and diffused backward (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each hypha showed the signal with different timing (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such R-GECO pulses continued for multiple times before they disappeared (maximum n = 8 in 180 s), probably because of a limited turnover of R-GECO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence of R-GECO could not be detected in media without CaCl2 or with 1 M CaCl2 + 10 mM EGTA (Fig S3 A and B), indicating that the increase of the intracellular Ca2+ level is induced by the influx of Ca2+ to the cells at hyphal tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R-GECO pulses were observed with this method in rapidly growing hyphae but not in germlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compared the signals of R-GECO and GFP-TpmA (F-actin) or BglA-GFP (-glycosidase, secreted protein as a marker for the SV) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fungal cells producing R-GECO and GFP-TpmA, cultured in medium supplemented with 1 M CaCl2, showed oscillating signals of GFP and R-GECO (Fig 3E and Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kymographs along the growth axis indicated temporal changes of signal intensities (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Line profiles corresponding to the signal intensities of F-actin (Fig 3E, green) and the Ca2+ concentration (Fig 3E, red) at the tip indicated that oscillations of peak intensities had similar periods (29 ± 8 and 26 ± 7 s, respectively) and were synchronized (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized cross-correlation analysis yielded a positive correlation between the concentrations of F-actin (Fig 3F, green) and Ca2+ (Fig 3F, red), with the central peak at 0.40 (Fig 3G) and indicated that the peaks of Ca2+ appeared a few seconds earlier than those of F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with the notion that Ca2+ influx at the growing hypha induces actin depolymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hyphae producing R-GECO and BglA-GFP (SV) showed oscillations of the GFP intensity at the tip and R-GECO pulses (Fig 3H and Movie S6), with similar periods (30 ± 7 and 26 ± 7 s, respectively), which were synchronized (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized cross-correlation analysis yielded a positive correlation with a central peak value of 0.43 (Fig 3J) and a few seconds delay of BglA-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that Ca2+ influx affords exocytosis mediated by fusion of the SV with the plasma membrane, as well as actin depolymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ca2+_Channels_Coordinate_Ca2+_Influx__Actin_Polymerization__and_Cell-Extension_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several Ca2+ channels, pumps, and transporters function in different organelles, such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, mitochondria, and vacuole in fungi (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane, Mid1 and Cch1p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae share the single pathway that responds to environmental stresses and ensures cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of these orthologs in A. nidulans, midA and cchA, caused a defect in polarized growth and cell wall synthesis (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of midA or cchA often caused abnormal branching and de-polarized hyphae (Fig 4A and Fig S3C), and addition of 10 mM CaCl2 partially restored normal morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence imaging showed no pulse of R-GECO fluorescence in the midA- or cchA-deletion strain grown in the media supplemented with 1 M CaCl2, and no oscillation of actin polymerization determined by GFP-TpmA fluorescence (Fig 4B and Fig S3D), in contrast to the wild-type (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No oscillation of the cell-extension rate was apparent (Fig 4C), and cell extension in the deletion strain was too slow for microscopy to show the oscillations of the hyphal tip extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of 10 mM CaCl2 occasionally caused Ca2+ entry into the deletion strains, but restored neither the oscillation of Ca2+ influx nor the oscillation of actin polymerization (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ influx and actin polymerization in the wild-type strain remained oscillatory in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that pulsed Ca2+ influx effected by Ca2+ channels is required for the oscillation of actin polymerization and the cell-extension rate, resulting in proper polarized growth of hyphae, which is also supported by the result that the treatment of calcium ionophore A23187 disrupted the oscillation of Ca2+ and actin polymerization and caused swollen hyphal tips by depolarized growth (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hyphal tip of filamentous fungi comprises an excellent model to investigate polarity determination and maintenance, as well as polar cell growth, which occurs in a pulsed fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to simultaneously analyze actin polymerization, SV fusion, and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings can be summarized in the following model (shown in Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During slow growth phases (i.e., low exocytosis activity), polymerized actin filaments accumulate at the hyphal tips, followed by SV accumulation before exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient increase of the intracellular Ca2+ level as a result of Ca2+ influx causes depolymerization of actin and fusion of the SV with the plasma membrane, resulting in more exocytosis and fast cell-extension phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reports that Ca2+ levels induce actin depolymerization and vesicle fusion in vitro support our model (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar oscillation periods of Ca2+ influx, actin polymerization, and SV accumulation at the tips of A. nidulans (30 ± 8 s) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H and 3 F and I) indicate that the cells coordinate these processes during stepwise cell extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few seconds of delay between these processes indicate that Ca2+ influx, actin depolymerization, and SV fusion are sequential mechanisms that proceed in this order to extend the cell periphery at the hyphal tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative correlation between the oscillation peaks of the SV amounts and the cell-extension rate without a time gap (Fig 2E) is consistent with the notion that exocytosis activity limits cell extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is in agreement with our recent transient polarity assembly model of fungal tip growth, which describes the assembly/disassembly of polarity markers, polymerization of actin, and local exocytosis resulting in local membrane extension (18, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we demonstrate that normal oscillation of actin polymerization and stepwise growth require pulses of Ca2+ influx through the Ca2+ channels, CchA and MidA, in A. nidulans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key event hence appears to be the activation of Ca2+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One attractive possibility is that the Ca2+ channels could be stretch-activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During slow growth phases cells gradually build up turgor pressure against the membrane and the cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the membrane tension exceeds a threshold, the Ca2+ channels could be activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the entry of Ca2+, exocytosis is promoted and leads to cell extension, which in turn decreases the turgor pressure and inactivates the channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, stretch activation of the S. cerevisiae ortholog Mid1 has been reported (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another simple possibility is that the calcium channel firing is refractory to further activation until the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level is restored to resting levels by diffusion or efflux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillation of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level might also play a role in other physiological processes as well and not only for hyphal tip growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our oscillatory model of cell growth implies a transient waiting time of SV before exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question about an advantage of pulsed versus continuous growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Massive exocytosis at hyphal tips, which is the basis for rapid hyphal growth, imposes a huge problem for polarity maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newly inserted membrane dilutes locally polarity markers and the exocytosis machinery (i.e., the exocyst complex and SNARE proteins), which serve to direct vesicles to specific locations on the plasma membrane and to mediate their tethering to the membrane immediately before fusion (22, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the number of fused vesicles exceeds the capacity of the cell to assemble focused polarity sites, the polar marker would diffuse on the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been nicely shown in S. cerevisiae (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The waiting time of the SV till the next exocytosis event may allow the polarity components to rearrange at newly forming polarity sites and thus assemble enough actin cables that serve as tracks for directed vesicle transport (16, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cortical actin meshes anchor the vesicles and, at the same time, function as barriers for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane in mammalian cells (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient increase of the intracellular Ca2+ level by Ca2+ influx is likely to be an important signal to coordinate depolymerization of actin meshes and thereby allow the anchored SV to fuse with the plasma membrane for exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data reveal correlations among oscillations of four cell peripheral machineries of cell extension, F-actin, exocytosis, and Ca2+ levels, and provide comprehensive understanding of pulsed cell extension at the molecular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinated cycles or oscillations of these machineries are expected to be ubiquitous in all eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ levels and actin polymerization have been revealed in mammalian and plant cells (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the time needed for assembly of polarity markers may be one reason for oscillatory growth, it may also be a mechanism for the cells to respond more quickly to both internal and environmental cues, including chemical and mechanical stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Ca2+ influx by the Ca2+ channel Cch1 in Candida albicans is involved in the control of directional growth of hyphae (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stepwise growth coordinated by transient Ca2+ influx could link growth with chemotropism and chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oscillatory recruitment of MAP kinase to cell tips during cell fusion in N. crassa is also involved in the process (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because filamentous fungi maintain the growth site at their hyphal tips, this system is ideal for elucidating the mechanism of pulsed growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the contribution of other processes, such as endocytosis, cell signaling, cell wall synthesis, and turgor pressure, will be necessary to complete the picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Supplemented minimal medium for A. nidulans was prepared as described, and standard strain construction procedures were used (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two percent of glucose was used as carbon source; 70 mM sodium nitrate and 0.9 M ammonium molybdate were used as nitrogen source for solid media, if not stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For liquid media, the carbon sources were 2% glucose, 2% threonine, or 2% glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. nidulans strains used in this study are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard laboratory Escherichia coli strains (Top 10 F) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N. crassa (CHS-1GFP) strain was grown on Vogels minimal medium agar at 32 °C for 3 d and observed using the inverted agar block method (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmid_and_Strain_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequence of R-GECO was amplified from plasmid pPD60 RGECO.1 (35), using primers R-GECO-KpnI-fw and R-GECO-XbaI-r, generating KpnI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites, respectively, and subsequently cloned into plasmid pJET1.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constructed plasmid was further digested with KpnI and XbaI and the corresponding to R-GECO ORF band was gel-extracted, purified, and cloned in the KpnI-XbaIdigested pCMB17apx (for proteins of interest expressed under the regulatable alcA promoter; contains N. crassa pyr-4) (21) plasmid downstream of the alcA promoter sequence, yielding pNT76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA fragment for GFP tagging at the C terminus of BglA was amplified by fusion-PCR with a GFP-pyrG cassette (47) using primers BglA_P1, BglA_P2, BglA_P3, BglA_P5, and BglA_P6, and was subsequently cloned into plasmid pJET1.2, yielding pNG3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of chsB was amplified from genomic DNA by using primers chsB_AscI_fwd and chsB_PacI_rev, was digested with AscI and PacI, and cloned into the AscI-PacIdigested pSH44 (for mCherry tagging at N terminus of proteins of interest expressed under the regulatable alcA promoter; contains pyroA) (48), yielding pNT77.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AscI-PacIdigested chsB sequence was replaced with the teaR sequence in pNT65 (for mEosFPthermo tagging at N terminus of proteins of interest expressed under the regulatable alcA promoter; contains pyr-4) (22), yielding pNT75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids were transformed into the TN02A3 strain (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformants were screened microscopically for fluorescence and confirmed by PCR for correct integration of the constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
