Successful arrest of photoreceptor and vision loss expands the therapeutic window of retinal gene therapy to later stages of disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corrective gene therapies for inherited retinal degenerations are being developed with the expectation that even patients in later stages of the disease will benefit from such intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence in animal models for a rescue after the onset of photoreceptor loss is scarce, and recent results from patients enrolled in two of the gene therapy clinical trials for a congenital form of blindness (RPE65-LCA) show that, despite transient improvement in visual function, photoreceptor cell death remains unabated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show in a canine model for a common and severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration that gene therapy successfully stops photoreceptor cell death, improves the structure of retinal cells, and prevents vision loss for more than 2 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inherited retinal degenerations cause progressive loss of photoreceptor neurons with eventual blindness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrective or neuroprotective gene therapies under development could be delivered at a predegeneration stage to prevent the onset of disease, as well as at intermediate-degeneration stages to slow the rate of progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most preclinical gene therapy successes to date have been as predegeneration interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many animal models, as well as in human studies, to date, retinal gene therapy administered well after the onset of degeneration was not able to modify the rate of progression even when successfully reversing dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated consequences of gene therapy delivered at intermediate stages of disease in a canine model of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) caused by a mutation in the Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator (RPGR) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatiotemporal natural history of disease was defined and therapeutic dose selected based on predegeneration results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then interventions were timed at earlier and later phases of intermediate-stage disease, and photoreceptor degeneration monitored with noninvasive imaging, electrophysiological function, and visual behavior for more than 2 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All parameters showed substantial and significant arrest of the progressive time course of disease with treatment, which resulted in long-term improved retinal function and visual behavior compared with control eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histology confirmed that the human RPGR transgene was stably expressed in photoreceptors and associated with improved structural preservation of rods, cones, and ON bipolar cells together with correction of opsin mislocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings in a clinically relevant large animal model demonstrate the long-term efficacy of RPGR gene augmentation and substantially broaden the therapeutic window for intervention in patients with RPGR-XLRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematic of neurodegenerations and complex spatiotemporal interactions of potential treatments that seek to prevent disease or positively modify the natural history in retinitis pigmentosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Natural history of neuron death can be approximated as a delayed exponential function (Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapies initiated at intermediate stages aim to stop further neuron loss and rescue function (Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) In retinitis pigmentosa and allied diseases, there is a complex spatial distribution of photoreceptor degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically an annulus is affected first, and over decades, the width of the annulus grows both centrifugally and centripetally (Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subretinal gene therapy injections aim to modify the natural history locally by either preventing or arresting neurodegeneration depending on the local disease stage (Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatiotemporal_Progression_of_Retinal_Degeneration_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutations in the RPGR gene cause a severe and early-onset form of progressive retinal degeneration in humans and dogs (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two naturally occurring canine diseases, XLPRA2 is caused by a two-nucleotide deletion within ORF15 that results in a frameshift and truncation of the terminal 161 amino acid residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histologically, the outer (photoreceptor) nuclear layer (ONL) has a normal thickness (1011 rows of nuclei) at 5 wk of age that corresponds to the age of onset of degeneration (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of photoreceptor neuronal death initially accelerates with a peak at 7 wk of age before returning to a reduced, yet constant, rate thereafter (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is a rapid ONL thinning that leads to a thickness of approximately three rows of nuclei (30% of normal) (32) by 40 wk of age (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In preparation for gene therapy strategies aimed at positively altering the natural history of the retinal degeneration, we first used in vivo imaging methods to evaluate the spatial distribution and temporal progression of ONL thickness changes with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT dogs show an ONL thickness distribution that peaks in the superior-central retina (Fig 2A, Left) except for the small highly cone enriched fovea-like area (33) (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ONL thickness in XLPRA2 dogs can progress from near-normal at 8 wk to severe retina-wide thinning at 95 wk (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements at superior, supero-nasal, and inferior retinal locations show a regular and predictable pattern of ONL thinning with progression rates of 0.33 log10/y for superior and supero-nasal retinal regions and 0.45 log10/y for inferior retinal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These invariant log-linear periods of progression last to 78 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, a slowing of the progression rate is apparent with an increase in measurement variability associated with severely thinned ONL (Fig S1 D and E), reaching the axial resolution limit of the imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DoseResponse_Function_for_Subretinal_Gene_Therapy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subretinal gene therapy at initial stages of XLPRA2 disease, before detectable ONL thinning, can arrest the progressive retinal degeneration (30); however, the doseresponse function of the treatment efficacy is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the minimum effective titer (MET), we injected eight eyes at the onset of degeneration (5 wk of age) with over a 2.5 log10 range of titers, and used as a principal outcome measure ONL thickness maps recorded at 3238 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative ONL maps show retention of thickness corresponding to the injection bleb for the two highest titers compared with lack of such effect for the lowest titer (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis of all eight eyes of five animals (Table S1) showed that the regions injected with a vector titer of 1.51 × 1011 vg/mL had an ONL thickness closest to WT (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection volumes at 5 wk of age were 70 L, which is a total vector dose of 10.6 × 109 vg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower titers resulted in ONL thickness expected from the untreated XLPRA2 natural history, and a higher titer did not reach the WT thickness, although it did show an effect of treatment (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we consider the titer of 1.51 × 1011 vg/mL as the MET to a first approximation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgene expression was specifically detected by immunohistochemistry on retinal sections using an antibody (Table S2) that recognizes human but not canine RPGR protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling was found exclusively in the bleb area, and semiquantitative assessment showed that the level of expression of the stable hRPGR variant was dose dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the highest titers, the transgene was found throughout the length of the photoreceptors (with the exception of the outer segments; Fig 2C) as previously reported when using retinal tissues fixed in paraformaldehyde for  greater than 1 h (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling of the RPGR transgene product has been shown to be restricted to the connecting cilium only when using a modified short (12 min) paraformaldehyde fixation protocol (31, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, control injections (n = 7) performed with balanced salt solution (BSS) in XLPRA2 eyes at different ages resulted in no measurable deviation of ONL thickness from the expected natural history (Fig S1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether there was toxicity of the vector to the retina, adult-size WT canine eyes were injected over a 2 log10 range of titers (Fig S2), with a higher volume (150 L) to cover a similar retinal area as achieved with 70 L at 5 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the MET and lower titer, the bleb region in WT eyes did not show a detectable difference from the surrounding uninjected region in terms of ONL thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the highest titer, however, there was evidence of mild ONL thickening at and around the bleb region in WT retinas (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histology was not available, and mild toxicity of WT retinas to the vector at the titer of 15.1 × 1011 vg/mL cannot be ruled out; the significance of this finding to the mutant eyes is currently not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking all of the XLPRA2 and WT results into consideration, the remaining experiments were performed with the 1.51 × 1011 vg/mL titer of the AAV2/5 vector carrying a stable hRPGR transgene under the control of the hIRBP promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intervention_at_Initial_Disease_Stage_Arrests_Photoreceptor_Loss_and_Rescues_Vision_for_3+_Y  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-term durability of the therapeutic effect of intervention at the time that degeneration begins was evaluated next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An XLPRA2 retina was injected with MET at 5 wk of age, and ONL thickness across a wide extent of retina was mapped serially between 32 and 131 wk (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at the first time point (27 wk after treatment), ONL thickness within the treated region was significantly thicker than the surrounding untreated region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the next 2 y, the untreated region lost ONL thickness along the trajectory consistent with the expected natural history of degeneration, whereas the injected region stably retained ONL thickness close to WT values (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in ONL thicknesses between the treated region and the surrounding untreated region progressively increased with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retinal function with full-field electroretinography (ERG) showed in the treated eye retention of rod and cone function up to the latest test date at 157 wk of age (Fig S3A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the contralateral BSS-injected eye, rod function was not detectable and cone function was severely reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual function was assessed in an obstacle-avoidance course at 130164 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly improved navigation performance (shorter transit time and reduced number of collisions) under scotopic and low mesopic ambient illumination (0.2 lx) was observed when testing the treated eye in comparison with the untreated eye; treated eye results were within the range observed with WT dogs (Fig S3B, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Therapy_Intervention_at_Mid-Stage_Disease_Arrests_Photoreceptor_Loss_and_Rescues_Vision_for_Up_to_3_Y  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stability of rescue following intervention at mid-stage disease was evaluated next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XLPRA2 retinas were injected with MET at 12 wk of age (volume injected: 150 L; dose: 22.7 × 109 vg), after the peak of photoreceptor cell death that results in a loss of 40% of the ONL (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ONL thickness across a wide extent of retina was mapped serially between 31 and 131 wk (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ONL maps at the first time point (31 wk of age, 19 wk after treatment) suggested some rescue in the treated region, this was more evident at later time points (Fig 3A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three treated XLPRA2 dogs, both in the superior and inferior retina, measurements of ONL thickness on each side of the treatment border showed an initial decline that followed the natural course of disease, but ONL loss in the treated region was halted at 31 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rescue persisted up to 131 wk of age, the latest evaluation point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological assessment in an XLPRA2 dog at 113 wk of age confirmed the in vivo imaging results with a clear demarcation in ONL thickness at the border of the bleb (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a substantially thicker ONL in the treated (approximately seven rows of nuclei) vs. untreated (approximately one to three rows of nuclei) regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inner (IS) and outer (OS) segments of photoreceptors had a normal appearance within the treated area, but they were almost completely lost in the untreated region (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the stable human RPGR transgene product was localized exclusively to photoreceptors of the treated area (Fig 3E) and was found throughout the cell except in the OS (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling with cone arrestin and rod and cone opsin antibodies confirmed the structural rescue of both photoreceptor populations (Fig 3F), as well as the reversal of opsin mislocalization (Fig 3 F and G) in the treated area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only was cone structure better preserved, but counts of total (M/L and S) cones showed a higher number of cells in the treated relative to untreated areas, and approximately twice as many S cones were found to express S opsin in their OS (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the effect of RPGR augmentation on the structure of the photoreceptor sensory cilium, three ciliary markers (rootletin, centrin-3, and acetylated -tubulin) were used for IHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their pattern of labeling in the treated area was normal (Fig S5C) and similar to that seen in an untreated XLPRA2 at the injection age of 12 wk (Fig S6 A and B), but very different from the reduced immunostaining in the untreated area at 113 wk (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mutant retina treated by RPGR augmentation retained molecular components of the sensory cilium to their normal site and levels of expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results suggest that intervention at mid-stage disease is able to stop cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the observation that rod and cone IS and OS structure in treated 113-wk-old animal (Fig 3 C and D) is more normal than at the 12 wk of age, the injection time point (Fig S6B; H&E), there appears to be preliminary evidence that treatment could actually reverse structural alterations in the surviving photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support comes from restoration of normal dendritic arborization of ON bipolar cells located within the treated area (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the treated eyes of two dogs, ERG showed retained rod and cone function up to the latest test date at 157 wk of age (Fig S3A, Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visually guided behavior in an obstacle avoidance course was also significantly improved under scotopic and mesopic illlumination when testing the treated eyes between 130 and 164 wk of age (Fig S3B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Efficacy_and_Durability_for_Up_to_2+_Y_of_Gene_Therapy_Intervention_at_Late-Stage_Disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether the window for therapeutic intervention could be extended to a more advanced disease stage, XLPRA2 retinas were injected with MET at 26 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this age, the ONL is approximately four to five rows of nuclei thick in the central/midperipheral retina (4050% of normal), and the structure of the OS is severely compromised (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topographic maps of ONL thickness from early postinjection time points did not indicate a rescue effect for up to 40 wk (Fig 4A and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 52 wk of age, a region of rescue became qualitatively visible and statistically significant (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From that time point up to 131 wk of age, ONL loss was halted in the treated area of the superior retina, but continued unabated in the untreated region (Fig 4 A and B and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rescue was confirmed histologically in an XLPRA2 dog at 113 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ONL was thicker in the treated (approximately four rows of nuclei) than in the untreated (approximately one to two rows of nuclei) region, and photoreceptors retained the normal elongated IS and OS (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the stable human RPGR transgene in the treated areas (Fig 4E) was associated with better preserved rod and cone OS structure and with correction of rod opsin mislocalization (Fig 4 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in the number of all cones (M/L + S), as well as S cones with preserved OS, was found in the treated vs. untreated area (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunolabeling pattern of the photoreceptor sensory cilium was also better preserved in the treated area at 113 wk of age (Fig 5C) and resembled that seen in an untreated dog at 24 wk of age (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of inner retinal gliosis was assessed by GFAP immunolabeling and did not reveal any increased reactivity of astrocytes or Müller cells in either the treated or untreated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, rod bipolar cells reestablished the dendritic arborizations that were absent at the 26-wk injection time point (29), and had completely retracted in the untreated regions at 113 wk of age (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERG analysis performed at 105 wk of age showed preserved rod function in all three dogs and cone function in two of three animals as illustrated for dog Z465 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in the third dog (Z464) similar amplitudes of persistent cone function were recorded from both the treated and untreated eye, combined analysis of the ERG data from all three dogs showed a statistically significant positive rescue of rod-mediated retinal function (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean ERG values at 105 wk of age from the three treated dogs were compared with that of seven WT adult dogs and showed that rod-mediated b-wave amplitude was 8% of WT, and mixed rod-cone a- and b-wave amplitudes were, respectively, 6% and 11% of WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because at 26 wk of age the XLPRA2 retina has lost 5060% of its photoreceptors (primarily rods) and only 1/5 of the retina was treated, these values suggest that maximal achievable ERG preservation was obtained from the treated area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERG measurements repeated at 157 wk of age (latest test date) in the two remaining XLPRA2 dogs showed persistent rescue of both rod and cone function in the treated eyes (Fig S3A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined analysis of the performance of these two dogs in an obstacle-avoidance course between 130 and 164 wk of age showed a faster transit time (within the range of WT dogs) and reduced number of collisions when testing the treated vs. the untreated eyes under scotopic and mesopic ambient illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual function was further investigated in these animals between 149 and 162 wk of age by assessing their ability to detect a dim blue flashing light in a forced two-choice Y maze (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An improved ability to detect the light stimulus was seen when testing the treated eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined analysis of the data collected from both dogs during all eight sessions showed a statistically significant difference in the success rate of the treated vs. untreated eye (91% vs. 63%; P less_than 0.001; Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inherited retinopathies are Mendelian diseases caused by thousands of mutations in  greater than 200 distinct genes (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most commonly, there is a progressive loss of vision due to neurodegeneration of retinal photoreceptors, and there is no cure or treatment (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential therapeutic approaches can be categorized into three groups: (i) prevention of degeneration before it starts, (ii) slowing the rate of progression, and (iii) replacement of lost photoreceptors and their intraretinal connectivity (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current work, we used an AAV2/5 vector to intervene with gene augmentation therapy both early and late in a naturally occurring canine model of RPGR-XLRP and demonstrated long-lasting arrest of retinal degeneration, restoration of normal structure in the remaining photoreceptors and bipolar cells, and rescue of vision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Defining_the_Natural_History_of_Disease_as_a_Prelude_to_Interventions_at_Different_Stages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In human clinical trials to date, AAV-vectored gene therapy for the RPE65 form of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) has shown improvement of some aspects of vision (36, 37), but there is recent evidence in patients from two of the ongoing trials that such intervention has not been able to stem the progression rate of retinal degeneration (16, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In naturally occurring canine models, both of RPE65-LCA and others, gene therapy has produced similar results: intervention after the onset of photoreceptor degeneration has not been able to modify the natural history of the disease (16) or to restore visual function unless adjunctive treatments are done (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the intervention preceded major loss of photoreceptors, prevention of retinal degeneration has often been achieved (16, 30, 41, 42) but not always (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mice, there is an extensive literature on gene augmentation therapy showing improved photoreceptor survival as long as the intervention is applied before or at very early stages of retinal degeneration (4347).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other work has shown positive effects of gene therapy when applied to disorganized retinas with rosettes (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful rescue of photoreceptors with gene augmentation has been difficult to achieve when applied late in the disease natural history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been reports of success (31, 49, 50) but with the caveat of a lack of quantitative definition of spatiotemporal natural history of retinal degeneration at the time of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well known that human retinopathies demonstrate very complex spatiotemporal patterns of disease progression (Fig 1B) (51, 52), even though underlying genetic mutations are presumed to be expressed in all retinal cells of relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse models, and their localized treatments with gene therapy, spatiotemporal gradients of natural disease progression are not often investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when carefully examined, there can be major gradients of ONL thickness that significantly varies within and between retinas (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we first quantitatively defined the spatiotemporal natural history of retinal degeneration in the XLPRA2 dogs (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both in the superior and inferior retina loci, exponential functions (16) with different parameters described the progressive loss of photoreceptors for the first 1.5 y of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolating the natural history to young ages implied an initial delay of degeneration that likely ranged from 5 to 12 wk of life and varied by location and animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of degeneration was slower in the superior and supero-nasal retina (0.33 log10/y) compared with the inferior retina (0.45 log10/y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparability_of_Progression_of_Disease_in_the_Canine_and_Human  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In patients with RPGR-XLRP, the exact spatiotemporal natural history of retinal degeneration is not known: this lack of knowledge extends to all other molecular forms of RP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, however, published estimates of rates of vision loss in RPGR-XLRP, and these can be used to estimate underlying retinal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, ERG amplitudes have been shown to change by 0.07 log10/y for cones and rods (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These full-field averaged values are in the same order of magnitude as psychophysical sensitivity changes rates reported for cone vision ranging from 0.06 to 0.09 log10/y at specific extramacular retinal locations (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown that rod and cone losses tend to be equal in this condition (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the simplifying assumptions of a delayed exponential progression of disease (56) and a relationship between the square of ONL thickness and light sensitivity (57), the rate of ONL thickness change in human RPGR-XLRP can be estimated to fall in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 log10/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using allometric scaling based on maximum lifespan (26), the human progression estimate corresponds to 0.18 to 0.31 log10 per canine-equivalent years, which is similar to the rate of 0.33 log10/y estimated in the superior retina of XLPRA2 dogs but slower than the 0.45 log10/y estimated in the inferior retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the current studies were performed to place the treatment injections in the superior retinal locations whenever possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies of human RPGR-XLRP should ideally include direct measurement of the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and its progressive thinning as we previously performed in RPE65-LCA (16) to provide a quantitative and predictive spatiotemporal measure of the natural history of degeneration in advance of upcoming treatment trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Window_of_Opportunity_for_RPGR_Gene_Augmentation_Can_Be_Expanded_to_Later_Stages_of_Retinal_Degeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After demonstrating the long-term ( greater than 3 y) stable rescue effect provided by early gene therapy intervention, we focused our efforts on determining whether RPGR gene augmentation could arrest the natural course of disease when delivered at patient-relevant stages of retinal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, XLPRA2 dogs at mid- and late-stage disease were subretinally injected with the same viral titer (1.51 × 1011 vg/mL) as used at the initial stage (this study and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the numbers of photoreceptors are reduced by 5060% at 26 wk of age (late-stage intervention), the titer used would be predicted to result in an approximately twofold higher vector load per photoreceptor cell compared with dogs treated at 5 wk of age with their full photoreceptor complement (initial-stage intervention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No signs of ocular toxicity were detected clinically or histologically even when treating XLPRA2 with a 10-fold higher viral titer (15.1 × 1011 vg/mL) than that selected for the long-term studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of toxicity suggests that the AAV construct used may have a reasonably high therapeutic index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results contrast, however, with the findings from another group that observed both short- and long-term toxicity in the Rpgr KO mouse when using a different AAV serotype/promoter/RPGR transgene at doses, respectively, 3- and 10-fold higher than the one that provided the most potent therapeutic effect (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following intervention at mid and late stages of disease, there was a latency of up to 26 wk before the rate of ONL loss was substantially altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a delay in ONL rescue could be explained by a lower efficiency of the vector at transducing older/diseased photoreceptors or the inability for corrective gene therapy to modify the fate of cells that are already irreversibly damaged and committed to cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After ONL loss was halted, the rescue effect was shown to be stable for more than 2 y following intervention at late-stage disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological assessment in two dogs treated at mid and late stage confirmed the morphological rescue of both rods and cones, correction of opsin mislocalization, and reversal of the early dendritic retraction of bipolar cells (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural preservation of surviving photoreceptors including their sensory cilium, and the positive remodeling of the inner retina was associated with improved ERG amplitudes of rods, cones, and postreceptoral neurons in all treated eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, we now demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that RPGR gene augmentation prolongs rod-driven visual behavior, an observation that could not be made at earlier time points when significant vision under scotopic illumination still persisted in the control eyes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Improving_the_Predictive_Value_of_Animal_Models_Used_to_Test_Treatments_for_Retinal_Degeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the last decades, several therapeutic strategies that include the use of neuroprotective agents, antiapoptotic factors, immunotherapy, and corrective gene therapy have been developed with the ultimate goal of preventing or halting photoreceptor degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With few exceptions (31, 49, 50), preclinical evidence gathered to support the initiation of clinical trials has been based on proof-of-concept studies conducted in animal models at a predegenerative stage (11, 5861).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limitation is that these experiments at predegenerate stages fail to recapitulate the cellular and molecular environment of surviving photoreceptors in patients with advanced disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So does drug development for retinal degenerative diseases run a risk of high attrition as seen with the therapy pipelines for Alzheimer and Parkinsons diseases (6, 7)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disappointing results with sustained delivery of the neuroprotective agent ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) for the treatment of early- and late-stage RP in two studies (62) and evidence that patients involved in two of the gene therapy clinical trials for the RPE65 form of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) show unabated photoreceptor and vision loss despite initial visual improvement (16, 38, 39) suggest that evidence in animal models for long-term efficacy and testing at clinically relevant stages of disease are needed to improve the predictive value of preclinical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, although regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration, which are responsible for approving investigations of new drugs in humans, require preclinical data from animal pharmacology and toxicology studies, there has been a poor return on investment of many drug trials for neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation calls for reconsidering the importance of establishing proof of concept in animal models that truly recapitulate the stages of disease of patients to be enrolled in phase II/III clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the increased financial pressure that this would exercise on both academia and industry, this appears to be a necessary step to increase the success rate in translating new drugs to the clinical phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For retinal gene therapy approaches, this would involve confirming efficient transduction of targeted cells in an animal that models the various human stages of degeneration and positive alteration of the natural course of disease before filing an Investigational New Drug application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our successful late-stage intervention and long-term follow-up results in a clinically relevant large animal model now provide the necessary proof of concept to support a clinical trial for RPGR-XLRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All dogs were bred and maintained at the University of Pennsylvania Retinal Disease Studies Facility (RDSF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (63) and the USDA's Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations and complied with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPGR mutant (XLPRA2) (28, 29) and WT dogs were used to characterize the natural course of ONL thinning as a function of age (16) and the response to subretinal injections with an AAV2/5 vector (64) carrying a stabilized human RPGR1-ORF15 cDNA under the control of a human IRBP promoter (30, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilized human RPGR1-ORF15 cDNA (stable hRPGR) contained seven in-frame deletions, one 3-bp insertion, and 65-bp substitutions spread throughout the AG-rich region of exon ORF15 compared with the published (GenBank: NM_001034853) human RPGR1-ORF15 sequence (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable hRPGR was the same sequence as used in our previous RPGR gene augmentation study in XLPRA1 and XLPRA2 dogs (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of the response to RPGR gene transfer was made by means of clinical ophthalmic examinations, en face and cross-sectional in vivo retinal imaging (Fig S8), electroretinography, visual behavior testing that included the use of an obstacle-avoidance course and a forced 2-choice Y maze, and morphological evaluation on retinal histological section (16, 29, 30, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methodological details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All dogs were bred and maintained at the University of Pennsylvania Retinal Disease Studies Facility (RDSF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and the USDAs Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations and complied with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All electroretinographic and noninvasive imaging procedures, as well as subretinal injections, were performed under general anesthesia, as previously described (30, 61, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ocular tissues were collected after euthanasia with i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of euthanasia solution (Euthasol; Virbac), and all efforts were made to improve animal welfare and minimize discomfort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Included were 21 eyes of 18 normal (WT) and 25 eyes of 14 XLPRA2 dogs (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vector_Development_and_Stability_of_the_Vector_Sequence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AAV serotype 2/5 was chosen because murine, canine, porcine, and nonhuman primate (NHP) rods and/or cones are known to be transduced with this vector serotype (30, 64, 6668).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 235-nt segment of the proximal human IRBP (hIRBP) promoter (65) was chosen to transduce canine rods and cones (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human RPGR1-ORF15 cDNA was chosen as the transgene because it is an RPGR isoform enriched in photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is 3,449 bp in length, which allows more than 1,200 bp for the promoter, polyA addition sequence, and AAV ITRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transgene contains ORF15, the location of a major fraction of RPGR-XLRP mutations and a known hot spot for spontaneous mutations (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high mutability of exon ORF15 may be related to a central repetitive, purine-rich region that may promote DNA polymerase arrest and slipped-strand mispairing during replication because the majority of disease causing mutations are out-of-frame deletions within these short repetitive regions (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, cloning of the RPGR1-ORF15 sequence into AAV vectors required screening of multiple colonies to identify a stable sequence that was found multiple times from individual bacterial colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for the stability of this human RPGR1-ORF15 sequence (named stable hRPGR) in vectors came from finding that the vector that was initially used to successfully treat RPGR-mutant dogs (30) contained the identical sequence as three more independently produced AAV vectors used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details on the stable hRPGR sequence have been recently published (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subretinal_Injections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subretinal injections of BSS or vector were performed under general anesthesia with a subretinal cannula as previously reported (30, 64, 69), and volumes injected (70150 µL) were adjusted to the dogs age/globe size aiming to produce a bleb that covered 1/5 of the retinal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the subretinal bleb was recorded immediately after each injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optical_Coherence_Tomography_Imaging_and_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
En face and retinal cross-sectional imaging was performed with the dogs under general anesthesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlapping en face images of reflectivity with near-infrared illumination (820 nm) were obtained (Spectralis HRA+OCT) with 30° and 55° diameter lenses to delineate fundus features such as optic nerve, retinal blood vessels, boundaries of injection blebs, retinotomy sites, and other local changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Custom programs (MatLab 7.5; The MathWorks) were used to digitally stitch individual photos into a retina-wide panorama.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed with linear and raster scans (Spectralis HRA+OCT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlapping 30° × 20° raster scans were recorded covering large regions of the retina (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postacquisition processing of OCT data was performed with custom programs (MatLab 7.5; The MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For retina-wide topographic analysis, integrated backscatter intensity of each raster scan was used to locate its precise location and orientation relative to retinal features visible on the retina-wide mosaic formed by NIR reflectance images (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual longitudinal reflectivity profiles (LRPs) forming all registered raster scans were allotted to regularly spaced bins (1° × 1°) in a rectangular coordinate system centered at the optic nerve; LRPs in each bin were aligned and averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intraretinal peaks and boundaries corresponding to the ONL were segmented using both intensity and slope information of backscatter signal along each LRP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all topographic results, locations of blood vessels, optic nerve head, and bleb boundaries were overlaid for reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ERG_Recording_and_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dogs were premedicated with s.c. injections of atropine and acepromazine, and their pupils were dilated with atropine (1%), tropicamide (1%), and phenylephrine (10%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After induction with i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  propofol, dogs were maintained under general inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane), and their pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature were monitored for constancy during the entire procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-field flash electroretinography was performed on both eyes using a custom-built Ganzfeld dome fitted with the LED stimuli of a ColorDome stimulator (Diagnosys).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 min of dark adaptation, rod and mixed rod-conemediated responses (averaged four times) to single 4-ms white flash stimuli of increasing intensities (from 3.24 to 1.01 log cdsm2) were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 5 min of white light adaptation (1.53 log cdm2), cone-mediated signals (averaged 10 times) to a series of single flashes (from 2.24 to 1.01 log cdsm2) and to a 29.4-Hz flicker (averaged 20 times; from 2.24 to 0.76 log cdsm2) stimuli were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplitudes of the a- and b-waves of the scotopic ERG, and the peak to peak amplitudes of the photopic single flash and 29.4-Hz flicker were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean and SD of these ERG parameters were calculated at 105 wk of age (n = 3 for both the mid- and late-stage treatment groups) and compared between treated and paired control eyes using a paired t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses was performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute), and two-sided P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Retinal_Morphology_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 113 wk of age, an XLPRA2 dog from each of the mid- and late-stage treatment groups was euthanized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyes were immediately enucleated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 h followed by 2% PFA for up to 6 d, trimmed, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature media as previously reported (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten-micrometer-thick serial sections that encompassed the nontreated, the boundary, and the treated/bleb area were cut on a cryostat (Microm HM550; Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood vessel landmarks identified by H&E staining were used to determine the precise location of the retinal cryosections on the vascular pattern of the en face cSLO images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential sections were immunolabeled with primary antibodies and cell-specific markers (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before incubation with the rootletin, centrin-3, and acetylated -tubulin antibodies, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed by incubating the retinal sections in citrate buffer (pH = 6) at 125 °C for 10 min in a pressure cooker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antigenantibody complexes were visualized with fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor, 1:200; Molecular Probes), and Hoechst 33342 counterstain (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to label cell nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E-stained sections were examined by widefield microscopy (Axioplan; Carl Zeiss Meditec), and the images were digitally captured (Spot 4.0 camera; Diagnostic Instruments) and imported into a graphics program (Adobe Illustrator) for display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections labeled for fluorescent immunohistochemistry were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH), and digital images were taken, processed using the Leica Application suite program, and imported into a graphics program (Illustrator; Adobe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total numbers of cell bodies from M/L and S cones labeled with human cone arrestin antibody and that of S opsin-positive OS were determined in both the treated and untreated areas on four retinal sections per eye that extended over the treatment boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell counts were expressed per millimeter of retinal length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Visual_Behavior_Testing_in_an_Obstacle-Avoidance_Course  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After a period of socialization and training, visually guided behavior was evaluated in a 3.6-m-long custom-built obstacle-avoidance course (70) that included five displaceable panels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyes were tested individually by placing an opaque ocular shield (Aestek; Oculo-plastik) on the contralateral cornea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both eyes were tested three times under each of five distinct ambient illuminations that ranged from scotopic (0.003, 0.009, and 0.03 lx) to mesopic (0.2 and 1 lx) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These light intensities were calibrated with a light meter (IL1700; International Light Technologies) at the level of dogs eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the five panels was randomly changed between each of the three trials per eye per illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contralateral eye was tested with the same set of panel positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Random selection of the eye to be tested first was made before the session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dogs were first adapted for 20 min to the lowest ambient illumination (0.003 lx) before running through the course; subsequently, the room illumination was increased to the next level of brightness, and dogs were adapted for 10 min and tested as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The session ended when testing under the five ambient illuminations was completed (total of 30 trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two digital cameras (Sony Handycam) located above the obstacle course recorded the navigation performance of the dogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infrared imaging function of the camera enabled recording under the dimmest light conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experienced observer who was masked to the experimental design reviewed all of the videos to measure for each trial the transit time measured in seconds between the first forward motion at the entrance of the course and the moment the animal completely passed through the exit gate, and the total number of collisions into the walls or moveable obstacle panels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the three groups (initial-, mid-, and late-stage degeneration), the data collected from all dogs on the 3 testing days (130, 146, and 164 wk) were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean difference in transit time and number of collisions under each ambient illumination between treated eyes and the contralateral control eyes, its 95% CI, and associated P value were calculated from generalized linear models using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for the correlation among repeated measurements from the same animal (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute), and two-sided P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Visual_Behavior_Testing_in_a_Y_Maze  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A Y maze composed of a 1.78-m-long entry arm and two 1.27-m-long exit arms was built with black PVC (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ceiling was made with a black opaque fabric, and two black strip curtains were placed at the exits, and a sliding black panel at the entry isolated the interior of the Y maze from any external light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A custom-made power supply controlled at each exit a horizontal 19-cm strip of six LEDs spaced every 3.81 cm (GSLEDIP12; Nemalux) that was used to emit a flickering (3 Hz) blue light (470 nm) stimulus (50-ms duration; Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these strips of LEDs was oriented toward the bifurcation of the Y maze, where it produced at dogs eyes level a corneal irradiance of 1 × 106 mW/cm2 (measured with an IL1700 illuminometer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a period of socialization during which bright sources of white light (6,500 K; stimulus: 3 Hz, 50-ms duration; corneal irradiance at bifurcation: 6.25 mW/cm2) delivered by strips of six LEDs (Nemalux) were used to train the dogs at selecting the correct (illuminated) exit, the animals were tested under scotopic conditions with the significantly dimmer blue light stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the obstacle avoidance course, each eye was tested separately by placing a black ocular shield on the contralateral eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Random selection of the eye to be tested first was made before the session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a dark adaptation period of 20 min, the dog was run in the Y maze 20 times for each eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one strip of LEDs was randomly turned on for any given trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the right and left light stimuli were selected 10 of 20 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the dog had completed its 20 trials for one eye, the contralateral eye was subsequently tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An infrared sensitive camera placed inside the Y maze recorded the choice of the dog when it entered the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experienced observer who was masked to the experimental design reviewed all of the videos and recorded for each eye the number of times (of 20 trials) that the dog correctly selected the illuminated exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the proportion of correct exit choices (of 20 trials) between the treated and untreated fellow eye of two XLPRA2 dogs treated at 26 wk of age (late-stage disease) was done for each of the eight testing sessions that were conducted between 130 and 164 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of correct exit choices (of 320 trials) was also done after combining data from both dogs and all eight sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean difference in the proportion of correct choice between the treated eye and fellow eye, its 95% CIs, and associated P value were calculated from generalized linear models using GEEs to account for the correlation among repeated measurements from the same animal (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute), and two-sided P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
