Inhibition of radiation-induced glioblastoma invasion by genetic and pharmacological targeting of MDA-9/Syntenin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the setting of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), invasion of cells into normal brain and the unlikeliness of complete surgical removal contributes to GBM lethality and recurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gold standard GBM treatment includes adjuvant radiotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, cells surviving radiation demonstrate increased invasion and therapeutic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 9 (MDA-9/Syntenin) expression is elevated in patient-derived tumors and GBM cell lines, which correlates with decreased survival and poor response to radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic suppression of MDA-9/Syntenin sensitizes GBM to radiation by inhibiting radiation-induced invasion gains and signaling changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, intraperitoneal administration of a small-molecule MDA-9/Syntenin inhibitor, PDZ1i, developed using innovative fragment-based drug design and NMR approaches, improved survival of brain tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival was enhanced further when used with radiation, supporting MDA-9/Syntenin as a therapeutic target for this deadly disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an intractable tumor despite therapeutic advances, principally because of its invasive properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation is a staple in therapeutic regimens, although cells surviving radiation can become more aggressive and invasive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation-associated gene 9 [MDA-9/Syntenin; syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP)] as a differentially regulated gene associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes in melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-9/Syntenin, a highly conserved double-PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein, is robustly expressed in human-derived GBM cell lines and patient samples, with expression increasing with tumor grade and correlating with shorter survival times and poorer response to radiotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of MDA-9/Syntenin sensitizes GBM cells to radiation, reducing postradiation invasion gains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation induces Src and EGFRvIII signaling, which is abrogated through MDA-9/Syntenin down-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific inhibitor of MDA-9/Syntenin activity, PDZ1i (113B7), identified through NMR-guided fragment-based drug design, inhibited MDA-9/Syntenin binding to EGFRvIII, which increased following radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genetic (shmda-9) and pharmacological (PDZ1i) targeting of MDA-9/Syntenin reduced invasion gains in GBM cells following radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not affecting normal astrocyte survival when combined with radiation, PDZ1i radiosensitized GBM cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDZ1i inhibited crucial GBM signaling involving FAK and mutant EGFR, EGFRvIII, and abrogated gains in secreted proteases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, following radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an in vivo glioma model, PDZ1i resulted in smaller, less invasive tumors and enhanced survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with radiation, survival gains exceeded radiotherapy alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-9/Syntenin (SDCBP) provides a direct target for therapy of aggressive cancers such as GBM, and defined small-molecule inhibitors such as PDZ1i hold promise to advance targeted brain cancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MDA-9_Syntenin_Inhibition_Leads_to_Radiosensitization_and_Inhibition_of_Radiation-Induced_Invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-9/Syntenin was shown previously to be a valuable target in addressing one of the deadliest aspects of GBM, its propensity to invade (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because radiation therapy has been demonstrated to induce invasion in GBM cells, targeting MDA-9/Syntenin could be a useful approach to complement conventional treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gliomas with higher expression of MDA-9/Syntenin are more likely to be high-grade, and patients whose tumors had high levels of MDA-9/Syntenin had a worse prognosis (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this in mind, we explored possible connections between MDA-9/Syntenin expression and radiotherapy in glioma using the Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) database, a publicly available dataset with information on tumor gene expression, treatment history, and survival (https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/gdoc/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In glioma patients with no history of radiation who then underwent subsequent radiotherapy, we probed whether survival time correlated with MDA-9/Syntenin expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients whose tumors had higher expression of MDA-9/Syntenin had significantly shorter survival (Fig 1A; P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median survival was reduced nearly threefold in patients with gliomas expressing high levels of MDA-9/Syntenin (15.2 mo) compared with others (43.6 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then asked whether inhibiting the expression of MDA-9/Syntenin would result in changes in radiosensitivity in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using GBM cells expressing a control shRNA, U1242-shcon, or shRNA targeting mda-9/syntenin, U1242-shmda-9, we found that low levels of MDA-9/Syntenin radiosensitized GBM in a colony-formation assay (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, proliferation was inhibited in cells transiently reduced in MDA-9/Syntenin expression via adenoviral vector Ad.5/3-shmda-9 (Fig 1C), indicating that MDA-9/Syntenin may play a central role in cell survival following radiation exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Radiation consistently increases motility and invasion in GBM cells (5, 6, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four cell lines were exposed to radiation after treatment with control adenovirus, Ad.5/3-shcon, or Ad.5/3-shmda-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the cell lines received a range of radiation doses, and the dose that demonstrated maximal radiation gains was used for MDA-9/Syntenin knockdown studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, knockdown of MDA-9/Syntenin levels reduced invasion with no radiation exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After irradiation, each GBM cell line exhibited at least a twofold invasion gain, whereas MDA-9/Syntenin knockdown significantly curtailed these gains (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GBM invasion following radiation was reduced with MDA-9/Syntenin knockdown to about 33% of levels observed in controls, representing a substantial reduction to an undesirable side effect of conventional radiotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Knockdown_of_mda-9_syntenin_Inhibits_Src_and_EphA2_Activation_Postradiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-9/Syntenin amplifies Src and NF-B signaling in melanoma and glioma (13, 14, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Src is a recognized enhancer of invasive signals in cancer settings, and has demonstrated involvement in postradiation signaling (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas a modest increase in MDA-9/Syntenin levels 24 h postradiation was observed, we detected a significant increase in activated levels of Src (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-9/Syntenin knockdown reduced those activation levels in each of the GBM cell lines tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EphA2 is a member of the Eph receptor family, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and is involved in numerous cellular processes, including angiogenesis and motility (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EphA2 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and increased metastasis, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous tumors, including those of the brain (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EphA2 has been shown to interact with Src in invasion signaling (23), is up-regulated following radiation, and enhances the malignant phenotype in melanoma (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both total and activated EphA2 levels increased after radiation exposure, yet MDA-9/Syntenin inhibition effectively reduced these gains (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because MDA-9/Syntenin inhibition negated the gains in Src and EphA2 signaling postradiation, it can be considered a valuable target in controlling radiation-induced pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Small_Molecule_Targeting_MDA-9_Syntenin_Inhibits_Invasion_and_Radiosensitizes_GBM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FBDD is an important technique used with success in efforts to develop small-molecule inhibitors of challenging drug targets, including those involved in proteinprotein interactions (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR-based screening of an in-house assembled fragment library of about 5,000 compounds using [15N,1H] heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra with a 15N-labeled PDZ1/2 tandem domain from MDA-9/Syntenin identified two hit compounds (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical shift mapping studies revealed that these two molecules interacted mainly with the PDZ1 domain and in a region at the interface between the domains, whereas no viable fragment hits were found binding to the PDZ2 domain (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of molecular docking studies and structureactivity relationship studies led to the synthesis of the bidentate molecule 113B7 (PDZ1i) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed docked structure of PDZ1i in the PDZ1 domain and interdomain of MDA-9/Syntenin is shown in Fig S1, and the chemical structure of PDZ1i is also shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the data with the individual fragments that compose 113B7, the molecule does not appreciably bind to the PDZ2 domain of MDA-9/Syntenin, indicating selectivity (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger-scale amounts of the compound ( greater than 500 mg) were synthesized and used for cellular and in vivo characterizations, including pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy studies in mice (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial studies revealed that PDZ1i effectively inhibited invasion in T98G and U87 cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it inhibited MDA-9/Syntenininduced invasion following MDA-9/Syntenin overexpression (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested whether PDZ1i treatment would radiosensitize glioma cells by exposing immortalized primary human fetal astrocytes (Im-PHFAs) and the GBM cell line U87 to 0-, 2-, and 5-Gy radiation after a 2-h pretreatment with PDZ1i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal astrocytes showed significant radiosensitivity following radiation exposure, yet PDZ1i treatment did not further radiosensitize these cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, U87 cells showed markedly more radiosensitivity when combined with PDZ1i treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation following radiation was also significantly decreased in U87 cells that combined radiation and PDZ1i compared with radiation with control DMSO treatment (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, U87 cells were exposed to 2 and 5 Gy of radiation, with or without PDZ1i pretreatment, which increased the ability of these cells to invade, whereas PDZ1i pretreatment abolished these invasion gains (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDZ1i_Inhibits_EGFRvIII-Driven_Signaling_in_GBM_and_Reduces_MMP_Secretion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EGFR amplification and mutation are both a common and important alteration in GBM (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particular mutation of this receptor, EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), is often coexpressed along with EGFR amplification in GBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFRvIII and FAK interact as part of a complex to mediate EGFRvIII-mediated MAPK activation (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the demonstrated role of MDA-9/Syntenin in enhancing downstream signaling of the FAKSrc complex in melanoma (13), we determined whether PDZ1i could inhibit EGFRvIII signaling in GBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used U87 cells stably expressing EGFRvIII, U87-EGFRvIII (Fig 4A), and treated them with PDZ1i before radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both radiated and nonradiated cells, phospho-EGFR was significantly reduced in the presence of PDZ1i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAK activation was enhanced after radiation, and this activation was nullified by PDZ1i treatment (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream, we observed that NF-B activation, enhanced following radiation, was reduced in the presence of PDZ1i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, treatment with the PDZ1i disrupted MDA-9 interactions with EGFR in both radiated and nonradiated cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these findings, we propose that PDZ1i disrupts EGFRvIIIFAK signaling, which ultimately reduces the observed postradiation gains in NF-B activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Secreted factors significantly impact on cancer cell invasion, and MDA-9/Syntenin affects the secretion of important factors such as MMP-2 and VEGF in glioma (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation enhances the release of important enzymes, including those involved in invasion, such as the matrix metalloproteinase family (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined whether PDZ1i could affect the secretion of invasion-related proteins following radiation therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U1242 cells were treated for 2 h before radiation therapy, and media were collected after 48 h. Expression of several MMP family members significantly increased following radiation therapy, including MMP-2 and MMP-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDZ1i treatment reduced the levels of these enzymes following radiation therapy (Fig S4), an important aspect of reducing radiation-induced invasion gains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, radiation therapy increased expression of several cathepsin family members as well as ADAM9, whereas PDZ1i eliminated these gains (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cathepsin family proteases modulate tumor invasion and metastasis in a variety of malignancies, including melanoma and breast cancer metastatic to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the expression of this family is important in microenvironment-mediated chemo- and radioresistance and in facilitating supportive tumor stroma (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stability in the circulation and bioavailability in vivo are critical properties of a potential therapeutic agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PK studies were performed administering 3.0 mg/kg (i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and 30.0 mg/kg (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in mice (n = 3), and the compound concentration in serum was measured at various times (15 min to 24 h after drug administration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy were the lack of adverse signs of toxicity during the experiment, the very slow clearance with T1/2  greater than 9 h in each route, and the 80% bioavailability for the compound administered i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vs. i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we anticipated that one to three weekly doses of the drug i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at 30 mg/kg would result in an effective dose for achieving a constant inhibition of the target, despite the relatively low affinity (micromolar) of the compound for the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not anticipate issues inhibiting brain exposure, because mice with GBM have a leaky bloodbrain barrier (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before in vivo efficacy studies, we evaluated the ability of the compound to cross the bloodbrain barrier using a target-based surrogate cellular assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is preferred to direct in vivo measurements of compound concentration in the brain because of low sensitivity of the detection methods and because of the presence of drug in various vascular spaces, namely the residual blood of the brain (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we used human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) (30) seeded with PDZ1i in the upper chamber of Transwell inserts placed on top of wells containing GBM6 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, the invasive ability of the treated GBM6 cells was compared with pretreated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDZ1i effectively crossed the HBMEC barrier to inhibit invasion in GBM6 cells comparably to the pretreated control with no barrier (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that PDZ1i is a potent inhibitor of invasion with radiosensitizing effects and favorable properties for CNS treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDZ1i_Is_Effective_in_Reducing_Tumor_Invasion_in_an_Animal_Model_of_GBM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthotopic xenograft models with GBM6 cells were pretreated with either DMSO or PDZ1i and injected intracranially to form tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven days postinjection, tumor and brain tissue were isolated for sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor cells treated with PDZ1i developed noticeably smaller and more demarcated neoplasms compared with controls (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separately, untreated cells were injected and tumors were established, and then mice were treated i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with either DMSO or PDZ1i (30 mg/kg) three times per wk for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival was significantly increased in treated mice compared with controls (Fig 5C), and tumors were well-circumscribed and less infiltrative on analysis than those of control-treated mice (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to previous studies knocking down MDA-9/Syntenin expression in an in vivo model (14), PDZ1i was effective in reducing tumor invasion and extending survival in an animal model of GBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDZ1i_Combined_with_Radiation_Extends_Survival_and_Reduces_GBM_Invasion_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the combination of PDZ1i with radiotherapy in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U1242-luc cells were injected intracranially under anesthesia and formed tumors, confirmed by imaging at 7 d postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, mice were randomized to four groups: DMSO treatment, PDZ1i treatment (30 mg/kg), DMSO + ionizing radiation (IR), and PDZ1i + IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment began at 11 d postinjection, and mice receiving radiation were treated with 2.5 Gy for 4 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDZ1i was administered 2 h before radiation treatment on each of the 4 treatment days (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control-treated mice had an average survival of 41.3 d, whereas PDZ1i treatment extended that to 54.7 d. Radiation alone extended survival to 62.8 d, whereas PDZ1i treatment + IR therapy led to a survival of 78.8 d (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether tumor morphology and invasion pattern changed in treatment groups, brain tissue sections were collected and H&E stains were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, U1242-luc cells developed diffusely infiltrating tumors in control groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor margins were slightly more demarcated in groups treated with PDZ1i (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation treatment led to generally smaller, yet still diffuse, tumor patterns, which frequently crossed the midline of the brain with invasive outgrowths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of PDZ1i with radiation led to tumors with markedly more circumscribed margins, less invasive outgrowths, and less spread to the leptomeninges (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of tumor sections from these treatment groups indicated that activated forms of EGFR, FAK, and Src correlated with PDZ1i treatment status (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those mice treated with only radiation showed marked increases in activation of these proteins, whereas groups that underwent treatment with PDZ1i showed decreased signal intensity compared with both control- and radiation-treated groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that targeting MDA-9/Syntenin is a promising approach to enhancing conventional radiation treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin is an important mediator of the postradiation signaling process, eliminating invasion enhancement induced by radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Database analysis of REMBRANDT clinical samples supports the idea that high MDA-9/Syntenin expression can lead to a more radioresistant phenotype compared with tumors with lower MDA-9/Syntenin expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interesting links in glioma to MDA-9/Synteninrelated signaling have emerged recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Database expression profiles comparing long-term survivors (LTSs) of GBM ( greater than 48 mo) with short-term survivors (less_than12 mo) revealed a 40% decrease in IGFBP-2, a noted downstream product of MDA-9/Syntenin signaling (9), in LTS tumors (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, identification of a radiosensitive gene signature via expression data from the NCI-60 cancer cell panel revealed that a recognized MDA-9/Syntenin binding partner, integrin-linked kinase (32), was significantly down-regulated in radiosensitive cells (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ideal complement to radiotherapy would sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of radiation while abrogating the unwanted proinvasive effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now establish MDA-9/Syntenin as a promising therapeutic target by showing that knockdown potentiates radiosensitivity and abolishes radiation-induced invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MDA-9/Syntenin activates multiple signaling pathways, including enhancing Src signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Src is involved in numerous cancer-related processes, including survival, motility, and invasion (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially relevant for GBM, Src interacts with EGFR, including wild-type and mutant versions, activating EGFR through phosphorylation (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, radiation induces Src-dependent activation of EGFR in GBM, leading to MMP-2 expression and invasion (19), supporting our hypothesis that targeting MDA-9/Syntenin could inhibit radiation-induced invasion signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although extensive preclinical data support the targeting of Src directly for cancer therapy, the results from clinical trials have overall been disappointing (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low or no response rates as a single agent or in combination were reported in breast cancer and GBM (34), and GBM patients progressing while on bevacizumab also did not respond on Src inhibitors (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A proposed method of escape and resistance to Src inhibitors involves up-regulation of IGFBP-2/FAK signaling (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High levels of IGFBP-2 correlated with resistance, and exogenous IGFBP-2 rendered cells less sensitive to dasatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, FAK activation has been linked to radioresistance (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting MDA-9/Syntenin reduces FAK phosphorylation as well as IGFBP-2 production in addition to Src activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our approach of inhibiting the action of MDA-9/Syntenin may preempt resistance stemming from Src inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent efforts reveal novel mechanisms by which cells evade the cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosome signaling is a potential pathway by which cancer cells survive under the stress of radiation damage (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among exosome cargoes are full-length protein receptors, ligands, RNA, and DNA, including oncogenes (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation therapy induces greater exosome release from both GBM cells and normal astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These exosomes contain much higher levels of IGFBP-2 and enhance migration in recipient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, radiation increases cellular uptake of exosomes (41), and uptake following radiation promotes FAK and Src activation in target cells (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is relevant to our work, because MDA-9/Syntenin gain enhances exosome yield whereas MDA-9/Syntenin knockdown reduces exosome release (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-9/Syntenin targeting is an effective inhibitor of Src activation in glioma and reduces the release of MMP family proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, PDZ1i (113B7) could prove useful in reducing both the efficiency of exosome release as well as their effect on the ECM in recipient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of PDZ1i and radiotherapy in a model of GBM showed improvement over each method alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, important interactions occur within the tumor microenvironment, including extracellular communication between tumor cells, but also between tumor cells and normal cells, such as endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work suggests a mechanism of radioresistance through endothelial cell FAKNF-B signaling (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal endothelial cells within the tumor vasculature, DNA-damaging therapy induced FAK activation and NF-B translocation and activation, leading to secretion of protective cytokines and the development of a sheltering perivascular niche following radiation (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our PDZ1i has the potential to have positive therapeutic effects on both tumor and normal cells within the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, we now show that MDA-9/Syntenin targeting is a viable approach for combating radiation-induced invasion and can radiosensitize GBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A targeted inhibitor leads to a reduction in phenotypes enhanced by MDA-9/Syntenin, and can be combined effectively with conventional radiotherapy in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study highlights an MDA-9/Syntenin PDZ1 inhibitor with profound antiinvasive effects, good stability without overt toxicity in vivo, a potential ability to pass the bloodbrain barrier, and the capacity to both radiosensitize and block invasion gains of radiation in aggressive GBM cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because MDA-9/Syntenin is involved in many important cancer-related cellular processes and signaling events, further investigation into the spectrum of activities of PDZ1i will be enlightening, as will the potential further development of this class of inhibitors into potential drugs for potentiating the therapeutic utility of radiation for the therapy of GBM, a currently invariably fatal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
