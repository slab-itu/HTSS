Nicotinamide benefits both mothers and pups in two contrasting mouse models of preeclampsia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preeclampsia (PE), high blood pressure and protein in the urine in the last third of pregnancy, complicates about 1 in 20 human pregnancies, and it is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related maternal deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only definitive treatment, induced delivery, invariably results in premature babies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood pressure-lowering drugs help, but results in preventing preterm delivery and correcting the fetal growth restriction (FGR) that also occurs in PE have been disappointing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that feeding high doses of nicotinamide, a vitamin, improves the maternal condition, prolongs pregnancies, and prevents FGR in mice having PE-like conditions due to two contrasting causes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because nicotinamide benefits both mothers and pups, it merits evaluation for preventing or treating PE in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 5% of human pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related maternal deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only definitive treatment, induced delivery, invariably results in prematurity, and in severe early-onset cases may lead to fetal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many currently available antihypertensive drugs are teratogenic and therefore precluded from use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonteratogenic antihypertensives help control maternal blood pressure in PE, but results in preventing preterm delivery and correcting fetal growth restriction (FGR) that also occurs in PE have been disappointing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that dietary nicotinamide, a nonteratogenic amide of vitamin B3, improves the maternal condition, prolongs pregnancies, and prevents FGR in two contrasting mouse models of PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is caused by endotheliosis due to excess levels in the mothers of a soluble form of the receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which binds to and inactivates VEGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is caused by genetic absence of Ankiryn-repeat-and-SOCS-boxcontaining-protein 4, a factor that contributes to the differentiation of trophoblast stem cells into the giant trophoblast cells necessary for embryo implantation in mice; its absence leads to impaired placental development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both models, fetal production of ATP is impaired and FGR is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that nicotinamide decreases blood pressure and endotheliosis in the mothers, probably by inhibiting ADP ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC), and prevents FGR, probably by normalizing fetal ATP synthesis via the nucleotide salvage pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because nicotinamide benefits both dams and pups, it merits evaluation for preventing or treating PE in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Nicotinamide_Ameliorates_the_Hypertension__Albuminuria__and_Renal_Abnormalities_in_PE_Caused_by_Increased_Maternal_Production_of_Flt1(1-3)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the potential of nicotinamide for treating PE, we first evaluated its effects on the PE-like condition induced in nonpregnant female inbred strain C57BL/6J mice by administrating 109 plaque forming units (pfu) of a recombinant adenovirus, rAdV Flt1(1-3), that infects the liver and causes production of Flt1(1-3) and increases its concentration in the plasma (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [Flt(1-3) is a synthetic protein that includes a signal sequence, the first 328 amino acids of FLT1, and six copies of a His tag.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments showed that 500 mg/kg per day of oral nicotinamide has significant beneficial effects on the hypertension, albuminuria, damage to the endothelium of the renal glomerular capillaries, and glomerular mesangial expansion caused by the Flt1(1-3) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [The amount of nicotinamide used in these and all of our other experiments (500 mg/kg per day) is equivalent to 2.5 g/d in a 60-kg human, when corrected for body surface area (8), and consequently does not exceed doses (39 g daily) that are commonly used (9, 10).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested the effects of nicotinamide in pregnant C57BL/6J mice receiving 109 pfu of the Flt1(1-3) virus at 7.5 d postcoitum (dpc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this led to miscarriages by 10.5 dpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the experiment was repeated using out-bred mice (ICR) and less virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that nicotinamide prevents the Flt1(1-3)induced increase in telemetrically measured systolic blood pressure (SBP; Fig 1A) and reduces the urinary excretion of albumin [albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)] to a level indistinguishable from control pregnant mice not receiving nicotinamide (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Widespread endothelial damage is an invariable finding in PE; indeed, renal glomerular endotheliosis is the most characteristic morphologic lesion of the human condition (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same type of endotheliosis develops in pregnant mice receiving the Flt1(1-3) virus, and this is ameliorated by nicotinamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the glomerular open capillary area (an indicator of the status of the capillary endothelium) was decreased to 60% normal in the pregnant mice receiving the Flt1(1-3) virus alone, but was improved to 80% normal if the mice also received nicotinamide (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise in the same samples, the marked increase in periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain-positive area (an indicator of mesangial expansion) was prevented by nicotinamide (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative light and electron micrographs of the renal glomeruli directly illustrate the endotheliosis and mesangial expansion caused by the virus and confirm that nicotinamide substantially reduces their severity (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These beneficial effects were seen despite our finding that plasma levels of sFLT1, VEGF, and placental growth factor (PGF) in pregnant mice at 18.5 dpc were not altered by nicotinamide (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nicotinamide_Prolongs_Pregnancies_and_Lessens_FGR_in_PE_Caused_by_Increased_Maternal_Production_of_Flt1(1-3)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Any treatment in a pregnant woman with severe early-onset PE that postpones the need to induce labor to save her life or benefit her baby is beneficial because it decreases the prematurity of the neonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested whether nicotinamide can prolong pregnancy in mice with increased Flt1(1-3) expression induced at different times during pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our first test was with 109 pfu of rAdV Flt1(1-3) administered at 8.5 dpc to pregnant mice that were receiving or not receiving nicotinamide daily by gavage beginning at 6.5 dpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This test allowed us to assess the effects of nicotinamide under conditions of exposure to high Flt1(1-3) relatively early in pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that nicotinamide had highly significant effects in prolonging pregnancies under these circumstances, although none of the pregnancies went to term (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the plasma sFLT1 levels in mice given nicotinamide and Flt1(1-3) virus were higher than in mice given the virus alone (Fig 2B); nevertheless, mice exposed to increased levels of sFLT1 maintain their pregnancies longer if given nicotinamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To have pregnancies in which the effects of nicotinamide on PE-induced FGR could be measured, we reduced the dose of Flt1(1-3) virus to 6 Ã— 108 pfu, administered it at a later time in the pregnancy (14.5 dpc) when placental development is more complete, and harvested the fetuses at 18.5 dpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Flt1(1-3) virus administered at this later stage of pregnancy with or without nicotinamide did not significantly affect maternal weight gain, uterine weights at the time of harvest, or number of fetuses per pregnancy, indicating that Flt1(1-3) has few harmful events once the placenta is fully matured (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, fetal weights at 18.5 dpc were decreased by the Flt1(1-3) virus (Fig 2C), and nicotinamide protected the fetuses from this growth restriction (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Placental expression of Flt1 was increased by maternal Flt1(1-3) (Fig 2D) and was corrected by nicotinamide (Fig 2D), suggesting that nicotinamide alleviated placental ischemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that nicotinamide significantly lessens the FGR that occurs in the fetuses of dams exposed to Flt1(1-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nicotinamide_Prevents_the_Hypertension__Albuminuria__and_Renal_Abnormalities_in_PE_Caused_by_Absence_of_ASB4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A substantial body of data indicates that PE in humans is a consequence of placental abnormalities caused by inadequate invasion of the maternal uterine endometrium by embryonic cytotrophoblasts (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, giant trophoblast cells (GTCs), differentiated from trophoblast stem cells, mediate the early stages of this invasion, by producing matrix metalloproteinases (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differentiation pathway is compromised in mice that genetically lack ASB4 (Ankiryn-repeat-and-SOCS-box-containing-protein 4), and pregnant Asb4/ mice have shallow placentas and develop a PE-like condition (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asb4/ mice therefore provide a model of PE in which the condition is initiated by inadequate placentation, which contrasts with the Flt1(1-3) model in which the condition is initiated by maternal overproduction of antiangiogenic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASB4 ubiquitinates inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) and causes it to be degraded in the proteasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of ASB4, ID2 inhibition persists, and the differentiation of trophoblast stem cells into GTCs is impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abnormal persistence of ID2 expression is also observed in placental biopsies from human PE patients (16), further exemplifying the similarities between the human condition and the Asb4/ mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many Asb4/ embryos die and are resorbed, so that Asb4/ dams produce fewer pups and, like human PE patients, they exhibit hypertension and proteinuria (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using this second model of PE, we first assessed the effects of nicotinamide on the maternal hypertension and albuminuria that develop in the Asb4/ mice mated with the Asb4/ males, and given or not given nicotinamide in their drinking water starting at the beginning of the pregnancy (0.5 dpc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tail cuff-measured SBP of both groups was close to normal in the first week of pregnancy, but had increased by about 25 mmHg in the untreated Asb4/ mice by the third week (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide prevented this increase (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the third week of pregnancy, the untreated Asb4/ dams had developed albuminuria (Fig 3B), which was also completely prevented by the dietary nicotinamide (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absence of ASB4 also resulted in endotheliosis as judged by a decrease in the open capillary areas of the renal glomeruli of the dams (Fig 3C) and in mesangial expansion as judged by an increase in PAS-positive area in the same glomeruli (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide prevented the endotheliosis, as judged by normalization of the open capillary area (Fig 3C) and prevented the mesangial expansion, as judged by normalization of the PAS-positive area (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beneficial effects of nicotinamide in protecting the kidneys of the pregnant mice from the deleterious effects of absence of ASB4 are illustrated by the light and electron micrographs shown in Fig 3 E and F. These beneficial effects of nicotinamide in the pregnant Asb4/ mice, like those in the mice receiving Flt1(1-3) virus, were seen even though plasma levels of sFLT1 and VEGF were not altered by the nicotinamide (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nicotinamide_Prolongs_Pregnancies_and_Prevents_Loss_of_Embryos_in_PE_Caused_by_Absence_of_ASB4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fetal distress is as likely as maternal hypertension to be the reason for induction of delivery in patients with severe early onset PE, but overall results in prolonging pregnancies to improve fetal well-being have been disappointing (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we tested whether nicotinamide can prolong and improve the outcome of pregnancies in the Asb4/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that Asb4/ mice not given nicotinamide delivered prematurely at 19.5 dpc, whereas their littermates given nicotinamide in the drinking water throughout pregnancy delivered their pups at 20.5 dpc, which is close to the normal time for WT mice (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beneficial effects of nicotinamide were also apparent in dams at 18.5 dpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Asb4/ dams have about half the number of live fetuses at 18.5 dpc than WT dams (Fig 4B), and nicotinamide throughout the pregnancy overcomes this deficiency (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the numbers of embryonic implants (dead + alive) in the Asb4/ mutant mice did not differ from that in WT mice (Fig 4C), and nicotinamide had no effect (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the proportion of living embryos changed with developmental stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, using the criteria illustrated in Fig 4D to determine whether an embryo or fetus is alive or dead, we found that the proportion of live embryos at 11.5 dpc and earlier was not affected by genotype or by feeding nicotinamide (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by 12.5 dpc, the proportion of live embryos was less than 40% in the dams lacking ASB4 (Fig 4F), and nicotinamide increased this proportion to 80% (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results demonstrate that the deleterious event(s) causing loss of Asb4/ embryos and the beneficial effects of nicotinamide both occur before 12.5 dpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanisms_Underlying_the_Effects_of_Nicotinamide_on_BP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nicotinamide is an inhibitor of ADP ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC) (5) and is an effective vasodilator of vessels already constricted by EDN1 (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because EDN1 increases cytosolic calcium by activating ADPRC (2, 3, 19), we used mice lacking Cd38 (which codes for the major form of ADPRC) to investigate the mechanism of action of nicotinamide in Flt1(1-3)treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nonpregnant CD38 WT females, the Flt1(1-3) virus increased tail cuff BP by 20 mmHg (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the CD38-null mice, Flt1(1-3) expression no longer increased BP (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telemetrically measured SBP of mice lacking CD38 was likewise not increased by the Flt1(1-3) virus, and nicotinamide no longer had any effect (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The time course of the effects of nicotinamide on the high SBP of mice that received the Flt1(1-3) virus was evaluated telemetrically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical result shows that the SBP rapidly decreased from 140 to 95 mmHg immediately after administering nicotinamide at the usual dose of 500 mg/kg per day by gavage as a bolus and that this decrease was followed shortly by a rise of 15 to 110 mmHg, a level that persisted for at least 1 h (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide had much less effect on the already near normal SBP of the Flt1(1-3)treated mutant mice lacking CD38 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of experiment, which was repeated at least six times, shows that the increase in BP caused by Flt1(1-3) and the effects of nicotinamide on BP are largely dependent on the presence of CD38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results also indicate that, when nicotinamide is administered as a bolus by gavage to Flt1(1-3) virus-treated mice, BP decreases in two phases: one that persists for a few minutes and a second that persists for at least 1 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparable experiments in which DAB (2,2'-dihydroxyazobenzene, a specific inhibitor of ADPRC) was administered by gavage show that it also decreases Flt1(1-3)induced hypertension (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the effects of nicotinamide increase with time, the effects of DAB decrease with time (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the effects on SBP of giving nicotinamide or DAB by gavage to mice not receiving the Flt1(1-3) virus (Fig S4) were almost identical in their time course and magnitude to those observed in mice that received the virus, showing that nicotinamide is a hypotensive agent when administered as a bolus by gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when mice not receiving the Flt1(1-3) virus were given the same total dose of nicotinamide over the course of a day via the drinking water, BP was not affected (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanisms_Underlying_the_Effects_of_Nicotinamide_on_FGR_and_Pregnancy_Outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nicotinamide is converted in two enzymatic steps into NAD+ via the nucleotide salvage pathway, and even in the absence of deliberate dietary supplementation is considered to be the main source of NAD+ in mammals (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During oxidative metabolism, NAD+ is converted via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle into NADH, which provides electrons used in the electron transfer system to generate ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During glycolysis, NAD+ is an essential participant in the reactions that lead to the generation of ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAD+ is also a substrate for sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a deacetylase that modulates cellular responses to hypoxia by deacetylating and inactivating the hypoxia inducible transcription factor 1  (HIF1A) (21), which mediates physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypoxia and controls many of the metabolic activities that generate ATP (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accordingly, we expected that nicotinamide would improve the status of hypoxic embryos and fetuses by its metabolic effects independently of its effects in decreasing the blood pressure and endotheliosis of their mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether this expectation is met, we harvested brains from 18.5-dpc fetuses, measured the expression of Hif1a, and performed an extensive metabolomic analysis of brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that administration of nicotinamide to the mothers completely prevented the increased expression levels of Hif1a caused in the fetal brain by Flt1(1-3) (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetal brain content of nicotinamide was increased by administration of nicotinamide to the mothers (Fig 6B), as was the brain content of NAD+ (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined result of these effects is that nicotinamide completely averts the decrease in ATP content that occurs in the brains of the fetuses of Flt1(1-3)expressing dams (Fig 6D), thereby preventing the FGR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details of the metabolomics analysis are presented in Fig S5, which shows that the increased production of ATP in the fetuses of mothers receiving nicotinamide was due to enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycling caused by increases in NAD pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparable effects of nicotinamide are demonstrable in our second model of PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, administration of nicotinamide to the mothers completely prevented the increased expression levels of Hif1a caused in 11.5-dpc embryos of ASB4-null mice (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetal content of nicotinamide was increased by administration of nicotinamide to the mothers (Fig 6F), as was the content of NAD+ (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absence of ASB4 significantly decreases the ATP content of the 11.5-dpc fetuses of ASB4-null females mated with ASB4-null males (Fig 6H), and 0.3% nicotinamide in their drinking water throughout pregnancy completely prevented this decrease (Fig 6H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanisms_Underlying_the_Effects_of_Nicotinamide_on_Pregnancy_Outcomes_in_ASB4-Deficient_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The importance of ubiquitin ligase ASB4 in facilitating the steps leading from trophoblast precursor cells to GTCs is well documented (14), as is the role of GTCs in the production of matrix metalloproteinases (15) that participate in the degradation of the interstitial matrix of the maternal endometrium, which occurs during implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of ASB4 impairs the production of GTCs, leading to shallow placentation (14), which in human PE is associated with fetal hypoxia and increased oxidative stress (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our observations suggest that absence of ASB4 in pregnant mice has two outcomes: either the embryo dies or it survives and subsequent growth is sufficient that the fetus is not growth retarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the number of fetuses surviving to term is greatly decreased when the mother is ASB4 null and is much improved when she is given nicotinamide, none of the surviving fetuses of ASB4-null mothers are growth retarded at 18.5 dpc whether or not the mothers received nicotinamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nicotinamide, acting via nucleotide salvage pathway, benefits ASB4-null mothers and their progeny, by improving the metabolic status of the hypoxic embryos in the same way that it benefits the progeny of pregnant mice with Flt1(1-3)-induced PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is demonstrable in 11.5 dpc embryos in which the decrease in ATP levels caused by maternal absence of ASB4 is prevented by nicotinamide in the drinking water (Fig 6H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, it is apparent that nicotinamide has beneficial metabolic effects which can improve the status of hypoxic embryos independently of its potential effects in improving implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nicotinamide_Acts_via_Two_Synergistic_Pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S6 presents diagrammatically an overview of the pathways via which nicotinamide may benefit both mothers and pups in our two contrasting mouse models of PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide inhibits ADPR cyclase, relaxes blood vessels constricted by sFLT1 (2, 3), and improves the condition of the endothelium, thereby correcting the hypertension and the albuminuria caused in the mothers by PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, acting through the NAD+ salvage pathway, it improves the metabolic state of hypoxic embryos, normalizes their production of ATP, and prevents FGR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide probably ameliorates the consequences of PE-associated ischemia in the same way that it protects the heart from ischemic reperfusion injury (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiments show that oral nicotinamide, a naturally occurring and well-tolerated form of vitamin B3, alleviates the maternal problems and improves the status of the offspring in two contrasting mouse models of PE: a model in which Flt1(1-3) is produced in the mothers liver and a model in which placentation is compromised by absence of ASB4 in the embryos and mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first model reproduces the consequences of having a high plasma level of sFLT1, which is an invariable feature of PE in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second model reproduces the effects of impaired placentation, which is also observed in human patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clear benefits of nicotinamide in the two models suggest that it should be evaluated for use in human PE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there are only anecdotal reports that it is safe during pregnancy, safety tests have been initiated in pregnant women at 24- to 36-wk gestation with the diagnosis of hypertensive complications of pregnancy (#NCT02213094).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines at University of North Carolina and at Tohoku University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expressed Flt1(1-3) (7, 26) using adenovirus in nonpregnant female C57BL/6J WT mice and pregnant ICR mice, given or not given nicotinamide (Nam) daily by gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used Asb4/ females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal phenotype, maintenance of pregnancy, and embryonal phenotype were analyzed as described in detail in SI Materials and Methods and Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Tohoku University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were housed individually under specific pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h:12-h light:dark cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were provided with ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory chow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except as noted below, we did not exclude any animals from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were randomly assigned into the various surgical and treatment groups detailed below without blinding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemical_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urinary albumin concentration was determined using Albuwell-M kits (Exocell) (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urinary creatinine concentration was measured with the method we developed using tandem LCMS (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood samples were collected into EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged to remove plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma sFLT1 [including mouse Flt1(1-3) and natural sFLT1], VEGF, and PGF were measured by ELISA kits (R&D Systems) (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP content of the fetal brain and embryo was measured by a luciferin-luciferase assay using an ATP assay kit (TOYO Ink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_BP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SBP was measured in the carotid artery by radio telemetry techniques using TA11PA-C10 (Data Sciences International) (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After anesthetizing with isoflurane, the carotid artery of the mouse was accessed with a ventral midline incision and cannulated with a catheter attached to a combination pressure transducer, transmitter, and battery, all encapsulated in an implantable microminiaturized electronic monitor (TA11PA-C10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tail-cuff BP was measured (between 10:00 AM and noon) by determining the tail blood volume with a volume pressure recording sensor and an occlusion tail cuff (CODA System; Kent Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphometric_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kidneys were fixed in 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS and embedded in paraffin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin cross sections of renal tissue (2 Âµm thick) were stained with PAS methods and scanned using a ScanScope CS (Aperio).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated endotheliosis by a decrease in glomerular open capillary area expressed as percentages of the glomerular tuft area (1, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glomerular mesangial expansion was expressed as PAS-positive mesangial area normalized to glomerular tuft area (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electron microscopic analysis, the kidney blocks were cut into 1-mm3 pieces and immersed into 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde fixative (phosphate buffered, pH 7.2), followed by Epon embedding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After thin sectioning, the samples were poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrastructural changes were examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM; Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope) (2, 7, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation__cDNA_Preparation__and_qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from placentae, fetal brains, or whole embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots (5 Âµg) of RNA were reverse transcribed with iScript advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time qRT-PCR was performed on CFX Connect system (Bio-Rad) using the following specific primers: Hif1a (forward: 5-CAAGTCAGCAACGTGGAAGGT-3, reverse: 5-CTGAGGTTGGTTACTGTTGGTATCA-3), Flt1 (forward: 5-GTTAGAGGTGAGCACTGCG-3, reverse: 5-GAGTCCTTTAATGTTTGACATG-3, probe: 5-FAM-GCAGGAGGAATGATTGTACCACAC-TAMRA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were normalized to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene Hprt (forward: 5-GGACTGATTATGGACAGGAC-3, reverse: 5-CAGAGGGCCACAATGTGAT-3, probe: 5-FAM-CCTCCCATCTCCTTCATGACATCTCG-TAMRA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparative analysis, RNA ratios of the treatment group were normalized to control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metabolomic_Analysis_of_the_Embryos  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Levels of metabolites in glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, purine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism of fetal brain from 18.5-dpc dams were measured as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nam, NAD+, Acetyl CoA, glutathione-SH (GSH), and glutathione-S-S-glutathione (GSSG) were measured by LC-MS/MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other metabolites were measured by GC-MS/MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are expressed as mean Â± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with the program JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute) using the statistical tests indicated in the individual figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences were considered to be statistically significant with P values less than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No sample size estimate was performed, but samples size was selected based on previous experiments, and the number of mice used for each in vivo analysis is indicated in the figures or in figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical outliers were identified as values beyond 3 SD of the mean level and were excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigators were not blinded to study conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
