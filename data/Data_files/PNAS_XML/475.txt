Trypanosoma brucei metabolite indolepyruvate decreases HIF-1 and glycolysis in macrophages as a mechanism of innate immune evasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disease, which lacks effective treatments, affects millions of humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper reveals a mechanism by which the parasite can evade our immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate is a metabolite produced by the parasite and it manipulates the immune cells, called macrophages, preventing them from becoming fully active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective advantage for the parasite of excretion of indolepyruvate is possible modulation of host inflammatory responses to prolong host survival, thereby potentiating transmission of the parasite to the tsetse fly vector and ensuring completion of the life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery could lead to new drug targets and better treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The parasite Trypanasoma brucei causes African trypanosomiasis, known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in domestic animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These diseases are a major burden in the 36 sub-Saharan African countries where the tsetse fly vector is endemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untreated trypanosomiasis is fatal and the current treatments are stage-dependent and can be problematic during the meningoencephalitic stage, where no new therapies have been developed in recent years and the current drugs have a low therapeutic index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a need for more effective treatments and a better understanding of how these parasites evade the host immune response will help in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bloodstream form of T. brucei excretes significant amounts of aromatic ketoacids, including indolepyruvate, a transamination product of tryptophan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that this process is essential in bloodstream forms, is mediated by a specialized isoform of cytoplasmic aminotransferase and, importantly, reveals an immunomodulatory role for indolepyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate prevents the LPS-induced glycolytic shift in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is the result of an increase in the hydroxylation and degradation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in HIF-1 levels by indolepyruvate, following LPS or trypanosome activation, results in a decrease in production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate an important role for indolepyruvate in immune evasion by T. brucei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Aromatic_Ketoacids_Are_Produced_by_Transamination_Catalyzed_by_an_Essential_Cytoplasmic_Aspartate_Aminotransferase_Activity_in_Bloodstream_Forms_of_T_brucei  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high consumption of tryptophan and phenylalanine by bloodstream form trypanosomes (19, 21, 22, 25) suggested that the abnormal levels of aromatic ketoacids present in infected animals are transamination products generated by the parasites, but this has never been directly demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, aromatic ketoacid production by T. brucei incubated with tryptophan, tyrosine, or phenylalanine was measured directly using NAD-linked aromatic -hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant production rates of 50.2 ± 4.6, 77.3 ± 11.0, and 84.8 ± 12.7 nmols/5 × 107cells per hour were measured for indolepyruvate, hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and phenylpyruvate, respectively (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cellular production of aromatic keto acids increased linearly with the concentration of the aromatic amino acid even above physiological levels (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant aromatic ketoacid production was detected when aromatic amino acids were omitted from the medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same assay also demonstrated that aromatic ketoacids are produced in vivo in infected animals and were in the 0.2- to 0.5-mM range when the parasitemia was 108 parasites per milliliter (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of aromatic ketoacids produced did not correlate precisely with the number of parasites present in the rat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variation may be because of differences in the ability of the rats to process indolepyruvate from the serum and the metabolic or cell-cycle status of parasites in the bloodstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless the data show that circulating levels of aromatic ketoacids are significant close to the peak of parasitemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production and excretion of aromatic ketoacids is a bloodstream-stagespecific phenomenon because there was no detectable production of aromatic ketoacids by the procyclic or insect gut form of the parasite (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, following uptake, aromatic amino acids are deaminated and the ketoacid product is excreted at sufficiently high rates that circulating levels of aromatic ketoacids in infected animals approach millimolar levels at the peak of parasitemia (i.e.,  greater than 108 parasites per milliliter of blood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several studies indicate that T. brucei cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase (TbcASAT) can efficiently catalyze transamination of aromatic amino acids (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the functional role of TbcASAT in aromatic ketoacid production was investigated by conditional interference RNA (RNAi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of the TbcASAT double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in a decrease of 70% in transcript levels within 24 h as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), which gave a relative expression ratio (induced/noninduced) of 0.37 ± 0.05 (mean ± SD of three separate determinations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a similar reduction in cellular ASAT activity in the induced cells (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, this decrease in activity was also accompanied by a proportionate decrease in aromatic ketoacid secretion by the induced cells (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of TbcASAT also had a rapid and deleterious effect on the growth of bloodstream forms (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell division essentially ceased 24 h after induction of the TbcASAT dsRNA and was subsequently followed by cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight growth effect was also observed for the noninduced cells, which can be attributed to a small knockdown (20%) of ASAT activity in noninduced cells because of leaky expression of the dsRNA (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of TbcASAT had no effect on the growth of the procyclic form (Fig 1F) despite specific knockdown of the TbcASAT transcript in procyclic forms, confirmed by qRT-PCR, which gave a relative expression ratio (induced/noninduced) of 0.35 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD of three separate determinations) 24 h after induction of the dsRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant ASAT activity (80%) remained, however, in the induced procyclic form (Fig 1G), which can be attributed to the presence of the mitochondrial form (mASAT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity is found in procyclic but not bloodstream forms and is highly specific for aspartate (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate that aromatic ketoacids were produced by transamination, the metabolism of (indole-2-13C)-tryptophan by trypanosomes was investigated by solution-state NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding ketoacid, indolepyruvate (chemical shift 127.97 ppm), was easily distinguished from tryptophan (at 127.86 ppm) in a 13C spectra (Fig 1H and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate derived from tryptophan accumulated in the extracellular medium of wild-type and the noninduced TbcASAT RNAi cells over time, demonstrating that both wild-type and noninduced RNAi cells maintained similar continuous production rates of the ketoacid, whereas that of the induced RNAi cells was lower (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, indolepyruvate was the sole excreted metabolite produced from tryptophan under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of indolepyruvate from tryptophan decreased significantly following knockdown of TbcASAT [Fig 1H, Top, compared with Middle (noninduced) and Bottom (wild-type)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrated that bloodstream forms of T. brucei excrete significant amounts of aromatic ketoacids that are produced by transamination catalyzed by TbcASAT, and that this is an essential process during this stage of the life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Berger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22, 27) have suggested that TbcASAT may play a key role in the transfer of amino groups from aromatic amino acids to ketothiobutyric acid as the final step in the recycling of methionine from methylthioadenosine, produced from S-adeosylmethionine during essential polyamine synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, methionine supplementation did not rescue the growth phenotype in cASAT knockdown cells (Fig S1B), a result that is consistent with metabolomic data showing that a methionine recycling pathway does not appear to operate in bloodstream forms (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither increasing nor decreasing extracellular levels of the aromatic amino acids ameliorated the growth defect in the knockdown cells, which indicated that the defect was not related to a detoxification role for TbcASAT (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the acceptor ketoacid specificity of TbcASAT using tryptophan as the amino donor, the enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and subject to a kinetic analysis (Fig S1D and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, TbcASAT catalyzed amino group transfer from tryptophan to oxaloacetate or -ketoglutarate, whereas pyruvate could also act as a poor acceptor substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest affinity (lowest Km) was for oxaloacetate (0.1 mM), whereas the Vmax/Km ratio indicated that the catalytic efficiency was also greatest with the tryptophan/oxaloacetate pair (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indolepyruvate_Alters_the_Glycolytic_State_of_the_Cell_Following_LPS_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because T. brucei clearly excrete aromatic ketoacids, we examined whether indolepyruvate, phenylpyruvate, or hydroxyphenylpyruvate would affect macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculated that, like the ketoacid -ketoglutarate, they might act to promote HIF-1 degradation via prolyl hydroxylase activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first used LPS to activate macrophages, because LPS is a potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS is a Gram-negative bacterial product and the agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS is also relevant during a natural T. brucei infection, because levels of circulating LPS are increased in both experimental and human African trypanosomiasis (2931) and it is thought that this LPS contributes to pathology in trypanosomiasis by increasing the proinflammatory environment of the host (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alteration in glycolytic rate (which is HIF-1dependent) in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), following LPS stimulation was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circulating levels of aromatic ketoacids are likely to be in the millimolar range, so concentrations of up to 1 mM were used in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS increased glycolysis as predicted and indolepyruvate at a concentration of 1 mM inhibited this response (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate also reduced the maximum glycolytic capacity of the cells along with the glycolytic reserve (Fig S3 AC); 0.2 mM and 0.5 mM indolepyruvate didnt appear to affect the glycolytic rate of these cells following LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall glycolytic state of the cell was altered as the maximum glycolytic capacity and the spare glycolytic capacity of the cells was reduced (Fig S3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenylpyruvate and hydroxyphenylpyruvate had no effect on the glycolytic state of cells stimulated with LPS, even at a concentration of 1 mM (Fig S3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the rate of glucose consumption from the media, an indicator of the level of glycolysis occurring within the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS increased the rate of glucose consumption and indolepyruvate again prevented this increase (Fig 2B), thus confirming that indolepyruvate inhibits the ability of LPS to increase glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate, at a concentration of 1 mM, was not toxic to the cells as assessed by LDH release (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indolepyruvate_Inhibits_the_LPS-Induced_Signaling_Pathway_to_HIF-1_but_Has_No_Effect_on_the_NF-B__MAPK__or_IFN-Stimulated_Response_Element_Signaling_Pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested whether indolepyruvate affected HIF-1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS increased HIF-1 protein levels and indolepyruvate inhibited this increase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3A, compare lanes 68 to lane 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate also significantly inhibited the ability of LPS to induce a reporter gene, luciferase, under the control of a HIF-response element (HRE) (Fig 3B) but not luciferase under the control of NF-B (Fig 3C) or the IFN response element (which binds IRF3) (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate also had no effect on LPS-induced I-B degradation (Fig 3E) or another LPS signal, p38 phosphorylation (Fig 3F), even at the highest concentration of 1 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the role of HIF-1 in the mechanism of action of indolepyruvate, we examined two HIF-1 target genes, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS induced the mRNA of both genes and this induction was inhibited in the presence of indolepyruvate (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate had no effect on the induction of the NF-Bdependent gene TNF- (Fig 3G, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that indolepyruvate specifically inhibits the signaling pathway leading to HIF-1 activation, while having little or no impact on the NF-B, MAPK, or IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the mechanism of inhibition of HIF-1 by indolepyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies suggest tryptophan catabolites, including breakdown products of indolepyruvate, act as endogenous ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AhR was of particular interest because AhR dimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (36, 37), the binding partner of HIF-1; thus, an increase in AhR activation could cause a decrease in HIF-1ARNT complexes, reducing the production of HIF-1dependent target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate was still able to inhibit LPS-induced proIL-1 production in BMDM from AhR knockout mice (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AhR receptor is therefore unlikely to be required for the inhibition of LPS-induced proIL-1 by indolepyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because indolepyruvate is a ketoacid, it might act in a similar way to KG, which is a cofactor for the prolyl hydroxylases that hydroxylate HIF-1 and promote its degradation, so we next tested whether indolepyruvate could induce HIF-1 hydroxylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was used in these experiments as HIF-1 hydroxylation is difficult to detect under normal conditions because of the speed at which it is degraded once hydroxylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of indolepyruvate increased the levels of HIF-1 hydroxylation in BMDM (Fig 3H, Upper, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under hypoxic conditions, which result in HIF-1 stabilization, the presence of indolepyruvate increased the levels of HIF-1 hydroxylation (Fig 3I, Upper, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4) and decreased the levels of HIF-1 protein (Fig 3I, Middle, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that indolepyruvate is promoting HIF-1 hydroxylation, leading to its degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indolepyruvate_Inhibits_the_Ability_of_LPS_to_Induce_ProIL-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have revealed that increased HIF-1 levels result in an induction of the critical proinflammatory cytokine proIL-1 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preincubation of BMDM with indolepyruvate inhibited the ability of LPS to induce production of the cytokine IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate also inhibits IL-1 mRNA production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate had no effect on LPS-induced IL-6 or TNF production, which are HIF-1independent events (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if indolepyruvate has the same effect in human cells, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate once again inhibited the ability of LPS to induce proIL-1 expression in these cells (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because LPS alone is sufficient to induce the production of mature IL-1 in PBMCs, an ELISA was used to measure mature IL-1 and, once again, indolepyruvate inhibited the ability of LPS to induce IL-1 production (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the effect of indolepyruvate on the ability of LPS to induce HIF-1 and IL-1 in murine peritoneal macrophages (PECS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS induced HIF-1 and IL-1 in PECS and indolepyruvate inhibited this induction (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the effect of indolepyruvate on IL-1 induction in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice injected with LPS into the peritoneum showed a significant increase in the production of proIL-1 protein in PECS isolated from the mice as assessed by Western blot (Fig 5A), and IL-1 present in the blood of these mice as assessed by ELISA (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administering indolepyruvate to the mice significantly inhibited the production of IL-1 protein (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effect was observed on IL-6 or TNF protein production (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA, isolated from the PECS of these mice, was also assessed and the induction of IL-1 mRNA was inhibited by indolepyruvate, whereas production of IL-6 or TNF mRNA was not (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenylpyruvate was also tested to determine if it could inhibit IL-1 induction in vivo following LPS administration, but unlike indolepyruvate, phenylpyruvate showed no effect on the ability of LPS to induce IL-1 in vivo (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, indolepyruvatebut not phenylpyruvatefunctions in vivo to modulate LPS-induced IL-1 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indolepyruvate_Inhibits_HIF-1_and_IL-1_Induction_in_Response_to_Trypanosome_Lysates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the effect of indolepyruvate on macrophage activation by trypanosome-derived components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used total lysates from bloodstream T. brucei to stimulate BMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages require preactivation by IFN- before they will respond to T. brucei derived proteins/components (6, 38), therefore we preincubated BMDM with IFN- before stimulation with the T. brucei lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF-1 and proIL-1 expression was detected in samples stimulated with increasing amounts of T. brucei lysates, and this production was inhibited in the presence of indolepyruvate (Fig 6A, compare lanes 6 and 7 to lanes 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF is produced following T. brucei infection and plays a key role in the regulation of parasitemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, indolepyruvate has no effect on the induction of TNF expression by LPS (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we wished to examine the effect of indolepyruvate on the ability of TNF itself to induce HIF-1 and proIL-1 expression in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B demonstrates that TNF can induce HIF-1 and proIL-1 expression, albeit at a lower level than LPS, and indolepyruvate again inhibited this response (Fig 6B, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lane 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indolepyruvate_Secreted_from_T_brucei_Inhibits_LPS-Induced_proIL-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to determine if the indolepyruvate secreted by T. brucei has an effect on the ability of LPS to induce proIL-1, we incubated the wild-type bloodstream form of T. brucei or an induced cASAT RNAi cell line with media supplemented with tryptophan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of indolepyruvate being produced were measured to confirm the reduction of indolepyruvate following knockdown of cASAT (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMDM were then cultured in this media and stimulated with LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS induced proIL-1 in control media but this induction was reduced in the presence of media from wild-type T. brucei (Fig 6D, compare lane 8 to lane 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When indolepyruvate was not present in the media (from induced cASAT RNAi T. brucei), there was no inhibition of the LPS-induced proIL-1 (Fig 6D, compare lane 10 to lane 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that indolepyruvate produced by T. brucei can inhibit the ability of LPS to induce IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results identify indolepyruvate from T. brucei as an inhibitor of HIF-1 and IL-1 in macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by this parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
African trypanosomiasis is characterized by alterations in plasma and urinary metabolic profiles, which display features of a diabetes-like state, such as glucose depletion, hyperketonemia, altered amino acid levels, and a marked -keto aciduria that are pronounced at high parasitemia (14, 15, 39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which these perturbations are a result of parasite or host metabolism, contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, or if they have a function in the modulation of host responses is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest for this study are the effects on the aromatic amino acid pool in infected animals, which include a depletion of serum levels of such amino acids, especially tryptophan, which is accompanied by excretion of abnormal amounts of the corresponding aromatic -ketoacid (15, 16, 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that these effects are clearly attributable to parasite metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, a combination of biochemical, metabolic, and RNAi analysis demonstrated that these parasites secrete significant amounts of aromatic ketoacids, which are generated by the transamination of host aromatic amino acids catalyzed by TbcASAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is obligatory in bloodstream forms of T. brucei and resultant levels of aromatic ketoacids can approach millimolar levels in serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, aromatic ketoacid excretion increased as the extracelluar concentration of aromatic amino acid increased, which may indicate that amino acid uptake might be a rate-limiting step rather than transamination activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise reason for the essential requirement for TbcASAT in bloodstream forms remains to be established, a number of results indicate that aromatic amino acids, especially tryptophan, act as amino acid donors for the transamination of oxaloacetate to generate essential intracellular aspartate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view is consistent with metabolomic data, which show that intracellular aspartate is largely synthesized from oxaloacetate derived from glucose rather than by uptake of aspartate (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same study also noted that transport of aspartate is either absent or below detection in bloodstream forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PEPCK is also an essential enzyme in bloodstream forms and knockdown of this enzyme resulted in a significant decrease in labeling of asparate and pyrmidine pools (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the ketoacid acceptor specificity of TbcASAT in this study also showed that oxaloacetate is the preferred ketoacid acceptor when tryptophan is the amino donor, a substrate pair preference that agrees with the metabolomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although -ketoglutarate can act as an acceptor in vitro, unlike oxaloacetate, there is no obvious metabolic route for the continuous net production of this ketoacid in bloodstream forms of T. brucei, which lack a functional TCA cycle and do not oxidize amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased intracellular levels of aspartate in the TbcASAT knockdown cells would readily account for the deleterious effect on cell growth for a number of reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parasites are auxotropic for purines and production of adenine nucleotides from hypoxanthine, the purine source in the medium, requires aspartate during the synthesis of the adenylosuccinate precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the enzyme responsible, adenylosuccinate synthase, is also essential (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the rate of succinate production from glucose (which can be taken as a measure of oxaoacetate production via PEPCK) by bloodstream forms, is 201 nmolh1mg1, which is equivalent to 56 nmols/h/5 × 107 cells (41), whereas the rate of excretion of indolepyruvate ranges from 2050 nmols/h/5 × 107 cells depending on the extracellular concentration of tryptophan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, production of oxaloacetate via PEPCK would be sufficient to meet the requirements of tryptophan transamination by TbcASAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, although a biosynthethic pathway for pyrimidines is present in these parasites, aspartate is also essential for the production of uridine monophosphate and indeed, as noted previously, knockdown of PEPCK resulted in decrease labeling of the pyrimidine pool (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, at the very least, aspartate produced by TbASAT would have an essential role in nucleotide biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of TbcASAT with the activity from Trypanosoma cruzi, a related but mainly intracellular parasite of mammals, suggests a selection for a preference for tryptophan in African trypanosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic studies have demonstrated that TbcASAT has a greater preference (lower Km) and a significantly higher Vmax/Km ratio for tryptophan as the amino group donor compared with tyrosine, phenylalanine, or aspartate, whereas the T. cruzi activity is less selective and transaminates aromatic amino acids and aspartate with equal efficiency (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we show that indolepyruvate, the transamination product of tryptophan, acts as a metabolic modulator of the innate immune response in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate prevents the glycolytic shift in response to LPS, a critical response for macrophage function, by promoting the hydroxylation of the transcription factor HIF-1, which targets HIF-1 for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF-1 is known to bind to, and promote expression of multiple inflammatory genes, notably proIL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that indolepyruvate inhibits the ability of LPS to induce proIL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although indolepyruvate promotes HIF-1 degradation and IL-1 production at 0.2 mM, it shows more consistent inhibition at 0.5 and 1 mM, suggesting that the inhibition of the innate immune response by indolepyruvate is most important at the peak of the parasitemia, when levels of indolepyruvate in the blood are close to millimolar levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the peak of parasitemia, the levels of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules activating the innate immune response would be at their highest, leading to a potential overactivation of the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be detrimental for the host and the well-being of the host is crucial for the survival of the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the ability of indolepyruvate to dampen down the immune response at the peak of the parasitemia would be very beneficial to the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modulation of the innate immune response by T. brucei has previously been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Garzón et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) used LPS to stimulate an innate immune response and demonstrated that proteins secreted from T. brucei gambiense affected the host immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secretome impaired LPS-induced maturation of murine dendritic cells as well as inhibiting the production of the cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitchell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11) demonstrated that LPS-induced IL-1 activity was profoundly depressed in cells isolated from both A/J and C57BL/6J mice following Trypanosoma congolenseanother extracellular African trypanosomeinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Day 7 of infection found no IL-1 activity in supernatants from either mouse strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect may have been a result of indolepyruvate being present in the bloodstream of these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aromatic ketoacids have also been shown to elicit an anti-inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aoki et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (44) demonstrated that indolepyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and hydroxyphenylpyrvate, at concentrations similar to those used in this study, protected the skin of hairless mice from UVB-induced damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, indolepyruvate proved to be the most effective and topical application of indolepyruvate to the dorsal skin of hairless mice reduced the severity of UVB-induced skin lesions; it also suppressed the production of IL-1 and IL-6 in response to UVB radiation in these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Macrophage activation occurs following infection with African trypanosomes but what causes this activation is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that macrophages are exposed to several different activating agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these agents, such as VSG and trypanosome DNA, originate from the parasite; others will originate from the host, such as IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of circulating LPS also increase during African trypanosomiasis (30, 31, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase is likely because of an increase in gut permeability (45) and it is thought that this increase in LPS contributes to the pathology of the disease by increasing the proinflammatory environment of the host (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nyakundi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9, 45) demonstrated that increases in cytokine production, including IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and IFN-, following T. brucei infection, strongly correlated with the increase in LPS levels observed during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T. brucei-infected mice become hyperresponsive to LPS (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The release of IFN- from several cell types, including T cells, is thought to prime macrophages making them more susceptible to LPS activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of LPS binding protein also increase in the plasma of infected mice, which would enhance the cellular response to LPS (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the increase in LPS present in the blood of infected patients, indolepyruvate may play a role in reducing the susceptibility of these patients to LPS or may be involved in the down-regulation of macrophage activation by all activating agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indolepyruvate reduces HIF-1 protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HIF-1 is a transcription factor, this reduction will lead to the reduction in several HIF-1 target genes, including GLUT1, VEGF, LDHA, and IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study has concentrated on the impact of indolepyruvate on the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact role for IL-1 in T. brucei infection is not yet fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 levels increase following T. brucei infection (9, 10) but Drennan et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38) demonstrated no significant difference between wild-type and IL-1R1/ mice in T. brucei infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study by Quan et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47), however, demonstrated a role for the IL-1R1 in T. brucei infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracerebral infusion of the IL-1R1 antagonist (IL-1ra) prevented the weight loss, or lack of weight gain, associated with infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infusion of IL-1ra and soluble type 1 TNF receptor (sTNFr1) reduced trypanosome-induced neurodegeneration, to a greater extent than TNFr1 on its own and reduced the expression of IL-1 and I-B with no effect on TNF-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies will be needed to determine if the impact of IL-1 during T. brucei infection would be far greater if the trypanosomes were not producing indolepyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 is a potent pyrogen, and so inhibiting its production may indeed prevent fever and seizures during infection, but further studies will be needed to investigate this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate may also enhance host survival by inhibiting endogenous trypanosome-induced gene expression, notably those targeted by HIF-1, to lessen systemic pathologies associated with a persistent infection, such as anemia and cachexia, to increase the probability of parasite transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the physiological role of indolepyruvate during an infection requires further investigation, it is tempting to speculate that is has a function in regulating host inflammatory responses, particularly at the peak of the parasitemia when circulating levels of the ketoacid are likely to be highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that a proinflammatory response appears to be required to control the initial parasitemia (8) but indolepyruvate may limit the extent or systemic nature of this response during the clearance of parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the neurological symptoms associated with the late stage of the disease can occur in the absence of a CNS inflammatory response (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps, as originally suggested by Newport et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15), disruption of the biogenic amine pool through metabolism of tryptophan and excretion of indolepyruvate contributes to the neurological effects, while simultaneously ameliorating a CNS inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results therefore confirm that indolepyruvate is produced by the bloodstream form T. brucei and can modulate the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of indolepyruvate present in a patient could therefore be an important diagnostic tool for the presence, and stage of disease, of T. brucei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indolepyruvate might also have potential as an inhibitor of IL-1 in inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A 446-bp fragment (from nuclotide 5561002) from the cASAT (Tb927.10.3660) of T. brucei was amplified and cloned into the p2T7-177 RNAi vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct was linearized with NotI and transformed into the RNAi parental cell lines using the Amaxa parasite nucleofection kit (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct was targeted to the minichromosomes through homologous recombination within the 177-bp repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cASAT-RNAi cell lines were selected by culturing in the presence of phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the dsRNA was induced by addition of tetracycline (1 µg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted using the Stratagene Absolutely RNA purification kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative level of expression of the cASAT mRNA was estimated by qRT-PCR using the Brilliant SYBR Green qRT-PCR Master Mix Kit (Stratagene) in an MxPro 3000 instrument (Stratagene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cycling threshold method [2-(Ct)] was used for relative quantification by comparative method after normalization to actin expression (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ASAT_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total ASAT specific activity was assayed at 340 nm in the direction of oxaloactate production using aspartate (12.5 mM) and -ketoglutarate (10 mM) as substrates and malate dehydrogenase (5 units/mL) and NADH (0.2 mM) as a coupling enzyme/substrate as described in Bergmyer (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At various times the trypanosomes were harvested by centrifugation and the ASAT specific activity (units per milligram) was determined in total cell lysates, prepared as described previously (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aromatic_Ketoacid_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full ORF (TcCLB.506937.10) for NAD-linked aromatic -hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (AHADH) was amplified and cloned into the pNIC28-Bsa4 expression vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following induction, recombinant AHADH was purified from the soluble fraction by Ni2+ affinity chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified AHADH was used to measure the amount of total aromatic ketoacids in samples (up to 0.2 mL) using a standard assay (final volume of 1 mL) containing Tris buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4), NaCl (50 mM), NADH (0.25 mM), and AHADH (850 U).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total aromatic ketoacid present in the sample was determined by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate blank controls were used to correct for sample volume and the assay was verified using standard solutions of phenlpyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cASAT_Cloning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cASAT (Tb10.70.3710) ORF sequence was amplified from genomic DNA using PfuUltra II Fusion DNA polymerase and TACTTCCAATCCATGTCCAGGCCCTTTAAGGACTTAGCACCC (forward primer) and TATCCACCTTTACTGCTACTTGTTACGCACGTGTCGGACAAC (reverse primer), with the underlined region corresponding to the sequence of the ORF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification product (1.2 kb) was inserted into pNIC28-Bsa4 using ligation independent cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly BsaI-digested pNIC28-Bsa4 vector was treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dGTP at 22 °C for 30 min, then at 75 °C for 20 min to create single stranded overhangs, whereas the TbcASAT amplification product was also treated with T4 DNA Polymerase in the presence of dCTP at 22 °C for 30 min, then at 75 °C for 20 min to create the complementary single-stranded overhangs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vector and insert were allowed to anneal and then used to transfect chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection was performed using kanamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive clones were subjected to small scale induction experiments and selected clones were subjected to full-length sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

cASAT_Recombinant_Protein_Expression_and_Activity_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expression of recombinant His-tagged TbcASAT was performed by incubation (500 mL) with isfopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.2 mM) overnight at 18 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 18-h incubations, E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with cold PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were resuspended in 50 mL lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 20 mM Imidazole, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8) with 50 µg/mL Lysozyme at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were lysed using a French press homogenizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supernatants were subjected to chromatography on Ni2+ agarose columns (5 mL) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column was washed three times with lysis buffer, then the protein was eluted using lysis buffer with 250 mM imidazole added, and collected into fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractions were then combined, dialyzed against TrisCl (25 mM) and NaCl (100 mM) containing PLP (0.1 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following dialysis active enzyme was concentrated using Amicon MW 3,500 centrifugal filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein was stored in 20% (wt/vol) glyercol at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assays were performed in standard Tris buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) NaCl (25 mM) and NADH (0.25 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of aromatic amino acid substrates the coupling enzyme was Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant AHADH (20 units/mL); commercial malate dehydrogenase (20 units/mL) was used when asparate was the amino donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
