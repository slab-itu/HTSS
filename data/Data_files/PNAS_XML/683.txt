Murine model indicates 22q11.2 signaling adaptor CRKL is a dosage-sensitive regulator of genitourinary development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Common deletions affecting multiple genes that cause multiple birth defects can be studied by investigating each genes independent role in embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that a specific gene, CRKL, which lies within the commonly deleted region at chromosome locus 22q11.2, is required for normal overall embryonic growth, and normal development of the kidneys and testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of only the Crkl gene in mice is sufficient to cause increased incidence of birth defects commonly seen in humans who possess deletion at 22q11.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that CRKL is one of the key genes whose deletion contributes to the urogenital birth defects associated with multiple-gene deletion at chromosome 22q11.2, indicating a new target for gene therapy in affected patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spectrum of congenital anomalies affecting either the upper tract (kidneys and ureters) or lower tract (reproductive organs) of the genitourinary (GU) system are fundamentally linked by the developmental origin of multiple GU tissues, including the kidneys, gonads, and reproductive ductal systems: the intermediate mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 31% of DiGeorge/del22q11.2 syndrome patients exhibit GU defects, little focus has been placed on the molecular etiology of GU defects in this syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among del22q11.2 patients exhibiting GU anomalies, we have mapped the smallest relevant region to only five genes, including CRKL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRKL encodes a src-homology adaptor protein implicated in mediating tyrosine kinase signaling, and is expressed in the developing GU-tract in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Crkl mutant embryos exhibit gene dosage-dependent growth restriction, and homozygous mutants exhibit upper GU defects at a microdissection-detectable rate of 23%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-sequencing revealed that 52 genes are differentially regulated in response to uncoupling Crkl from its signaling pathways in the developing kidney, including a fivefold up-regulation of Foxd1, a known regulator of nephron progenitor differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Crkl heterozygous adult males exhibit cryptorchidism, lower testis weight, lower sperm count, and subfertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that CRKL is intimately involved in normal development of both the upper and lower GU tracts, and disruption of CRKL contributes to the high incidence of GU defects associated with deletion at 22q11.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

CRKL_Lies_Within_the_Minimal_Region_for_22q112_Patients_with_GU_Anomalies_and_Is_Expressed_During_GU_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By retrospectively analyzing 22q11.2 patients from the DECIPHER database, previously published literature (18), and patient data acquired from aCGH previously performed by our laboratory (14), we compiled an overlap map of patients with 22q11.2 dosage variation who also exhibit GU phenotypes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smallest region covered by all of the mapped GU 22q11.2 CNVs encompasses five protein-coding genes: CRKL, AIFM3, LZTR1, THAP7, and P2RX6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We referred to the ExAC database of 60,706 individual genomes (exac.broadinstitute.org) to determine the likelihood of haploinsufficiency for each gene (probability of loss-of-function intolerance; pLI score).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the five genes within the minimal region, CRKL harbors the highest pLI score at 0.16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores for the other four genes within the minimal region were AIFM3 pLI = 0, LZTR1 pLI = 0, THAP7 pLI = 0.03, and P2RX6 pLI = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, only two truncating mutations of CRKL are reported in the ExAC database, both of which are located at the end of the 303-aa protein sequence: p.Gln297Ter and p.Glu301Ter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of any early truncating mutations in the 60,706 genomes of the ExAC database suggests an unappreciated intolerance to loss-of-function mutations in CRKL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An aCGH and CNV qPCR screen showed duplications (n = 2) and deletions (n = 2) encompassing CRKL (Fig 1, Lamb Lab Patients) were enriched in a population of GU-abnormal patients and present at 1.4% (n = 277; P = 0.0004) compared with the unselected general population where CRKL-encompassing CNVs are present at 0.088% (6 of 6,813; only duplications found) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNVs in CRKL are also enriched in our cohort of GU-abnormal patients compared with rates in the generally disease-enriched cohort of the ExAC database (19 deletions; 47 duplications; 66 of 60,706; 0.1%; all analyzed ethnic subgroups represented; P = 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our laboratorys cohort of GU-abnormal patients is heavily biased toward lower-tract defects, and our findings may underestimate the frequency of CRKL encompassing CNVs in GU-abnormal patients because of underrepresentation of patients with upper-tract phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define Crkl expression in the developing GU system to ask whether these observed CNVs might contribute to GU defects associated with 22q11.2 dosage variation, in situ hybridization was performed on murine tissues (Fig 2 AF), as well as a qPCR screen of human fetal cDNAs from various tissues (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crkl is expressed throughout the developing mouse at modest levels (Fig 2A), and at moderate levels in the developing GU tract with emphasis on the E12.5 genital tubercle (Fig 2B, red dotted outline) and the E16.5 kidneys, bladder, and testis (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E16.5 Crkl expression patterns are largely corroborated by E15.5 data from the GUDMAP database (www.gudmap.org; entry #10685).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human CRKL is expressed throughout a variety of fetal tissues, including liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, and, importantly for DiGeorge syndrome phenotypes, heart, spleen, thymus, brain, and kidney (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRKL is expressed in the human fetal kidney at levels comparable to or higher than human fetal organs affected in Crkl murine deletion models (thymus and heart, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Loss_of_Crkl_Adapter_Functions_Mimics_Null-Deletion_Models_and_Indicates_Haploinsufficiency_via_Dose-Dependent_Intrauterine_Growth_Restriction_in_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine a role that Crkl may play in GU development as implicated above, we used a cre-dependent conditional allele in which exon 2 of murine Crkl is flanked by two loxP sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second exon of Crkl encodes the SH3n domain and a short portion of the SH3c domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder of the SH3c domain is encoded in the third exon, which is transcribed but not translated in cre-recombined tissues because of the introduction of a premature stop codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos were produced using a three-generation cross between Crkl exon2 fl/fl and GDF9-icre oocyte-specific cre-recombinase mice (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon generation of full-bodied Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos, RNA was isolated from E16.5 kidneys and cDNA was sequenced with Sanger sequencing to validate splicing of Crkl exon 1 to exon 3 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crkl exon2/exon2 animals are embryonic-lethal at E18.5 with no recovery of live null animals perinatally suggesting a tight phenocopy of the Crkl/ embryos developed and assessed previously (Fig 3C) (11, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon analysis of mutant embryos it was immediately apparent that both Crkl exon2/exon2 as well as Crkl+/exon2 embryos exhibit intrauterine growth restriction (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because loss of a single copy of wild-type Crkl is sufficient to cause restricted intrauterine growth, Crkl is haploinsufficient for normal embryonic development and is likely to contribute to growth restriction associated with 22q11.2 deletion in humans (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Murine_Loss_of_Crkl_Exon_2_Results_in_23%_Incidence_of_Upper_GU-Tract_Embryonic_Phenotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos and their control littermates were analyzed by microdissection for overt GU structural anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 242 embryos were analyzed and upper tract GU phenotypes including hydronephrosis (Fig 4 C, D, and F) and unilateral renal agenesis (Fig 4E) were found in 23% (12 of 52) of Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos, and not present in 63 Crkl+/+ and 127 Crkl+/exon2 littermates (Fig 4, Inset chart).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This incidence is considered statistically significant by Fishers exact test between Crkl exon2/exon2 and Crkl+/+, with P = 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No overt embryonic phenotypes were present in other microdissected GU tissues, including bladder, gonads, reproductive ducts, and genital tubercle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because embryos were assessed only for overt structural anomalies, the incidence described here likely underrepresents the true incidence of renal phenotypes in Crkl-deficient embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) assay on 52 adult male Crkl+/exon2 and 57 wild-type controls (Fig S1) revealed a higher-trending but statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.19 by Fisher exact test) rate of VUR in 32.7% (17 of 52) of Crkl+/exon2 males versus 21% (12 of 57) of Crkl+/+ controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterozygous mutants exhibited normal bladder capacity normalized to body weight (Fig S2) and no anomalies of the bladder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although embryonic and early postnatal VUR studies in other backgrounds indicate wild-type incidences ranging from 0 to 59% (2123), and embryonic and early postnatal VUR in C57/BL6 occurs at low rates (24, 25), this is the largest study to date showing background incidence of VUR in C57/BL6 adult age-matched males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the 52 Crkl+/exon2 mutants assayed for VUR exhibited unilateral cystic kidney and apparent ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction as assessed by micro-CT scanning (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crkl_Facilitates_Renal_Signaling_Pathways_Affecting_a_Minimum_of_52_Transcripts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Crkl facilitates the transduction of a wide variety of signaling pathways in an even wider variety of cell types, it is imperative to our understanding of Crkl function specific to renal development to attempt to address which pathways are aberrantly affected when Crkl cannot perform its normal adaptor functions within developing kidney tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, mRNA from n  3 E16.5 kidney pairs of phenotypically normal Crkl exon2/exon2 male embryos and Crkl+/+ male control embryos was next-generation sequenced at 80 million reads per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypically normal kidneys were used so as to isolate transcript changes primary to Crkl dosage variation and exclude transcript differences secondary to organ stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-two transcripts are differentially expressed when Crkl is uncoupled from its transduction networks in embryonic renal tissue, with a heavy bias toward genes becoming aberrantly up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that a main function of Crkl in the developing kidney is to aid in maintaining suppression of a wide panel of transcripts (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the evidence for Crkl haploinsufficiency in intrauterine growth, we also sequenced RNA from Crkl+/exon2 embryonic kidneys and found that although similar genes are affected in the comparison between Crkl+/exon2 kidneys and Crkl exon2/exon2 kidneys (Fig S4), Crkl+/exon2 kidney transcripts did not vary from Crkl+/+ (Datasets S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result correlates with the finding that although Crkl is haploinsufficient for intrauterine growth, Crkl+/exon2 embryos do not exhibit increased incidence of overt upper-tract GU phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the RNA-seq findings, qPCR was performed on cDNA reverse-transcribed from the RNA samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen genes were selected for validation, several of which are involved in renal development (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the validated genes, Foxd1 is the most significantly affected and exhibits a 5.5-fold induction when Crkl is uncoupled from its renal signaling networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same cohort of genes was tested for differences between wild-type and heterozygous mutant samples, but no differences were found (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adult_Crkl_Exon_2_Deletion_Heterozygotes_Exhibit_Lower-Tract_GU_Defects_and_Subfertility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As we were performing our crosses to derive Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos and maintain the mutant colony, it became apparent that Crkl+/exon2 males frequently exhibited lower-than-average pups per litter when crossed to wild-type females, and often would become infertile earlier than their male wild-type littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this observation, a two-branched approach to analyze anatomical and physiological lower-tract GU phenotypes was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address anatomical defects, testicular parameters of males and controls (n = 11 per group) were defined at the age of observed subfertility onset (20 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address physiological defects, an age-matched fertility study of n = 11 breeding cages per group across three consecutive litters with breeding starting at 11 wk of age when fertility of mutants was comparable to wild-types was undertaken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crkl+/exon2 males exhibit a high penetrance of cryptorchidism (Fig 7 A and D), smaller testes and lower testis-to-body-weight ratio (Fig 7 B and E), lower sperm concentration (Fig 7F), and abnormal testicular histology (Fig 7C) compared with Crkl+/+ age-matched controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiologically, Crkl+/exon2 males sire 30% fewer pups per litter than Crkl+/+ controls after their first litter, which is of normal size (Fig 7G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All Crkl+/exon2 male mice tested produced at least one litter, and two of the experimental breeding cages stopped producing litters at or before their third litter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately even numbers of Crkl+/+ and Crkl+/exon2 pups were recovered from experimental cages; this indicates that a potential loss of mutant embryos does not account for the lower pups per litter observed in experimental cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, time between litters is unaffected (Fig S6), indicating that although subfertile by their second litter, Crkl+/exon2 males are breeding at rates comparable to wild-type controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sperm motility was also unaffected (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, Crkl+/exon2 males exhibit age-related subfertility secondary to testicular atresia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the histological findings vary from that typically expected for cryptorchid testicular histology (26,27), the histology observed is likely primary to a role of Crkl in adult testicular function rather than secondary to cryptorchidism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that Crkl is haploinsufficient for murine male fertility, and CRKL mutations may play a role in age-related subfertility and infertility in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, subfertility was observed in Crkl+/exon2 females (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that female subfertility is not a result of oocyte malfunction, because females with exon 2 deleted specifically in oocytes (Crkl fl/fl;Gdf9-icre+) produced viable full-bodied Crkl+/exon2 offspring when mated to wild-type males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The finding that unrelated, seemingly nonsyndromic patients with congenital GU defects exhibit CNVs clustering at 22q11.2 was, perhaps, not surprising given the fact that 22q11.2 dosage variation is a notoriously complex disease with high phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance across phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically complex disorders such as these require simplification to be understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion and overexpression models of individual genes within large copy-variant genomic loci are indispensable tools to unveiling the effect of each genes individual impact on a given CNV syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of murine Crkl by our group (exon 2) and others (11, 13, 17) (null and conditional models) revealed that Crkl plays a pivotal role in the proper development of a wide variety of tissues whose structures and functions are deleteriously affected in 22q11.2 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse model described in this paper shows that in addition to neural, heart, and thymic congenital defects, loss of Crkl also contributes to the GU defects characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, and lends insight to the observation that similar GU anomalies are seen in a subset of nonsyndromic patients with smaller 22q11.2 aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although not every phenotypic parameter was compared, the full-body Crkl exon 2 deletion model suggests that loss of exon 2 is sufficient to phenocopy a true null allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study indicates that loss of one copy of wild-type Crkl is sufficient to confer intrauterine growth restriction and adult testicular phenotypes, implicating that Crkl is haploinsufficient for a subset of biological structures and functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially important in the context of 22q11.2 deletions because patients generally still harbor one normal copy of each of the affected genes, rendering them functionally heterozygous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main evolutionary benefits to a biallelic genome is the general unlikelihood that having only one copy of a given gene results in the generation of insufficient amounts of protein to perform that proteins baseline function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, the second copy of a gene is conventionally thought to represent a backup of all of the data required for that particular genetic program to function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although haploinsufficient genes are still considered rare, genes are regularly discovered to be dosage-sensitive, and clinically phenotypic syndromes associated with the monoallelic loss of a subset of genes point us in the direction of genes that are haploinsufficient for the development or function of tissues affected in a particular syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Crkl, it appears that one wild-type copy is insufficient to sustain normal embryonic growth as well as normal adult testicular histology and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings suggest that patients with DiGeorge syndrome or smaller aberrations to the CRKL gene affecting one or both copies are more likely to exhibit embryonic growth restriction and subfertility in males as adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the high phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in 22q11.2 deletion patients, our Crkl exon 2 deletion mice exhibited partially penetrant congenital renal and ureteral anomalies, ranging from congenital hydronephrosis to unilateral renal hypoplasia and agenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The renal agenesis observed uniformly involved apparently normal ureteric growth (Fig 4E), implying that the renal aplasia resultant from Crkl exon 2 deletion is secondary to impaired metanephric mesenchyme induction or response rather than aplasia of the ureteric bud.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-sequencing of Crkl exon 2-deleted embryonic kidneys revealed deregulation of 52 transcripts compared with wild-type controls, with a heavy bias toward transcript induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This induction bias suggests that in the normal embryonic kidney, Crkl facilitates the maintenance of repression signaling across a variety of transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most heavily up-regulated renal genes in response to Crkl exon 2 deletion from the panel chosen for validation is Foxd1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxd1 is a transcription factor that promotes nephron progenitor differentiation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether overexpression of Foxd1 is detrimental to renal development; however, Foxd1 duplication is associated with branchial defects (29), which are also common phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another gene up-regulated in renal tissue in response to Crkl exon2 deletion is Adcy2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adcy2 encodes adenylyl cyclase 2, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the production of the signaling molecule cAMP in a wide range of tissues (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A review of the DECIPHER database shows a correlation between CNVs (both deletions and duplications) covering ADCY2 and GU phenotypes, including hydronephrosis and ureteral atresia (patient 259229), VUR (patient 262907), and cryptorchidism (patients 279259 and 284051), and previous work has linked ADCY2 CNVs to abnormalities of the GU tract (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From these studies several conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of Crkl in GU development, as well as the role of exon 2 in Crkl function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the Crkl exon 2 deletion embryos closely mimic phenotypes observed in Crkl-null models, exon 2 deletion, despite producing a truncated protein from translation of exon 1, is most likely a complete loss-of-function mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is yet possible that the truncated protein produced by exclusive deletion of Crkl exon 2 may retain some function, allowing overt renal phenotypes to persist only in homozygous but not heterozygous murine mutants; this could explain the discrepancy between renal phenotypes being present in humans heterozygous for 22q11.2 deletion but absent at the microdissection-level in Crkl+/exon2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another explanation could be that heterozygous phenotypes are less penetrant, less severe, and therefore not easily detectable by embryonic microdissection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent study indicates that subtler, histologically detectable phenotypes are penetrant at low levels in Crkl+/exon2 embryos (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because loss of Crkl results in dose-dependent intrauterine growth restriction, and because heterozygous animals exhibit high rates of cryptorchidism and subfertility, it can be concluded that Crkl is a haploinsufficient gene for a subset of developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, it can be concluded that loss of both copies of wild-type Crkl confers increased susceptibility to structurally overt upper-tract GU defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this same vein, one can hypothesize that loss of a single wild-type copy of CRKL, perhaps by itself but especially in combination with modifying genetic aberrations, may be sufficient to induce CAKUT phenotypes of varying severity in patients with 22q11.2 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, RNA sequencing identified several candidate pathways by which loss of Crkl may induce renal phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These candidate pathways will need to be further studied to narrow down the molecular means by which Crkl aberrations affect renal development and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DiGeorge syndrome is among the many syndromic CNVs that can be screened for embryonically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These technological advances allow researchers to hypothesize that by combining molecular and genetic findings with embryonic screening of at-risk pregnancies, eventually it may be possible to manufacture molecular modifiers to help modulate the effects of syndromic CNVs in utero without undertaking the higher-risk tasks of modifying the embryonic genome or performing infant or in utero surgeries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experimental_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study aimed to map the minimal region of 22q11.2 dosage variation in GU patients and assess the optimal candidate gene within the minimal region (CRKL) for expression and function in GU systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was achieved by in situ hybridization and qPCR studies to delineate CRKL/Crkl expression pattern in the GU tract, and by assessment of Crkl mutant embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weights and pictures of littermate embryos were compared, and each embryo was genotype-blind microdissected to reveal overt congenital GU anomalies, which were documented by photograph, histology, and CT scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of renal phenotypes indicates a need to delineate underlying molecular mechanisms, which was achieved by RNA-sequencing of phenotypically normal embryonic renal tissue from mutants and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, adult male mutants and controls were subjected to a panel of GU phenotype assessments, including dissection, VUR assay, bladder capacity assessment, cryptorchidism assessment, and fertility assessment (sperm motility, sperm count, testis histology, and prospective fertility assay).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotype-blinded assessments were used wherever possible (during microdissections of embryos, sperm count, and sperm motility measures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sufficient n to establish statistically significant differences were calculated by power analysis after preliminary data were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CNV_Overlap_Mapping_and_Identification_of_Candidate_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DECIPHER database was queried for copy number gains and losses at the 22q11.2 locus and CNV breakpoints of patients with phenotypes relevant to GU development were mapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data were combined with CGH-based microarray analysis data (14) from our own laboratory and all GU-relevant CNVs were mapped to determine the smallest region of maximal CNV overlap indicating the presence of candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five genes in the minimal region (CRKL, pLI = 0.16; AIFM3, pLI = 0; LZTR1, pLI = 0; THAP7, pLI = 0.03; and P2RX6, pLI = 0) were then queried in the ExAC database to determine likelihood of haploinsufficiency, indicating CRKL as the gene with the highest likelihood of haploinsufficiency (pLI = 0.16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNV qPCR of GU-abnormal patients was performed by isolation of genomic DNA from blood (Gentra Puregene Kit, Cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  158389) followed by CNV qPCR using 20-ng input template in triplicate and TaqMan CNV probe HS02102421 according to the manufacturers protocol, with informed consent from patients and Institutional Review Board approval from the Baylor College of Medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A cre-dependent conditional allele (Crkl exon2 fl or Crkl f2) was derived from Crkltm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu after removal of a splice acceptor-IRES-gal and -actin-neo cassettes by FLPeR strain [B6;129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm2Dym/J] followed by segregation of the FLPeR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resultant allele included one FRT and one loxP sites in intron 1, and one loxP site in intron 2 of the Crkl gene, designed to delete exon 2 upon cre-mediated recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crkl exon2 fl/fl males were mated with Gdf9-icre females (34) (Jackson Laboratories stock #011062) to generate oocyte-specific deletion Crkl exon2 fl/+; Gdf9-icre+ females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These females were then bred to C57/BL6 wild-type males to generate Crkl+/exon2 progeny, which were then interbred to generate Crkl exon2/exon2 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryonic lethality required our studies to be completed via timed matings and the collection of Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos and their littermates at time points E16.5, E17.5, and E18.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplex genotyping primers are Crkl int1 F2: 5- TCAGCCAGGAGAGGAGGATCATCAA; Crkl int1 R: 5-TGGCTCTC-GTCCTGCATAGGTCA; Crkl int2 R1: 5- GAGGCCAGGACAGCTGGGACTAC with expected band sizes at 484 bp (deleted allele); 358 bp (floxed allele); 194 bp (wild-type allele).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping was performed using Promega GoTaq green Cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M7123 with 56 °C annealing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gdf9-icre animals were donated to D.J.L.s laboratory, courtesy of Austin Cooney, Department of Pediatrics, Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, Austin, TX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mouse work was performed in strict concordance to animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Chicago as well as that of Baylor College of Medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Crkl conditional mutant strain will be available shortly through The Jackson Laboratory as B6;129S4-Crkl less_than tm1c(EUCOMM)Hmgu greater than /ImoJ (Jackson Laboratories stock #30030).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_Crkl_Exon_2_Deletion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was collected from E16.5 Crkl exon2/exon2 kidneys using a dounce homogenizer and zymo RNA isolation kit Cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R1055.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 500 ng of total RNA was converted to cDNA using TermoFisher High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit Cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4368814.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers were designed flanking exon 2 of Crkl cDNA and used to amplify PCR products from cDNA of Crkl exon2/exon2 E16.5 kidneys: forward: CCTCCGCCAGGTTTGATTCT; reverse: ACTC-GTTGTCATCGGGGTTC (440-bp product) and sequenced bidirectionally by Genewiz using Sanger Sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned to RefSeq to verify transcripts are missing exon 2 of Crkl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microdissection_and_Histological_Analysis_of_GU_Tracts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Timed matings between Crkl+/exon2 animals were performed and litters were collected at E16.5, E17.5, and E18.5, which included Crkl exon2/exon2 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryo pictures and weights were documented upon litter collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GU tracts (kidneys, ureters, bladder, gonads, müllerian and wolffian duct derivatives, and genital tubercle) were collected by microdissection and any observable gross anatomical GU malformations were noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GU tracts were then fixed in bouins overnight and transferred to 70% ethanol before being oriented in biopsy pads for paraffin embedding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections of specimens were taken at 5  and stained with H&E for histological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-Sequencing__Analysis__and_Validation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from n  3 male wild-type, Crkl+/exon2, and Crkl exon2/exon2 E16.5 nonphenotypic kidneys using a dounce homogenizer and zymo RNA isolation kit Cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R1055.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was DNase-treated and next-generation sequenced by BCM GARP RNA-sequencing core at 80 million reads per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonphenotypic kidneys were used to exclude differential expression secondary to organ stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Genomic and RNA Profiling Core first conducted sample quality checks using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, then used Illumina TruSeq RNA library preparation protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double-stranded DNA library was created using 250 ng of total RNA (measured by picogreen) plus ERCC Spike-in Mixes, preparing the fragments for hybridization onto a flow cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, cDNA was created using the fragmented 3 poly(A) selected portion of total RNA and random primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During second-strand synthesis, dTTP is replaced with dUTP, which quenches the second strand during amplification, thereby achieving strand specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were created from the cDNA by first blunt ending the fragments, attaching an adenosine to the 3 end, and finally ligating unique adapters to the ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligated products were then amplified using 15 cycles of PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting libraries were quantitated using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and fragment size assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A qPCR quantitation was performed on the libraries to determine the concentration of adapter ligated fragments using Applied Biosystems ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System and a KAPA Library Quant Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were pooled equimolar, requantitated by qPCR, and reassessed on the Bioanalyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the pooled concentration from the qPCR assay, the library pool was loaded onto three lanes of a high-output flow cell at a concentration of 30pM and amplified by bridge amplification using the Illumina cBot instrument, v4 chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A paired-end 100 cycle run was used to sequence the flow cell on a HiSEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2500 instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in number of reads per sample were calculated and used to generate heat maps with FDRs less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pair-ended reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC mm10) using STAR (35) with National Center for Biotechnology Information RefSeq genes as the reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, about 88% of the reads were uniquely mapped to the mouse genome (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce possible PCR biases, read duplicates were removed using Picard tools (broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HTseq (www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq) was used to determine the number of reads falling in the known genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DESeq2 (36) was used to identify differentially expressed genes between the groups of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform the differential expression analysis, DESeq2 first normalized the data by calculating a factor for each sample and then scaled the gene-expression value by the factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After normalization, DESeq2 fitted generalized linear models for the genes and performed tests to identify differentially expressed genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FDR of the differentially expressed genes was estimated using Benjamini and Hochberg method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDR less_than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of differentially expressed genes previously indicated in renal development was validated using TaqMan qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VUR_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kidneys and bladder of anesthetized Crkl+/exon2 males and wild-type controls aged matched to 1012 wk were visualized by dissection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 27-gauge butterfly needle with 5- to 8-inch tubing was used to first aspirate any urine present in the bladder and then inject filtered 2% methylene blue in PBS into the bladder as slowly as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bladder expansion was observed and recorded in units of microliter of dye injected, and bladder capacity was considered reached when urethral leakage was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presence or absence and location of VUR was recorded with the presence indicated by dye fluxing from bladder up ureters to kidney either unilaterally or bilaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Testis_and_Sperm_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crkl+/exon2 and wild-type control males aged 1820 wk were analyzed for testis position after being killed, by massaging inguinal canals in a downward direction to avoid false discovery of retractile testis as cryptorchid testis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were then dissected and pictures of testicular position were taken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Position was analyzed relative to the bladder and penis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testes positioned beside the bladder were considered inguinal cryptorchid; testes positioned beside or directly above the penis were considered prescrotal cryptorchid; testes inside the scrotum were considered to have descended properly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testes were isolated and weighed; testicular weight was graphed normalized to body weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testes were then fixed in bouins overnight and moved to 70% ethanol before further dehydration and embedding in paraffin for 5-m sectioning and H&E analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epididymis were isolated and placed into prewarmed 37 °C HTF media, minced, and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C before sperm were analyzed by: (i) sperm motility by sperm smear as calculated by percent motile out of total sperm; and (ii) sperm count as calculated by hemacytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sperm assessment was genotype-blinded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fertility_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For fertility assessment, n  11 cages per group were set up into the following groups with animals aged 11 wk: group 1: wild-type male × wild-type female (control); group 2: Crkl+/exon2 male × wild-type female (experimental); group 3: Crkl+/exon2 female × wild-type male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fertility was assessed as pups per litter average, as well as normalized to litter number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even representation of wild-type and Crkl+/exon2 embryos in experimental crosses indicate that Crkl+/exon2 embryos are not being lost in utero and are not affecting pups per litter measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Frequency comparisons (i.e., affected versus unaffected) were assessed by Fishers exact test with P less_than 0.05 considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Professional statistical analyst Q.M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compiled the heat map of RNA-sequencing results with FDR less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other statistical comparisons were performed by Students t test with P less_than 0.05 considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Per group n values are listed in each figure or figure legend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
