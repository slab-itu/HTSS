Establishment of the early cilia preassembly protein complex during motile ciliogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Motile cilia preassembly proteins processing dynein motor proteins have been identified in patients with motile cilia dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the exact function and interaction of these proteins are not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using primary airway cell culture and regulated induced pluripotent stem cell culture, we provide a roadmap for preassembly protein expression, showing that HEATR2 is the first preassembly protein to appear, emerging early in ciliogenesis and preceding known regulatory factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 colocalize within previously unrecognized cytoplasmic foci to form an early preassembly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings suggest that a lead scaffold structure essential for motile cilia function is destroyed by proteostasis in HEATR2 mutants, leading to degradation of the whole preassembly complex and identifying the cellular mechanism for disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Motile cilia are characterized by dynein motor units, which preassemble in the cytoplasm before trafficking into the cilia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins required for dynein preassembly were discovered by finding human mutations that result in absent ciliary motors, but little is known about their expression, function, or interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By monitoring ciliogenesis in primary airway epithelial cells and MCIDAS-regulated induced pluripotent stem cells, we uncovered two phases of expression of preassembly proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An early phase, composed of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2, preceded other preassembly proteins and was independent of MCIDAS regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early preassembly proteins colocalized within perinuclear foci that also contained dynein arm proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins also interacted based on immunoprecipitation and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET analysis of HEAT domain deletions and human mutations showed that HEATR2 interacted with itself and SPAG1 at multiple HEAT domains, while DNAAF2 interacted with SPAG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human mutations in HEATR2 did not affect this interaction, but triggered the formation of p62/Sequestosome-1positive aggregates containing the early preassembly proteins, suggesting that degradation of an early preassembly complex is responsible for disease and pointing to key regions required for HEATR2 scaffold stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that HEATR2 is an early scaffold for the initiation of dynein complex assembly in motile cilia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cilia_Preassembly_Follows_a_Biphasic_Expression_Pattern  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To begin to understand the preassembly pathway, we examined the relative expression of the known human preassembly proteins (10, 11, 13, 1518, 21), as temporal relationships are not reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used in vitro differentiation of normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTECs) cultured at the airliquid interface (ALI) to induce multiciliogenesis, which generates cilia by ALI day 14 (31, 32) (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of mRNA was assayed during differentiation and compared with ciliogenesis transcription factors MCIDAS and FOXJ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts of preassembly genes HEATR2, SPAG1 (long form), and DNAAF2 were expressed during the early stages of airway epithelial cell differentiation, preceding the expression of FOXJ1 (ALI day 7), which directs the transcription of most cilia components (33, 34), Levels of these three genes were different from other preassembly genes as determined by K-means cluster analysis (Fig 1A, Fig S1B, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second phase of preassembly genes composed of DNAAF1, DNAAF3, DYX1C1, LRRC6, ZMYND10, and PIH1D3 was expressed after ALI day 7, coincident with the onset of FOXJ1 (Fig S1B and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MCIDAS is required for centriolar replication and activation of FOXJ1 for the regulation of motile cilia-specific proteins (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the early expression of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 follows canonical MCIDAS-FOXJ1 regulation, we used an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture system to conditionally express MCIDAS in all cells differentiated to the lung epithelial fate (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of doxycycline activation, MCIDAS did not induce HEATR2 or DNAAF2, and minimally increased SPAG1 expression (Fig 1B and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, other preassembly factors were expressed at a later stage of differentiation and responded to regulation by MCIDAS (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1B and S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early expression of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 is contrary to the current paradigm that places cilia preassembly downstream to FOXJ1 (35), and is further evidenced by detection of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 in the trachea epithelial cells of Foxj1/ mice (37) (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEATR2__SPAG1__and_DNAAF2_Are_Coexpressed_Early__Within_Distinct_Puncta  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the protein levels, HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 showed early onset during differentiation, in relation to FOXJ1 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATR2 levels were prominent early in differentiation, and were accompanied by at least two dominant bands of SPAG1 (at 100 kDa), as previously noted (17, 38) (Fig 1C and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our immunoblot analysis of SPAG1 also showed multiple short fragments, as reported by others (17, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fragments were detected by SPAG1 antibodies that target either the amino (N) or carboxy (C) terminus (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously suggested, these fragments are likely nonspecific (17, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At ALI day 0, HEATR2 was intranuclear, and by ALI day 3, it was localized to puncta within the cytoplasm of hTECs (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of expression within puncta persisted as airway cells differentiated into mature multiciliated cells, cultured at ALI for 21 d or more (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of SPAG1 and DNAAF2, as detected by immunostaining, was slightly later, present by ALI day 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the intracellular protein localization was similar to HEATR2, and both were present as puncta within the cytoplasm (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early preassembly proteins were present in cells before the appearance of dynein DNAI1, a FOXJ1-dependent member of the ODA (39) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During active cilia growth, DNAI1 colocalized with HEATR2 in the cytoplasm (ALI day 13), positioning a known ODA subunit with an early preassembly protein (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATR2 expression also precedes the massive centriole replication required to form the basal bodies for cilia nucleation (Fig 1F), which had been previously identified as one of the earliest markers of motile ciliogenesis (31, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that motile cilia preassembly occurs in sequential stages, with a set of early preassembly factors preceding FOXJ1 and independent of MCIDAS and a late phase composed of additional MCIDAS/FOXJ1-dependent proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEATR2_Interacts_with_Early_Preassembly_Proteins_DNAAF2_and_SPAG1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarities in the expression patterns between HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 suggested that these proteins might interact as an early preassembly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining of mature multiciliated cells in normal human trachea shows a shared characteristic pattern (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foci with bright staining were typically observed within the perinuclear region (Fig 2A, Inset), while smaller puncta were present diffusely in the cytoplasm, as early as ALI day 3 (Fig 1D), and in the mature airway (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Same-species primary antibodies for the three early preassembly proteins limited the ability to identify relationships; however, staining with fluorescently labeled Fab fragments bound to HEATR2 antibodies, and airway cells transduced with a HEATR2-EGFP fusion protein, suggested that HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 were present in the same foci (Fig 2B and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between these three proteins was further tested by performing immunoprecipitation studies using anti-GFP antibodies in hTECs transduced with HEATR2-EGFP or EGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitations performed in cells obtained during the stage of active cilia growth (ALI day 12) detected SPAG1 and DNAAF2 in cells transduced by HEATR2-EGFP, but not EGFP alone (Fig 2C and Fig S4 BE), supporting their interaction and suggesting specific localized clusters of proteins for preassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better characterize proteinprotein interactions, we performed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments in live cells transduced with tagged preassembly proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATR2, DNAAF2, and SPAG1 were fused to either a yellow (mVenus) or blue (mCerulean) fluorescent protein (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tags were placed at the N or C terminus of the protein (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dual-reporter plasmid composed of fused mVenus and mCerulean proteins separated by an eight-amino acid flexible linker (43, 44) served as a positive control, and plasmids expressing the mVenus or mCerulean fluorescent tag without a target protein served as negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET occurs when two proteins are less than 10 nm apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET was identified between HEATR2 and SPAG1 by acceptor photobleaching, resulting in dequenching and a consequent increase in donor florescence (mCerulean) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET signal analysis suggested that HEATR2 interacted directly with SPAG1 as determined by increased FRET activity between tagged HEATR2 and tagged SPAG1, compared with control plasmids (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result did not change when fluorescent tags were on the N or C terminus of either protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET was not detected between HEATR2 and DNAAF2; however, FRET analysis of cells transduced with DNAAF2 and SPAG1 suggested that this pair interacts directly with one other (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analyzed the HEATR2HEATR2 interactions since this is a common feature of other HEAT-repeat proteins (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATR2 interacted with itself, as demonstrated by the increased FRET signal between HEATR2 pairs tagged with both mVenus and mCerulean (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these data to mean that HEATR2 and SPAG1 are in close proximity in the cytoplasm, possibly in a complex, whereas HEATR2 interacts indirectly with DNAAF2, mediated through a complex with SPAG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEAT-Repeat_Domains_Are_Redundant_for_HEATR2SPAG1_Interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structure analysis based on crystallography indicates that HEAT domains stack together to form flexible scaffolds to mediate proteinprotein interactions for the binding and assembly of multiple substrates (27, 28, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the predicted structure of HEATR2, using Phyre2 (47), showed a structure dominated by HEAT domains and an overall concave shape that is typical of HEAT-repeat proteins (26) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEAT domains contain a loosely conserved pattern of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues within the structure of antiparallel helices (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern and consensus sequence within the A- and B-helixes were identified in the 10 predicted HEAT domains of HEATR2 listed by UniProt (49) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if a specific single HEAT domain or region of the protein is required for SPAG1 interaction, we performed N-terminus and C-terminus deletions in HEATR2 and analyzed FRET efficiency (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletions of the N terminus of HEATR2, which included HEAT domains 14, did not affect FRET with SPAG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, deletions of the C terminus of HEATR2, which encompassed HEAT domains 710 did not abolish FRET activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction in FRET between HEATR2 and SPAG1 was observed when a short segment at the N terminus was deleted (HEAT domains 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely the result of a change in protein conformation and increased distance between the fluorescent probes, as the FRET level was restored when a larger segment was deleted (heat domains 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicated that HEATR2-SPAG1 binding is not mediated by a single binding site on either the extreme N terminus or C terminus (domains 14 or domains 710), and suggest that multiple HEATR2 regions are capable of mediating an interaction with SPAG1, consistent with predicted interaction of cargoes within a broad region of the concave surface of HEAT-repeat proteins CRM1 and PP2A (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEATR2SPAG1_Interaction_Is_Maintained_in_PCD_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next considered that mutations in HEATR2 causative of PCD with absent IDAs and ODAs in the cilia axoneme may interrupt HEATR2SPAG1 interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially reported on a missense P795L mutation located within HEAT domain 10 in a patient with classic PCD features (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another group later reported a different mutation, similarly within HEAT domain 10 (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have since identified two additional mutations in HEATR2 in two families (Fig S5 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proband of one family has a homozygous mutation in HEATR2 c.23532356del AG (p.S785Cins fs*4, referred to as S785Cins) that causes a frame shift and premature termination also within HEAT domain 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This child had typical features of PCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A homozygous missense mutation c.1499G  greater than  T (p.C500F) was present in two siblings of another family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation lies not in a HEAT domain, but within an unstructured region between HEAT domains 6 and 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The children with the C500F mutation had less prominent PCD symptoms, despite the presence of situs inversus totalis in one of the siblings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C500F mutation is predicted to be pathogenic; however, the residue is conserved only in higher organisms (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy analysis showed reduced numbers of IDAs and ODAs in all cases (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cilia on cells cultured from the subject with the S785Cins mutation were immotile, as determined by high-speed video microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, high-speed video analysis of cilia on cells with the C500F mutation showed variable activity, ranging from immotile to a slow beat frequency (Fig S5E and Movies S1S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impact of human-specific HEATR2 mutations on SPAG1 interaction was determined using FRET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe changes in the efficiency of FRET between HEATR2 harboring patient-specific mutations and SPAG1 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that these HEATR2 mutations do not disrupt the direct interaction with SPAG1, and that HEAT domain 10 was dispensable for that interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if there was a relationship between mutant HEATR2 and SPAG1 in vivo, we obtained nasal epithelial cells from children bearing HEATR2 mutations and from control, nonaffected individuals to establish ALI cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the colocalization of HEATR2 and SPAG1 in cells from both normal control subjects and those with mutations (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When assessing mutant cells, we did not appreciate a reduction in the number of perinuclear foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed the accumulation of large dual-positive HEATR2-SPAG1 aggregates only in cells from subjects with PCD (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large aggregates were also present in HEK293T cells cotransfected with mutant HEATR2 and normal SPAG1 expression plasmids (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEATR2_Mutations_Result_in_Degradation_of_an_Early_Preassembly_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the larger size and atypical distribution of puncta expressing both the mutant HEATR2 and the normal SPAG1, we considered that these complexes may be subjected to a different fate than nonmutant HEATR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1; p62) can serve as a marker for aggregates containing misfolded proteins that are subjected to cellular quality control and degradation through proteostasis (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were an increased number of SQSTM1/p62-positive puncta in nasal epithelial cells from subjects bearing HEATR2 mutations compared with non-PCD samples, as detected by immunofluorescent staining (Fig 5 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SQSTM1 also colocalized with SPAG1 and DNAAF2 in the HEATR2 mutant cells (Fig 5D and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that in the presence of HEATR2 mutations, there is instability of the early preassembly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support, we observed reduced HEATR2 protein by immunoblot analysis of primary mutant HEATR2 nasal cells (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPAG1 was also reduced (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of these protein levels was accompanied by normal RNA expression (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the cause of low HEATR2 protein levels, we determined the relative half-lives of the HEATR2 mutants by treating cells transfected with normal or mutant HEATR2 with cycloheximide (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that mutant forms that cause severe disease were unstable, while the C500F mutation, associated with a mild phenotype, was stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore potential pathways of HEATR2 degradation, we treated CHO cells expressing mutant HEATR2 with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MG132 treatment did not increase HEATR2 protein (Fig S7C), suggesting that the proteasome is not the dominant pathway for mutated HEATR2 degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine autophagy as an alternative pathway for mutant HEATR2 turnover, we treated transfected cells with chloroquine (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, chloroquine treatment increased levels of LC3BII, a marker of autophagosomes and a substrate for autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HEATR2 proteins were not increased by chloroquine treatment, suggesting that autophagy is not the dominant mechanism for mutant HEATR2 degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, overexpression of HEATR2 mutant proteins produced a trend toward reduced autophagic activity, as indicated by the somewhat lower LC3B turnover (Fig S7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we find that the low levels of mutant HEATR2 levels are a function of their instability with degradation by a proteasome- and autophagy-independent pathway (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we considered that protein instability observed in HEATR2 mutation-bearing cells may be the result of defective HEATR2HEATR2 interactions for scaffold formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated FRET efficiency of HEATR2HEATR2 interactions in the setting of mutations or deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no reduction in FRET between nonmutant HEATR2 and HEATR2 harboring mutations or deletions, which suggests that multimer interaction is also not dependent on a single HEAT domain (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our observations support a model in which early expression of HEATR2 serves as a scaffold for the establishment of an initial complex for motor protein processing in motile ciliogenesis, and that a motile ciliopathy can result from an early complex disruption (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exome sequencing has identified 10 proteins that are mutated in patients with PCD and result in the absence of the IDA and ODA multiprotein complexes in the ciliary axoneme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current paradigm is that these proteins, and others not yet identified, interact in a stepwise fashion to organize, fold, and transport the large dynein arm complexes (11, 15, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain a perspective on this pathway, we explored the temporal relationship of these known cilia preassembly factors, uncovering the expression of an early group and a late group in relation to FOXJ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that an early group, led by HEATR2 and including SPAG1 and DNAAF2, colocalized and interacted within discrete cytoplasmic foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the early expression of HEATR2 serves as a primary platform to establish an initial complex for motor protein processing in motile ciliogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation in HEATR2 results in degradation of the initial scaffold and proteostasis of the early complex that leads to disease (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulation of motile ciliogenesis occurs in two phases: an early MCIDAS-dependent portion to induce centriologenesis and later a FOXJ1 program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the onset of the early preassembly program was not dependent on either factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional MCIDAS expression in iPSCs suggested that HEATR2, DNAAF2, and, to a lesser extent, SPAG1 expression was independent of MCIDAS control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HEATR2 was expressed in Foxj1-deficient trachea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comprehensive report of TP73, another factor that regulates ciliogenesis, did not identify direct regulation of preassembly genes (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the preassembly pathway is initiated before the appearance of deuterosome generation, which is regulated by MCIDAS and has classically been considered the first mark of ciliogenesis in multiciliated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these findings to suggest either that there are yet undefined ciliogenesis regulatory factors or that HEATR2 and other early preassembly proteins are regulated by a program independent of ciliogenesis and parallel to centriologenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Support for the latter concept is the widespread expression of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2 in nonmotile tissues as cataloged in ProteomicsBD (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data show that early-phase preassembly proteins are expressed in a characteristic pattern of cytoplasmic puncta, with additional perinuclear foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had previously reported that cytoplasmic HEATR2 does not colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, or basal bodies (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show a similar pattern for SPAG1, and DNAAF2, which colocalize with HEATR2, using a combination of antibodies and GFP-labeled HEATR2-transduced human airway epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early complex forms well before the expression of dynein arm proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also observe colocalization of DNAI1 just before the emergence of cilia, suggesting that the early complex machinery may have a role in the late phase, within the same huge multiprotein clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody availability has limited the characterization and localization of preassembly proteins and their isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissecting the contents of the foci relative to different protein isoforms and posttranslational modification will be important for elucidating the preassembly pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEAT-repeat proteins are ideal candidates for binding SPAG1 to HEATR2 and for providing an initial scaffold for a larger preassembly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEATHEAT domain interactions result in stacks of repeat sequences that provide concave surfaces, which are flexible to hold large complexes within a HEATR2 pocket (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our FRET studies demonstrate that HEATR2 interacts with itself, possibly forming dimers or multimers as observed with other HEAT-repeat proteins (58, 59), which is ideal for binding large numbers of ligands, for example, several SPAG1 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPAG1 sites for interactions with HEATR2 are not yet identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPAG1 contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat domains that may mediate proteinprotein interaction and assembly of multiprotein complexes (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the enrichment of mutations in HEAT domain 10, it seems possible that this was a key site for HEATR2SPAG1 interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this was not the case, and, in fact, deletions of the C and N termini did not alter FRET between HEATR2 and SPAG1, suggesting that these regions alone are not essential to maintain this interaction, and that HEATR2SPAG1 interactions may occur at multiple locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified a mutation outside a HEAT-repeat domain causative of PCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of the lengthy sequence of residues between HEAT domains 6 and 7 possibly affects early complex formation by interrupting the stacking of these two central HEAT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEATR2 mutations resulted in the appearance of large SQSTM1-positive aggregates within both primary cells and cell lines expressing mutant HEATR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aggregates also contained SPAG1 and DNAAF2, suggesting the formation and degradation of a larger HEATR2SPAG1DNAAF2 complex, rather than only HEATR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turnover of mutated HEATR2 does not appear to be a substrate of the protostome or autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these pathways constitute the major routes for degradation, other pathways exist and could be contributing to the early preassembly complex degradation (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stabilizing the mutant preassembly complex, which our data suggest is still capable of binding SPAG1, could potentially provide future therapy for subjects with PCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to placing HEATR2 in an early, central position of preassembly, we can now better position DNAAF2 in an early pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we found that SPAG1 binds DNAAF2, others have reported that the late preassembly proteins DYX1C1 and PIH1D3 also bind DNAAF2 (16, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we postulate that DNAAF2 can function as a link between the early- and late-phase complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNAAF2 and other preassembly proteins may be guided into specific positions between early and late phase by the chaperone function of heat shock proteins (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSP70 has been shown to bind DNAAF2 (11), and HSP90 binds DYX1C1 (16, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How any of these proteins interact with a preassembly complex or dynein proteins and participate in the organization of the IDA and ODA is an important goal for future studies and potential therapeutic manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our data and those of others (11, 15, 21, 61), we propose a model of early motile cilia preassembly (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that HEATR2 multimers form a flexible scaffold that binds several SPAG1 molecules, which, in turn, bind multiple DNAAF2 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions might be transient in nature, changing as cell differentiation progresses and FOXJ1 is activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, DNAAF2 might be released from SPAG1 for binding with PIH1D3 and DYX1C1 for folding of dynein motor proteins into the IDA and ODA (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stoichiometry of the early preassembly protein complex interaction must be determined, but the ability of HEATR2 to multimerize into a docking platform that binds many molecules of SPAG1 and DNAAF2 would provide a mechanism for amplification for rapid preassembly, which would allow the simultaneous fabrication of thousands of motor units for delivery to hundreds of axoneme microtubules during ciliogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human airway epithelial cells were transduced with EGFP or HEATR2-EGFP using recombinant lentivirus, differentiated using ALI conditions as previously described (32), and then prepared for HEATR2 immunoprecipitation with GFP antibodies (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FRET_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images to measure FRET efficiency were acquired on a confocal microscopy system equipped with a spectral detector of laser-activated fluorescence (LSM 880; Karl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent FRET efficiency (E) was calculated by measuring the donor fluorescence intensity (ID) before and after the acceptor photobleaching E = 100 * (Id-after  Id-before)/Id-after.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells with an acceptor/donor intensity ratio outside of the 1:88:1 range were excluded from the analysis to avoid artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_Protein_Degradation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assays were performed in CHO cells that were transfected with normal or HEATR2 mutants for 24 h before treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine protein stability, cells were treated with cycloheximide (200 g/mL) 24 h posttransfection and then analyzed by immunoblotting for HEATR2 expression up to 24 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other experiments, transduced cells were treated with MG132 (10 M) for 4 h and then evaluated for HEATR2 expression by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy activity was determined using the LC3B turnover assay (65, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated with chloroquine (50 M) for 2 h, and LC3BII levels were analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (55, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Group variation is described as the mean ± SE (SEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons between groups were made using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual group differences were determined using a two-tailed Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P value of 0.05 was considered to represent a significant difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonparametric data are shown as the median and the 25th and 75th interquartile ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K-means cluster analysis of preassembly gene transcript levels during in vitro differentiation was performed using the K-means function, with k = 2, and the city-block distance option in MATLAB (release R2015a; MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
