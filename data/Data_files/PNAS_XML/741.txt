Nanophotonics-enabled solar membrane distillation for off-grid water purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current desalination technologies provide solutions to the increasing water demands of the planet but require substantial electric energy, limiting their sustainable use where conventional power infrastructure may be unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a direct solar method for desalination that utilizes nanoparticle-assisted solar vaporization in a membrane distillation geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scalable process is capable of providing sufficient clean water for family use in a compact footprint, potentially for off-grid desalination at remote locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With more than a billion people lacking accessible drinking water, there is a critical need to convert nonpotable sources such as seawater to water suitable for human use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, energy requirements of desalination plants account for half their operating costs, so alternative, lower energy approaches are equally critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane distillation (MD) has shown potential due to its low operating temperature and pressure requirements, but the requirement of heating the input water makes it energy intensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate nanophotonics-enabled solar membrane distillation (NESMD), where highly localized photothermal heating induced by solar illumination alone drives the distillation process, entirely eliminating the requirement of heating the input water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike MD, NESMD can be scaled to larger systems and shows increased efficiencies with decreased input flow velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with its increased efficiency at higher ambient temperatures, these properties all point to NESMD as a promising solution for household- or community-scale desalination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison of conventional membrane distillation (MD) and nanophotonics-enabled solar membrane distillation (NESMD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) In MD, heated saline (input) water and ambient temperature distillate water flow on each side of a PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature difference generates a vapor pressure difference across the membrane, resulting in evaporation from the feedmembrane interface to condensation at the distillatemembrane interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonvolatile contaminants do not evaporate and are therefore not present in the distillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) In NESMD, light-absorbing (CB) NPs are embedded in an electrospun PVA layer deposited on a PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon solar illumination, the CB-laden membrane layer generates an elevated vapor pressure with no additional heat source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water vapor condenses at the distillatemembrane interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A generalized module that features two regions: R1 and R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R1: Water molecules transport and heat conduction are not allowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat to the feed is provided by the nanoparticles (NPs)-embedded PVA layer through light-to-heat conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is the same for configuration A and configuration B. R2: Evaporation and water molecules are allowed through the PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In configuration A, the PVA layer is also present to reproduce the NESMD working principle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In configuration B, there is no PVA layer to mimic a solar MD device where the input water must be preheated (in R1) before the evaporationcondensation process begins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both configurations, ambient temperature is 20 °C, feed input is 17 mL/min, and distillate input is 136 mL/min as in the performed experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fabrication_of_the_Photothermal_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before applying the photothermal coating, one side of the PVDF membrane was contacted with a 2 mg/mL dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma) solution in 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.5) for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polydopamine layer formed aids in adhesion of the hydrophilic photothermal coating to the hydrophobic PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare the electrospinning solution, functionalized CB NPs (Cabot Corporation) were first suspended in deionized water using probe sonication (Sonics Vibra-Cell; 35 W) for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly(vinyl alcohol), N-methyl-4(4-formylstyryl)pyridinium methosulfate acetal (PVA-SbQ) (Polysciences) was then added to the suspension to yield a final PVA-SbQ concentration of 8.87%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspension was vortexed to evenly distribute the polymer and the CB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CB concentration was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 wt% in the electrospinning solution, corresponding to 1.111 wt% in the PVA-SbQ polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The electrospinning solution was loaded in a 3-mL syringe placed 10 cm away from the aluminum sheet metal collector plate, where the polydopamine-coated PVDF membrane was mounted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The syringe was advanced using a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems; NE-1000) at the rate of 0.5 mL/min, and a 10-kV voltage was applied (Gamma High Voltage Research; ES50P-5W) between the syringe tip and the collector plate (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After electrospinning for 3 h, the membrane was placed in a photoreactor (Luzchem; LZC-4V) equipped with 8 UV-A bulbs (Hitachi; FL8BL-B; peak emission at 352 nm) for 30 min to cross-link the styrylpyridinium groups (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A beaker of water was placed inside the chamber to maintain the humidity level and prevent dehydration of the PVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NESMD experiments were carried out using a custom-built membrane distillation module (Fig S3) in direct-contact mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic of the system and the actual setup is shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane module consists of a 1-mm-thick quartz window with dimensions of 3.3 × 6.8 cm on the feed side to allow sunlight illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow channel dimensions were 3.48 × 8.10 × 0.15 cm on both the feed and distillate sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1-mm-thick polypropylene mesh spacer (McMaster; catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9265T49) was used on the distillate side, and a modified spacer with perpendicular mesh segments removed was used on the feed side to support the membrane while maintaining laminar flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-flow velocities in the feed and distillate channels were 0.54 cm/s (flow rate, 17 mL/min) and 4.34 cm/s (flow rate, 136 mL/min), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feed stream (saline stream) on the top of the membrane was a 1% NaCl (J. T. Baker) solution stored in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and deionized water (produced by a Barnstead E-Pure system and Milli-Q Integral; Millipore) was used for the distillate stream at the bottom of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose 1% salinity to mimic average salinity of brackish water, which is a main saline water supply used inland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maintain stable temperatures on both sides of the membrane, the feed and distillate were cooled by 15-m-long chilling coils submerged in a shaded ice bath before entering the NESMD module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feed and distillate were continuously circulated through the membrane module using peristaltic pumps (Masterflex L/S) in a countercurrent flow mode, where feed and distillate streams flow in opposite directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The insulated distillate reservoir was kept on a weighing balance (Denver Instruments; P402) connected to a computer equipped with data acquisition software (TAL Tech WinWedge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in distillate mass was measured with the balance at 1-min intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sketch of a vertical cross-section of the module is shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inline conductivity meter (Oakton pH/CON 510 series) was installed at the exit of the distillate channel to monitor the salinity of the distillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inlet and outlet temperatures for both the feed and distillate streams were measured using in-line thermometers (Traceable; no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4351).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NEMD experiments with solar concentration, a 25.4 × 25.4 cm Fresnel lens was used to concentrate sunlight on the membrane surface by a factor of 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unconcentrated and concentrated solar intensities at the NESMD module surface were 0.7 and 17.5 kW·m2, respectively (Thorlabs; S350C; Thermal Surface Absorber).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We understand that the Fresnel lens used for solar concentration has optical losses; however, we use the incident power at the NESMD module surface as the input power for the efficiency calculations, as we are interested in the NESMD unit performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All system components, except the membrane module, Fresnel lens, computer, and power meter were enclosed in an insulated box made of radiation barrier foam to prevent excessive solar heating of the system components (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Salt_Rejection_Through_the_Membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Salt rejection is defined as the percent reduction in salinity between the distillate and the feed, calculated using the following:SaltRejection(%)=(1distillatefeed)×100%,where distillate is the conductivity of the distillate, and feed is the conductivity of the feed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductivity of the distillate (distillate) was calculated using a mass balance on salt in the entire distillate loop:Md×d=Mf×fMi×i,where Md is the total mass distilled through the membrane, d is the conductivity of the distillate, Mf is the final mass of water in the distillate loop, f is the corresponding final conductivity, Mi is the initial mass of water in the distillate loop, and i is the corresponding initial conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this mass balance, the distillate conductivity was 60 ± 30 S/cm for these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial conductivity of the 1% NaCl feed was 17,310 S/cm, so the salt rejection was 99.7 ± 0.17%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the salt content of the distillate is around 50 ppm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Finite-Element_Method_3D_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A finite-element method (FEM)-based 3D model was developed using a commercial software (COMSOL 5.2) to describe the coupled heat, fluid, and mass transfer processes in the NEMD system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry and dimensions of the model system were kept the same as in the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model system is composed of four regions (domains): the feed channel (where salty or polluted water flows), the photothermal coating (containing light-absorbing NPs), the PVDF membrane, and the distillate channel (where water vapor condenses to form pure water).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The porous photothermal coating is a gel with high water content; moreover, its thickness (25 µm) is much thinner than the overall channel (1.5 mm); therefore, only water properties are used for the channels (feed and distillate) and the PVA layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific heat at constant pressure, Cm, and density, m, of the PVDF membrane, were calculated using an effective medium theory as a function of the membrane porosity () and temperature (41):Cm(T,)=(1)CPVDF+Cair(T),[S1]m(T,)=(1)PVDF+air(T),[S2]where CPVDF=1,120J/kgK, PVDF=1.78g/cm3 (42), and kair(T) (33), Cair(T), and air(T) are the properties of PVDF and air, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermal conductivity, one of the key parameters of the system, was described using the MaxwellEucken approach (43):km(T,)=kPVDFkair(T)+2kPVDF2(kPVDFkair(T))kair(T)+2kPVDF+(kPVDFkair(T)),[S3]where kPVDF=0.19W/mK (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effective diffusion coefficient, Dm, of water vapor was estimated by the Bruggeman correlation (44) for tortuosity () and porosity (=0.65, ==0.806):Dm(T,p)=Dwair(T),[S4]where temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of water in air, Dwair(T), can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45 (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such correlation holds for relatively large pore sizes (100400 nm), and is applicable to the PVDF membrane (200-nm nominal pore size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller pore dimensions (less_than2 nm) would require more specific approaches (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three sets of equations are iteratively solved numerically to obtain the water vapor flux and temperature profile in the membrane module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NavierStokes and the continuity equations are solved in all of the regions except the PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equations assume a single-phase fluid flow and, in their complete form, read as follows (47, 48):t+(u)=0,[S5]ut+(u)u=[pI+]+F,[S6]Cp(Tt+(u)T)=(q)+:STT|p(t+(u)p)+Q,[S7]where =w(T) and Cp=Cw,p(T) are the temperature-dependent density (in kilograms per cubic meter) and specific heat at constant pressure [joules/(kilogramkelvin)] (49) of water respectively, u is the velocity vector (in meters per second), p is the pressure (in pascals),  is the viscous stress (in pascals), F is the volume force vector (in newtons per cubic meter), T is the absolute temperature (in kelvin), q is the heat flux vector (in watts per square meter), Q represents the heat that will be later introduced (in watts per cubic meter), and S is the strain-rate tensor given by the following:S=12((u)+(u)T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S8]The operation : denotes the contraction between tensors defined as follows:a:b=nmanmbnm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]The constitutive relation to close the equation system (Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5S8) is given, for a Newtonian fluid, by a linear relationship between stress and strain obtained by Stokes (50):=2S23(u)I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]Here,  represents the dynamic viscosity (in pascals), which, for a Newtonian fluid, depends on the thermodynamic state only and not on the velocity field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the PVDF membrane domain, the mass conservation equation is solved instead (47, 48):ct+(Dc)+uci=0,[S11]where c is the concentration of water vapor and D=Dm(T,p) is the modified diffusion coefficient defined above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in the current model convective mechanisms in the membrane are neglected (u=0), we notice that further physical phenomena may be integrated by coupling Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 with NavierStokes equations through the velocity field u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermal transport equations are solved in all domains and read as follows:Cp(Tt+uT)+q=Q,[S12]where q=kT is the heat flux by conduction, with k being the thermal conductivity [watts/(meterkelvin)] defined by km(T,) for the membrane domain or water conductivity kw(T) for the channels and the PVA layer (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice how NavierStokes equations are coupled to thermal transport equations through the velocity field u, which is different from zero within the feed, the distillate, and the PVA domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model also features a subdomain within the PVA layer, which accounts for the finite size of the transparent window through which the sun impinges on the NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the schematic of the setup used for the modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The heat generated by the CB NPs is represented, in the model, by an exponentially decreasing power dissipation density across the thickness of the active region of the PVA layer:Q(z)=wt%cMIsunewt%c(z0z),[S13]where c = 182 cm1 is the experimentally determined absorption coefficient per weight percentage point (wt%) of CB NPs embedded in the PVA layer (Fig S1B), M is the magnification factor related to the focusing lens (M = 1 when no lens is used), Isun is the incident solar power intensity (0.7 kW/m2), which depends on weather conditions and was measured during each experiment, and z0 represents the z coordinate of the photothermal coating surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following section, a brief description of the calculation process and its underlying physics are described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initially, all domains are fixed at ambient temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feed and distillate inlet surfaces, however, are set at the temperature used in the experiment, Tfeed and Tperm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, feed and distillate input velocities parallel to the device length and normal to the inlet surfaces are set to vfeed and vperm, the cross-flow velocities used in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the experimental setup, feed and distillate flows can both be set in the same (cocurrent) or in opposite (countercurrent) directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To replicate the low-feed and distillate velocities at the PVDF membrane surfaces, no-slip boundary conditions have been set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, at the membrane surfaces, the velocity of the fluid is zero (u = 0), and thus the fluid is not moving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a typical boundary condition for laminar flow, which is justified by the relatively low velocities of the fluxes used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we can consider the Reynolds number for a flow in a pipe, Re=w|u|DH/w, where DH2ab/(a+b) (53) with a=1.5mm being the height and b, the width of the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ba, then DH2a=3mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A back of the envelope calculation assuming w103kg/m3, u=|u|1cm/s, and w0.001Pas gives Re  30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actual data extracted from the model depending on the case, confirm this approximation with lower values in the feed Re  1050 than in the distillate Re  80140 due to the larger fluid velocities used in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatively low Reynolds numbers, especially in the feed where heat sources are present, are consistent with a laminar flow approximation and no-slip boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger velocities or rougher surfaces would, however, require the turbulent regime to be fully taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PVDF membrane domain is governed by diffusion equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the membrane surfaces (parallel to the channels), an initial concentration of c0=hrelw,max/Mw=0.19095mol/m3 is set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, hrel=0.2 is the chosen initial relative humidity, w,max=0.0172kg/m3 is the maximum amount of water for 100% humidity at 20 °C, and Mw=18.015g/mol is the molar mass of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the calculation starts, the heat generated in the PVA layer increases the temperature of the nearby domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the feed flow increases its temperature close to the PVDF membrane and increases its water vapor concentration at the feed channelPVDF membrane interface given by the following:c=psat(T)RT,[S14]where psat(T) is the temperature-dependent saturation pressure of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The now-increased vapor pressure at the feed side induces a concentration gradient across the membrane, and diffusion equations (within the COMSOL Transport of Diluted Species module framework) are then solved using the diffusion coefficient introduced before, Dm(T,p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latent heat transfer due to water vapor transport through the membrane is accounted for by placing two opposite boundary heat sources on the PVDF membrane surfaces:Qbound=±Hvapf,[S15]where Hvap=44.2kJ/mol is water enthalpy of evaporation and f is the computed molar flux with units of moles per square metersecond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations can be performed both in stationary or time-dependent regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, the mass of fresh water produced over time, Wtime (in kilograms) (which can be directly compared with experimental results) can be calculated as follows:Wtime=0tdtfMwdxdy,[S16]where the first integral takes into account the increase of fresh water over time and the second double integral accounts for the total water produced over the whole device PVDF membrane area (Atotal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stationary regime, the rate of water production Wrate (in kilograms per second) can be evaluated instead as follows:Wrate=fMwdxdy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S17]Another useful parameter that can be calculated is the fresh water rate normalized by the area, that is, the effective flux J (in kilograms per square metersecond), which is simply given by the following:J=Wrate/Atotal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S18]Finally, to estimate the overall device efficiency , it is possible to relate the solar input energy and the effective generated vapor flux as follows:=HvapfMwdxdyMIsunAactive,[S19]where Aactive is the active area of the PVDF membrane surface, meaning the portion of the membrane corresponding to the transparent window illuminated by solar radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the window represents 100% of the device-exposed surface, then Aactive=Atotal, where Atotal is the total area of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This parameter is important because it establishes what fraction of the available energy is actually converted into vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because current experiments (and thus models) do not feature heat recovery, assuming a very good insulation of the device (in the model the external surfaces of the device are thermally insulated), less_than1 is due to two mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a portion of input energy is lost within the flowing feed itself: the flow increases its temperature, but the heat does not contribute to evaporation and simply leaves the device as thermal energy of the feed outflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the nonzero thermal conductivity of the PVDF membrane allows for heat to be conductively lost through the membrane, and thus the available energy for evaporation is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regarding the practical design of the device, symmetry with respect to the XZ plane is adopted to compute only one-half of the total mesh elements of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is worth mentioning that all of the computed variables within the models are space dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present calculation approach allows for flexibility both from a physical and from a geometrical point of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, further equations may be introduced to account for additional relevant effects, which can be added in future experimental conditions, and the shape and dimensions of the model may be tailored to meet the designers objectives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_of_CB_NP_Concentration_for_NESMD_Application  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the absorption coefficients, a, obtained from optical characterization of photothermal membranes in the COMSOL modeling of the NESMD system, we obtain the average temperature at the surface of the PVDF membrane with varying CB NP concentrations in the PVA for feed and distillate inlet temperature of 20 °C as shown in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration corresponding to photon absorption maps simulated with Monte Carlo simulation in Fig 2B (1.1 wt%), Fig 2C (5.5 wt%), and Fig 2D (11 wt%) are marked with dashed lines in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it can be seen from Fig 2G, the absorption coefficient of the photothermal membrane varies with the wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a value of absorption coefficient for 5.5 wt% CB NP concentration used in the experiments, we take the average of experimental reflectance values over the solar spectral irradiance (54) in the range from 400 to 800 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then use Fig 2G to adopt the absorption coefficient corresponding to the average reflectance value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 5.5 wt% CB NP concentration, we get an absorption coefficient of 1,000 cm1, which corresponds to 182 cm1/wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lower concentrations of CB in PVA absorb less sunlight and thus produce less heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At very high (20 wt%) CB NP concentrations, most of the sunlight is absorbed in the light-absorbing layer; however, the absorption occurs on top of the PVA layer, away from the PVDF membrane surface (as it can be seen in photon absorption map in Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At optimal concentration, most of the sunlight gets absorbed in the PVA layer and it produces a temperature increase near the surface of the PVDF membrane, which is desired to get a higher temperature gradient across the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At concentrations higher than 5.5 wt%, we observed that the electrospun fibers contained NP beading, leading to nonuniform electrospinning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we decided to work with 5.5 wt% CB NP concentration in photothermal membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Portable_NESMD_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As it can be seen in Fig S2, all of the components of the NESMD systemNESMD module (Fig S3, Inset), feed and distillate reservoirs, digital thermometers, conductivity meter, peristaltic pumps, computer, chilling coils, power meter, etc.were placed on a cart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We brought this cart outside (Fig S3) to perform the solar experiments shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the residual heating in the membrane, we performed measurements with PVDF membrane electrospun with PVA without any CB NPs as shown in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flux obtained by covering this membrane gives the contribution from the experimental temperature difference across the membrane, JMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this membrane is exposed to sunlight, we find the flux due to system temperature difference and the residual heating in the system, JMD+Jres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature difference at the feed and distillate inputs, monitored with digital thermometers, do not change more than ±1 °C during the course of this experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference of the flux between uncovered and covered membrane gives us the flux due to residual heating, Jres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the Jres value obtained at M = 1 in Fig S4A in Fig 3B and that obtained at M = 25 in Fig S4B in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flux obtained by covering CB-laden photothermal membrane gives the contribution from the experimental temperature difference across the membrane, JMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is used to take out the contribution of JMD from total flux from Fig S4A in Fig 3B and at M = 25 from Fig S4B in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Membrane_Porosity_on_Thermal_Conductivity_and_Diffusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeling results demonstrate how increasing membrane porosity reduces the thermal conductivity of the membrane and increases the diffusion coefficient of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in thermal conductivity increases the temperature gradient across the membrane and increases the diffusion coefficient, resulting in increases in flux through the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, increasing porosity of the membrane (Fig S6) will improve the performance of both NESMD and MD system as seen in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Linear_Increase_in_NESMD_Flux_and_Efficiency_with_Ambient_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increase of flux (and efficiency) with Tamb (shown in Fig 4D) can be expected if we consider how the concentration (c) of water vapor depends on temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have that c=psat(T)/RT, where psat is the saturation pressure of water, and it is known to depend exponentially on temperature (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R is the ideal gas constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S10B shows concentrations c for the experimental (black) and scaled device (red) with their dependence on Tamb (dashed lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the trend is exponential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As concentration increases exponentially, one would expect flux and efficiency to follow the same behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, from Fig 4D, we observe a fairly linear trend in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent mismatch can be explained by calculating the actual temperature gradient across the membrane, as reported in Fig S10A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, it is shown that for higher Tamb, the temperature drop across the membrane is lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although it is true that c grows exponentially with temperature, the temperature difference across the membrane, which drives molecular diffusion, drops linearly with Tamb (Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net result is a linearly increasing flux across the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is shown in Fig S10B, where concentration gradients in the z direction for the two device dimensions, experimental (black) and scaled device (red), are plotted with respect to Tamb (solid lines), showing a linear trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the concentration increases exponentially (on both sides of the membrane), the concentration gradient has a linear dependence on ambient temperature due to a decreasing temperature difference across the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, operating NESMD module at elevated ambient temperatures will increase the device performance with both the feed and distillate inlet temperatures being at Tamb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Performance_of_NESMD_and_MD_with_Increasing_Module_Size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the performance of the NESMD and MD with increasing module size using theoretical FEM modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we plot the temperature at the top and bottom of the PVDF membrane in the NESMD (Fig S7C) and MD (Fig S7A) modules for the same size of 3 × 10 cm, we observe that the temperature gradient across the PVDF membrane decreases with length across the module in MD (Fig S7A), whereas it increases with length in NESMD (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Similar trend is observed for larger dimensions of 10 × 100 cm for MD (Fig S7B) and NESMD (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature gradient across the membrane is positive, that is, when the feed temperature is higher than the distillate temperature, we get positive flux across the membrane with water evaporating from the feed and condensing in the distillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can consider the active area of the membrane as the region where the temperature gradient is positive (shown as gray area in Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculating the percentage of active area for a module with fixed width of 10 cm and length varying from 10 to 100 cm in steps of 10 cm, we get more than 94% active area for NESMD at each length (black circles in Fig 4C), and exponentially dropping active area for MD at longer lengths (red triangles in Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flux_Through_the_NESMD_Module  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total area of the NESMD module is 8.1 × 3.48 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the area of illumination is 6.8 × 3.3 cm in the case of no solar magnification, and 3.3 × 3.3 cm with 25× solar magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we analyzed the fluxes from different components JMD, Jres, and JNP in the main text, the total module area of 8.1 × 3.48 cm was considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to accurately evaluate the effect of the CB NPs, only the area of illumination should be considered because mainly that area is giving the resulting distillate flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, JNP is normalized by the illumination area and compared with JMD and Jres in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we can clearly see that the contribution of JNP to the total flux significantly increases with magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NESMD_and_MD_Efficiency_Comparison  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A direct comparison between NESMD and MD systems is difficult for two main reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, MD did not find wide-scale commercial applications yet and standardized performance data are still missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, even if several MD configurations have been proposed, the values of the corresponding efficiency parameters [e.g., gain output ratio (GOR), energy consumption (EC), or water production cost (WPC)] can vary substantially and even span more than three orders of magnitude (for EC and WPC in particular) depending on assumptions and the considered system (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, GOR measures the overall energy efficiency of a system, and it can be defined as follows:GOR==HvapmpQh,[S20]where Hvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, mp is the distillate production rate, and Qh is the power input of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This definition of efficiency is quite general and it has been used in the rest of the work (reported as ) to establish NESMD energy efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EC is the specific energy consumption and relates the energy input to the production of 1 m3 of distillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the particular desalination system, recirculation and heat recovery techniques, EC values can range from 1 to 9,000 kWh/m3 (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WPC is expressed in dollars per cubic meter and expresses the total costs associated to the production of a given quantity of fresh water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the chosen technology, considered energy source, components, and cost reporting methods, values range from 0.3 to 130 $/m3 (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional parameters have been recently proposed to evaluate MD efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it has been shown how GOR can be further decomposed in thermal efficiency () and effectiveness () as (57):GOR=1,[S21]where  compares the distillate enthalpy change to its maximum possible value and is defined as follows (57):=Tdistillate,OUTTdistillate,INTfeed,INTdistillate,IN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S22]Although these additional parameters can be useful to evaluate conventional MD performance, especially when heat recovery is considered, they are not suitable for our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact,  alone would diverge in NESMD which works at ambient temperature and has Tfeed,IN=Tdistillate,IN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As consequence, we decided to compare NESMD and MD configurations by considering the amount of water that can be produced from each module for the same footprint, that is, a given available surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having available surface and input energy intensity (sun irradiation at 0.7 kW/m2) as the only external parameters, allows us to fairly compare the two systems at their core working-principle level and without the need to consider any accessory technology or equipment (e.g., pumps, light collectors, heat exchangers, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison approach is also consistent with the proposed employment of NESMD in rural areas, remote zones, or poor regions where the transport and construction of bulky and costly devices could be difficult to achieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S8, we report the scheme of the device used to compare NESMD and MD processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feed and distillate are in countercurrent configuration and enter a module with length Ltotal and fixed width of 5 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feed enters the device in the first region (R1), which extends for a length Lsun and allows water heating but not evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a nonporous thermal insulator is considered between the NPs+PVA layer and the distillate channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, the feed proceeds to the second region (R2), which depends on the chosen configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In configuration A, R2 reproduces exactly an NESMD module: heating and evaporation happen in parallel while the feed flows along the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In configuration B, R2 allows for evaporation but not water heating (the NPs+PVA layer is not present), thus emulating the process of a MD module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, R2 regions, in both configurations, are the operative sections of either NESMD or MD technologies, that is, they represent the regions where the water purification process (evaporation plus condensation) takes place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, R1 regions can be considered as pure power source regions where available energy (sun irradiation) is converted into heat by means of an efficient, cheap, and optics-free method (light-to-heat conversion in the NPs+PVA layer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that the choice of this light-to-heat conversion method does not lead to any loss of generality because it places MD and NESMD on the same level where a continuous flux of water can be provided to the system without the need of salty/polluted water reservoirs and solar collectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can therefore consider configuration A as a generalized version of NESMD where the power source region (R1) is added to the conventional NEMSD module (R2) so that a direct comparison can be carried out with a solar powered MD system, configuration B, that, unlike NESMD, requires a dedicated power source area (R1) before water purification can begin (R2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We will now vary the extension of R1 in both configurations to identify the role played by the power source zone in the generalized NESMD and solar MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S9A, we plot the efficiency (), calculated as in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20 with Qh=I0DLtotal(I0=0.7kW/m2, D=5cm), depending on the size of the power source region R1 for configuration A and configuration B at four different total lengths (Ltotal = 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if NESMD does not strictly require a power source only region (light can be converted to heat in R2 as well), the purpose is to compare NESMD and MD in the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, we find that both processes can be optimized to yield a maximum efficiency at specific Lsun values, which approach the total device length for increasing Ltotal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a major difference between NESMD and MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NESMD, as mentioned, the whole device area is dedicated to both heat generation and water evaporation: even for shorter Lsun values, the purification process is sustained and the efficiency saturates at constant values at Lsun = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MD, a vanishing Lsun translates into an absence of power input, and thus the efficiency diminishes and goes to zero for Lsun = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both NESMD and MD, the efficiency reaches zero in the case Lsun  Ltotal because no room for evaporation would be left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig S9A, it is evident how, for the same footprint, NESMD efficiency is always higher than MD efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in Fig S9A, a trend can be observed: for longer modules (increasing Ltotal), the MD efficiency moves close to the NESMD efficiency if Lsun is optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, we can understand this trend as follows: while in R1, the feed flux absorbs heat and its temperature keeps increasing; because a higher temperature at the beginning of R2 favors the evaporation process (distillate inlet is at ambient temperature), an efficiency maximum exists when the temperature gain in R1 balances a shorter evaporation region in R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One may think to extend this concept to much longer modules, but in that limit very high temperatures would be reached and the water boiling point would constitute a limit, especially in simple devices that run at ambient pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S9B, we compare the efficiencies between pure NESMD (Lsun = 0 for every Ltotal) and an optimized MD system (specific Lsun for each Ltotal), depending on the maximum temperature reached, for modules of total length from 0.25 to 2 m. Remarkably, NESMD features efficiencies up to 30% while keeping the module at a maximum temperature below 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar efficiencies are achieved by MD systems only at much higher temperatures: for the 2-m case, an efficiency of about 32% is reached when the temperature at the end of the R1 region is 73 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In these calculations, we considered the modules to be thermally insulated from the ambient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonideal insulators would decrease the actual device efficiency, especially in the case of warmer fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact, in addition to the practical convenience of maintaining near-ambient temperature water, points to NESMD as a viable technology that can be implemented straightforwardly in a low-tech environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To conclude, we compared NESMD and MD by considering, for both cases, the same footprint, that is, available surface and input power source (solar irradiation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that NESMD has a higher efficiency than MD for modules with lengths up to 2 m. Even if it is true that the total input power of NESMD is constant, whereas, in the MD case, it would depend on the dimension of R1, it is found that, for similar efficiencies, MD requires much higher temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular for longer modules, MD can be optimized only at increasing Lsun/Ltotal ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that for larger-scale systems, the total input power for NESMD and MD also becomes similar, whereas NESMD can achieve the same efficiency at much lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
