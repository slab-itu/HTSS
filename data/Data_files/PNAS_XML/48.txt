Sequential divergence and the multiplicative origin of community diversity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding how new life forms originate is a central question in biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population divergence is usually studied with respect to how single lineages diverge into daughter taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, populations may not always differentiate in isolation; divergence of one taxon could create new niche opportunities in higher trophic levels, leading to the sequential origin of many new taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that this may be occurring for three species of parasitoid wasps attacking Rhagoletis fruit flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As flies shift and adapt to new host plants, wasps follow suit and diverge in kind, resulting in a multiplicative increase of diversity as the effects of ecologically based divergent selection cascade through the ecosystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biodiversity therefore may potentially beget increasing levels of biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenotypic and genetic variation in one species can influence the composition of interacting organisms within communities and across ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the divergence of one species may not be an isolated process, as the origin of one taxon could create new niche opportunities for other species to exploit, leading to the genesis of many new taxa in a process termed sequential divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we test for such a multiplicative effect of sequential divergence in a community of host-specific parasitoid wasps, Diachasma alloeum, Utetes canaliculatus, and Diachasmimorpha mellea (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), that attack Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flies in the R. pomonella species complex radiated by sympatrically shifting and ecologically adapting to new host plants, the most recent example being the apple-infesting host race of R. pomonella formed via a host plant shift from hawthorn-infesting flies within the last 160 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using population genetics, field-based behavioral observations, host fruit odor discrimination assays, and analyses of life history timing, we show that the same host-related ecological selection pressures that differentially adapt and reproductively isolate Rhagoletis to their respective host plants (host-associated differences in the timing of adult eclosion, host fruit odor preference and avoidance behaviors, and mating site fidelity) cascade through the ecosystem and induce host-associated genetic divergence for each of the three members of the parasitoid community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, divergent selection at lower trophic levels can potentially multiplicatively and rapidly amplify biodiversity at higher levels on an ecological time scale, which may sequentially contribute to the rich diversity of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Three scenarios of codivergence in a hostparasitoid system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) A single sequential divergence event, (B) sequential divergence with multiplicative amplification of biodiversity, and (C) cospeciation in allopatry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A, codivergence is driven by the cascade of divergent ecological selection pressures across trophic levels in sympatry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a degree of divergent ecological adaptation must accompany the host shift such that parasitoids are not merely moving between geographically separated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In B, the multiplicative effects of sequential divergence can be seen as several members of the parasitoid community diverge in parallel with their host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C, codivergence (cospeciation) occurs after host plant, fly, and parasitoid populations become jointly geographically isolated (black bar), resulting in parallel allopatric speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, little differentiation need accompany the initial host shift of fly or parasitoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cospeciation is not necessarily driven by the creation and adaptation to new niches but by the concordant geographic and reproductive separation of hosts and parasitoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The community of host-specific parasitoids that attack members of the (A) Rhagoletis pomonella sibling species complex: (B) D. alloeum, (C) D. mellea, and (D) U. canaliculatus that (E) emerge from the fly pupal case as adults following overwintering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar, 1 mm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summary of conditions (criteria) conducive to and supporting hypotheses of sympatric host race formation (modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) and sequential divergence (modified from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 and 13)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
mtDNA_Divergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To make a case for the sequential divergence of U. canaliculatus and D. mellea, it must be shown that populations attacking the derived apple fly do not represent unrecognized sibling species associated with different Rhagoletis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, differences could be erroneously attributed to ecological adaptation following a recent sympatric host shift when, in fact, they represent older speciation events that potentially occurred in allopatry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for the existence of cryptic sibling species, we sequenced a 540-bp region of the mtDNA COI (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) gene for specimens morphologically classified as U. canaliculatus and D. mellea attacking apple, hawthorn, blueberry, flowering dogwood, snowberry, and black cherry flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of sibling species would be indicated by diverged mtDNA haplotypes that, upon analysis using nuclear-encoded microsatellites, would identify as genetically distinct populations, implying an absence of gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concept that biodiversity begets biodiversity is deeply engrained in biology (49, 1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential divergence has been proposed to help explain a number of diverse patterns, including radiations following mass extinctions (46), species diversity in the tropics (7), and macroevolutionary patterns of diversification in herbivorous insects (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the process has rarely been explicitly studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we document for the first time, to our knowledge, the genetic signatures of and ecological mechanisms promoting rapid, sequential divergence for three distinct species, as the same host-related ecological adaptations associated with host choice and life history timing in Rhagoletis appear to have evolved concordantly and multiplicatively in the parasitoid community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We caution, however, that our results represent a single datum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are needed to assess how common and taxonomically widespread sequential divergence, evaluate its importance for generating patterns of biodiversity, and assess its role in assembling novel guilds or communities de novo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditions promoting sequential divergence (Table 1 and Fig 1) may not be common for many species and may be difficult to empirically test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, even if sequential divergence is rare, it could still, through a multiplicative effect, make a nontrivial contribution to the origin of new taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for organisms such as insects and their parasites that experience and partition resources on a fine scale (39), the effects of new niche construction may cascade through ecosystems and have an important effect on biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that an estimated 1030 million plant-feeding insect species exist (40), that each phytophagous insect is likely attacked by 1 parasitoid (41), and that host-specific parasitoids account for an estimated 25% of insects (40), sequential divergence may be an underappreciated process (1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional concerns regarding sequential divergence require clarification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we associated the process with sympatric divergence with gene flow (criterion 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This need not always be the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical element is that divergent ecological selection pressures transcend trophic levels to generate new biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sequential divergence may occur in any geographic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, sequential divergence is also possible in allopatry if the evolution of RI is driven by adaptation to a new host following migration of a parasite into a different geographic area (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, verifying that population divergence was due to the cascading effects of selection from plant, to insect, to parasitoid, as opposed to genomic conflict and RI arising as an inadvertent by-product of mutation order processes (42, 43), is difficult in the absence of gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we focused on an example of sequential divergence involving sympatric host shifts, allowing us to directly document the multiplicative potential of the process in action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we excluded mtDNA haplotypes A and B in Utetes from further analysis here, but these taxa may represent cases of sequential divergence when considered from a broader geographic perspective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also defined the process with respect to population divergence rather than using the previously defined term sequential speciation (14) to convey a focus on recent sympatric host shifts for empirical testing and to remove any presumption of the evolutionary outcome of our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our results support the sequential divergence hypothesis, it is not possible to discern the long-term evolutionary fate of the species we studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are unable to determine, with certainty, if these taxa will diverge further along the speciation continuum (44), represent frozen multistate polymorphisms in evolutionary equilibrium between selection and gene flow, or have already attained species status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, case studies of speciation must rely on inferences drawn from comparisons involving a series of related population pairs at varying stages along the speciation continuum (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore contend that host-specific populations of D. alloeum, D. mellea, and U. canaliculatus provide an opportunity to make inferences concerning the critical ecological attributes and adaptations initiating sequential divergence that may result in speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theory suggests that, during ecological divergence, populations may diverge incrementally through time before a threshold level of differentiation is reached and the genomes of taxa rapidly congeal into new species (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, populations that appear to be in evolutionary limbo may be slowly accumulating new mutations of small effect and progressively inching their way toward species status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the two cryptic Utetes taxa we discovered (Fig 2A) imply that the wasps have the potential to diverge further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains to be determined whether sequential divergence alone (cascading ecological selection pressures), or in conjunction with other mechanisms, contributes to the transition from races or biotypes to species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With respect to the current taxonomic status of wasp populations, we cast our experimental design in terms of eight criteria supporting sympatric host race formation and sequential divergence (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support, partially or in whole, criteria 17 for Rhagoletis and its parasitoid community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to difficulties in wasp husbandry, we could not test for host fly-related fitness tradeoffs among populations (criterion 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocal fruit transplant studies of apple- and hawthorn-infesting R. pomonella have failed to detect host-related differences in larval feeding performance with respect to survivorship to pupariation (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, tradeoffs in larval performance have been documented for R. pomonella sibling species (33, 34) that may distinguish species from the apple and hawthorn host races.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the same is true for wasps, experiments investigating performance tradeoffs may help establish the taxonomic status of D. alloeum, D. mellea, and U. canaliculatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, estimates of habitat isolation via host odor discrimination and temporal isolation via differences in eclosion timing substantially reproductively isolate host-associated populations of D. alloeum, D. mellea, and U. canaliculatus (Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account the relative contribution of each measure of RI (SI Text), temporal isolation and habitat isolation can act in concert to produce prezygotic RI among pairs of D. alloeum (7094%), U. canaliculatus (8599%), and D. mellea (7990%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other cues in addition to fruit surface volatiles also likely increase host plant fidelity and habitat isolation for the wasps (e.g., differences in fruit color, size, and taste), as in Rhagoletis (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host fruit odor discrimination could also contribute to postzygotic RI for the wasps due to hybrid behavioral sterility, as it may for Rhagoletis (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, competition may limit the potential for multiplicative sequential divergence (25), placing limits on the overall number of parasitoids that can simultaneously share the same host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we discovered two cryptic, highly diverged haplotypes of egg-attacking Utetes sharing snowberry and flowering dogwood hosts, suggesting that wasps can subdivide the fly resource and avoid extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, competition does occur among Rhagoletis parasitoids, as only one adult wasp ecloses when a single fly is attacked by multiple parasitoids (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, larval-attacking D. mellea and D. alloeum overlap in host use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, several species cooccur, and it is possible that interspecific interactions may foster diversity by selecting for newly shifting wasps to differentiate to avoid competition on novel hosts, reducing temporal overlap and increasing their RI from ancestral population (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, eclosion time differences exist not only within each species attacking different fly hosts but also between parasitoid species sharing the same host (Table 2 and Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a degree of temporal niche partitioning for oviposition sites exists among species, a common phenomenon among parasitoids sharing the same host (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although speculative, this may permit coexistence of multiple species on shared fly hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, escape from parasitism itself may also favor host shifting in Rhagoletis (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, host plant, fly, and wasp may play a tritrophic coevolutionary game of hide and seek that spins off several new life forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimen_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Host fruits infested with parasitized flies were collected from nine sites in the eastern United States from 2006 to 2012 (Fig S1, Table S1, and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six of these sites for U. canaliculatus and four for D. mellea represent locations where two or more Rhagoletis taxa were sympatric (less_than1.5 km apart) or in close proximity (less_than10 km apart).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twenty and 21 pairs of unique microsatellite primers were developed for U. canaliculatus and D. mellea, respectively (see data in the Dryad database).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other types of markers, microsatellites have high mutation rates and levels of polymorphism, characteristics useful for revealing subtleties in population genetic structure associated with rapid and recent divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also PCR-amplified and sequenced a 540-bp region of the mtDNA Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further details on genetic methodology, see SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Genetic_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microsatellite loci were tested for conformity to HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) in females (diploid) using Markov chain randomization methods with default parameters in Micro-Checker (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 41 microsatellites scored, no locus displayed significant deficiencies of heterozygosity in more than two populations, implying markers represented single-copy sequences that did not possess high frequencies of null alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, every haploid male possessed only a single allele for each microsatellite, and we observed no obvious null allele at each locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of microsatellites separately for each host-associated population using Burrow's composite  (52), which does not assume HWE or require phased data but instead provides a joint metric of intralocus and interlocus disequilibria based solely on genotype frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus,  is equivalent to the LD parameter D under HWE (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined multilocus haplotypes of individual males together at random, based on their frequencies in a population, to construct diploid genotypes in HWE to combine with females genotypes to estimate a single  value for each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were then transformed to a standardized correlation coefficient and combined across populations using the method of Fisher (53) to derive overall measures that were tested for significance by 2 tests, as described by Weir (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, LD was low between loci of both species, an indication that most markers were evolving independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, certain microsatellites did display significant LD, and these loci were (i) arranged stepwise with one another to form arrays interconnecting the majority of markers genotyped for each species (Fig S4) and (ii) used in association with eclosion time relationships to pool alleles at loci for GLM analysis (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested for a relationship between eclosion timing and microsatellite genotypes separately for males and females by a two-way ANOVA with genotype and host as main effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses were performed on the subset of individuals genotyped (Table S1) that were also phenotyped for eclosion timing (see data in the Dryad database).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concentrated on the sympatric pairs of wasps attacking hawthorn and apple flies, transforming the eclosion time for each individual by its SD from the mean eclosion time for each sex at the site from which it was collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalizing eclosion times allowed us to combine data across hosts and sites to test for genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the results for the main genotype effect and the genotype × host interaction because the host effect was significant in the ANOVA for all loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed stepwise multiple regressions for all microsatellites against normalized eclosion times separately for females and males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested for significant allele frequency differences between host-associated populations at sympatric sites using a nonparametric, Monte Carlo approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microsatellite genotypes were randomly resampled with replacement from the combined data set for a locus at a site to determine the probability from 100,000 replicates of generating a Neis genetic distance D (54) greater than the observed value between populations by chance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed GLM analyses at sympatric sites to test for significant host and latitude effects on microsatellite allele frequencies for each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the GLM analyses, allele frequency was modeled as a quasi-binomial variable, with host as a discrete factor and latitude as a continuous factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GLM analysis required that we collapse the microsatellites to a diallelic dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, we pooled different combinations of alleles at each locus into two variant classes, using the diallelic combination that (i) generated the highest level of LD with other loci (Fig S4) and (ii) explained the largest amount of variation in adult eclosion time (Table S6), similar to Michel et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) and Powell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22) (see data in the Dryad database).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assessed the genetic relationships among populations for COI mtDNA by constructing maximum parsimony gene trees for U. canaliculatus and D. mellea using Phylogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) 3.69 (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined relationships for the nuclear-encoded microsatellites by constructing unrooted NJ networks for U. canaliculatus and D. mellea based on Neis pairwise genetic distances calculated between populations using PHYLIP 3.69 (55), with bootstrap support determined by 10,000 replicates across loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eclosion_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The timing of adult eclosion was determined by monitoring fly pupae once daily, following overwinter, for emerging flies and wasps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult wasp longevity was calculated by measuring the interval, in days, between adult emergence and death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the degree of allochronic isolation between wasp populations due to differences in eclosion time and adult according to the formula in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_Observations_and_Behavioral_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the site of assembly for mating, we conducted 45 h of observations of behavior for both U. canaliculatus and D. mellea in stands of apple and hawthorn trees, and nearby non-Rhagoletis host plants, at sympatric study sites in Fennville and Grant, MI (14) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The responses of U. canaliculatus, D. mellea, and D. alloeum to natal and nonnatal fruit volatiles were determined using a Y-tube olfactometer based on the protocol previously developed for D. alloeum (14) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the degree of habitat isolation between wasp populations due to host fruit odor discrimination according to the formula in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Parasitoids_Biology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
D. alloeum, D. mellea, and U. canaliculatus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Opiinae) are all endoparasitoid wasps specific throughout their life cycle to flies in the genus Rhagoletis (24) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utetes attacks eggs of Rhagoletis laid beneath the surface of fruit, and D. alloeum and D. mellea lay their eggs into second and third instar fly larvae feeding within fruit (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like their fly hosts, each wasp species is univoltine, having one generation per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females alight on a host fruit and examine its surface with their antennae to detect fly eggs or larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a fly is found, a female wasp will thrust her ovipositor into the egg or larvae in the fruit (24, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a parasitized fly larva is finished feeding and the fruit falls to the ground, the maggot will leave the fruit, burrow into the soil, enter a facultative diapause, and pupate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasitoid larva will then consume its fly host and overwinter in the pupal case of the consumed fly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next summer, the wasp will complete development and eclose (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-living adult wasps reach sexual maturity within a few days and then search for host fruit to find mates and oviposition sites (24, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Genetic_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole body tissue of individual adult wasps using Puregene extraction kits (Gentra Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified samples of DNA were transferred to 96-well plates for PCR amplification, mtDNA sequencing, and microsatellite genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty and 21 pairs of unique microsatellite primers were developed for U. canaliculatus and D. mellea, respectively, from 454 whole-genomic sequencing of wasps reared from apple- and hawthorn-infesting flies collected at Grant and Fennville, MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microsatellite loci were designated with the prefix UC for U. canaliculatus and DM for D. mellea, followed by a number indicating their original order of characterization (see data in the Dryad database for details of the microsatellites).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alleles at each locus were PCR-amplified using a pair of locus-specific primers, one of which was fluorescently labeled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial denaturation period of 5 min at 94 °C, DNA was amplified for 35 cycles, followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR products were then pooled into one of four groups, each of which was genotyped separately using Fragment Analysis v.3.4 (Beckman Coulter CEQ8000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also PCR-amplified a 540-bp region of the mtDNA COI for 130 U. canaliculatus (GenBank accession numbers KT761291KT761420) and 76 D. mellea (GenBank accession numbers KT761422KT761497) attacking various fly hosts at several sites as well as a single D. alloeum (GenBank accession number KT761421) infesting a fly attacking hawthorns from Grant, MI (see Fig 3, Fig S1, and Table S1 for collecting sites) to serve as an outgroup using universal primers developed by Simon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (60) and used for D. alloeum by Forbes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified PCR products were DNA sequenced on an ABI 3700 sequencer with the ABI Prism BigDYE Terminator v3.0 system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parasitoid_Sampling_and_Husbandry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parasitized flies were collected and reared from nine sites in the midwestern and northeastern United States (Fig S1 and Table S1) as described in Forbes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infested fruit were sampled from host plants and the ground beneath plants during the summer and fall from 2006 to 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fruit were transported to a greenhouse at the University of Notre Dame where they were placed on wire mesh racks in plastic collecting trays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trays were monitored once daily for newly emerging larvae that left fruit and pupariated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fly pupae were placed in Petri dishes filled with moist vermiculite and exposed to a prewinter period of 8 d at 21 °C and a 14:10 light:day cycle in a constant-temperature room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Petri dishes were then transferred to a refrigerator and overwintered at 4 °C for 4 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 mo, the Petri dishes were removed from the cold and held in individual 15 cm × 15 cm × 25 cm Plexiglas cages supplied with water and food (a mixture of honey and brewers yeast) inside a 24 °C, 14:10 light:day cycle rearing chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cages were monitored daily for fly and wasp eclosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon eclosion, adult flies and wasps were sexed, wasps were morphologically identified to species using taxonomic keys (5759), and flies and wasps were cold-stored at 80 °C for genetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A portion of eclosing wasps were placed in separate cages and used to measure adult longevity (as described in Eclosion Time Analysis) and test for host odor discrimination (as described in Host Odor Discrimination Testing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eclosion_Time_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eclosion curves for wasps were analyzed with KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to insufficient sample sizes, we pooled individuals from sympatric sites across years and sexes (there was minimal variation between sexes, populations, and years sampled).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, due to insufficient sample size and quantity of DNA, U. canaliculatus attacking apples flies at site 5 were used in the eclosion analysis but pooled with site 6 (the nearest site less_than30 km away) for microsatellite genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, U. canaliculatus attacking flowering dogwood flies at sites 4 and 6 were pooled to represent a single northern population for microsatellite genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also coupled estimates of adult longevity with eclosion timing to calculate the potential degree of temporal isolation of adults from pairs of sympatric populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult longevity was calculated for individuals by measuring the interval, in days, between adult emergence and death by monitoring individuals placed in wire mesh cages supplied with food and water (10 wasps per cage) twice daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the degree of allochronic isolation (AI) between pairs of wasp populations according to the formulaAI=1-xiyixi2yi2where xi and yi are the proportions of wasps from populations x and y alive on day i based on their eclosion curves and probabilities of survival to day i derived from the longevity estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no difference in adult longevity between sexes, populations, or host fly origin of U. canaliculatus and D. mellea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Host_Odor_Discrimination_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthetic fruit blends (that induce the same level of response as whole fruit extracts) previously developed by coupling gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and electroantennographic detection were used for odor testing flies infesting apple, hawthorn, and flowering dogwood fruits (27, 28, 61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each blend consists of a suite of the behaviorally active chemical compounds emitted from the surface of the ripening host fruit (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we used apple, hawthorn, and flowering dogwood blends and whole fruit for blueberries (store-bought Vaccinium corymbosum from Michigan) and snowberries (field-collected uninfested Symphoricarpos albus collected from Notre Dame, IN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole fruit was not used for all behavioral assays because not all fruits keep well in the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The behavioral response of each species to host fruit odors was assayed using a Y-tube olfactometer following the methods of Forbes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y tube, unlike the flight tunnel used in odor discrimination tests for R. pomonella (27, 30), allows for the simultaneous assessment of preference and avoidance behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The olfactometer is a Y-shaped glass tube with a 250-mm-long neck that measures 19 mm in internal diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two 200-mm arms of the Y tube are each attached to a 2,000-mL Erlenmeyer flask that houses fruit odor sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flasks were placed below a 0.8 cm × 1.5 cm piece of plywood to eliminate potential visual cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon-filtered air carrying host fruit volatiles was split into each arm of the tube at a rate of 100 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire apparatus was attached to a plywood sheet held at 22 ± 2 °C and positioned below a light source (34W Cool White light bulb) to induce parasitoid movement up the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate geotaxis bias (i.e., preference for a particular arm of the Y tube with no odor present) and establish a baseline value of orientation in the Y tube for statistical analyses, we first conducted control treatments where both flasks were left odorless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed a single 3- to 6-d-old odor-naïve individual 1 cm into the neck of the Y tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 min, its position in the Y tube was recorded (left arm, right arm, or neck).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then repeated the process with one flask housing an odor source to determine if the individual oriented to either the arm containing no odor (avoidance) or odor source (preference) or remained in the neck of the Y tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process was then repeated, with each individual tested once for each odor source on different days with the order and position of the fruit odors in the Y tube (right or left arm) randomized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The odorless trials provided expected control frequencies for each wasp population to orient to the right arm, left arm, and neck of the Y tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These expected, control frequencies were then compared with the observed (odor treatment) frequencies using a 2 test to determine statistical significance (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to insufficient sample sizes, we pooled wasps having the same host fly association across sites and sexes for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated the degree of habitat isolation (HI) between pairs of wasp populations based on their fruit volatile responses in the Y-tube olfactometer using the formula from Powell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (63, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formula measures behavioral overlap between two host-associated wasp populations x and y to each others fruit volatile compounds according to the formulaHI=1-px+py2where px is the proportion of the wasp population from host fly x responding to the nonnatal fruit odor of host plant y, and py is the proportion of wasps from host fly y responding to the nonnatal fruit odor of host plant x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also estimated total prezygotic RI (PZtotal) between pairs of wasp populations attacking different hosts due to the combined effects of AI and HI using methods similar to those described by Ramsey et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of total RI take into account the absolute contribution of each barrier considering the reduction in gene flow already imposed by the barriers acting previously in the life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of each barrier at two stages of the life cycle is calculated asPZ1=AI,[S1]PZ2=HI(1-PZ1),[S2]PZtotal=PZ1+PZ2[S3]where PZ1 is the reduction of interhost migration for wasps attacking two different flies at a sympatric site, and PZ2 is the proportion of the remaining population that will avoid the alternate host given the opportunity during the period of seasonal overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total prezygotic RI (PZtotal) can then be calculated by summing across the absolute contributions of each barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cross-Reared_Diachasma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for environmental effects on host fruit odor discrimination, we reared D. alloeum collected from parasitized hawthorn and blueberry flies from Grant, MI, and Fennville, MI, respectively, for a single generation on apple flies infesting apple fruit in the laboratory and assayed the resulting adult offspring in the Y-tube olfactometer to parental versus apple fruit volatiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the summer of 2012, 400 sexually mature apple-origin R. pomonella adults originally collected from Grant, MI, in 2011 and overwintered in the laboratory were placed into a 60 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm Plexiglas cage under a tented sheet in a greenhouse at the University of Iowa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cages were stocked with artificial leaves and fly food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of fresh, store-bought apples, including Honey Crisp, Gala, and Pink Lady varieties, were scrubbed with warm water to remove surface wax, pierced with insect pins to facilitate oviposition, and placed on raised platforms near the ceiling of the cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 56 d following signs of infestation, the apples were divided and moved to two new cages, where they were placed on top of raised platforms over trays of moist vermiculite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following overwinter, 150 adult D. alloeum emerging from hawthorn-infesting flies collected from Grant, MI, and 50 D. alloeum emerging from blueberry-infesting flies collected from Fennville, MI, were placed into separate cages containing maggot-infested apples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apples in the cages were washed daily with water to remove a known oviposition-deterring pheromone deposited by D. alloeum on the surface of fruit (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhagoletis larvae emerging from the apples fell into the vermiculite and pupated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vermiculite in the cages was sifted weekly to collect pupae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pupae were then overwintered for 4 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 22 hawthorn fly-origin and five blueberry fly-origin D. alloeum adults subsequently eclosed from the overwintered pupae and were tested for their responses to their parental (natal) versus nonnatal fruit odors (as described in Host Odor Discrimination Testing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field_Observations_of_Mating_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the site of mating assembly for wasps, we conducted a total of 45 h of field observations, following the methods described by Forbes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14), from early August to mid-September in 2011 and 2012 in Grant, MI, and Fennville, MI, where stands of apple and hawthorn trees cooccur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From two to four observers walked through a study site during an observation period in search of adult U. canaliculatus and D. mellea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many species of host-specific parasitoids that attack tephritids do not disperse great distances from their natal hosts, foraging and resting primarily on or near the fruit of their host flies (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to ensure an objective and unbiased survey of the distribution of wasps at the study sites, we spent only 15 h of the total 45 h of observation focused on host trees themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the remaining 30 h, we concentrated our efforts on fruits and vegetation of non-Rhagoletis host plants within a 30-m radius from apple or hawthorn trees at these sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We detected no wasps in our field survey outside of the immediate vicinity of apple or hawthorn trees on a nonhost plant in our 30 h of observation (see Results and Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our failure to detect wasps on nonhost vegetation and fruit was not due to the parasitoids being inconspicuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Rhagoletis fly is about 10 times the mass of a Drosophila, and, as wasps do not consume their fly hosts until they have reached their full size as pupae, the wasps can be nearly as large in size (but not weight) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, D. mellea and U. canaliculatus are brightly colored (red and dark red/black, respectively) and contrast against foliage and fruit of plants (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the wasps are highly active in flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the wasps are easily spotted flying near or resting on vegetation at a distance of several meters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, flies are highly parasitized at these sites; therefore, we would have observed wasps on nonhost plants if they were present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that because many species of Rhagoletis are agricultural pests, the biology and natural history of their parasitoids is well studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, we are not aware of a documented observation of wasps on a non-Rhagoletis host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that, occasionally, wasps do occur and initiate mating on nonhost plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the 15 h that apple and hawthorn trees were surveyed, when an adult wasp was spotted, its position on the plant and sex were noted, and a stopwatch was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual was then continuously monitored for a minimum of 5 min or until mating was initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If mating was initiated during the 5-min period, the time and distance of the mating pair to the nearest host fruit were recorded, and the pair were collected and morphologically identified to species level in the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only observed individuals that initiated mating were included in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 23 mating pairs of U. canaliculatus were observed on apple (n = 9) and hawthorn (n = 14) trees, and 19 mating pairs of D. mellea were observed on apple (n = 11) and hawthorn (n = 8) trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
