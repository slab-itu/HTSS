Spatially resolved multicolor CsPbX3 nanowire heterojunctions via anion exchange  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Semiconductor heterojunction is a key building block in modern electronics and optoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accurate control over the composition, band gap, energy level (band bending), and doping level is the foundation of ideal functional heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate highly spatially resolved heterojunctions in a type of semiconductor, halide perovskites, which show great potential in photovoltaic and solid-state lighting applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accomplish this through the combination of facile anion-exchange chemistry with nanofabrication techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The halide perovskite nanowire heterojunction provides an ideal platform for fundamental studies and technological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, multicolor lasers or LEDs could be made using such localized heterojunctions; quantitative interdiffusion and ion migration dynamics could be examined at elevated temperatures, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Halide perovskites are promising semiconductor materials for solution-processed optoelectronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their strong ionic bonding nature results in highly dynamic crystal lattices, inherently allowing rapid ion exchange at the solidvapor and solidliquid interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the anion-exchange chemistry can be precisely controlled in single-crystalline halide perovskite nanomaterials when combined with nanofabrication techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate spatially resolved multicolor CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, or alloy of two halides) nanowire heterojunctions with a pixel size down to 500 nm with the photoluminescence tunable over the entire visible spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the heterojunctions show distinct electronic states across the interface, as revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These perovskite heterojunctions represent key building blocks for high-resolution multicolor displays beyond current state-of-the-art technology as well as high-density diode/transistor arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CsPbBr3 nanowires as well as some thin plates were grown using our previously reported solution-based method (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diameter of a typical nanowire is several hundreds of nanometers with a length of up to 30 micrometers (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the anion-exchange chemistry on the single-nanowire level, individual CsPbBr3 nanowires were picked using a micromanipulator and transferred to a clean SiO2/Si substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A droplet of reaction solution containing oleylammonium chloride in 1-octadecene was used to cover the nanowire on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was in situ examined under a microscope with a 325-nm laser excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S2, during the reaction period (12 h), the photoluminescence (PL) of the nanowire gradually blue-shifted, without the coexistence of both green and purpleblue emission, respectively, from pure CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, indicating the formation of homogeneous CsPbX3 alloys instead of any Br- or Cl-rich domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cesium lead halide perovskites, the reaction probably occurs via a vacancy-assisted diffusion mechanism (12), and the anion-exchange reaction zone width is probably close to the crystal size (27), which leads to alloy formation instead of a coreshell structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction dynamics are important for controlling the conversion degree and therefore the optical and electronic properties of the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mild reaction conditions we developed here are essential for maintaining the nanowire morphology and compatible with nanofabrication processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we studied the anion-exchange chemistry on the partially masked nanowires for creating spatially well-defined heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1A, after transferring the nanowire, a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-cast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A designated area of the PMMA was removed using e-beam lithography to expose part of the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the substrate was dipped into an oleylammonium halide (OAmX, X = Cl, I) solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the reaction, the PMMA layer remains intact as shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the anion-exchange reaction, the PMMA layer was completely removed by washing with chlorobenzene and hexanes, as shown in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details and a schematic illustration of the fabrication process can be found in SI Appendix, Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar chemistry is also applicable to the bromideiodide conversion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noted that the bromide part and the chloride part show a weak contrast difference even in the optical image (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL emission of the individual nanowires after reaction was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 DG shows the optical images and PL spectra of the BrCl and BrI partially exchanged nanowires, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both nanowires feature two-color emissions with a clear, sharp interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BrCl exchange sample, the blue part has an emission peak centered at 420 nm, suggesting a complete conversion from CsPbBr3 to CsPbCl3, whereas in the BrI exchange case, the red region shows an emission peak centered at 655 nm, corresponding to 80% BrI conversion (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there are no additional emission peaks between the two major peaks in the PL spectra, which means the interface of the junction is relatively sharp with no significant interdiffusion of the Br and Cl/I ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such high-quality junction is important for electronic device applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The elemental distribution and morphology of the nanowires after anion exchange was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, the SEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping on a heterojunction nanowire shows a clear interface between the bromide section (green) and chloride section (blue), whereas other elements such as lead (purple) and cesium (yellow) are uniformly distributed within the whole nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the weak chlorine signal in the bromide part is likely from lead, because the Pb M shell has a similar energy to that of the Cl K shell (see SI Appendix, Fig S4 for the EDS spectrum and more explanation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows the relative bromide and chloride concentration profiles along the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both elements are spatially confined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dramatic changes of Cl and Br concentrations at the interface region are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another SEM image (SI Appendix, Fig S5) shows that the nanowire morphology is well-preserved upon chemical conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CsPbBr3 part features a width of 741 nm while the width of the CsPbCl3 part shrinks to 714 nm; the 3.8% change in the nanowire width is consistent with the difference of the lattice constant between the bromide (orthorhombic: a = 8.207 Å, b = 8.255 Å, c = 11.759 Å, Z = 4, V/Z = 199.16) and chloride (tetragonal: a = b = 5.584 Å, c = 5.623 Å, Z = 1, V/Z = 175.33) room temperature phases (nanowire growth direction is [110], ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The local electronic structure of the junction was examined by scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the 3D AFM topographic image of a partially converted nanowire on SiO2/Si.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowire profile reveals heights of 523 and 504 nm for the CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 parts (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S6A), respectively, which again agrees well with the theoretically expected relative dimensional change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed gradual height transition occurring over 1 m is inherently linked to the release of lattice-mismatch-induced strain at the electronic junction (note: the height profile transition width is not necessarily equal to the junction width).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No grain boundaries or cracks in the crystal were observed in the AFM and SEM images, indicating that the nanowire remains single crystalline with the heterojunction being probably of epitaxial nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further study using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy is needed to elucidate the underlying atomic structure of the heterojunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon chemical conversion, the nanowire maintains its high structural quality and very low surface roughness (rmsless_than 5 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 C and D shows the nanowires 3D KPFM surface potential map and the corresponding 2D potential profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to the compositional variation within the nanowire, a sharp relative surface potential change of 190 meV is observed across the heterojunction interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed electronic characterization of various heterojunction nanowires consistently revealed higher surface potential values for the CsPbBr3 part relative to the CsPbCl3 part (SI Appendix, Fig S7), indicating a shallower Fermi level in CsPbBr3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to create interfaces of distinct compositional and electronic properties at high spatial control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The workfunction values of pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanowires were quantitatively determined by KPFM measurements (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 3E, we obtain workfunction values of 4.77 ± 0.03 eV for CsPbBr3 and 4.93 ± 0.03 eV for CsPbCl3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suggested band alignment at the heterojunction is illustrated in Fig 3F (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band structure can be further tuned by controlling the composition and doping, which opens up the possibility for electronic device applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrate multijunctions in a single nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3G shows the 3D KPFM surface potential map and corresponding 2D potential profile of a nanowire comprising four heterojunctions with each segment of 3 m (see SI Appendix, Fig S6B for topography).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the single heterojunction nanowire, the CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 regions feature distinct electronic characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sharp electronic interface of the heterojunctions allows us to reduce the feature size, and the robustness of the nanowire allows us to introduce additional fabrication steps to create multicolor heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the spatially resolved patterns, confocal PL mapping with high spatial resolution was used, and the results are summarized in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the BrCl exchanged nanowire, the confocal PL mapping results (Fig 4 AC) are similar to the PL image in Fig 1D, with a better-resolved interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S10, the length of the exposed area and the covered area prior conversion are 10.8 and 8.7 µm long, respectively, whereas after the conversion the lengths for the chloride and bromide regions changed to 10.8 and 8.6 µm (the dark region in between is around 100 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that the reaction is well defined at the exposed area with the PMMA coating effectively protecting the area underneath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral scan on a BrCl exchanged nanowire shows almost no PL emission from 450 to 480 nm and a sharp switching from blue to green emissions (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The junction width is smaller than 500 nm, which is consistent with the SEM EDS mapping as well as the distinct surface potential change in the KPFM measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then created multiple junctions with pixel size (open window of PMMA by e-beam) of 1 µm on a nanowire (Fig 4 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After conversion, the superlattice structure can be clearly resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a feature cannot be resolved very well via the PL imaging measurement (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further decrease the pixel size to less than 500 nm, and the features can still be resolved (Fig 4 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, attempts to further decrease the pixel size to 200 nm were not successful (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution is probably limited by the instrument (diffraction limit) or the interdiffusion of anions within such a small area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, based on the two-color heterostructure, another fabrication-conversion step was added: a redgreenblue three-color heterojunction was achieved, as shown in Fig 4J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the emission wavelength of the red and blue parts is tunable by varying the conversion degree, and the relative intensity of each color can be tuned by varying the pixel size of each segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such color-tunable perovskite heterostructures provide an ideal platform for full-color displays and solid-state lighting (3033).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral scan on the three-color nanowire shows two sharp junctions at the interfaces (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate high-resolution arbitrary patterns on CsPbBr3 perovskite plates using the spatial-controlled anion-exchange chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4 KM, strips, an arrow target, and a University of California, Berkeley, logo can be written on the CsPbBr3 plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nanowire heterojunctions show good stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being stored in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 wk, confocal PL mapping of the partial bromide partial chloride nanowire and the superlattice nanowire exhibited PL emissions and sharp junctions very similar to the initial states (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the anion interdiffusion occurs much more slowly across the heterojunction compared with the exchange reaction at the solidliquid interface of the exposed area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two possible reasons: First, at the exposed area, more vacancies may be introduced from the solidliquid interface due to the interaction between the perovskite solid and the precursor molecules and ions in the solution; furthermore, higher vacancy concentration in the exposed region leads to faster ion migration and exchange reaction (12, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the ion migration may have higher activation energy along the nanowire growth direction, and thus anion exchange/migration proceeds slightly slower along this direction (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our results suggest that the anion-exchange chemistry combined with nanofabrication is a powerful tool to create high-quality semiconductor heterojunctions and patterns at the nanometer scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid-state ion diffusion rate in halide perovskite is much slower than expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The halide perovskite nanowire heterojunction provides an ideal platform for fundamental studies and technological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, multicolor lasers or LEDs could be made using such localized heterojunctions; quantitative interdiffusion and ion migration dynamics could be examined at elevated temperatures, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With deeper understanding of these heterojunctions, halide perovskites may find practical applications in large-scale electronic circuit, information storage, and full color displays, in addition to the current interest in photovoltaic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional details regarding the materials and methods may be found in the SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anion_Exchange_of_CsPbBr3_Nanowires  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To convert the CsPbBr3 to CsPbCl3, 10 mg of oleylammonium chloride was dissolved in 10 mg of 1-Octadecene (ODE) to make the conversion solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual CsPbBr3 nanowires were transferred onto a clean Si/SiO2 substrate using a nanomanipulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip with nanowires was immersed into the conversion solution at room temperature for 16 h for complete conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the chip was taken out from the solution and washed with chlorobenzene twice and hexanes once to remove the extra salts left on the chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction dynamics can be tracked in situ by monitoring the PL emission of an individual nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To convert the CsPbBr3 to CsPbI3, 10 mg of oleylammonium iodide was dissolved in 10 mg of ODE to make the conversion solution and the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 4 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fabrication_of_the_Nanowire_Heterojunctions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To fabricate heterojunction devices, the as-grown nanowires were first transferred onto a 300-nm SiO2-coated Si substrate by a micromanipulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate was then spin-coated with PMMA, and baked at 130 °C for 6 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E-beam lithography (EBL) was performed in a Crestec CABL-9510CC High-Resolution Electron Beam Lithography System with acceleration voltage of 50 keV and beam current of 500 pA. After EBL, the substrate was dipped into developer (methyl isobutyl ketone:isopropyl alcohol = 1:3) for 60 s followed by washing in isopropyl alcohol for another 20 s. The developer and isopropyl alcohol were dried with molecular sieves (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the nanowires with partially coated PMMA were immersed into the conversion solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion reaction was carried out using the same recipe as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After conversion, the PMMA mask was removed by dipping the substrate into chlorobenzene and hexanes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note, although different ways of carrying out the anion-exchange reaction have been reported, none of them are applicable here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, more polar solvents such as toluene, chlorobenzene, or isopropanol can either dissolve the PMMA mask and/or damage the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with ODE, higher temperature will also damage the nanowire morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For vapor-phase conversion, heating at over 100 °C is necessary to evaporate the organic halide precursors, which may also damage the PMMA layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a nonpolar solvent, such as ODE, is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To dissolve the halide precursor in such nonpolar solvent, an ammonium cation with a long carbon chain is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AFM_and_Scanning_KPFM_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AFM and scanning KPFM measurements were performed on an AFM system (MFP-3D Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments) equipped with an acoustic isolation chamber (AEK 2002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were transferred from the preparation glovebox into the AFM chamber operated in nitrogen atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AFM/KPFM measurements were performed at room temperature using conductive platinum-coated silicon cantilevers (Olympus AC240TM-R3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KPFM measurements were performed in a two-pass mode: the first scan for topographical imaging in ac mode followed by the interleave mode, in which the conductive tip was lifted with constant separation relative to the specimen surface while acquiring the contact potential difference, VCPD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve the highest lateral resolution, the influence of the lift height on the measured surface potential was carefully checked by surface potential vs. z spectroscopy, whereas only a minor influence of the lift height on the measured CPD signals was observed in the delta lift height region of 1030 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, for all surface potential measurements the delta lift height was set to result in a tip apexsurface distance of 20 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ac bias of 3 V amplitude at the first contact resonance frequency and a dc bias of 1 V was applied to the conductive probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were performed at low scan rate of 0.2 Hz at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambient light is minimized by the AFM isolation chamber, whereas a low-intensity 5-mW IR diode (860 nm) is used to detect probe deflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Confocal_PL_Mapping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confocal PL mapping was performed using an Olympus IX83 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40× 0.95 N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective and a 405-nm laser excitation source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All images were 512 × 512 pixels collected at 10 ms per line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 emission were collected over a spectra range of 410450, 500550, and 580640 nm, respectively, using an emission grating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multichannel images were collected in series or simultaneously using either a 473- or 560-nm dichroic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lambda scans were performed by collecting a series of images while scanning the emission grating in 10-nm spectral windows to vary the collected wavelength range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
