Dynamics of SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells during chronic SIV infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific follicular CD8 T cells represent a unique subset of antiviral CD8 T cells that rapidly expand during pathogenic SIV infection, localize within B-cell follicles, and contribute to control of chronic SIV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential for these cells to infiltrate sites of ongoing viral replication and viral persistence and the ability to induce these cells by vaccination provide a tremendous opportunity to develop and optimize therapeutic strategies to target and reduce the HIV reservoirs in lymphoid tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant challenge to HIV eradication is the elimination of viral reservoirs in germinal center (GC) T follicular helper (Tfh) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, GCs are considered to be immune privileged for antiviral CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show a population of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific CD8 T cells express CXCR5 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5, a chemokine receptor required for homing to GCs) and expand in lymph nodes (LNs) following pathogenic SIV infection in a cohort of vaccinated macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expansion was greater in animals that exhibited superior control of SIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CXCR5+ SIV-specific CD8 T cells demonstrated enhanced polyfunctionality, restricted expansion of antigen-pulsed Tfh cells in vitro, and possessed a unique gene expression pattern related to Tfh and Th2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in CXCR5+ CD8 T cells was associated with the presence of higher frequencies of SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following TCR-driven stimulation in vitro, CXCR5+ but not CXCR5 CD8 T cells generated both CXCR5+ as well as CXCR5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the addition of TGF- to CXCR5 CD8 T cells induced a population of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, suggesting that this cytokine may be important in modulating these CXCR5+ CD8 T cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells represent a unique subset of antiviral CD8 T cells that expand in LNs during chronic SIV infection and may play a significant role in the control of pathogenic SIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Overview  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite comprehensive analyses on the role of CXCR5 on CD4 T cells during chronic SIV/HIV infection (14, 15, 2426), much less is known about the role of CXCR5 on CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, previous studies have not characterized antigen-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells and their role in HIV/SIV pathogenesis and viral control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore studied the CXCR5 expression on SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the LNs during chronic SIVmac251 infection in a group of 20 DNA/MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara)-vaccinated SIV-infected RMs with a spectrum of viral control (Fig 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered animals with set point (week 24) VL at or below 104 copies per mL of plasma as low-VL animals, as described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 12 animals with low VL and 8 animals with high VL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was a retrospective study, and thus, we used samples from LNs and blood where available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SIV-Specific_CXCR5+_CD8_T_Cells_Expand_in_LNs_Following_Pathogenic_SIV_Infection_and_at_Higher_Levels_in_Animals_That_Exhibited_Superior_Viral_Control  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the contribution of SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells to viral control during chronic SIV infection, we determined the magnitude of Gag CM9 tetramer+ CD8 T cells (Tet+) and their coexpression of CXCR5 in the LNs during the acute (week 2) and chronic (week 24) phases of SIV infection in a group of Mamu A*01+-vaccinated RMs that exhibited a varying degree of viral control (Fig 1 and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the acute phase, the CXCR5+ Tet+ cells were readily detectable in the LNs; however, the magnitude of these cells was quite variable and ranged from 0.01% (limit of detection) to 6% (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time, the magnitude of CXCR5+ Tet+ cells (geometric mean of 0.32%) was about 14 times lower compared with CXCR5 Tet+ CD8 T cells (geometric mean of 4.4%) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the chronic phase, the magnitude of CXCR5 Tet+ cells decreased by 2.5-fold (geometric mean of 1.7%) compared with acute phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed a twofold increase in the magnitude of CXCR5+ Tet+ cells (geometric mean of 0.75%) that was associated with a fourfold increase in the proportion of Tet+ cells expressing CXCR5 during the chronic phase (24%) compared with the acute phase (6%) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to LNs, about 5% of the Tet+ cells in the blood expressed CXCR5 during the acute phase, and this expression increased to 10% during the chronic phase (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed a direct correlation between the magnitude of CXCR5+ Tet+ cells in the LNs and the proportion of Tet+ cells expressing CXCR5 in the blood during chronic phase (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrated that the SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells expand in LNs and blood following pathogenic SIV infection in vaccinated macaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the relationship between the magnitude of total, CXCR5+, and CXCR5 Tet+ cells in the LNs and plasma viremia during the chronic phase (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impressively, the frequency of CXCR5+ Tet+ CD8 T cells in the LNs showed a strong inverse association with plasma viremia, and this association was not evident with CXCR5 Tet+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of total Tet+ cells also showed an inverse association with plasma viremia; however, this association was much weaker than the association observed with CXCR5+ Tet+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association between CXCR5+ CD8 T cells and viral control was not influenced by a specific vaccine group (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a limited number of animals, we also observed a strong inverse association between the magnitude of CXCR5+ Tet+ CD8 T cells and multiply spliced SIV TatRev RNA levels in GCTfh in LNs (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar inverse association was also observed with cell-associated viral DNA within the Tfh subset (P = 0.003, r = 0.85; Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a similar association with total Tet+ CD8 T cells but did not with CXCR5 Tet+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrated that the magnitude of CXCR5+ Tet+ CD8 T cells within the LNs potentially contribute to both control of plasma viremia and viral replication within the GCTfh during pathogenic SIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data highlight an important role for a SIV-specific CXCR5+ follicular CD8 T-cell subset in control of viral replication during chronic SIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SIV-Specific_CD8_T_Cells_Localize_to_GCs_in_SIV-Infected_Low-VL_RMs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the presence and distribution of Tet+ CD8 T cells in the B-cell follicles and extrafollicular regions of LNs, spleen, and rectum of vaccinated and SIV-infected RM with low VL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out in situ Gag CM9 tetramer staining using samples obtained from four vaccinated animals with low VL using antibodies to CD3 and CD20 (the marker used to delineate GC when identifying Tet+ CD8 T cells in situ) (1618) and Gag CM9 Tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the presence of CD3+ Tet+ cells within both the extrafollicular as well as intrafollicular regions of the sampled lymphoid tissue (Fig 2A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of Tet+ cells in the follicular and extrafollicular regions was either comparable or marginally higher in the latter region (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a strong correlation between the frequency of CXCR5+ Tet+ CD8 T cells in the LNs defined by flow cytometry and the density of Tet+ CD8 T cells in GCs determined by in situ tetramer analysis (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, we could not perform the in situ tetramer analysis on samples obtained from high-VL RMs due to the lack of fresh tissue, which is a requirement for this assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a previous study had demonstrated a relatively lower ratio of Tet+ cells in the follicular region compared with extrafollicular region in RMs with high VL (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using frozen sections, we performed in situ immunofluorescence staining on LN sections of three low-VL and three high-VL RMs to study the localization of total CD8 T cells and found the presence of CD8 T cells in the follicles primarily in the low-VL RMs but not high-VL RMs (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the GC resident CD8 T cells are positive for CXCR5, we stained sections for CD8, CXCR5, and IgD and found that some of the CD8 T cells localized in GC are positive for CXCR5 (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that antiviral CXCR5+ CD8 T cells in vaccinated RMs with low VL localize to GC regions of lymphoid follicles and this may provide them with an immunological advantage to target and eliminate virus-infected Tfh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SIV-Specific_CXCR5+_CD8_T_Cells_Express_Cytolytic_Molecules_and_Limit_Expansion_of_SIV_Antigen-Pulsed_Tfh_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the functional quality of CXCR5+ and CXCR5 SIV-specific CD8 T cells, we characterized their ability to coproduce cytokines IFN, TNF-, and IL-2 in response to stimulation with SIV Gag CM9 peptide (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of CD8 T cells coproducing all three cytokines (TP) was greater (P = 0.01) in the CXCR5+ subset compared with the CXCR5 subset (Fig 3A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these TPs also showed degranulation as evidenced by CD107a expression on the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated that CXCR5+ cells retain a polyfunctional advantage to CXCR5 CD8 T cells for triple cytokine production, a measure that has been shown to be associated with enhanced control of human chronic viral infections (6, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next characterized the expression of molecules associated with cytolytic function in CXCR5+ and CXCR5 SIV-specific CD8 T cells from the LNs post-SIV infection (Fig 3B and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses revealed that a significant fraction of CXCR5+ Tet+ cells express cytolytic molecules granzyme B and perforin; however, granzyme B was marginally lower in CXCR5+ cells compared with CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may have the potential to eliminate SIV-infected GCTfh cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we sorted Tfh cells from the LNs of six Mamu A*01+ SIV-infected low-VL RMs and stimulated them with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 5 d in the absence and presence of sorted autologous CXCR5+ or CXCR5 CD8 T cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cells were additionally pulsed with P11C peptide so they could serve as ideal target cells for the responding CXCR5+ and CXCR5 Tet+ cells present in the coculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of 5 d, we determined the number of Tfh cells that remained after stimulation with or without CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 3C, the number of Tfh cells increased significantly following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in the absence of CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inclusion of either CXCR5+ or CXCR5 CD8 T cells in the culture reduced the number of Tfh cells significantly in five out of six animals, demonstrating that both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 cells are capable of limiting the expansion of SIV antigen-pulsed Tfh in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease was not evident when we used unpulsed Tfhs as target cells in four out of five animals tested (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for one animal (#1), we observed a decrease in the number of both pulsed Tfhs and unpulsed Tfhs, but the decrease was much greater for pulsed Tfhs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not unexpected to see this decrease in expansion of unpulsed Tfhs in the presence of CD8 T cells, as we are using Tfhs from SIV-infected animals and it is likely that a fraction of these Tfhs are infected with SIV and thus can serve as targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the mechanism involved in limiting the expansion of TCR-stimulated Tfh cells, we studied the expression of the cytolytic molecules granzyme B and perforin on responding SIV-specific CD8 T cells and observed a significant increase in the expression of these effector molecules on both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells (Fig 3D and Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in coexpression of granzyme B and perforin was higher in the presence of peptide-pulsed target Tfh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to further investigate the mechanism behind the diminished TCR-driven expansion of Tfh cells in vitro, we assessed the transfer of granzyme B to the target Tfh cells when cocultured with the CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T-cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a higher frequency of granzyme B+ Tfhs when CXCR5+ or CXCR5 CD8 T cells were included in the culture (Fig S3C and Fig S4E), suggesting the cytolytic function of CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells in the culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively these results demonstrate that both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells can limit the expansion of antigen-pulsed Tfhs in vitro potentially through cytolytic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to note that, in vivo, only CXCR5+ CD8 T cells but not CXCR5 CD8 T cells will likely gain access to the Tfh population due to the expression of CXCR5 and that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells are more polyfunctional than CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SIV-Specific_CXCR5+_CD8_T_Cells_Share_Features_of_Tfh_and_Th2_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate the differences in cellular processes and functional states between the CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T-cell subsets during chronic SIV/HIV infection, we performed global gene expression microarray analysis on sorted SIV-specific CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells from SIV-infected RMs with low VL (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis, we sorted cells from either SIVmac251-infected or SIVE660-infected animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells revealed a distinct gene expression pattern compared with CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the CXCR5 CD8 T cells, the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells showed higher signal intensities of genes associated with Tfh CD4 T cells, such as the master transcription factor Bcl-6, NFATC1, NFATC2, CD200, and CTLA-4, as well as markers associated with Th2 CD4 T cells, such as IL-4R (CD124), CCR4, STAT6, and IL-10 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal intensities for effector molecules typically observed in cytotoxic CD8 T cells such as granzyme A, B, and K were lower on SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells compared with their CXCR5 counterparts, confirming our ex vivo phenotypic analysis of these effector molecules on the subsets (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is not surprising that CXCR5+ SIV-specific CD8 T cells express lower levels of cytolytic molecules ex vivo, as these cells retain a unique profile similar to Tfh cells and data have shown that overexpression of Bcl-6 in CD8 T cells results in reduced granzyme B expression (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to note that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells rapidly up-regulate expression of some of these genes following stimulation (Fig 3D); thus, the activation state and exposure to antigen may strongly influence the effector state of CXCR5+ SIV-specific CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies need to be conducted to understand what drives these differential phenotypes in these antiviral CXCR5+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CXCR5+ CD8 T cells also showed higher signal intensities for molecules associated with costimulation/antigen presentation such as CD40, CD83, 41BBL, and MAMU-DRA (Fig 4A) and inhibitory receptors CD200 and SPRY2 but lower intensities for inhibitory receptors CD160 and CD244 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional consequence of the expression of these molecules is yet to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells showed higher signal intensities for the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 and lower intensity for the proapoptotic genes annexin1 and -2, suggestive of their better survival potential during chronic SIV infection compared with CXCR5 CD8 T cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expression of transcriptional regulators such as TCF4, TCF24, SOX4, CULT1, MEF2C, and CDCA7 was also higher in CXCR5+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression of ID2, the transcription factor associated with terminal effectors (31), was lower in CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, suggesting that the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells have transcriptional signatures associated with memory precursor cells that survive and give rise to the pool of long-lived memory CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells showed higher expression of chemokines such as CCL5 and CXCL10 and cytokines IL-2 and CSF-1 compared with CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed the expression of some of these genes on a protein level using flow cytometry (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the level of PD-1 expression and, consistent with the LCMV model, found that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells express marginally higher levels of PD-1 compared with CXCR5 CD8 T cells (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results demonstrate that SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells possess a unique gene expression pattern that is distinct compared with SIV-specific CXCR5 CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induction_of_CXCR5+_CD8_T_Cells_Can_Be_Enhanced_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to understand the modulation of CXCR5 expression following TCR-driven CD8 T-cell proliferation, we sorted CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells from the LNs of chronically infected RMs and stimulated them in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 (Fig 5A and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells proliferated equally, but interestingly the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells differentiated into both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T-cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CXCR5 CD8 T cells largely remained CXCR5 (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was also true for Gag CM9 Tet+ CD8 T cells in the culture (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may potentially gain access to the GC through increased expression of the follicular homing receptor CXCR5 and, then once activated and in response to antigen, can differentiate into a population of CXCR5 CD8 T cells retaining an effector CD8 T-cell profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One question that remains is what signals may drive the induction or expression of CXCR5 on these SIV-specific CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study found that TGF- was critical in providing the initial signals required for Tfh differentiation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we cultured anti-CD3/CD28stimulated PBMCs in vitro in the presence of TGF- and found that TGF- can also significantly increase the expression of CXCR5 on proliferating RM CD8 T cells (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF- in combination with IL-12 and IL-23 induced higher CXCR5 expression compared with cells stimulated with IL-12 and IL-23 alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar analysis on sorted CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells confirmed that TGF- could enhance CXCR5 expression on CXCR5 CD8 T cells as well (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we focused on investigating the dynamics of follicular homing antiviral CD8 T cells during chronic SIV infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated RMs that showed a varying degree of SIV control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings revealed the rapid expansion of a subset of highly functional antiviral CXCR5+ follicular CD8 T cells with potential to migrate to B-cell follicles/GCs in the LNs and possess a unique phenotype in RMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the expansion of SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells in the blood and LNs was associated with vaccine-mediated control of pathogenic SIV infection, suggesting that it is important to generate these cells by vaccination to enhance control of chronic immunodeficiency virus infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we focused our analyses on SIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses in Mamu A*01 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to use Mamu A*01 animals because CXCR5 expression is down-regulated following peptide stimulation (Fig S1E), and the use of Mamu A*01 animals allowed us to use the immunodominant Gag CM9 tetramer to measure the majority of SIV-specific CD8 T cell response without stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we note that even in unvaccinated SIV-infected animals with varying degrees of viral control, higher CXCR5 expression on Gag CM9 Tet+ CD8 T cells in blood is associated with improved viral control during the chronic phase, highlighting their contribution to enhanced viral control (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results showed that SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells can restrict expansion of SIV antigen-pulsed Tfhs from SIV-infected macaques in vitro, supporting the potential for these cells to limit Tfh expansion in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms by which these cells are able to restrict Tfh expansion require further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, several lines of evidence suggested that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may potentially limit the expansion of antigen-pulsed Tfh through perforin- and granzyme B-dependent mechanisms, as these cells strongly up-regulated these molecules in culture and transferred granzyme B to Tfh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our attempts to perform a CD8 T-cell-killing assay ex vivo were not successful, as this assay requires a large number of sorted SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is interesting to note that SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells express transcripts/proteins associated with Tfh and Th2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that cytokines and signals that shape a T-helper differentiation program may also help differentiation of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did find that TGF-, which has been shown to promote Tfh differentiation in human cells, also enhanced CXCR5 expression on CD8 T cells (discussed further below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting finding was that the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells gave rise to both CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells when stimulated through TCR, supporting their self-renewal and stem cell-like properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also suggest a supporting role that CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may potentially play in regulating an extrafollicular effector CXCR5 CD8 T-cell response during chronic HIV/SIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is very important to understand the mechanisms underlying the induction of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells by vaccination and during infection to develop immune-based strategies that can substantially reduce the HIV reservoir and generate effective control of viral replication in the absence of ART.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro studies showed that TGF- may play a significant role in inducing these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies showed that TGF- levels increase significantly following SIV (33) and HIV infections (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, pathogenic SIV infection in rhesus macaques is characterized by activation of the smad7 pathway, an inhibitor of the TGF-1 signaling cascade, whereas nonpathogenic SIV infection in African green monkeys is characterized by prolonged smad4 signaling, a mediator that enhances TGF-1 signaling, and an absence of smad7 signaling (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that immunoregulatory mechanisms that occur very early during acute infection may potentially influence the phenotypic outcome of antiviral CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation into early immune signatures will help to address what mechanisms influence the in vivo generation of these CXCR5+ antiviral CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in vitro studies suggest that the TGF- pathway could be modulated in vivo to augment induction of antigen-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recently described follicular CXCR5+ CD8 T cells from chronic LCMV and HIV infections (21, 22) have been shown to express transcription factor BCL-6 similar to what we observed in our SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, and selectively entered into B-cell follicles eradicating both infected Tfh and B cells (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCMV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells described by Im et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (23) express TCF-1 and act as stem cells during LCMV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these cells reside in the T-cell zones and not in follicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation into early immune signatures will help to address what mechanisms influence the in vivo generation of these CXCR5+ antiviral CD8 T cells, but our data in combination with these recently published studies highlight the importance of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells and underscore the need to develop immune-based strategies capable of generating these cells in vivo as a means of targeting and eliminating HIV-infected CD4 T cells that contribute to ongoing viral production and persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our results show a population of SIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells induced early after infection with potential to migrate to the GC within lymphoid sites and contribute to control of pathogenic SIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential for these cells to infiltrate sites of ongoing viral replication and viral persistence and the ability to induce these cells by vaccination provide a tremendous opportunity to develop and optimize therapeutic strategies that can successfully target and reduce the viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings have important implications for functional cure efforts for HIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Young adult (1.54.5 y) male Indian rhesus macaques (Macca mulatta) from the Yerkes breeding colony were cared for under the guidelines established by the Animal Welfare Act and the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (35) using protocols approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All RMs sampled were unvaccinated or vaccinated with DNA/MVA SIV vaccine (DM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccination consisted of two DNA primes on weeks 0 and 8 and two MVA boosts on weeks 16 and 24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both DNA and MVA immunogens expressed SIV239 Gag, Pol, and Env, as described previously (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccinated animals either received unadjuvanted DNA/MVA vaccine (36), CD40L adjuvanted DNA/MVA vaccine (described previously in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), or unadjuvanted DNA/MVA vaccine with rapamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapamycin was administered intramuscularly from day 3 to day 28 during each of the DNA and MVA immunizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose of Rapamycin on day 0 of each cycle was 50 g/kg and was adjusted to reach a serum concentration of 515 ng/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in the use at a dose between 10 and 50 g/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were challenged intrarectally weekly with SIVmac251 starting 2124 wk after the final MVA immunization with a dose of 647 TCID50 (1.25 × 107 copies of viral RNA) until they were infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were infected by seven challenges under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N.

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (version 5.0d; GraphPad Software Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance (P values) was obtained using nonparametric MannWhitney test (for comparisons between groups/subsets), nonparametric paired t test (for comparisons between subsets within the same animal), or Spearman rank test (for correlations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses of cytokine coexpression profiles were performed by partial permutation tests using SPICE software (NIAID, NIH) as previously described (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For microarray analysis, background adjustment, normalization, and median polish summarization of CEL files were performed with the robust multichip average (RMA) algorithm using the affy Bioconductor package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of hybridized chips was assessed after normalization by examining their NUSE and RLE plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream analyses were performed using Partek Genomics Suite software version 6.5 (Partek Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values for the contrasts between CXCR5+ and CXCR5 CD8 T cells in the low-VL RMs were determined by paired t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be consistent, we used robust nonparametric tests that do not depend on assumptions of data distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-sided P value with less than 0.05 was considered as significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were not corrected for multiple comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SIV_Tat_Rev_Multiply-Spliced_RNA_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SIV Tat/Rev msRNA were quantified using an ultrasensitive nested RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was extracted using the allprep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen) including on-column DNase I treatment, and RNA quantity was measured using Nanodrop analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA samples (7.598 µg) were reverse transcribed and preamplified using the SuperScript III Platinum One-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were performed in a volume of 10 µL with 250 nM of each primer (Tat-Fwd1 and Rev-Rev1) using the following thermal profile: 50 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 2 min followed by 18 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 4 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR products were diluted 1:5 in water, and 2 µL of the dilution was used as template for the Tat/Rev seminested quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions performed in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Final reactions were performed in 20 µL and contained 1× TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems), 500 nM of each primer (Tat-Fwd2 and Rev-Rev1), and 150 nM of the SIV probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The real-time PCR was carried out in Applied Biosystems 7500 using the following cycling conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 s. Serial dilutions of a Tat/Rev plasmid were used for the quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were normalized to CD4 RNA expression measured by qRT-PCR (adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptIII first stand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and random hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed in duplicate in 30 µL, containing 1× TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems), 200 nM of each CD4-Fwd and CD4-Rev primers, and 150 nM of the CD4 probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The real-time PCR was carried out in Applied Biosystems 7500 following the cycling conditions described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences for PCR were as follows: SIV-Tat-Fwd1, 5-TGA GCA ATC ACG AAA GAG AAG AAG AAC TC-3; SIV-Tat-Fwd2, 5-GCT AAG GCT AAT ACA TCT TCT GCA TCA AAC-3; Rev-Rev1, 5-TCC ACC GTC TCT TTC TTT GCC-3; SIVprobe, 5-FAM-CTC TGG TTG GCA GTG CCG GGT C-3IABkFQ-3; CD4-Fwd, 5-ACA TCG TGG TGC TAG CTT TCC AGA-3; CD4probe, 5-FAM-AGG CCT CCA GCA CAG TCT ATA AGA AAG AGG-TAMRA-3; and CD4-Rev, 5-AAG TGT AAA GGC GAG TGG GAA GGA-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microarray_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Briefly, sorted cells from lymph nodes were lysed in 350 L of Qiagen RLT buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA extraction was then performed using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers specifications with on-column DNase I digestion to remove Genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA integrity was assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) capillary electrophoresis on a RNA Pico chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples had an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) score of 8.5 or higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each individual sample, cDNA synthesis and amplification was performed using the NuGEN Ovation Pico WTA V2 system (NuGEN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 500 pg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis followed by whole transcriptome amplification by NuGENs Ribo-SPIA technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ribo-SPIA technology uses DNA/RNA chimeric primers to amplify cDNA isothermally maintaining the stoichiometry of the input RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplified single-stranded DNA was purified using AMpure XP beads (Beckman).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on the Bioanalyzer and NanoDrop, respectively, to assess the size distribution of the amplified DNA and quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 4.5 µg of the amplified DNA for biotinylation and fragmentation using the NuGEN Ovation Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Rhesus Macaque Genome Arrays (Affymetrix), which contains over 52,000 individual probe sets that assay over 47,000 transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe arrays were washed, stained, and scanned as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (media.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CEL files were extracted from the raw scanned images using the Affymetrix GeneChip command console software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quality control metrics were monitored on the Affymetrix Expression console software; discordant arrays were excluded from further downstream analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
