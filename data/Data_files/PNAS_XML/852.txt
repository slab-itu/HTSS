Influenza infection triggers disease in a genetic model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral infections exacerbate symptoms of many neurological diseases, including the most common autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), multiple sclerosis (MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that influenza viral infection of autoimmune-prone mice triggers clinical and histological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that influenza infection alters the transcriptome of the central nervous system and facilitates immune cell trafficking to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we identified a specific chemokine that is upregulated in the CNS during infection that is also increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients during relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations improve our understanding of how peripheral infection may act to exacerbate neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most MS patients experience periods of symptom exacerbation (relapses) followed by periods of partial recovery (remission).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, upper-respiratory viral infections increase the risk for relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used an autoimmune-prone T-cell receptor transgenic mouse (2D2) and a mouse-adapted human influenza virus to test the hypothesis that upper-respiratory viral infection can cause glial activation, promote immune cell trafficking to the CNS, and trigger disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we inoculated 2D2 mice with influenza A virus (Puerto Rico/8/34; PR8) and then monitored them for symptoms of inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical and histological experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was observed in 29% of infected 2D2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further understand how peripheral infection could contribute to disease onset, we inoculated wild-type C57BL/6 mice and measured transcriptomic alterations occurring in the cerebellum and spinal cord and monitored immune cell surveillance of the CNS by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection caused temporal alterations in the transcriptome of both the cerebellum and spinal cord that was consistent with glial activation and increased T-cell, monocyte, and neutrophil trafficking to the brain at day 8 post infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Cxcl5 expression was up-regulated in the brains of influenza-infected mice and was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients during relapse compared with specimens acquired during remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data identify a mechanism by which peripheral infection may exacerbate MS as well as other neurological diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Influenza_A_Infection_Causes_EAE_Onset_in_2D2_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenic 2D2 mice possess an inherent reduction in CD8+ T-cells that might impede virus-specific immune responses (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, following intranasal inoculation with a normally nonlethal dose of influenza [1.0 hemagglutinating unit (HAU)], 2D2 mice lost more weight, and a higher percentage succumbed to infection compared with controls (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 2D2 mice that were inoculated with a lower viral titer (0.7 HAU) had substantially reduced mortality rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 29% of virus-inoculated 2D2 mice developed clinical signs of EAE within 2 wk of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neither saline-inoculated C57BL/6 nor 2D2 mice developed signs of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This incidence is similar to the effect of upper-respiratory infection on relapse in MS and is significantly higher than would be anticipated to occur in this strain (2 = 37.565; P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, viral M1 was not detectible in the olfactory bulbs, cerebellum, or spinal cords of infected 2D2 mice at day 8 post infection (p.i.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal disease severity of influenza-induced EAE ranged from tail weakness to unilateral paralysis (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathological analysis confirmed the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the spinal cord and cerebellum of influenza-infected 2D2 mice (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe demyelination in control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if influenza inoculation caused autoreactive T-cell trafficking to the CNS, we measured the percentages of CD45+V3.2+ isolated from influenza-inoculated 2D2 mice, of which 3/5 had mild signs of EAE (tail paresis with wobble; score of 1), and control 2D2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenza increased percentages of both CD45+V3.2+ autoreactive T-cells and CD45hiV3.2 cells in the brains of infected mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that upper-respiratory infection is capable of triggering moderate signs of EAE in T-cell receptor transgenic 2D2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Infection_Causes_Alterations_to_the_Cerebellar_and_Spinal_Cord_Transcriptome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain further insight into how peripheral infection may cause EAE and might act to exacerbate other neurological diseases, we examined transcriptomic changes to the cerebellar and spinal cord tissues isolated from C57BL/6 mice at days 0, 4, and 8 following intranasal inoculation with virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Influenza-inoculated mice displayed a time-dependent reduction in both body weight and body-conditioning scores (Fig 2 A and B) compared with saline-inoculated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As occurred in 2D2 inoculated mice, viral M1 transcript was not detectable in cerebellar or spinal cord tissues, but was abundantly present in the lungs of infected animals (Fig 2C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we did not detect viral RNA in olfactory bulbs (Fig 2C, Right), again confirming that this dose of virus does not infect the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated changes in gene expression in both tissues due to infection (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although principal component analysis showed that the cerebellum and spinal cord are distinct at the transcriptome level, both tissues demonstrated time-dependent alterations of the transcriptome (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After assigning a 1.5-fold change in expression and a false discovery rate (FDR) of less_than0.05 as a cutoff criteria, 21 annotated, differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in the cerebellum and 18 DEGs in the spinal cord at day 4 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compared with day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 8 p.i., there were 242 and 230 DEGs in the cerebellum and spinal cord, respectively (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top 30 DEGs in the cerebellum and spinal cord at days 4 (Fig 2 G and H) and 8 (Fig 2 I and J) are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Infection_Up-Regulates_Genes_Associated_with_Glial_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral injection of poly(I:C) or LPS up-regulates the expression of genes associated with the complement cascade in the CNS (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, peripheral LPS injection is sufficient to induce an A1 reactive astrocyte phenotype that is dependent on microglial cell activation and C1qa, IL-1, and TNF production (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we questioned if upper-respiratory viral infection was capable of altering genes associated with astrocyte activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both C1qa and C1qb genes were increased in the cerebellum at day 4 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spinal cord, C1qa, C1qb, and Il1a were elevated but not significantly different from controls (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Lta (which also signals to TNFR1) was up-regulated in the spinal cord at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tnf was not detectable in either the brain or the spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, most genes that were recently identified as predictors of an A1-reactive astrocyte phenotype were elevated in both cerebellar (9/12; Fig 3B) and spinal cord tissues (11/11; Fig 3C) at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, fewer genes associated with an A2-reactive astrocyte profile were increased in cerebellar (3/9) and spinal cord tissue (3/10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that, similar to peripheral LPS injection, upper-respiratory infection promotes an A1 astrocyte phenotype in both brain and spinal cord (Fig 3) and provides strong evidence that is suggestive of reactive gliosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Up-Regulated_Genes_Are_Associated_with_IFN_and_MAPK_Signaling_During_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next conducted bioinformatics analysis on genes that exhibited at least a 1.5-fold increase and an FDR of less_than0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few genes met this criteria for up-regulation at day 4 p.i., but gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 18 up-regulated genes in the cerebellum identified terms associated with antiviral immunity as enriched (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No gene ontology terms were enriched in the spinal cord, although cellular response to interferon-beta signaling and positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene regulatory network analysis indicated that 72% of up-regulated genes in the cerebellum were targets of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7; Fig S3 B and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical analysis of up-regulated genes in the spinal cord genes identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 as a regulator of expression (Fig S3 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the most enriched transcription factor-binding motif from genes in both tissues was identical (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because IRF7 and STAT1 are activated in response to IFN receptor signaling, we questioned which of the observed up-regulated genes in the CNS are targets of IFN signaling using the database Interferome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All up-regulated genes in the cerebellum (18/18) and 85.7% (12/14) of genes in the spinal cord are known to be induced by IFN signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cerebellum, 36.8% (7/19) were identified as activated by type I interferons, whereas the remaining 63.15% were identified as products of either type I or type II IFN signaling (Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spinal cord, 66.6% of IFN-inducible genes were suspected products of type I interferons, whereas the remaining 33.3% were shown to be induced by both type I and type II IFN receptor ligation (Fig S3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the genes have been shown to be induced by type III interferons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I IFN receptors are ubiquitously expressed, and Ifnar1, Ifnar2, Ifngr1, Ifngr2, and Ifnlr1 transcripts were detectible in cerebellar and spinal cord tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not detect expression of Ifna, Ifnb1, Il28a, Il28b, or Il29 transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data show that the most prominent up-regulated genes in the CNS during influenza infection are controlled by IFN signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At day 8 p.i., gene ontology analysis of up-regulated genes in the cerebellum identified terms associated with immune system responses as enriched, although no terms reached statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spinal cord, the term immune system process was significantly enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After relaxing the criteria for up-regulation to include genes that exhibited a 1.4-fold increase and an FDR less_than0.05, the gene ontology terms relating to immune responses became significantly enriched in both CNS tissues (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the examination of coexpressed up-regulated genes in these tissues that comprised the GO term immune system response as stipulated by our original criteria implicated IFN- signaling in controlling the expression of these inflammatory genes (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as on day 4 p.i., IFN transcripts were undetectable within cerebellar or spinal cord tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that signaling within the CNS may arise from a peripheral, potentially humoral source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influenza_Infection_Causes_Immune_Cell_Surveillance_of_the_CNS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next analyzed serum cytokines in saline- and influenza-inoculated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection increased circulating levels of IL-6 (day 4 p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and IFN- (day 8 p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  but had no effect on IL-1, TNF, IL-17A, and IL-10 levels (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because IFN- signaling to the choroid plexus can promote T-cell surveillance of the CNS (9) and choroid plexus epithelial cells are accessible to blood cytokines, we conducted studies to determine if peripheral infection caused an influx of T-cells into the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection temporally increased the percentage and number of CD3+ T-cells, but not CD19+ B-cells, at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the brain (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental replication confirmed an increased percentage of CD3+CD4+ helper T-cells (Fig 4C) in the brains of influenza- vs. saline-inoculated mice at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if CD4+ T cells localized to the choroid plexus, we isolated the choroid plexus of saline- and virus-inoculated mice at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and then examined whole mounts by immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choroid plexus of influenza-infected mice contained more CD4+ cells than saline-inoculated mice (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several chemokines were up-regulated in the brain and spinal cords of influenza- vs. saline-inoculated controls (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, influenza-inoculated mice had increased Ccl17, Ccl25, and Ccl28, but decreased Ccl27a and Cx3cl1 expression in the cerebellum and spinal cords at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, peripheral infection up-regulated Ccl6 and Cxcl5 in the cerebellum, but not the spinal cord, at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both CCL17 and CCL28 are attractants for macrophages, dendritic cells, and Th2 cells, whereas CXCL5 is a monocyte and neutrophil chemoattractant and has been identified as a putative serum biomarker of MS relapse (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we questioned whether peripheral infection caused immune surveillance of the brain by innate immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection did not alter the percentages of immune cells in the brain at either day 2 or 4 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at day 8 p.i., we observed an increase in the percentage of lymphocytes (CD45hiCD11b) and monocytes/neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+) in the brains of infected mice (Fig 5 E and F and Fig S6 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis indicated that the increase in myeloid lineage cells likely included a mixture of both inflammatory monocytes (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6Chi) and neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+Gr-1+Ly6CintMHCIICD19) (Fig S6 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the percentages of microglia (CD45intCD11b+) and dendritic cells (CD11b+CD11c+) did not differ between saline- and influenza-inoculated mice (Fig S6B and Fig 5 BH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, percentages of lymphocytes in the blood and the brain differed substantially (Fig 5M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these ratios differed among infected mice as well, indicating that residual cells from contaminating blood were not likely the source of immune cells isolated from the brain (Fig S7 for gating strategy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these data indicate that influenza infection causes an increase in immune cell surveillance of the brain and may implicate the choroid plexus as a potential entry site, although the data do not rule out extravasation across cerebrovascular endothelium or leptomeninges as additional and/or alternative routes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influenza_Infection_Modulates_the_Percentage_of_MHC_Class_II+_B_Cells_in_the_CNS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T-cell reactivation in the CNS is partially attributed to B-cells (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next questioned if influenza infection altered the expression of MHC class II on B-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously, we found that B-cells were the major MHC class II-expressing cell in the naive mouse brain (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that the expression of MHC class II on B-cells was higher on cells from infected mice at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compared with controls (Fig S8 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously described (31), two populations of B-cells were present in the naive brain that were distinguishable when gating on CD45 and CD19 (Fig S5C and Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection did not alter the percentages or numbers of total CD45+CD19+ cells in the brain (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the percentage of CD45intCD19int B-cells decreased at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the percentage of CD45hiCD19hi B-cells increased as a result of infection (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CD45hiCD19hi comprise the predominant MHC class II-expressing population in the murine brain (32) (Fig 6D, Left), we questioned whether infection altered MHC class II expression on these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When gating on the CD45hiCD19hi population of B-cells, the mean fluorescent intensity of MHC class II did not differ between saline- and influenza-inoculated mice at day 8 p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 6D, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the observed change in B-cell MHC class II expression during infection is attributable to an increased percentage of CD45hiCD19hi cells in the CNS rather than to an increased expression of surface MHC class II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Both_IFN-_and_CXCL5_Are_Elevated_in_Cerebral_Spinal_Fluid_of_Patients_During_Relapse  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next questioned whether any of the chemokines that we identified as up-regulated in the CNS of mice during peripheral infection were increased in the cerebral spinal fluid samples of MS patients sampled during relapse vs. remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demographics of the patient population are shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of disease status, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL8, CCL27, CCL28, CXCL12, CX3CL1, and IFN- were detectable in patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Fig 7 AH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemokines CCL17 and CXCL2 were undetectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only chemokine that was significantly increased as a result of relapse was CXCL5 (Fig 7B), although CXCL1 showed a trend toward being increased in the CSF during relapse (Fig 7A; P = 0.06).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of IFN- were also elevated in MS patients during relapse (Fig 7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we investigated the ability of a mouse-adapted human influenza virus to trigger neurological disease in the autoimmune-prone TCR transgenic 2D2 mouse line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that infection with influenza virus is capable of causing both clinical and histological evidence of neurological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we showed that peripheral influenza infection causes time-dependent transcriptomic changes to occur in both the cerebellum and the spinal cord that are consistent with the up-regulation of immune response genes, of which many are downstream of type I and type II IFN receptor signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate that influenza infection potentiates immune cell surveillance of the CNS and identify CXCL5 as up-regulated in the CNS of animals during peripheral infection as well as in the CSF of MS patients during relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that upper-respiratory infection activates glia and potentially choroid plexus epithelial cells to promote immune cell trafficking to the CNS, which can, under the correct circumstances, trigger neurological disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data originating from the majority (1317, 21, 23, 24), but not all (33), studies that have investigated the relationship between upper-respiratory infection and MS exacerbation implicate viral infection as a trigger of relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper-respiratory infection by rhinovirus and enterovirus has been associated with MS relapse (13, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aside from picornaviruses, other viruses that infect the upper-respiratory tract have also been linked to exacerbation of inflammatory demyelinating disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in one case study, influenza infection caused relapse in a patient diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, several studies that examined the effects of upper-respiratory infection on MS relapse included flu-like symptoms and fever over 38 °C as criteria for occurrence of infection, indicating that influenza may have been the culprit underlying disease exacerbation in a few of these patients (14, 21, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That influenza is associated with exacerbation of MS symptoms is further eluded to by epidemiological data that link the incidence of MS hospitalizations to influenza epidemics (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, De Keyser et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have shown that influenza infection increases relapse risk whereas patients vaccinated against influenza had a lower risk of relapse (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many, but not all, studies have shown that influenza vaccination inhibits relapse (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these data suggest that influenza infection may promote exacerbation of MS symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How viral infection contributes to relapse is not known, but it may involve up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines both peripherally and centrally within the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is established that peripheral injection of TLR agonists such as LPS, poly(I:C), and imiquimod promotes global changes in immune-responsive genes, including chemokines, within the CNS (1, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, influenza infection causes microglia activation and promotes the central up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (4, 5, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because s.c. injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) (8), cutaneous treatment with imiquimod (2), and upper-respiratory infection with Bordetella pertussis (38) each caused T-cell surveillance of the brain parenchyma, it is plausible that glial activation during peripheral inflammation is a catalyst for autoreactive T-cell attraction to the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that nonautoreactive activated T-cells traffic to the CNS (3941), but what triggers this trafficking is still not completely defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells residing in lung tissue may be unique in their ability to direct activated T-cells to the CNS as T-cells were shown to be licensed in this tissue to traffic to the brain and spinal cord (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, concurrent respiratory infection with B. pertussis inhibited EAE onset when the disease was actively induced with CFA (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, multiple autoimmune transgenic mouse lines are known to develop EAE following systemic injection of TLR agonists or pertussis toxin alone (25, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it is tempting to speculate that activation of resident CNS cells, in response to pathogen-specific peripheral inflammation, have a role in the trafficking of autoreactive T-cells to the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that infection increases MHC class II+ B-cells in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are important because B-cells are known to contribute to reactivation of T-cells during EAE (31, 32) and also contribute to relapse in MS (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, uncovering the mechanisms governing the effect of peripheral infection on surveillance and reactivation is relevant not only to the pathogenesis of MS but also to many neuroinflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because all of the experiments were not conducted in 2D2 mice, which differ in their immune responsiveness to virus, it is likely that some of the observed responses that occurred in C57BL/6 mice would be different, particularly temporally in the 2D2 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the data presented here add to the understanding of how systemic inflammation affects the CNS by demonstrating that peripheral infection with a live virus induces the up-regulation of IFN-responsive genes in the cerebellum and spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly agree with those from Thomson et al., which clearly show an effect of systemic TLR7 ligation and IFN gene induction in the brain (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, influenza viral RNA is recognized by TLR7 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identified an association between circulating IFN- levels, type II IFN signaling in the brain, and immune cell surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our studies, these molecular events preceded the onset of neurological disease in 2D2 mice, which occurred within 2 wk of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our findings are similar to what is observed in human MS patients following upper-respiratory infection in both incidence and timing of relapse after the occurrence of symptoms of upper-respiratory viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, MS patients are at higher risk for relapse within 2 wk before and 5 wk after the occurrence of sickness behaviors that are indicative of upper-respiratory infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this at risk period (ARP) MS patients were shown to have higher numbers of circulating IFN- producing cells compared with measurements taken outside of this time frame (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that a single i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of IFN- triggered relapse in 38% (7/18) of MS patients (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These IFN-induced relapses lasted longer than 24 h and all occurred within the time frame that would be considered the ARP for an infection-induced relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Kunis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have provided compelling data suggesting that IFNGR signaling at the choroid plexus is needed for immune cell surveillance of the CNS (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In relation to MS, these data are interesting because there is an association with IFN- signaling and relapse and also because this portal of T-cell entry into the CNS may partially explain the periventricular predilection of lesions in MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it is conceivable that circulating IFN-, resulting from peripheral infection, aids in the surveillance of the CNS by immune cells and that, under the correct circumstances, may be sufficient to stimulate autoimmune cell activation/reactivation and disease exacerbation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that we found elevated levels of IFN- in patient CSF during relapse compared with samples taken during remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IFN- is capable of promoting relapse in MS patients, its role in the pathogenesis of EAE has traditionally been ascribed as protective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more recent data suggest that the absence of IFN- signaling to brain glia promotes atypical signs of EAE and is associated with cerebellar pathology (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An alternative hypothesis, which may not be mutually exclusive, is that peripheral infection-induced up-regulation of TNF and IL-1 within the CNS is required for disease initiation or relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generation of classical EAE is dependent on the activation of microglial transforming growth factor beta (TGF)1-activating kinase (TAK)1 activation, which is downstream of both IL-1 and TNFR1 receptor signaling (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deletion of TAK1 signaling in Nestin+ cells diminishes disease severity, indicating that IL-1 and TNF activation of microglia and/or astrocyte TAK1 likely induces chemokines needed to attract peripheral immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that neutrophils are the source of IL-1 that is needed for EAE induction (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are interesting because neutralizing antibodies directed against CXCR2 ameliorates atypical EAE, which was shown to be dependent on neutrophil recruitment (50, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, atypical EAE was strongly linked to astrocyte production of the CXCR2 ligands CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are relevant because (i) serum CXCL5 was recently reported to be a prognostic factor for MS relapse (30) and (ii) we now show that CXCL5 is increased in the CSF of MS patients during relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we observed demyelination in the cerebellum of several infected 2D2 transgenic mice and increased surveillance of the brain by monocytes and neutrophils, and our transcriptomic analysis identified Ccl17, Ccl6, and Cxcl5 as up-regulated in the cerebellum as a result of peripheral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These chemokines were previously identified as highly expressed in atypical vs. classical EAE (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect CCL17 in CSF of MS patients and did not observe increased levels of either CCL27 or CCL28 during relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results do not necessarily exclude the involvement of these chemokines in the pathogenesis of MS, especially given our small sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, that CXCL5 was increased during relapse supports the role of this chemokine in the pathogenesis of relapse, and it is tempting to speculate that the production of this chemokine within the CNS parenchyma by peripheral inflammation facilitates relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we found that intranasal inoculation with influenza A virus facilitated glial activation and immune surveillance and was sufficient to induce neurological and histological disease in autoimmune-prone 2D2 transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between peripheral infection induced neuroinflammation as determined by gene expression and human cytokine, and chemokine levels during relapse indicate that up-regulation of IFN- signaling during infection may contribute to relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations contribute to a better understanding of how peripheral infection may act to exacerbate neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and potentially others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and then inoculated with either sterile saline or mouse-adapted human influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1; PR8) diluted in sterile PBS in a total volume of 50 µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body weights and conditioning scores were recorded daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body-conditioning scores were assessed as follows: Score 1 is an emaciated mouse with skeletal structure extremely prominent and vertebrae distinctly segmented; score 2 is an under-conditioned mouse with segmentation of vertebral column evident and pelvic bones readily palpable; score 3 is a well-conditioned mouse with nonprominent vertebrae and pelvis; score 4 is an overconditioned mouse characterized by vertebrae that are palpable only with firm pressure; and score 5 is an obese mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical signs of EAE were recorded as reported previously (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, score 0, no abnormalities detected; 0.5, weak tail; 1, tail paralysis; 2, loss of coordinated movement and hind-limb paresis and/or decreased righting reflex; 3, paralysis of one hind limb; 4, paralysis of both hind limbs; 4.5, paralysis of both hind limbs and forelimb weakness; 5, moribund.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a mouse received a score for EAE this score was confirmed by a blinded rater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation__cDNA_Library_Generation__and_RT-qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At days 0 (noninfected), 4, and 8 p.i., mice were brought to a surgical plane of anesthesia by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, blood was collected from the heart, and then the mice were transcardially perfused with sterile PBS (pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cerebellum and the spinal cord were dissected, placed in RNAlater (Ambion), and transferred to 80 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was then homogenized by sonication, and total RNA was isolated by Tri reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were further purified using Thermojet RNA purification columns (ThermoScientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residual DNA was digested using DNaseI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of RNA was checked for genomic DNA by gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, strand-specific RNAseq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded RNA sample prep kits (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both PCR and qPCR were used to determine relative expression of viral M1, Gfap, Actin, and Gapdh using the following primer sequences: M1Fwd-AAGACCAATCCTGTCACCTCTGA, Rev-CAAAGCGTCTAC GCTGCAGTCC; GapdhFwd-GCATCTTCTTGTGCAGTGCC, Rev-TACGGCCAAATCCGTTCACA; GfapFwd-CAGCTTCGAGCCAAGGAG, Rev-TGTCCC TCTCCACCTCCA; and -actinFwd-AGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATGG, Rev-CAACGTCAC ACTTCATGATGG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative PCR was performed using Sybergreen (Bio-Rad) on a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold change in gene expression was calculated using the formula 2-Ct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-Sequencing_and_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA-seq data and statistical analyses were performed by the Roy J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carver Bioinformatics Center (University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, equimolar concentrations of libraries were pooled and then quantitated by qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the samples were subjected to 100-bp paired-end sequencing for 101 cycles on a HiSeq2500 using the HiSeq SBS sequencing kit version 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fastq files were generated and demultiplexed with the bcl2fastq v1.8.4 Conversion Software (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmomatic (version 0.33) was used to trim any residual adapter content and low-quality bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned to the mouse (Mus musculus) genome using STAR (version 2.5.0a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene counts were determined using featureCounts (version 1.4.3-pl), and multimapping reads were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After trimming and excluding multimapping reads, an average of 92.07 ± 0.09% (cerebellum) and 91.71 ± 0.23% (spinal cord) were uniquely mapped to a gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of single 100-bp paired-end gene reads obtained per sample was 72.04 million and 71.76 million in the cerebellum and spinal cord, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA sequencing datasets associated with this paper have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and can be accessed using the accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE96870.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene ontology and pathway analyses were performed on up-regulated genes using DAVID Bioinformatics Researches 6.8(Beta) (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted transcriptional regulators were identified using the iRegulon application in Cytoscape (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these analyses, the default settings of the program were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For any given set of genes, putative transcription factors or motifs that achieved a normalized enrichment score of less_than3.0 and an FDR of  greater than 0.001 were considered to be potential regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Serum_Cytokine_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Serum levels of TNF, IL-1, IFN-, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A were determined by Bio-plex (Bio-Rad) using a luminex magnetic bead panel kit (Millipore) following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue-Specific_Lymphocyte_Extraction_and_Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were brought to a surgical plane of anesthesia by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and then perfused with 1020 mL of sterile PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brain was removed, minced with a sterile razor blade, digested in StemPro Accutase buffer (Gibco) for 45 min at 37 °C, and then passed through a 70-µm filter (Corning) to remove debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated by percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing, the cells were suspended in ice-cold staining buffer (sterile PBS containing 2% FBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 6 and Fig S5, cells were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (clone 93) on ice for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking antibody was not used for experiments shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5 and Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, very similar results were obtained between experiments (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following antibody clones and conjugated fluorophores were used for phenotypical analysis: antiCD3-eFluor450 (clone: 17A2), antiCD3-PE-Cy7 (clone: 1452C11), antiCD4-eFluor450 (clone: GK1.5), antiCD4-APC (clone: GK1.5), antiCD4-FITC (clone: GK1.5), antiCD8-PE-cy5.5 (clone: 536.7), antiCD19-PE (clone: eBio1D3), antiCD19-APC (clone: eBio1D3), antiCD45-APC (clone: 30-F11), antiCD45-PE (clone: 30-F11), antiCD11b-FITC (clone: M170), antiCD11c-eFluor450 (clone: N418), antiMHCII-eFluor450 (clone: M5/114.15.2), antiMHCII-APC (clone: H1519), antiV3.2-APC (clone: RR3-16), antiV3.2-eFluor450 (clone: RR3-16), antiLy6G/C-PE-Cy7 (clone RB6-HC5), and antiLy6C-PE-Cy5.5 (clone HK1.4) were all from eBioscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 0.1 mL of ice-cold staining buffer and stained on ice in the dark for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing twice in staining buffer, the samples were acquired on a LSRII Flow cytometer (BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gates were determined using unstained and single-stained samples obtained from the same tissue of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were analyzed using FCS Express 4 and 6 flow cytometry software (De Novo Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histochemistry__Immunohistochemistry__and_Tissue_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were brought to a surgical plane of anesthesia and then transcardially perfused with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains and spinal columns were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, and then sectioned in the sagittal (brain) and transverse (spinal cord) planes, using a microtome, and then stained with either H&E or luxol fast blue by the histopathology core facility at the University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lesions were identified by an observer blinded to the experimental group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative images were collected using a NanoZoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In some experiments, the choroid plexus was isolated as previously described (58), fixed, mounted onto glass slides, and blocked with PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 and 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cells were stained using a rat anti-mouse CD4 antibody (clone RM4-5; eBioscience) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing, the tissue was incubated with an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary diluted 1/1,000 in PBST at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoechst 33342 trihydrochloride (1:2,000 Life Technologies) was then added for 1 min at RT to stain nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was coversliped with flouromount-G (Southern Biotech) and imaged using a fluorescent microscope ZOE (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human cerebrospinal fluid specimens were obtained from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center, VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center, Los Angeles, CA 90073, which is sponsored by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institute of Mental Health, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Department of Veteran Affairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluids were de-identified before acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, Institutional Review Board approval was not necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cerebrospinal fluids from MS patients in remission (n = 10) and in relapse (n = 10) were used to measure CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL12, CCL17, CCL27, CCL28, CX3CL1, and IFN- levels by Luminex array according to the manufacturers instructions (R&D Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All available information regarding human samples is shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Where appropriate, data were analyzed using one or two-tailed Students t tests for comparisons between two groups as indicated in the figure legend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of nonparametric analyses between two groups, data were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence of EAE onset was determined using 2 analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no saline-inoculated animals developed EAE, the known incidence of spontaneous EAE (4%) was used as a reference for controls (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing more than two groups, data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance followed by Bonferronis post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in survival were assessed using a log-rank MantelCox test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, P less_than 0.05 was considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
