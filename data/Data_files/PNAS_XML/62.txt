Selective optogenetic activation of arcuate kisspeptin neurons generates pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mammalian reproductive system is critically dependent upon pulsatile gonadotropin hormone release driven by a small population of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms underlying the episodic activation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons to drive pulsatile hormone release are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that, using optogenetics in vivo, the synchronous activation of a population of kisspeptin neurons located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus is remarkably potent at generating pulsatile gonadotropin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system exhibits major sex differences and is modulated by the gonadal steroid environment of the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide an important insight into the brain mechanism underlying gonadotropin pulsatility in mammalian reproductive biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Normal reproductive functioning in mammals depends upon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons generating a pulsatile pattern of gonadotropin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural mechanism underlying the episodic release of GnRH is not known, although recent studies have suggested that the kisspeptin neurons located in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) may be involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present experiments we expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the ARN kisspeptin population to test directly whether synchronous activation of these neurons would generate pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization studies showed that this strategy targeted ChR2 to 70% of all ARN kisspeptin neurons and that, in vitro, these neurons were activated by 473-nm blue light with high fidelity up to 30 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, the optogenetic activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons at 10 and 20 Hz evoked high amplitude, pulse-like increments in LH secretion in anesthetized male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation at 10 Hz for 2 min was sufficient to generate repetitive LH pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In diestrous female mice, only 20-Hz activation generated significant increments in LH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ovariectomized mice, 5-, 10-, and 20-Hz activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons were all found to evoke LH pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Part of the sex difference, but not the gonadal steroid dependence, resulted from differential pituitary sensitivity to GnRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments in kisspeptin receptor-null mice, showed that kisspeptin was the critical neuropeptide underlying the ability of ARN kisspeptin neurons to generate LH pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data demonstrate that synchronized activation of the ARN kisspeptin neuronal population generates pulses of LH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Adeno-Associated_Virus_Transfection_of_ARN_Kisspeptin_Neurons_with_Channelrhodopsin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because ARN kisspeptin cell bodies are difficult to visualize in mice, we performed experiments evaluating the efficiency of adeno-associated virus (AAV) transfection in Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/;Rosa26-CAG-GFP+/ mice in which kisspeptin neurons are tagged with GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused with mCherry was targeted to ARN kisspeptin neurons by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV [AAV9-EF1-dflox-hChR2-(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH] bilaterally into the ARN of Kiss1-IRES-Cre mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks after AAV injections, dual-label immunofluorescence studies showed that GFP (kisspeptin) neurons throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the ARN were transfected with mCherry (ChR2) (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas GFP was typically restricted to the cell body (Fig 1A), mCherry was often observed in processes in addition to the cell bodies (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just over 70% of kisspeptin neurons throughout the ARN (Fig 1 AC and Fig S1 AC) expressed ChR2 and these cells accounted for 91% of all ChR2 neurons (n = 5) (Fig 1D and Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S1 for the number of GFP, mCherry, and dual-labeled cells and their percentages in the rostral-, middle-, and caudal parts of the ARN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells with mCherry but no GFP were usually observed in the lateral margins of the ARN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control AAV injections performed in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) resulted in no mCherry expression confirming the Cre-dependence of the viral vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that AAVs can be used to target the majority of ARN kisspeptin neurons in a selective manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optogenetic_Activation_of_ARN_Kisspeptin_Neurons_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the ability of transfected ChR2 to control the firing of kisspeptin neurons, coronal brain slices were prepared from AAV-injected Kiss1-IRES-Cre male mice (3 wk postinjection) and cell-attached recordings made from mCherry-expressing ARN kisspeptin neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser pulses (473 nm, 5 ms) were delivered at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Hz for 1 s in a repetitive manner once every 10 s over a period of 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kisspeptin neurons exhibited action potentials in response to blue light activation with high spike fidelity (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser pulses at 1, 2, and 5 Hz induced action potentials with 100% fidelity, and frequencies of 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz generated 97 ± 3% (n = 7), 91 ± 9% (n = 8), 80 ± 10% (n = 7), and 70 ± 14% (n = 7) fidelity, respectively (four mice) (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although kisspeptin neurons did not follow every light stimulation at higher frequencies (Fig 1E), the overall mean fidelity rate was not different up to 30 Hz, with only 40 Hz generating significantly reduced firing fidelity (P less_than 0.05, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that ARN kisspeptin neurons can faithfully follow blue light activation up to moderately high stimulation frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optogenetic_Activation_of_ARN_Kisspeptin_Neurons_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined whether activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons in vivo could alter LH secretion in anesthetized mice and whether this might be different in males and females or altered by ovariectomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies in the laboratory have found that endogenous LH pulsatility is blocked in the isoflurane-anesthetized mouse (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate here that the synchronous activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons in vivo evokes pulse-like increments in LH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AAV approach in Kiss1-IRES-Cre mice was effective at transducing 70% of kisspeptin neurons with ChR2 and electrophysiological brain-slice studies demonstrated kisspeptin neurons to exhibit high spike fidelity up to 30-Hz blue light activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo experiments in male mice showed that ARN kisspeptin neurons needed to be activated at 10 Hz to evoke reliable increments in LH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, whereas 30-s duration 10-Hz activation had no effect, a 2-min stimulation period was found to be as effective as 5 min in generating a pulse of LH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is reminiscent of recent GnRH neuron optogenetic studies where a 2-min period of GnRH neuron activation was found to be the minimum activation interval required to evoke a pulse of LH secretion (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpectedly, we found that the activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons in diestrous mice was less effective at modifying LH secretion than in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In diestrous females, only 20-Hz activation was able to generate significant increases in LH and, even then, these changes were approximately fourfold lower in magnitude than those observed in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this sex difference in LH release resulted from sexually differentiated GnRH release or pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, we examined pituitary responses to exogenous GnRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the magnitude of the pituitary response to GnRH in diestrous females was only 40% of that of males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, in vivo sex differences in pituitary sensitivity to GnRH have not been reported previously for mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our data suggest that the pituitary will underlie at least part of the sex differences observed here following activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons in intact male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex differences have occasionally been reported for ARN kisspeptin neurons themselves (31), including a 20-fold difference in spontaneous firing rate (32), and may also contribute to the sexually dimorphic optogenetic responses found here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous investigations have shown that kisspeptin biosynthesis within the ARN is robustly suppressed by estradiol (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether different levels of kisspeptin peptide within ARN kisspeptin cells may impact upon their ability to regulate LH secretion, we compared OVX and intact diestrous female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optogenetic activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons at 10 and 20 Hz in OVX mice generated fourfold larger increments in LH secretion compared with intact females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pituitary sensitivity to exogenous GnRH was not different between OVX and diestrous mice, it is likely that optogenetic activation evokes enhanced kisspeptin release in OVX mice, resulting in larger LH responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 5-Hz stimulation was able to elevate LH release in OVX mice but not intact animals, suggesting that there is more efficient electrochemical coupling of kisspeptin release from kisspeptin nerve terminals in the OVX state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would provide one mechanism through which estrogen negative feedback could occur in the absence of any changes in the actual firing rate of kisspeptin neurons (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ARN kisspeptin, or KNDy cells, synthesize numerous neuropeptidergic and classic transmitters (20, 23, 35) and innervate only the distal processes of GnRH neurons in mice, either at the level of the dendron or their nerve terminals in the median eminence (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 2-Hz stimulation of ARN KNDy neurons was completely ineffective in modulating LH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because low stimulation frequencies of 12 Hz typically evoke only classic neurotransmitter release (38, 39), this suggests that glutamate release from KNDy cells is insufficient on its own to modify LH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To help decipher which KNDy neuropeptide is responsible for activating LH release, we examined the effects of optogenetic activation in the Gpr54-null mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the pituitary gland was still able to generate a small response to exogenous GnRH in Gpr54-null mice, optogenetic activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons had no effect at all on LH levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding demonstrates that, even following 20-Hz activation of KNDy cells, kisspeptin is the key neuropeptide/transmitter released by these cells to generate an LH pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is compatible with prior data showing that kisspeptin can act at the distal processes of GnRH neurons to modulate GnRH secretion (40, 41) and that the effects on LH secretion of coreleased neuropeptides, such as NKB, may be upstream of kisspeptin signaling (27, 42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There seems little doubt that kisspeptin signaling is essential for normal LH pulsatility in mammals (4447), but an essential role for the ARN kisspeptin neurons has yet to be proven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, increases in extracellular kisspeptin levels within the region of the ARN can correlate with pulsatile GnRH secretion (48) and injection of Gpr54 antagonists into the ARN region decreases LH pulse frequency (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of Gpr54 antagonism within those studies is unknown and may possibly be at the level of the Gpr54-expressing GnRH neuron dendron/terminals within and adjacent to the ARN, where they would suppress the putative episodic kisspeptin drive to GnRH secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that the selective reduction of ARN kisspeptin levels by 30% results in a small but significant 8% slowing of LH pulse frequency in the rat (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, we herein provide the first direct evidence that the synchronous activation of ARN kisspeptin neurons can generate pulsatile LH release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents critical support for the hypothesis that the ARN kisspeptin neurons are part of the GnRH pulse generator and demonstrates that kisspeptinergic innervation of GnRH neuron distal projections can be a remarkably potent neuronal construct for generating repeated LH pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/, Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/;Rosa26-CAG-GFP, Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/;Gpr54/, Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/;Gpr54+/, and wild-type C57BL/6J mice (8- to 16-wk-old) were housed in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on at 0600 hours and off at 1800 hours) with food and water available ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where indicated, mice were bilaterally overiectomized under isoflurane anesthesia and used for experiments 310 wk later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For intact females, estrous cycle stage was determined by daily vaginal smear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stereotaxic_Injections_of_AAV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and given simultaneous bilateral 1-L injections of AAV9-EF1-dflox-hChR2-(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH (4.35 × 1013 GC/mL; Penn Vector Core) into the ARN at a rate of 100 nL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The syringes were left in situ for 3 min before and 10 min after the injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates according to the Paxinos mouse atlas (51) were 1.2-mm posterior to bregma, 0.3-mm lateral to midline, and 6.0-mm depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brain_Slice_Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acute 200-m-thick coronal brain slices containing the ARN were prepared between 0900 and 1100 hours, as reported previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 95%O2/5%CO2 equilibrated artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained: 120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loose-seal cell-attached recordings (1030 M) were made from mCherry-fluorescent kisspeptin neurons visualized through an upright microscope fitted for epifluorescence (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kisspeptin neurons were identified by the presence of mCherry, revealed by brief illumination with green light, and then patched under differential interference contrast optics, as reported previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Action currents were recorded (2- to 5-M pipettes) in voltage clamp mode with 0-mV command voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recorded neurons were stimulated by delivering blue light (473 nm) from a 100-m optic fiber coupled to DPSS laser (Ike-Cool), controlled by a Grass S88X stimulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light intensity at the tip of the optic fiber was 5 mW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulses of light (5-ms duration) were delivered at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz for 1 s every 10 s, repeated six times over 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals were acquired using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices) connected to a Digidata 1322A and filtered at 3 kHz before digitizing at 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intact male AAV-injected Kiss1-IRES-Cre+/;Rosa26-CAG-GFP mice were killed by overdose of sodium pentobarbital (3 mg/100 L, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and transcardially perfused with 20 mL of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three sets of 30-m-thick coronal brain sections were cut and processed for free-floating GFP immunofluorescence using a polyclonal chicken anti-GFP antiserum (1:1,500; Chemicon International), biotinylated goat anti-chicken secondary immunoglobulins (1:400; Vector Laboratories), and streptavidin Alexa488 (Alexa Fluor; Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three sections at the level of the rostral, middle, and caudal ARN were analyzed in each mouse by counting the total number of cells expressing GFP or mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Optogenetic_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three to 10 wk after AAV injection, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and an optical fiber (100-m tip diameter) connected to a laser was implanted into the ARN (1.2 mm AP, midline, 6.0 mm DV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty minutes later the stimulation protocol commenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consisted of either (i) 5-ms pulses of blue light delivered at frequencies of 2, 5, 10, or 20 Hz for 5 min each in a randomized order; (ii) 5-ms pulses of blue light at 10 Hz delivered for 30 s, 2 min, or 5 min; or (iii) 5-ms pulses of blue light at 10 Hz delivered for 2 min repeated four times over 45-min intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial blood samples (5 L each) were collected from the tail tip at 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 20, and 30 min, where time 0 is the start of the stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, baseline LH levels were determined from blood samples taken 5 and 0 min before subcutaneous injection of 200 ng/kg GnRH and compared with LH levels 15 min later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blood samples were processed by ELISA as reported previously (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis of LH values at 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 20, and 30 min was undertaken using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Dunnetts post hoc test, comparing values to the 5 min LH level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare between groups, the change in LH was determined by subtracting average baseline LH values at 5 and 1min from average evoked levels detected at 6 and 10 min in each mouse and these combined to provide mean ± SEM values for each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons were made by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferronis post hoc tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pituitary responses to subcutaneous GnRH were determined by subtracting baseline LH values from that of 15 min after GnRH, and were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Bonferronis post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
