Hamartin regulates cessation of mouse nephrogenesis independently of Mtor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mammals form the final numbers of nephrons, the functional units of their kidneys, before or within a few days after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This initial endowment declines throughout life without the ability to replace nephrons lost to injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, humans with low nephron numbers (such as premature infants) have higher rates of kidney disease in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that partial reduction in hamartin activity within mouse renal progenitors can lead to a significant increase in nephron numbers in newborns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nephrogenesis was prolonged by at least a day and correlated with higher engraftment rates in the developing niche in a stem cell engraftment assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that this phenotype is independent of the inhibitory effect of hamartin on the Mtor complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nephrogenesis concludes by the 36th week of gestation in humans and by the third day of postnatal life in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending the nephrogenic period may reduce the onset of adult renal and cardiovascular disease associated with low nephron numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conditionally deleted either Mtor or Tsc1 (coding for hamartin, an inhibitor of Mtor) in renal progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of one Mtor allele caused a reduction in nephron numbers; complete deletion led to severe paucity of glomeruli in the kidney resulting in early death after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, loss of one Tsc1 allele from renal progenitors resulted in a 25% increase in nephron endowment with no adverse effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased progenitor engraftment rates ex vivo relative to controls correlated with prolonged nephrogenesis through the fourth postnatal day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete loss of both Tsc1 alleles in renal progenitors led to a lethal tubular lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hamartin phenotypes are not dependent on the inhibitory effect of TSC on the Mtor complex but are dependent on Raptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mtor_Activity_Is_Necessary_for_Normal_Development_of_the_Kidney  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the role of the Mtor pathway in nephron development, we deleted Mtor in NPCs using Six2TGC+/tg (14) and the Mtorf/f alleles (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocally, we deleted Tsc1 using a similar strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the Six2TGC+/tg allele is not benign: Fewer nephrons form in hemizygotes relative to wild type (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a large fraction of gravid dams carrying a litter with Tsc1 hemizygote kidneys delivered prematurely (before the Six2TGC+/tg controls), we assigned age to all mice in this study as postcoitum days (PCD) based on the plug date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One-quarter of the pups born to a Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f male mated with an Mtorf/f female died within 2 d and displayed severe generalized edema (Fig 1A) not seen in other mice lacking nephrons (e.g., Notch mutants) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping confirmed complete loss of Mtor in these pups; no Mtor-null mice survived longer than 2 d. The kidneys of Mtor mutants were pale and dysplastic (Fig 1B), with tubules in the parenchyma, paucity of glomeruli, and multiple cysts noted in the collecting ducts (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that Mtor activity is essential for proper kidney development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although complete loss of Mtor led to dysplastic and dysfunctional kidneys, we next explored the hypothesis that Mtor signaling might still affect nephron endowment in hemizygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of one Mtor allele led to a 24% decrease in the kidney/body weight ratio at PCD19.5 compared with Six2TGC+/tg mice (0.47 ± 0.03 vs. 0.624 ± 0.02, P less_than 0.005), and to a 42% decrease in the ratio compared with wild-type mice (0.47 ± 0.03 vs. 0.9 ± 0.03, P less_than 0.005) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, nephron counts were significantly (P less_than 0.005) lower in Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f kidneys (1,140 ± 139) compared with both controls: Six2TGC+/tg (2,850 ± 3) and wild type (5,100 ± 377.5) (Fig 2B), reflective of impaired nephrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Six2TGC+/tg itself affects nephrogenesis, Six2TGC+/tg mice serve as controls in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then assessed the contribution of postnatal nephrogenesis in Mtor hemizygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f P30 kidneys had 22.5% fewer nephrons than Six2TGC+/tg controls (13,382 ± 389 vs. 17,250 ± 194, P less_than 0.0001) and 59% fewer nephrons than wild-type kidneys (13,382 ± 194 vs. 27,967 ± 298, P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, at P200 Six2TGC+/tg animals developed albuminuria (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite reduced nephron numbers, glomerular function, assessed in aggregate by serum creatinine (Fig S1B), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (Fig S1C), and albuminuria, was not further compromised in Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f  P200 mice relative to Six2TGC+/tg controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tsc1_Loss_Is_Lethal_Due_to_Severe_Renal_Tubular_Lesion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While Mtor loss may compromise progenitor survival due to metabolic insufficiency, it is possible that elevated Mtor activity would accelerate the cessation of nephrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore this, we first deleted Tsc1 in NPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Six2TGC+/tg Tsc1f/f pups (henceforth, Tsc1-null kidneys) were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies and had a normal appearance at birth, they failed to survive longer than 48 h, consistent with renal failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tsc1-null kidneys produced urine throughout gestation, as demonstrated by amniotic fluid volumes similar to those in hemizygous littermates and the presence of urine in the bladder when pups were killed at PCD19.5 (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, and in contrast to Mtor-null kidneys, no glomerulopathy was identified in histological sections of Tsc1-null kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strikingly, Tsc1-null kidneys displayed severe proximal tubular lesions: H&E staining showed that most cortical proximal tubules in Tsc1-null kidneys lacked a patent lumen compared with wild-type tubules, and tubular epithelial cells frequently exhibited a random orientation of the nuclei in contrast to the orderly basilar location in wild-type tubules (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the degree of tubular lesion, we counted the fraction of LTL+ tubules with a patent lumen in Tsc1-null and wild-type kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All control LTL+ tubules had a patent lumen; 90% of LTL+ tissues in the Tsc1-null kidneys lacked a lumen (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubular lesions were detected as early as PCD15.5 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further characterize the phenotype, we performed periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining on Tsc1-null and control embryonic kidneys to examine the brush border in cortical proximal tubule cells (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PAS stain generally showed no well-developed brush border along the apical surface and a lack of intracytoplasmic resorption droplets, both findings divergent from wild-type stains and indicative of loss of tubular cell polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the lack of a brush border in swollen proximal tubule cells with large eccentric nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal number and the distribution of mitochondria implied that some forms of active transport may still exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glomerular morphology was unaffected by Tsc1 loss, consistent with the production of urine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lesion was limited to the cortical proximal tubules; although it did not obstruct urine flow, it was severe enough to compromise survival (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we cannot rule out the possibility that loss of Tsc1 in other Six2-expressing tissues (e.g., cranial nerves and dorsal root ganglia) compromised the animals, at birth they were viable, motile, and feeding normally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that the mechanism most likely to impose rapid demise may be impaired tubular function driving the accumulation of electrolytes in the blood and leading to fatal arrhythmia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tsc1-Hemizygous_Kidneys_Have_More_Nephrons_than_Controls_in_Two_Independent_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied the effect of removing one Tsc1 allele on nephron numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that hamartin levels were reduced by Western blot analysis of purified NPCs (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the kidney/body weight ratio of the Tsc1 hemizygotes (1.5% ± 0.05) was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice (1.5% ± 0.05, P = 0.49) and was 22% higher than that of Six2TGC+/tg mice in adulthood (1.22% ± 0.04, P less_than 0.05) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deletion of one copy of Tsc1 in kidney progenitors restored nephron numbers at P30 to the wild-type levels (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average nephron number in Six2TGC+/tg mice was 17,180 ± 261, significantly lower than that in wild-type mice (25,769 ± 1,756, P less_than 0.001); by contrast, the average nephron number in Tsc1-hemizygous kidneys (26,640 ± 514, P = 0.66) was indistinguishable from wild-type kidneys and was significantly higher than in Six2TGC+/tg kidneys (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the loss of one Tsc1 allele in NPCs increases kidney size and nephron numbers in the Six2-Cre background without any apparent impact on viability or fecundity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The loss of a Tsc1 allele may act only to correct the uncharacterized defect in Six2+/TGC (a Bac insertion transgene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility we used Fgf20+/Cre mice (25), a knockin line increasing progenitor exit by a fraction due to reduced Fgf20/Fgf9 signaling (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we observed a significant increase in nephron numbers in Fgf20+/Cre; Tsc1+/f mice, which became statistically indistinguishable from wild type (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This line serves as an independent control confirming that the reduction in hamartin did not act solely by countering the defect introduced by the Six2TGC transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increased_Perdurance_of_Tsc1-Hemizygous_Progenitors_in_the_Niche  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hamartin could act by increasing niche numbers, by increasing progenitor proliferation, by prolonging nephrogenesis, or by other mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blinded observers quantified niches and progenitors by tomography-based counts on littermates with the genotypes wild type, Six2TGC+/tg, and Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f on PCD15.5 and PCD19.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell number per niche was indistinguishable in the three groups at both ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they trended upward at PCD19.5 in Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f mice, niche numbers were statistically indistinguishable in Six2TGC+/tg and Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f mice and were higher in wild-type mice on PCD15.5 and PCD19.5 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine when NPCs were exhausted (typically by P3 in mice), we stained PCD22.5PCD25.5 kidneys (P3P6 in Six2TGC+/tg mice) from the genotypes mentioned above for Six2 (MM) and cytokeratin 8 (UB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all genotypes, Six2+ NPCs were identified on PCD22.5 but were absent on PCD24.5 (P5 in controls).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At PCD23.5, controls (four wild type and two Six2TGC+/tg) lacked Six2+ NPCs, while many niches in all seven Tsc1 hemizygotes contained Six2+ progenitors (Fig 7A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an additional control, age-matched wild-type (Tsc1+/f) littermates exposed to the same uterine environment as Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f pups were examined; no Six2+ niches were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Six2+ progenitors, and thus nephrogenesis, persisted an additional 24 h in the Fgf20+/Cre; Tsc1+/f kidney as well (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, since none of the wild-type littermates had Six2+ progenitors at that age (Fig 7B), the gain in nephrons is the result of the increased lifespan of NPCs hemizygous for Tsc1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tsc1-Hemizygotous_Renal_Progenitor_Cells_Have_Higher_Engraftment_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above observation suggests a possible shift in the rate of NPC aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we investigated how progenitor engraftment was affected by reduced hamartin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Tsc1 increases the activity of Mtor, which may be driving the aged signature in our single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If elevated Mtor activity caused poor engraftment of older progenitors, we anticipated that Tsc1-deficient progenitors would engraft poorly relative to same-age wild-type cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if Mtor activity was not impeding engraftment, but hamartin activity was, we expected to see improved engraftment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used an ex vivo transplantation assay to differentiate between these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engraftment potential of NPCs declines with time, as older NPC tend to exit the niche and differentiate in larger numbers than younger cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the performance of PCD18.5 Tsc1+/f progenitors engrafted relative to PCD12.5 progenitors, we FACS-purified PCD18.5 Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f; Rosa+/tdTomato old progenitors (red+green, due to GFP expressed from the Six2TGC+/tg allele) and PCD12.5 Six2TGC+/tg; CAG-eCFP+/tg young progenitors (blue+green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were injected in a 1:1 ratio into the cap mesenchyme (CM) of a PCD12.5 recipient kidney explant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 d the injected kidneys were fixed and stained for markers of MM and UB (Six2 and cytokeratin 8, respectively); we then quantified the number of red and blue Six2+ cells in z stacks acquired by confocal imaging (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To normalize the data across experiments, we calculated the percentage of red and blue cells out of the total injected cells remaining in the niche at day 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IMARIS software enabled analysis of the engraftment rate; the young cells engrafted better than old cells (86 ± 3% vs. 13 ± 3%, P less_than 0.0001, 11 sites injected on three dates) (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the reduction in Tsc1 dosage did not alter the negative effect of aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested if Tsc1 loss impacted relative engraftment by comparing same-age cells of different genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We FACS-purified PCD18.5 Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f; Rosa+/tdTomato (red+green, Tsc1-hemizygote) and Six2TGC+/tg; CAG-eCFP+/tg (blue+green, control) progenitors and mixed them at a 1:1 ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When populations of PCD18.5 progenitors were injected into the CM of a PCD12.5 host kidney, Tsc1-hemizygote progenitors had a significant engraftment advantage compared with the controls (85 ± 5% vs. 15 ± 4%, P less_than 0.0001, 10 sites injected on five dates) (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although Tsc1 loss did not reverse the overall effect of aging on engraftment, decreased hamartin in NPCs does improve the cell engraftment rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Effect_of_Tsc1_on_Nephron_Number_and_Proximal_Tubules_Is_Agnostic_to_Mtor_Dose_but_Requires_both_Alleles_of_Raptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increase in nephron numbers could result exclusively from elevated Mtor activity, from reduced hamartin function(s) unrelated to Mtor signaling, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To differentiate between these possibilities, we examined nephron numbers in compound hemizygous (Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f; Tsc1+/f) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of one Mtor allele resulted in reduced nephron numbers (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this reflected enhanced inhibition of Mtor complex(es) due to an increased Tsc/Mtor ratio, we would expect nephron numbers in Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f; Tsc1+/f kidneys to return to the levels seen in Six2TGC+/tg kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead we found that Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f; Tsc1+/f and Tsc1-hemizygous kidneys were indistinguishable: At P30, the average nephron number in Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f mice (21,355 ± 1,819) is similar to the average number in Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f Tsc1+/f mice (19,325 ± 1,822, P = 0.46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both were significantly higher than in Six2TGC+/tg control mice (13,838 ± 755, P = 0.01) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that Mtor-independent hamartin activity limits nephron number and that the loss of one Tsc1 allele alleviated this restriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the tubular lesions of Tsc1-null kidneys can be reversed by decreasing Mtor activity in progenitors, we mated Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f; Tsc1+/f males with Tsc1f/f females; 12.5% of the pups had the relevant genotype (Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1f/f; Mtor+/f), all of which died within the first 2 d of life regardless of their Mtor genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of tubules displaying lesions under light microscopy in Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1f/f; Mtor+/f kidneys was the same as noted in Tsc1-null kidneys (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the frequency and severity of the tubular lesions caused by complete deletion of Tsc1 are not modified by the Mtor dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we asked whether the scaffold protein Raptor was involved in the Tsc1 phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Six2TGC+/tg; Mtor+/f kidneys contained significantly fewer nephrons than Six2TGC+/tg kidneys (Fig 2), nephron numbers in Six2TGC+/tg; Rap+/f (n = 4) kidneys were statistically indistinguishable from Six2TGC+/tg (n = 5) kidneys (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Raptor and the Mtor kinase form MtorC1, Raptor may be in excess such that the loss of free Raptor had no impact whereas the loss of Mtor did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Raptor activities were mediated via MtorC1, we expected that reducing hamartin levels would elevate nephron number in Rap hemizygotes as it did in Mtor hemizygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, loss of Tsc1 in Six2TGC+/tg; Tsc1+/f; Rap+/f kidneys (n = 5) had no impact on nephron numbers (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These series of genetic experiments suggest a complex mechanism by which hamartin regulates nephrogenesis duration in mice, proposed in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we describe a role for hamartin in regulating NPC exhaustion during kidney development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete deletion of either Mtor or Tsc1 in mice NPCs led to postnatal lethality but apparently by different mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mtor-deficient NPC failed to develop a functional kidney, reminiscent of the loss of Mtor in other stem cell compartments (2631).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lethal phenotype reflects the vital role of the kidney in neonates: In utero, the filtering function of the kidney is replaced by the maternal placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complete deletion of Tsc1 spared the glomerulus but disrupted cortical proximal tubule morphology with loss of the brush border and minimal luminal space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal tubules act in resorption and homeostasis of glucose, ions, and water; the loss of Tsc1 must have rendered them sufficiently impaired to cause lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype is reminiscent of one described previously (32) in which a later, mosaic deletion of Tsc1 in proximal tubules, glomeruli, and ducts resulted in severe, MtorC1-dependent polycystic kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reflect an earlier, fully penetrant effect of hamartin that is Mtor independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, hemizygous deletion of Tsc1 increased nephron numbers in Six2TGC+/tg Tsc1+/f kidneys, restoring them to the level seen in the wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While environmental factors such as a high-protein diet (33) can increase nephron endowment in rats, few genetic manipulations can cause the same effect (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the number of nephron progenitors and niches were the same in Tsc1+/ and controls at PCD15.5 and PCD19.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Tsc1+/ kidneys displayed prolonged nephrogenesis, with Six2+ NPCs detected at PCD23.5 in a fraction of the niches, while there was no detectable Six2 staining past P25.5/PCD22.5 in control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extended nephrogenesis by even a fraction of a day can account for the observed increase in nephron number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extended nephrogenesis in Tsc1 hemizygotes was consistent with the effect of losing one Tsc1 allele on the behavior of individual NPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our explant system permits simultaneous interrogation of genetically defined cells engrafted in genetically defined environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that older NPCs lacking one Tsc1 allele have significantly higher engraftment rates than wild-type NPCs of the same age, as is consistent with a prolonged nephrogenic period and, presumably, a slower rate of aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that not all NPCs have to display these properties for a gain of 25% in nephron numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because hamartin loss impacted both Six2TGC+/tg and Fgf20+/Cre NPCs, its impact implies a more general mechanism that compensates indirectly for the deficiency in these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In humans, tuberous sclerosis disease is caused by loss of function of TSC1 or TSC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kidney involvement manifests with angiomyolipoma (AML) and cysts, which contribute to bleeding and CKD, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not known whether newborns with TSC1 loss have more nephrons at birth, as any gain may be obscured by the secondary disease complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that an increased nephron number offers a physiological advantage, as cysts promote nephron loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In AML, in addition to germline loss of TSC1 or 2, somatic loss of heterozygosity is frequently identified (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the complete deletion of Tsc1 in NPCs leads to severe and lethal tubular lesions, and others have demonstrated severe cysts in Tsc1-null kidneys (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the loss of heterozygosity may lead to similar, mTOR-independent tubular lesions and eventually, in an mTORC1-dependent manner, to cystogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin revolutionized tuberous sclerosis management and was particularly helpful in treating hamartomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have shown that viability was not restored and that the severity of the tubular lesions in Tsc1-null kidneys was not ameliorated by Mtor deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it did not modify nephron numbers in Six2TGC+/tg Tsc+/ kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that Mtor deletion could affect MtorC1, MtorC2, and other Mtor-containing complexes (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since reduced hamartin levels increase nephron number in Mtor, Fgf20, and Six2TGC hemizygotes but not in Raptor hemizygotes, we conclude that hamartin activities are Mtor independent but Raptor dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reminiscent of recent reports that free Raptor has mTOR-independent activity (38), which hamartin may be able to modulate (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several questions remain to be addressed by future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanisms behind our observed Tsc1+/ NPC niche retention and higher engraftment rates remain unknown, as are the hamartin targets involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hamartin and tuberin form a complex that negatively regulates the Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase, the main regulator of mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hamartin also interacts with other pathways that affect nephrogenesis: For example, it can modulate TGF-/Smad2/3 signaling independently from tuberin (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smad signaling has an important role in kidney development via regulation of NPC exhaustion (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not detect changes in the level of phospho-Smad in Tsc1 hemizygotes (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our genetic analysis suggested that hamartin impacts nephron number independently of Mtor or the dosage-sensitive Fgf20 but that its activity does require Raptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that hamartin may participate in balancing the impact of free Raptor on nephrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When hamartin levels are reduced, a net positive effect is gained (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathogenesis of Tsc1/-associated tubular lesions remains to be fully characterized, and, last, the implications for human health need to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the field is focused on modulating Mtor; our study suggests Mtor-independent targets should also be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we find that a reduction in hamartin has a net positive effect on nephron number by enabling progenitor expansion, acting independently of the mTor complex but requiring Raptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests distinct targets and offers a therapeutic path toward increasing nephron numbers in premature newborns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the long run, augmenting nephron numbers could also help address the high rates of adult renal and cardiovascular disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may also provide a model that will enhance our understanding of the initial steps in the process leading to AML and cyst formation in tuberous sclerosis patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BUN_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BUN measurement was carried out by the Cincinnati Veterinary Laboratory (Cincinnati, OH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Niche_and_Progenitor_Cell_Count  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-mount and confocal microscopy and optical projection tomography (OPT) were carried out according to published protocols (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell counts per niche (confocal microscopy) and niche counts (OPT) were performed as reported (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-tailed unpaired t tests were performed for the analysis of kidney size, nephron counts, and BUN levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of red or blue cells out of the total number of cells coinjected in multiple sites on different days were combined to derive the average percentage and SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-tailed Student t test was used to calculate the P value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error estimates of all pooled data were calculated as SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of single cells vs. groups was calculated separately for cells of each color in individual injected niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are presented using the GraphPad Prism version 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
