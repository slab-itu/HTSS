Varying and unchanging whiteness on the wings of dusk-active and shade-inhabiting Carystoides escalantei butterflies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whiteness, although frequently apparent on the wings, legs, antennae, or bodies of many species of moths and butterflies, has often escaped our attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the nanostructure and microstructure of white spots on the wings of Carystoides escalantei, a dusk-active and shade-inhabiting Costa Rican rain forest butterfly (Hesperiidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify two types of whiteness: angle dependent and angle independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the biological functions and evolution of Carystoides spot patterns, scale structures, and their varying whiteness are adaptations to the butterflys low light habitat and to airflow experienced on the wing base vs. wing tip during flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex and species differences in the location of angle-dependent white spots on the wings may function in both intraspecific and interspecific communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whiteness, although frequently apparent on the wings, legs, antennae, or bodies of many species of moths and butterflies, along with other colors and shades, has often escaped our attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the nanostructure and microstructure of white spots on the wings of Carystoides escalantei, a dusk-active and shade-inhabiting Costa Rican rain forest butterfly (Hesperiidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On both males and females, two types of whiteness occur: angle dependent (dull or bright) and angle independent, which differ in the microstructure, orientation, and associated properties of their scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some spots on the male wings are absent from the female wings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the angle-dependent whiteness is bright or dull depends on the observation directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angle-dependent scales also show enhanced retro-reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the biological functions and evolution of Carystoides spot patterns, scale structures, and their varying whiteness are adaptations to butterflys low light habitat and to airflow experienced on the wing base vs. wing tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
White coloration occurs on the wings of thousands of species of moths and butterflies including many of those in Area de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica (janzen.sas.upenn.edu/) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It likely serves three broad functions: part of courtship under low or limiting light conditions (poor visibility at dusk or dawn), part of aposematic warning coloration, and when the skipper is perched, some mimetic resemblance to rotting and fungus-attacked inedible foliage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carystoides escalantei (Fig 1) (Hesperiidae), a medium-small denizen of Neotropical rain forest, is common in ACG midelevation rain forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its caterpillars, feeding on the leaves of understory palms (janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso), have often been found and reared by the ACG Lepidoptera inventory (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adult butterflies, however, are rarely seen because they fly at dusk and in the deep shade, and their colors are dull, drab, and inconspicuous compared with the brilliant colors of many other more sun-loving butterflies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a pinned, dried specimen of Carystoides escalantei with its wings spread open in a horizontal plane is placed on a flat surface for routine perpendicular examination, the large spots on the wing look plain white; but when viewed at a low angle, the white spots look brilliant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn prompted reexamination of living butterflies when they perched on plants (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the image of a male Carystoides, ventral hindwing spots are bright white in an oblique frontal view (Fig 1B) but inconspicuous in a perpendicular side view (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The female Carystoides, on the other hand, has nearly lost the white spots on the underside of its hindwing (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the midsection of the upper side of the male Carystoides wing, there are four white spots, labeled a1, a2, and a3 on the forewings and a4 on the hindwing vs. three white spots, a1, a2, and a3 on the forewings of the female Carystoides; they are bright or dull (Fig 1 D and E and Fig S1), depending on the viewing angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the difference in intensity of the whiteness, the location and quality of whiteness on the wings also vary between males and females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white spots on the wing tips (c1 in Fig 1D) and antennae (b1 in Fig 1 D and E) are angle independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediate questions are, Why are there different kinds of white spots in different places, and for different sexes?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What aspects of the wing scales contribute to the differences in operational whiteness?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are the micromechanisms of whiteness the same in different spots?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Does whiteness originate from the same basic kind of wing scale within a species and among species, or does it have different evolutionary starting points?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address some of these questions, we characterize the morphology of the Carystoides scales and their corresponding optical properties of different white spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 2 and Fig S1, the angle-dependent white spots (a1a3) on the forewing show different reflectance when observed from the light illumination side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the male, when viewed from the wing base on the dorsal side, a1 and a2 appear bright white, whereas a3 is dull (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When viewed from the wing tip, a3 is bright white, whereas a1 and a2 appear dull (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the female, the three forewing spots are either bright white or dull white on the dorsal side when observed from the wing base and the wing tip, respectively (Fig 2 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the retro-reflection intensity of a1 (male, dorsal) was tested using the setup shown in the Inset in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retro-reflection is the special type of reflection, where light striking the surface is redirected back to the source of light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As specified in Fig S2,  is the incident angle,  is the detecting angle, and we set  to be equal to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the intensity of the bright white spot (wing tip side,  = 40°, green line in Fig 2E) is two times higher than that of the dull white spot (wing body side,  = 40°, red line in Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that retro-reflection intensity differs with varying incident angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The whiteness of the spots a1a3 on the ventral side is shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these spots are bright white when viewed from the wing base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, another four species of CarystoidesC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hondura, C. Janzen03, C. basoches, and C. Burns01, which were reared from wild-caught caterpillars by the biodiversity inventory of the rain forests of ACG in northwestern Costa Rica (janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso) (2932)were also examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig S3, the spot a3 (male, dorsal) always has the opposite reflection direction to a1 and a2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is inconsistency of spots a4 (male, ventral, Fig S4); whereas some showed bright white from the wing tip, others showed bright white from the wing base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the difference in locations of the white spots and the resulting optical properties on male and female Carystoides are adaptations to some aspect of courtship and both interspecific and intraspecific recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unique_Hierarchical_Scales_at_the_White_Spots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reveal the morphology of the various white spots, we first characterized the scales at these locations macroscopically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For angle-independent white spots at wing tips (Fig 3 A and B) and antennae (Fig S5), the scales are laid down in stacks on the wing membrane much like the ones we typically see on butterfly wings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These scales have a high aspect ratio (AR = length/width) of 35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scales on angle-dependent white spots, however, have AR of 1 and stand vertically on the membrane with different scale angles (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closer examination of the scales on angle-independent white spots shows micrometer-sized periodic ridges with micropores in-between (Fig 3C and Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scales on the angle-dependent white spots, on the other hand, are undulated like ripples, consisting of periodic ridges and ribs that are perpendicular to the ridges on both sides of the scale (Fig 3F; see definitions in Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 3D topography profile of the scale obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig S6), the periodicity and height of the ridges are 2 m and 400500 nm, respectively, and the periodicity and the height of the ribs are 165 and 50100 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the scale membrane is ultrathin, 150 nm (Fig 3F, Inset), and has low AR (AR of 1, estimated from the optical image in Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such structure seems to provide a stiff lightweight scale that resists gravity and alleviates aerodynamic stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the full-scale observation on different white spots, we categorize the standing scales into three types as summarized in Fig 4A, including wavy scales (type A), lightly curled scales (type B), and highly curled scales, like cut-out cones (type C) with different tilting angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig S2, the tilting angle of the scales, marked as scale angle , indicates the intersection angle from the normal direction of wing membrane to the central axis of the scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is set as positive if the scale tilts toward the wing tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values from angle-dependent white spots were obtained and summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all scales on the male Carystoides escalantei wings are wavy (type A), whereas those on the female Carystoides escalantei wings are curved (type B and type C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the scale angle decreases from the wing tip to the wing base on both male and female butterflys forewings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the dorsal side, the scales typically stand vertically on the wing membrane with smaller , whereas those on the ventral side tend to have a larger .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the scale of a3 (male, dorsal) is tilted to a negative angle (e.g., 15° as shown in Fig 4Biii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the scale is tilted to the opposite direction of the scale holder at the root (see Insets and red arrows in Fig 4B), and  varies from specimen to specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, why do they present such different scale angles?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tilting angle of follicle and scale root are all 45° and scales start to bend at the connection between the root and the main scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hypothesis is that the variety of scale angles is the response of the standing scales to the airflow across the surface of the wing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 4C, the scales on the dorsal side could be pushed up by the airflow when the wing is flapping up because the airflow direction (from wing tip to wing base) is against the scale tilting direction (from wing base to wing tip).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the wing is flapping down, scales are pushed down because the airflow is in the same direction as the tilted scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the push of airflow gradually increases in the direction of airflow (see bold arrows in Fig 4C), the scale angle decreases when the airflow is against the scales tilting direction but increases when the airflow follows the scales tilting direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain why the scales of a3 (male, dorsal) tilt to the opposite side of the scale holder because there should be stronger airflow near the wing base region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the scale angles of a4 on the hind wings of male Carystoides escalantei vary from species to species (Table 1), which is consistent with their optical appearance on the wings (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe it may be attributed to the complex airflow on the hindwing created by the flapping of both forewing and hindwing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typically, whiteness is the result of scattering by random microstructures (Fig 3C) accompanied by no pigment or dye beneath the scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the size of the features of the structures on the scales decreases to submicrometer sizes and becomes more regular (Fig S4 A and B), the scattering is decreased and whiteness becomes the result of mixing multiple grating colors as appears to be the case in the standing scales with angle-dependent white spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen under the optical microscope at the microscale, a1 (male, dorsal) appeared as purple head-on from the standing scales (Fig 3D) but multicolored when viewed from the scale surface (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purple color could be attributed to the interference of the periodic nanoribs (see schematics in Fig 3Gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this is the prediction from multibeam interference (see detailed discussion in Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe the multicolors to be the combination of thin film interference at air/scale membrane, air/(membrane + rib) and air/(membrane + ridge) interfaces of different thicknesses (see schematics in Fig 3Gii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the prediction shown in Supporting Information (Table S1) and further supported when we put a thin poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) film in contact with the bottom side of the scale and the bright color was lost (see the dark region in Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be attributed to the decreased refractive index contrast, where air is replaced with PDMS, and thus decreasing the overall interference intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also consistent with the observed angle dependence of the white spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enhanced_Retro-Reflection_on_Angle-Dependent_White_Spots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the angle-dependent whiteness at a single scale level, we used backscattering, reflection probe (Fig 2E, Inset), and fiber spectrometer to characterize the reflection of the white spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5A presents the retro-reflection intensity of two typical white spots with  = 15° (a3, male, dorsal) and 40° (a1, female, ventral), respectively, at the incident light of 550 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scale with  = 40°, the reflection is the highest at the detecting angle  = 50°, reaching the specular reflection angle (), that is,  = .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scale with  = 15°, the reflection also increases when  is approaching the specular reflection angle ( = 75°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At  = 0°, the reflection intensity is high for both scales, which we think is mainly due to the specular reflection from the wing membrane, whereas for the angle-independent white spot (c1, male, dorsal), the reflection intensity is low and the distribution is rather broad (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retro-reflection intensity of the angle-dependent spot a1 at the specular reflection angle is comparable to that of the traditional retro-reflection materials such as the glass microbead array (Fig S7), although the latter has uniform intensity across the angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the intensity contrast (Ihighest/Ilowest) of a1 ( = 40°), 10, is much higher than that of c1, 2.64, whereas the intensity contrast of the glass microbead array is 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of high angle dependence and high intensity contrast leads to the brilliant white appearance of white spots at a1a4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the relationship of the reflection intensity and tilting angles without the optical influence from the wing membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we used an optical microscope coupled with a fiber spectrometer to obtain optical microscopy images (Fig 5B) and reflection intensity of several scales at different  (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On spot a3 (male, dorsal) with a scale angle  = 15°, when tilting the wing to increase the detecting angle (here  = ), the scale color changed from purple (at scale edge) to bright multicolors (at the scale surface), similar to that seen in Fig 3 D and H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better summarize the shiny directions of white spots with different scale angles, here we introduced the specular reflection angle , which is the intersection angle from the specular reflection direction of the scale to the normal plane of the wing membrane (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the geometric relationship shown in Fig S8,  =  + 2   when  is positive, and  =  + 2   when  is negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because light can only be shown and viewed from one side of the wing membrane,  and  are limited to 90    90° and 90°    90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the measured scale angles  in Table 1, we plotted the distribution of  as seen in Fig 5D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scales with   0°,  is mainly in the bottom-left region of the  coordinates, but at  = 15° it shifts to the up-right region (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the tilted scales are retro-reflective and the reflection light only can be observed in the opposite direction of the scale tilting direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted line  =  represents the incident light in the normal direction of the scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated values shown in Fig 5D are in good agreement with the experimental observation in Fig 5 A and C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Speculation_on_the_Biological_Functions_of_the_White_Spots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given different kinds of whiteness on Carystoides wings, it is natural to ask how does the Carystoides habitat select for wing scale structure and thus the difference in the appearance of the white coloration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carystoides escalantei appears dark with some notable white spots that seem to flicker on and off during flight, presumably because of change in the angle of vision to the observer as the wings move up and down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white spots do not signal aposematism (bad tastes or venom), but they increase the visibility of the butterfly to some observers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white spots on antennae and wing tips could be used for interspecific or intraspecific visual recognition, and also the white spots on the antennae may be signaling, when the butterfly is waving its antennae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the dark/white system has high contrast, it can be well recognized even at a low light intensity and by color-blind species, for example, in the late evening (dusk) and early morning hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, color-sensitive receiving systems, which are common in butterflies with pigments or structural colors, do not work well for identification or warning at such a low light environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the dark/white visual system is highly efficient, with low energy consumption for delivering and receiving information using a single kind of eye receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white patterns on Carystoides probably evolved over the long term in the dark rainforest understory (where its caterpillar hosts, palms, also live).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is striking that the angle-dependent white spots show strong bright reflection at a particular low angle (seen in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright white against the dark wings will constitute a complex blur and onoffon visual vocabulary among individuals of both sexes when in flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits well with the environment at dusk or dawn with its low light intensity and low sunlight illumination angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like many startlingly bright colors (e.g., red, yellow, and blue) as patches and stripes on butterfly wings, the white spots are hidden when a butterfly or moth is resting with its wings folded, but displayed when in flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their function is to hold the pursuit image of a predator and yet abruptly disappear when the moth or butterfly lands on a generally nondescript background and folds its wings, thereby leading the predator to think that the insect has left the scene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white spots on the wings of Carystoides may be functioning in this role, as well as in courtship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another apparent feature of the white spots in Carystoides escalantei is that male and female butterflies have different numbers and locations of the white spots, and thus different optical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the white spot on the underside of the hindwing is conspicuously present on the male Carystoides escalantei but appears tiny and residual on the female hindwing underside (Fig 1E vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is either part of his courtship display or allows the female to recognize him as a male, or both, when males fly or perch on a twig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sexes displayed conspicuous white spots on their forewings, but the location and sequence are different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The male Carystoides escalantei shows a 21 pattern (see a1 to a3 in Fig 1) from the tip to base, whereas the female Carystoides escalantei shows a 12 pattern, with another small spot near the lower edge of the forewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex recognition could also come from the different sequence of the white spots on the forewings, which will generate different blurry white lines in flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure and optical characterization showed that spot a3 (male, dorsal) had the opposite scale tilting angle and retro-reflection direction (Fig 2 and Fig 5D) in comparison with the spots a1, a2 on male, dorsal wing, or a1, a2, a3 on female, dorsal wing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we speculate in Fig 4, the main possibility to form opposite tilting scales on spot a3 (male, dorsal) was the push force of airflow when Carystoides flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the evolution of these traits, Carystoides may recognize spot a3 (male, dorsal) for courtship and malemale antagonism interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
White spots on the wings of the skipper butterfly Carystoides escalantei differ intersexually in number and location, and intrasexually in the constancy and variability of their whiteness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of white spots, angle dependent (dull or bright) and angle independent, appear on both male and female wings, but differ from each other in the microstructure, orientation, and associated properties of their scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scales of angle-independent spots are long, flat against the wing membrane, and stacked atop one another; each has micrometer-sized periodic ridges with micropores between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the scales of angle-dependent spots are vertical and variably tilted; and numerous closely set and slightly curved thin ribs are perpendicular to periodic ridges formed by overlapping segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whiteness appears to be a mixing of grating colors coming from the hierarchical structure and the tilting of the scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angle-dependent scales enhance retro-reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright vs. dull aspect of whiteness depends on whether the more or less vertically oriented scales are observed from the direction of the wing base or the wing tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale structure also relates to differing airflow at the wing base vs. wing tip as the wing moves up and down during flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis may catalyze the development of materials mimicking structural whiteness for use in sensing and in displays with low energy consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evolution of the two kinds of white spots, one of which brightens when viewed at certain angles, is probably an adaptation to the dusky period of butterfly activity combined with the shady habitat of Carystoides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the spots may function in communicative behavior such as camouflage, species and sex recognition, competition, and courtship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carystoides butterflies, including Carystoides escalantei [now known to be two extremely similar sympatric species, one undescribed (29)], Carystoides hondura, Carystoides Janzen03, Carystoides basoches, and Carystoides Burns01, were reared from wild-caught caterpillars by the biodiversity inventory of the rain forests of ACG in northwestern Costa Rica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologies of the wing scales of C. escalantei were characterized by a field emission high-resolution scanning electron microscope (FEI Strata DB235) operated at 5.0 kV after sputter coating of a thin layer of gold/palladium (Au/Pd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale tilting angles were measured by tilting the sample stage in the scanning electron microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical microscopy images were taken by an Olympus BX 61 in the reflection mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface topography of the scales, which were picked up by a 1-mm-thick PDMS film, were imaged by AFM (Bruker Icon) using a Si3N4 cantilever in the tapping mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angle-resolved reflection spectra were collected from a USB4000 fiber optical spectrometer (Ocean Optics) with home-built rotating stage, or connected to an optical microscope (BX 61; Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 illustrates the definition of incident angle , detecting angle , and specular reflection angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These angles are marked as positive if they move toward the wing tip side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

According to multiple-beam interference, the reflection peak wavelength of periodic structures under vertical illumination could be predicted as follows:=2dneff,[S1]where d is the interplanar spacing and neff is the effective refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, d is the spacing between nanoribs and d = 165 nm, whereas neff could be calculated from the following:neff=nairair+nribrib,[S2]where nair = 1 and nrib = 1.6, considering the component of ribs is chitin, whereas the air and rib are the volume-filling fractions of air and ribs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, based on the results in Fig S6B, we believe the volume-filling fractions of air and ribs are very close to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we assume air = rib = 0.5, so neff = 1.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the reflection peak appears at 429 nm, which is consistent with the purple color seen in Fig 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 3Gii, there are several types of thin films, including pure scale membrane, membrane and ribs, and membrane and ridges with thickness as h1, h2, and h3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to AFM (Fig S6) and SEM (Fig 3F), h1 = 150 nm, h2 = 200250 nm, and h3 = 550650 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the incident light is vertical to the thin film, the reflection peak wavelength  is predicted as follows:m=2nh±/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]Here, n = 1.6 and m indicates the order of interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated reflection peaks are summarized in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple peaks should occur in the visible region (391462, 428533, 502594), and near IR (704832 nm), in agreement with the observation of multicolors in the visible region as seen in Fig 3 H and I, and in the UV region (320 nm and 320378 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
