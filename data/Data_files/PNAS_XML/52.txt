Producing desired ice faces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The molecular-level structure of icebonding patterns, binding sites, and molecular mobilityis difficult to probe experimentally due to challenges preparing faces of neat ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach is to grow ice on a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ice is held together by hydrogen bonds; a substrate perturbs the connections and radically alters the surface properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work shows how to quantitatively specify orientation of the ice lattice with respect to a surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, based on recent success growing large single crystals, it shows how to prepare any desired face from the initial crystal surface orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A general procedure for preparing any arbitrary face is described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure is used to prepare all three major faces from various initial orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to prepare single-crystal faces has become central to developing and testing models for chemistry at interfaces, spectacularly demonstrated by heterogeneous catalysis and nanoscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability has been hampered for hexagonal ice, Iha fundamental hydrogen-bonded surfacedue to two characteristics of ice: ice does not readily cleave along a crystal lattice plane and properties of ice grown on a substrate can differ significantly from those of neat ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work describes laboratory-based methods both to determine the Ih crystal lattice orientation relative to a surface and to use that orientation to prepare any desired face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work builds on previous results attaining nearly 100% yield of high-quality, single-crystal boules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these methods, researchers can prepare authentic, single-crystal ice surfaces for numerous studies including uptake measurements, surface reactivity, and catalytic activity of this ubiquitous, fundamental solid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Crystal_Lattice_Orientation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most stable form of ice at atmospheric pressure is hexagonal ice, Ih, in reference to the hexagonal prism crystal structure: a structure that gives rise to familiar hexagonal snowflakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determining the crystal orientation with respect to any starting surface begins with location of the major and minor hexagonal axes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major axis is the prism axis, labeled the c axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The face perpendicular to the c axis is called the basal face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c axis and the surface normal define a plane, called the surface-normal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface-normal plane and the basal face locate the minor axis as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three equivalent axes in the hexagonal basal face; these connect pairs of opposite apexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these is nearest to the surface-normal plane; this is the minor axis referred to in this work, simply labeled the a axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c- and a axes specify orientation of the ice hexagonal prism relative to the surface via two angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is the angle between the surface normal and the c axis, labeled as  and referred to as the tilt angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tilt angles range from 0° to 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second angle locates the a axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface-normal plane intersects the basal face in a line; the angle between the a axis and this intersection line is defined as the roll angle, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roll angles range from 30° to +30°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The face perpendicular to the a axis is called a secondary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The face ±30° from the secondary prism face is called a primary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal, primary prism, and secondary prism faces are the three major faces of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growing ice from a polycrystalline seed might be expected to produce random lattice orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growing ice front is preserved in the frozen boule, so cutting a cross-section perpendicular to the growth direction reveals the growth face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c axis is observed to be strongly tilted away from the growth direction; the tilt is most often greater than 65°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there is a bias favoring secondary prism face growth ( near zero).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with previously reported growth (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reflect the interlayer entropic advantage of the prism faces over the basal face and the slight entropic advantage of the secondary prism face relative to that of the primary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determining_Tilt_and_Roll_Angles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystal orientation was determined via two methods: (A) cross-section etching (13) and (B) locating the c axis followed by a basal face etch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Method A: Both tilt and roll can be determined from the surface etch pit profile;  is typically determined to ±5°,  to ±3°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Etching consists of cutting a flat section and coating the surface with a thin polymer film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water and the etching solvent evaporate through pin holes in the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pointed out by Furukawa and Kohata (22), evacuation of water from the bulk of an ice crystal produces a negative crystal (2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the surface, evaporation produces a negative crystal that is truncated, called an etch pit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key etch pit property is that the profile is constant as it grows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reading  and  from the pit profile requires connecting the tilt and roll angles of the partially submerged hexagonal prism with ratios of pit-profile lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous publication (13) has shown a schematic relationship between an etch pit profile and a cut through the hexagonal prism; another locates points within the pit to define lengths (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the etch pits in Fig 3 show, locating points within the pits is challenging, producing large angle determination uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more exact measurement is required to produce a quantitative measurement and use the macroscopicmicroscopic relationship to expose any desired face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide a closed-form, analytical connection between a cross-section etch pit profile and the angles  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most frequently observed profile is typified by that in Fig 3A: the trapezium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 B and C is typical of those observed for  near 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 illustrates the connection between the etch pit profile and the crystal lattice for a trapezium profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like all etch pits, a trapezium results from a surface cut through the hexagonal prism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trapezium contains a partially submerged basal and three adjacent primary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three primary prism faces are arrayed top to bottom in the photomicrograph shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 B and C shows a simulation of (B) the hexagonal prism embedded in the surface and (C) lifted out leaving a pit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three geometric pit perimeter features from pitsurface intersections are used to determine ratios from which  and  are calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The features are as follows: (i) The intersection of the surface plane and the upper primary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersection cuts this primary face all of the way to its junction with the partially submerged basal face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The surfaceplane intersection with the middle primary prism face; this cuts a corner of the middle primary prism face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the upper and middle primary prism face cuts plus the surface plane meet at the apex of a triangle; this triangle is used in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third primary prism face is observed from above at an acute angle, thus is barely visible at the lower edge of the middle primary prism face (shown submerged with the dotted line in Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The surface plane intersection with the basal face defines a line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perpendicular to this intersection line (line h in Fig 4A) that meets the apex subdivides both the apex angle and the basal face intersection line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These geometric objects along with hexagonal prism geometry reveal the tilt and roll angles via three parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance from the intersection line to the apex, labeled h in Fig 4, is the common height of two triangles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypotenuses are formed by straight lines tracing the surface cuts through the primary prism face (extended if necessary) to the basal face intersection line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypotenuses intersect the basal face surface intersection defining the triangle bases, A2 and A3 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three parameters A2, A3, and h are used to calculate  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The keys for decoding the etch pit profile lay in the geometry of the Ih hexagonal prism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prism faces meet at 120° angles; prism faces meet the capping basal faces at 90° angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partially exposed basal face is shown on the left-hand side of Fig 4A; Fig 5 shows a schematic face-normal view of this face with corresponding distances marked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trigonometry indicates that both A2 and A3 are proportional to the etch depth, d. The depth is removed via a ratio:A2d=tan(60°+);A3d=tan(60°);R=A2A3=tan(60°+)tan(60°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]Applying the sum angle formula yields :=arctan{(b2+1)(R+1)±(b2+1)2(R+1)24(R1)2b22b(R1)},[2]where b = tan 60°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that for R = 1 ( = 0°) Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 is not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However,  = 0° is readily apparent because then A2 = A3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, if  = ±30°, tan (60°+30°) is not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again,  = ±30° is readily apparent from etch pit symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For || 30°, the roll angle is more accurately determined from the basal face etch, Method B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The apex angle is unchanged as the etch pit develops because the profile is connected to the crystal lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It reveals the tilt, :=arccos{(A2+A3)/htan(60°+)+tan(60°)}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]Method A is readily applied to any etch pit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its accuracy depends on accuracy in tracing the etch pit perimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the uncertainty is ±5° for  and ±3° for .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Method B: This method is more accurate, but requires two cuts through the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It uses the birefringence of ice and a basal face etch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice is birefringent due to lower packing density along the c axis compared with that perpendicular to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Placed between crossed polarizers, ice is dark only when the c axis is in the plane of polarization (plane formed by the polarization direction and the line-of-sight between the polarizers) of one or both of the polarizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, placing the cylindrical boule between crossed polarizers with the boule axis in a polarization plane produces an extinction event when the c axis is rotated into that polarization plane (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extinction consists of a dark band flanked by rainbows that are due to light refraction at the curved boule sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this extinction band, rotating the boule 90° on axis orients the c axis in the plane formed by the two polarization axes; rotating within this plane produces a whole-boule dark extinction (Fig 6B) when the c axis is collinear with either polarization axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Fig 6B the polarization axes are shown in blue: one horizontal, the other vertical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At whole-boule extinction, the c axis is either horizontal or vertical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Choosing between these alternatives hinges on results from equilibrium growth (18):  is always greater than 45°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the c axis for the boule shown in Fig 6B is vertical and the angle between it and the growth directionthe white arrowis 80.5°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extinction is quite distinct;  is typically determined to within 1°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the c axis accurately located, the boule is rotated to put the c axis in the horizontal plane, and then rotated within the plane to bring the c axis perpendicular to the cutting plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produces a basal face cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roll is then accurately determined via etching the cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7A shows a typical basal profile; all edges are uniformly dark, indicating that the six primary prism face bounding sides are viewed edge-on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonuniform thickening indicates an error in the basal face cut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-section was cut oriented with the c-axis, boule-axis plane horizontal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, measure the roll angle (Fig 8) by connecting the two proximal hexagonal apexes and measuring the angle between this line and the horizontal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c axis is directed into the paper, so positive  has the right-hand point below the horizontal, negative  above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roll angle  is determined (typically ±1°) from a basal face etch pit profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-crystal ice boules [2.5-cm diameter, 610-cm-long cylinder (18)] were grown from the melt using a modified Bridgeman technique under strict temperature control with a growth rate equal to 96 nm·s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeding ensures near-equilibrium growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growing front temperature was held at 0 °C ±2 mK using proportional-integral-differential control, a ubiquitous industrial control technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After growth, the boule was extracted and cooled to 18 °C, a cross-section cut, the surface smoothed with a microtome (American Optical Rotary model 820 Microtome) and rendered microscopically flat by self-annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Formvar (Ladd Research) solution (13) was used to produce etch pits (imaged with a Meiji ML9300 microscope) and a crossed-polarizer stage used to locate the optical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports (18), the optical axis is tilted more than 45° with respect to the growing icewater interface normal (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a slight bias toward near 0° roll.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Face_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the tilt and roll angles have been identified, cutting a targeted face consists of orienting the face-normal perpendicular to the cutting plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful face production is determined by smoothing, self-annealing, and etching (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faces are identified based on their etch pit profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 shows the etch pit profile produced using Method B for (A) basal, (B) primary prism, and (C) secondary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All etch pits are bounded by basal and primary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal face etch pit is bounded from below by a basal face and on the six sides by primary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary face etch pits are bounded from below by two adjacent primary prism faces and on the two ends by basal faces that are cut by the surface plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary prism face etch pits are a bit more involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are bounded from below by a primary prism face flanked by two adjacent primary prism faces and capped on the ends by basal faces that are cut by the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pit perimeter is rectangular and the darker sides are due to primary prism faces viewed at a 30° angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger pits have an octagonal perimeter (one is shown in Fig 7B, Left Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that a higher index face is close in energy to the basal and primary prism faces, consistent with previously reported (26) pyramidal faces developed on evaporating, isolated, micrometer-sized hexagonal prisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These etch pit photomicrographs demonstrate that the solidair interface consists of basal and primary prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the growth record data (Fig 2) show that the solidliquid interface is dominated by prism and pyramidal faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Traditionally, a hexagonal lattice is described with four lattice vectors: the prism axis, c, and three vectors through alternate hexagonal points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, producing desired faces is greatly facilitated via rotation matrices; using rotation matrices is aided through use of orthogonal coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the following coordinate system is used: c is the optical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The a axis is orthogonal to c and runs through a hexagonal vertex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third axis, b, is orthogonal to c and a such that b-a-c forms a right-handed coordinate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like hexagonal coordinates, in this coordinate system the c axis is normal to the basal face, in hexagonal coordinates designated the {0001} face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The a axis is one of the three hexagonal a axes; it is normal to a secondary prism face {112¯ 0}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The b axis is orthogonal to the other two and normal to a primary prism face {11¯ 00}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutting a selected face begins with defining the selected face-normal in this orthogonal coordinate system: the basal face {001}, the primary prism face {100}, and the secondary prism face {010}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tilt and roll angles specify the relationship between the orthogonal axes and the specimen axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Bridgeman-grown ice, the boule axis is the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the boule cross-section is circular, x and y are equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutting instructions are given with respect to the laboratory frame: Z is the cutting direction, X-Z the cutting plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orient the boule so that the boule and laboratory axes are coincident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the tilt and roll angles specify location of the crystal b-a-c axes:b=Xcos+Ysincos+Zsinsin,[4]a=-Xsin+Ycoscos+Zcossin,[5]c=-Ysin+Zcos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These relationships can be visualized by starting with coincident crystal lattice and X, Y, Z axes then applying the rotation matrix:(cossincossincossincoscoscossin0sincos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This leads to the interpretation of  as the tilt angle and  as the roll angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Armed with these coordinates, the key to producing any desired ice face is identifying the face-normal and positioning it perpendicular to the X-Z cutting plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two rotations are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One consists of rotation about the sample surface normalfor Bridgeman-grown ice this is the boule axisby an angle  to bring the face-normal axis into the Y-Z plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is rotation about the X axis by an angle  to position the face-normal perpendicular to the X-Z cutting plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These operations correspond to applying the rotation matrix:(cossin0cossincoscossinsinsinsincoscos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [8]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The face-normal is antiparallel to the Y axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solve for the angles  and  that result in a zero value for the X and Z coordinate of the face-normal vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the laboratory, use crossed-polarizer examination to position the c axis in the Y/+Z quadrant of the Y-Z plane by locating the stripe extinction event, then rotating the boule 90° about its axis and determining if whole-boule extinction occurs for 045° rotation in the plane of the polarizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If not, return to stripe extinction and rotate 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tilt angle  is equal to 90° minus the in-plane rotation required to produce whole-boule extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To produce a basal face, locate the c axis in the Y-Z plane, then rotate about the X axis by 90°  .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Producing prism faces also begins with locating the c axis in the Y-Z plane, then rotating about the boule axis by=180°+arctan{tan(+)cos},[9]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where  = 0 for a secondary prism face and ±30° for a primary face (+ for  less_than 0,  for   0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the X rotation is=arctan{costan}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [10]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that if  = 90° then  is not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the secondary prism face is generated by rotating about the boule axis by ±90° and about the X axis by 90°  if   0 or less_than 0, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a primary prism face is generated via a boule axis rotation of ±90° followed by an X axis rotation of 60° for  less_than 0 or   0, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that the truncated negative-crystal etch pit formed at a surface can be used to analytically determine the ice lattice hexagonal orientation with respect to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation is characterized by two angles: the angle between the optical axis and the surface normal, , and a roll angle, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roll angle is the angle between the a axis and the line of intersection between the surface-normal c-axis plane and the basal face plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two orientation angles enable manipulation of the sample to successfully cut any desired ice face from any starting surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we have demonstrated the technique by cutting the major faces of ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainty in angle measurement is determined from the accuracy for cutting these three faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously published work using cross-section etches has shown that the ice prism faces are lower energy than the basal face at the icewater interface (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, etch pit profiles show that the basal and primary prism faces are the most stable iceair interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contrasting observations emphasize the need to probe dynamics and interactions at the so far neglected prism faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here provide the tools necessary to prepare either prism faceor any other desired faceof ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
