Geometry-induced capillary emptying  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present a precise mathematical criterion that determines whether the liquid in a capillary of arbitrary cross-section will remain in it or will flow out when the capillary is at a horizontal position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rich phenomenology found can be used to construct very sensitive microfluidics devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When a capillary is half-filled with liquid and turned to the horizontal, the liquid may flow out of the capillary or remain in it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For lack of a better criterion, the standard assumption is that the liquid will remain in a capillary of narrow cross-section, and will flow out otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a precise mathematical criterion that determines which of the two outcomes occurs for capillaries of arbitrary cross-sectional shape, and show that the standard assumption fails for certain simple geometries, leading to very rich and counterintuitive behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens the possibility of creating very sensitive microfluidic devices that respond readily to small physical changes, for instance, by triggering the sudden displacement of fluid along a capillary without the need of any external pumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emptying  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is common experience that when a wide container, like a cylindrical glass, is partially filled with liquid and tilted slowly to the horizontal, the liquid spills out, and the glass inevitably empties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if the container is narrow enough, like a drinking straw, the liquid remains in the container even in the horizontal position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For lack of a better criterion, the standard assumption is that the liquid will remain in a capillary of narrow cross-section and will flow out otherwise, but can one provide a definite answer that takes into account the cross-sectional shape of the capillary?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we turn to macroscopic thermodynamics, which states that the liquid adopts the shape that minimizes the total free energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energy has three terms, each dependent on the shape  of the meniscus:E[]/=AcosS+G/a2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]Here,  is the surface tension of the liquidgas interface and  is the contact angle (indicative of the affinity of the liquid toward the solid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capillary length a=/g is defined in terms of the mass density difference between the liquid and the gas , and the gravitational acceleration g; for pure water at room temperature, a2.7mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional dependence of the free energy on the meniscus shape  enters through three geometrical quantities: the area of the meniscus A, the surface area of the container walls in contact with the liquid S, and the position of the center of mass of the fluid multiplied by its volume G. The equilibrium shape of the fluid can be obtained from minimization of [1], which amounts to balancing the three competing terms, subject to a constant volume condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be done formally and leads to the renowned YoungLaplace equation for , which must be solved requiring the meniscus to touch the container walls at an angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, obtaining the shape of the liquid meniscus is a very demanding task in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite enormous efforts (16), hardly any analytical solutions to the YoungLaplace equation are known, except for simple containers without gravity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we concentrate on the solutions to this equation when the container is a horizontal capillary of arbitrary cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These show a number of remarkable features:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Computing the emptying line by the direct numerical determination of 3D menisci is impracticable due to the critical nature of capillary emptying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid this, we have devised an exact reduction of the problem: Instead of minimizing the 3D functional [1] subject to a constant volume constraint, we minimize a 2D functional defined for the cross-section of the capillary but with variable volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physically, this functional represents the energy cost per unit length of a translationally invariant meniscus that extends along the horizontal capillary (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimizing 2D shape corresponds to the section of the (arbitrarily long) 3D meniscus that prompts the emptying of the capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically, this method represents a physically motivated generalization of the pioneering work of Finn on capillaries without gravity (16), and is ultimately based on the recent application of generalized Poincaré inequalities to functions of bounded variation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When this method is applied to a capillary with a circular cross-section of radius R, the simple emptying line of Fig 1 is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this, we see that any circular capillary, made of any material and containing any liquid, whose radius is larger than 3a, will empty in the horizontal position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, any circular capillary whose radius is smaller than a will remain filled in that position, irrespective of the contact angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in a narrow range of sizes aless_thanRless_than3a does the contact angle  (i.e., the choice of liquid and capillary material) exert an influence on the final outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is similar to what happens to a liquid confined in a horizontal capillary slit made of two parallel walls, which is essentially a 2D phenomenon (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results roughly confirm the intuitive idea that wide capillaries empty and narrow capillaries remain filled when turned to the horizontal, the reality is very different for capillaries with noncircular cross-sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fig 2 shows the emptying line for capillaries whose cross-sections are ellipses of semiaxes R and bR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emptying line is computed for progressively more eccentric ellipses and for two different orientations (portrait and landscape-like), which illustrate the extremely sensitive interplay between the different energetic contributions in [1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two features emerge that are worth emphasizing: (i) For sufficiently eccentric capillaries (b greater than b1.635), the emptying line touches the line R/a=0 at contact angles (b) and 180°(b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that, contrary to intuition, those capillaries will empty if the contact angle  is smaller than (b) or larger than 180°(b), no matter how small they are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The line R/a=0 also represents the limit of vanishing gravity and, therefore, any result for that line is necessarily independent of the orientation of the capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) For landscape-like elliptical cross-sections (Fig 2), the emptying line is divided into sections corresponding to different emptying mechanisms with distinct meniscus shapes, including those that spread along the sides of the capillary rather than its bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the common point of two adjacent sections, two different (yet equivalent) emptying mechanisms coexist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These common points need to be the starting points of lines of coexisting solutions in the filled region, which the present 2D-reduction approach cannot describe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these features represent a radical departure from the simple case of the circular capillary, where emptying is essentially determined by the size R (wide or narrow containers), and there is only a single emptying mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional features also emerge when capillary cross-sections with edges are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fig 3 shows the emptying lines of a horizontal capillary of triangular cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of an opening angle  in the cross-section of the capillary gives rise to a distinct emptying mechanism that takes place close to the corner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any capillary with such an angle will empty for less_than(180°)/2 and  greater than (180°+)/2, no matter how small the cross-section is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this phenomenon, closely related to wedge filling (21), has already been described in the absence of gravity (22), we see here that, quite unexpectedly, it extends unaltered to appreciable values of the gravitational field (dashed red lines) that depend on the geometrical details of the capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approaching these vertical sections of the emptying line, the meniscus does not develop a tongue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the vanishing of the meniscus cross-section on approaching the points A in Fig 3 along the (blue) emptying line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, upon crossing these vertical sections of the emptying line, the capillary will simply empty because all of the liquid in the capped end will flow out along the wedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been observed in experiments at zero gravity (corresponding to R/a=0) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note also that, as the cross-section of this triangular capillary lacks symmetry under 180° rotations, the emptying line is no longer symmetric about =90°, as it was in the previous examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the exception of the vertical sections of the emptying line that appear in capillaries with edges, the 3D meniscus develops a tongue that grows in size whenever an emptying line is approached from the filled region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be achieved in a number of ways: changing the contact angle [for instance, varying the temperature or using electrowetting (18, 23)], changing the gravitational acceleration (24), or simply rotating the capillary around its axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, a number of microfluidic devices can be constructed (including, for instance, those with immiscible fluids or other coexisting phases that could play the role of liquid and gas) that exploit the sharp change in the meniscus shape in response to very small physical changes, for instance, by triggering the sudden displacement of fluid along the capillary without the need of any external pressure, or by increasing the meniscus area for catalytic purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we focus here only on equilibrium properties, contact angle hysteresis has not been addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, earlier experimental studies in zero gravity indicate that even in the presence of large contact angle hysteresis, the meniscus behavior is consistent with the discontinuities predicted by the mathematical solution of the idealized YoungLaplace theory (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the dynamics of capillary emptying, note that, in the growth of the tongue, the front and rear of the meniscus will be characterized by the advancing and receding contact angles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further consequences of capillary emptying could also be envisaged for the localization of fluids in porous media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equation_for_the_Emptying_Line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_YoungLaplace_Equation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The free energy of a liquid droplet in a capillary can be written as the following functional of the meniscus shape :E[]/=AcosS+G/a2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]Here,  is the liquidgas surface tension,  is the contact angle of the liquid with the capillary material, and a=/g is the capillary length, defined in terms of the mass density difference between the liquid and the gas , and the gravitational acceleration g. The functional dependence of the free energy on the meniscus shape  enters through three geometrical quantities: the area of the meniscus A, the surface area of the container walls in contact with the liquid S, and the position of the center of mass of the fluid multiplied by its volume G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In turn, the equilibrium shape of the liquid drop is obtained from minimization of E[], subject to the condition that the liquid volume V is fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the functional to be minimized isF[]=AcosS+G/a2+V,[S2]where  is the Lagrange multiplier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an appropriate choice of coordinates (Fig S1), the meniscus can be represented as a function (x,y) and the above terms can be written for a horizontal capillary:A=dxdy1+()2,S=ds,G=dxdy(xsin+ycos),V=dxdy,[S3]where  represents the cross-section of the capillary, and  its perimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A formal minimization of [S2] produces the YoungLaplace equation:(1+()2)=1a2(xsin+ycos)+,[S4]together with the boundary condition that the angle formed by the meniscus with the capillary walls must be  at all points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In physical terms, the left side of this equation is (twice) the mean curvature of the meniscus at each point which, in the absence of gravity (a), needs to be a constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lagrange multiplier  is itself determined by the constant volume condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for capillaries (containers with a constant cross-section),  is independent of the volume of liquid, provided the meniscus does not touch the end cap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This follows immediately from integration of [S4] over , yielding=0cos0,[S5]where 0 is the area of the capillary cross-section, and 0 the length of its perimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In writing [S5], we have assumed that the origin of the coordinates x and y lies along the line of the center of mass of ; this choice means that  does not depend on the turning angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The independence of the Lagrange multiplier on volume implies that the meniscus shape is also independent of the volume of liquid, which is in accord with experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we assume that the length of the capillary and volume of liquid are effectively infinite, which prevents the uninteresting influence of finite size effects in our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emptying_Tongue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon approaching any point on the emptying line from the filled region, the meniscus will, in general, develop a tongue of length L which diverges when the emptying line is reached (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, because the total energy of the meniscus, given by [S1], is finite, the energy cost per unit length of this (in that limit, infinitely long) tongue must necessarily be zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the emptying line must correspond to the condition that there is a translationally invariant solution to [S4] with zero energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this condition applies even if no tongue develops: if there exists any translationally invariant solution to [S4] with negative energy, the total energy of the system, which must attain the minimum possible value, would decrease unboundedly by simply making a meniscus tongue with the shape of that solution progressively longer; if the total energy is negatively unbound, no meniscus shape exists that can hold the liquid in the capillary, and this must empty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emptying_Line  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existence of a translationally invariant solution to [S4] with zero energy may be formulated asminE2D[]=0,[S6]where E2D is a 2D reduction of the functional S2:E2D[]=A2DcosS2D+G2D/a2+V2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]This functional represents the energy of a 2D drop of liquid  placed inside the cross-section , in the grand canonical ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D drop  corresponds to the cross-section of the translationally invariant meniscus tongue, which is assumed to be of infinite length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In expression S7,  is still given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and therefore does not impose a constraint on the volume V2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in this interpretation, [S5] is a generalized Kelvin equation (25), and the value of  is essentially the pressure at which there is thermodynamic coexistence between two phases: capillary liquid (a completely full capillary) and capillary gas (a completely empty capillary).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above physical argument implies that there is no absolute minimum of the functional [S2] when the functional [S7] attains negative values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, sufficient condition for the non-existence of equilibrium solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that it is indeed a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonexistence of any solution of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 has been proved recently in the more mathematical context of functions of bounded variation by Obersnel et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that, owing to the symmetries of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, the emptying line is always symmetric about =90° for capillary cross-sections invariant under a 180° rotation (e.g., ellipses, rectangles,), and for any updown symmetric configuration (e.g., an equilateral triangle with a vertical side).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Numerical_Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain the emptying line for a given capillary geometry ( and ), we must solve Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 for each value of the contact angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we find first the minimum of [S7] for a given value of the capillary length a, and compute its energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emptying line corresponds to the value of a for which this energy is zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a deceptively difficult task for two main reasons:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(x)(1+(x)2)3/2=±1a2(xsin+cos)+,[S8]where the sign refers to the liquid being below (+) or above () the gas at the point (x,(x)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the presence of gravity precludes any analytical solution, and numerical methods must be adopted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, this equation is known to exhibit multiple solutions (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emptying line corresponds to the smallest value of the gravity acceleration (the largest value of a) for which Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 is verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the energies of two different solutions vanish for the same value of a, this means that there exist two equivalent (yet different) emptying mechanisms for the capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To solve these problems, we parametrize the perimeter of the capillary cross-section  with a variable t. Each value of the parameter t[,) refers to a unique point in the perimeter (x(t),y(t)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we define a function (t) as the value of [S7] that is obtained from integration of the drop equation starting at the point (x(t),y(t)) making the correct angle  with the capillary wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the initial point of integration and the derivative are known, the integration can be performed, akin to a shooting method, ending when the drop reaches another point on the wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the contact angle condition is not verified at this second point of contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the parameter t spans the entire perimeter, all drops satisfying the contact angle condition at both points of contact are necessarily included, and occur at specific values of t. These drops correspond to the stationary points of the functional E2D[], and appear as extrema of the function (t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that not every extremum of (t) corresponds necessarily to a stationary point of E2D[], with the exception of the global minimum of (t), which is a guaranteed minimizer of E2D[] and, indeed, its global minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What makes the phenomena of capillary emptying so rich is that solutions to the YoungLaplace equation may disappear abruptly, as pointed out by Finn (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the function (t) is discontinuous, and displays an extraordinary sensitivity to the capillary geometry and to changes of the variables  and a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated in Fig S3, where the two global minima of (t) represent different emptying mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
