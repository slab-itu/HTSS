Aggregation landscapes of Huntingtin exon 1 protein fragments and the critical repeat length for the onset of Huntingtons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formation of inclusion bodies is the pathological hallmark of Huntingtons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Huntingtin exon 1-encoded protein fragments aggregate in inclusion bodies, causing disease onset in a length-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using energy landscape theory, the critical length for disease onset is predicted to be between 30 and 40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion in the polyglutamine (polyQ) track of the Huntingtin (HTT) protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severity of the disease depends on the polyQ repeat length, arising only in patients with proteins having 36 repeats or more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that the aggregation of N-terminal fragments (encoded by HTT exon 1) underlies the disease pathology in mouse models and that the HTT exon 1 gene product can self-assemble into amyloid structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide detailed structural mechanisms for aggregation of several protein fragments encoded by HTT exon 1 by using the associative memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model (AWSEM) to construct their free energy landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the addition of the N-terminal 17-residue sequence (NT17) facilitates polyQ aggregation by encouraging the formation of prefibrillar oligomers, whereas adding the C-terminal polyproline sequence (P10) inhibits aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of both terminal additions in HTT exon 1 fragment leads to a complex aggregation mechanism with a basic core that resembles that found for the aggregation of pure polyQ repeats using AWSEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the extrapolated physiological concentration, although the grand canonical free energy profiles are uphill for HTT exon 1 fragments having 20 or 30 glutamines, the aggregation landscape for fragments with 40 repeats has become downhill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This computational prediction agrees with the critical length found for the onset of HD and suggests potential therapies based on blocking early binding events involving the terminal additions to the polyQ repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

N-Terminal_Region_Facilitates_the_Aggregation_of_17-20_Through_Forming_Prefibrillar_Oligomers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HTT exon 1 gene product contains a 17-aa N terminus (NT17) that is followed by the polyQ tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteolytic digestion of full-length HTT releases fragments that contain the NT17 terminus, polyQ repeats, and the following proline-rich segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fragments aggregate into a fiber form (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiment and simulation of simple polyQ peptides show that the aggregation proceeds through a classical nucleated growth polymerization mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous computations showed that the aggregation free energy landscape of Q20 at 300 K under experimental concentration (0.1 mM) leads to a critical nucleus of around three (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this section, we examine how the N-terminal addition affects aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A solved crystal structure of the HTT exon 1 gene product with 17 glutamine repeats fused with maltose binding protein shows that the NT17 segment becomes -helical (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NT17 tract has been shown to be critical for the formation of -helixrich oligomeric intermediates by Jayaraman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, first construct the aggregation free energy profile for six NT17-Q20 monomers in a simulation box at the nominal laboratory concentration of the study by Wetzel (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to constant temperature studies, we use umbrella sampling with the fraction of native contacts of the simulated fiber structure as the biasing coordinate to construct free energy profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1A, we can project the free energy landscape onto a 2D surface using the oligomer size and the number of interchain hydrogen bonds inside the six peptides as simultaneous progress variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the pure Q20 peptide, the aggregation propensity of NT17-Q20 is higher, greatly favoring the final fiber form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pure Q20, it is hard for the monomers to associate and cross the free energy barrier near the critical nucleus size of three (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This barrier, however, in NT17-Q20 aggregation has been eliminated by initially forming NT17-mediated oligomers with various sizes (structures IV and VI in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamine being amphiphilic, the linear association of pure polyQ peptides into their fiber form requires the formation of -hydrogen bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With help from the NT17-terminal addition, monomers associate first to form -helixmediated oligomers before forming amyloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After initial association, these oligomers undergo structural rearrangement toward the final fiber form (from structure VI to structure VI in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar sequence of events is also seen in the simulations for NT17-Q30 (SI Appendix, Fig S3) and NT17-Q40 (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the simulations within a finite box, the cache of monomers becomes depleted as clusters grow, an effect that is negligible in laboratory experiments that study the early phases in aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in our previous papers (9, 28), we adopt the Reiss physical cluster theory (30) as detailed in Methods to correct for this finite size effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grand canonical free energy profile, Fnn, becomes downhill at the nominal simulation concentration (0.1 mM) (purple line in Fig 1B), whereas at the same concentration, the profile for the pure polyQ peptide is uphill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change in slope agrees with experimental observations, indicating that NT17-Q20 peptides aggregate much more readily than pure Q20 peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is considerable evidence that the ratio of the concentration to the solubility limit plays a large role in aggregation in vitro (31) and perhaps, in vivo (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the concentration dependence of the free energy profiles to estimate solubility limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When extrapolated to 1 M, the aggregation free energy profile of the N-terminal constructs becomes uphill; in contrast, the profile becomes very downhill at high supersaturation (1 mM) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solubility of NT17-Q20 estimated from our calculation, therefore, is in the range from 1 to 10 M, agreeing with experimental evidence that peptides of a similar length, like NT17-Q15 and NT17-Q25, only slowly aggregate at a concentration of around 5 M (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetics of aggregation can be inferred using a diffusion picture based on the free energy profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plan to report on these results later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C-Terminal_Polyproline_Inhibits_the_Aggregation_of_20-10_Without_Altering_the_Aggregation_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proline-rich segments often follow the polyQ sequence in many proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases (17, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the NT17 peptide addition encourages aggregation, the proline-rich terminus at the C end inhibits aggregation (17, 3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To computationally address the effect of the proline-rich addition on the aggregation of HTT exon 1-encoded protein fragments, we determined the aggregation free energy profile of six Q20-P10 peptides in a simulation box at 300 K (nominal concentration of 0.1 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with what was found for pure Q20 peptides, the 2D free energy landscape using the size of the oligomer and the number of interchain hydrogen bonds as the reaction coordinates displays a more uphill trend as aggregation proceeds (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We visualized structures sampled in each oligomer basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyproline region generally remains an unstructured coil, whereas sometimes, a polyproline helix forms (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated with the structures in Fig 2, aggregation proceeds via linear addition of the Q20-P10 peptides to existing oligomers, very much like the aggregation mechanism observed for Q20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations for Q30-P10 and Q40-P10 peptides show a similar inhibition of aggregation by the C-terminal addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During aggregation, a free energy barrier of around 8kBT is encountered near the formation of a pentamer, suggesting that the critical nucleus size would be around five for this construct having only the polyproline tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After making the correction for the change in the concentration of free monomers in the simulation box, the free energy profiles then exhibit a barrier around the pentamer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only at a very high concentration of around 100 M does the profile become flat, suggesting that the solubility of the construct having only the proline-terminal addition is around 100 M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_Free_Energy_Landscape_of_Complete_17-20-10_Fragments_Reveals_a_Complex_Aggregation_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simulations suggest that the extended structure of the polyQ repeat is the preferred form of the monomer for constructs with the shorter polyQ repeats: Q20, NT17-Q20, Q20-P10, and NT17-Q20-P10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of the two termini does not significantly affect the preference of the repeat peptide to assume either a collapsed structure or an extended form in the monomer (SI Appendix, Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wish to remind the reader that, for all constructs, the thermal ensemble is rather broad as evidenced by the modest free energy barriers seen in their free energy profiles (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extended -strand structure and the -hairpin are not the only structures populated in the simulated ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, experiments of Baias et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37) also suggest that the NT17-Q17-P7 peptide with an His tag at the C terminus adopts an unstructured state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the N-terminal addition and the polyproline addition act in opposite ways on the aggregation propensity, we next examined the aggregation free energy profile for the full construct of 20 repeat forms with both additions, the NT17-Q20-P10 peptide, at an experimental concentration of 100 mM at 300 K. The 2D free energy profile is found to be uphill toward the final simulated fiber form (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative structures from different oligomer basins are shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in these constructs with the proline addition, the addition of the NT17 residues eliminates the free energy barrier near the formation of a pentamer by encouraging association into prefibrillar oligomers (structure VI in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compare the landscape of the full construct with that for NT17-Q20 peptides without the proline addition, we find that adding polyproline again makes the profile more uphill, slowing down aggregation without changing the sequence of events in aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After correcting for monomer depletion, the profile of the full construct becomes slightly downhill at 100 M. Extrapolation to a lower concentration indicates the solubility of the full construct to be around 10 M, consistent with experiments that show that aggregation of the NT17-Q20-P10 peptide proceeds slowly at a concentration of 6 M (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_Free_Energy_Landscapes_of_Intermediate-Length_Repeat_Constructs_30__17-30__30-10__and_17-30-10  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the monomeric structures of the constructs with 20 glutamines prefer the extended form, all of the constructs with 30 glutamines favor a -hairpin form for the polyQ repeat region in the monomer (SI Appendix, Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pure Q30 aggregation is a downhill process after the monomeric nucleus is formed at the laboratory concentration (100 M) at 300 K (SI Appendix, Fig S3) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NT17 addition at the N terminus, by mediating the formation of prefibrillar oligomers, makes the free energy profile even more downhill in NT17-Q30 compared with pure Q30 (structures III and VI in SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, adding P10 at the C terminus by itself makes the profile for Q30-P10 more uphill toward the final fiber form compared with that for pure Q30 (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of events in the aggregation of Q30-P10 again resembles that for pure Q30 (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As for the aggregation of NT17-Q20-P10, the combined effects of the two terminal additions lead to a complicated aggregation free energy landscape with an obvious barrier now near the formation of a tetramer (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with Q30-P10, adding the N terminus makes the profile less uphill by 3kBT at the size of a hexamer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the further addition of the terminal polyproline segment to the fast aggregating NT17-Q20 makes the profile highly unfavorable for the final fiber state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prefolded hairpin monomers still remain in the route to larger oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the -helixmediated oligomeric structures seen in NT17-Q20-P10, the simulation yields a large variety of prefibrillar oligomers in the forms of tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer (structures IV, V, VI, and VI in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After correction for the chemical potential of free monomers, the profile becomes slightly downhill for NT17-Q30-P10 at 100 M (purple line in Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolation to a lower concentration suggests that the solubility of the full 30-length polyQ construct is around 10 M, consistent with laboratory results (15) (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_Free_Energy_Landscapes_of_Long_PolyQ_Repeat_Constructs_40__17-40__40-10__and_17-40-10  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The critical repeat length for onset of Huntingtons disease is 36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the full-length constructs containing Q20 and Q30 are below the disease threshold, we also simulated the aggregation of constructs including 40 repeats, which is above the disease threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensembles of all four types of sequences highly favor the -hairpin structure of the monomer subunits according to our free energy calculations (SI Appendix, Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hairpin motif persists in the structures for the individual subunits in the fiber forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first computed the aggregation free energy profile of the pure Q40 peptide at a laboratory concentration 0.1 mM at 300 K. Consistent with what we found for the aggregation of pure Q20 and Q30, the simulations show that Q40 aggregates through linear addition in a generally downhill fashion to its fiber state (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again adding NT17 at the N terminus, mediating the formation of prefibrillar oligomers encourages aggregation and makes the free energy profile more downhill (structure VI in SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the addition of P10 at the C terminus increases the solubility relatively for pure Q40 (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of aggregation events after the early helical bundle association for Q40-P10 nevertheless resembles that for pure Q40 (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combined additions at the two termini lead to a downhill aggregation at a concentration of 100 M as shown in Fig 5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much as for NT17-Q20-P10 and NT17-Q30-P10, the NT17 addition by itself facilitates aggregation through forming prefibrillar oligomers (structures V and VI in Fig 5), whereas the final P10 addition inhibits aggregation compared with NT17-Q40 that lacks the proline addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After correction for the finite size effects, the profile becomes downhill at 100 M (purple line in Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see the physiological consequence of these changing free energy profiles, we need to know the peptide concentrations in the relevant compartments of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the cytosol, the concentration has been estimated to be around 0.15 M. We can also estimate the concentration of HTT exon 1-encoded fragments enriched inside an inclusion body in brain tissue from multiple experiments (as we describe in SI Appendix) (3, 38, 39), suggesting that the concentration is around 10 M inside an inclusion body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolating our predicted free energy curves to 10 M, the NT17-Q40-P10 construct exhibits a downhill profile, whereas the predicted 1D aggregation free energy curves for NT17-Q20-P10 and NT17-Q30-P10 at this physiological concentration remain uphill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a change in the aggregation landscape at the disease threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Coiled_Coil-Mediated_Aggregation_Mechanism_Caused_by_17_vs_the_Protective_Role_of_the_Polyproline_Tail  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The AWSEM simulations have previously detailed the mechanism of aggregation for pure polyQ peptides, which occurs largely by linear addition (SI Appendix, Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the C-terminal polyproline to pure polyQ does not change the mechanism, but this addition does significantly reduce the aggregation rate (SI Appendix, Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the aggregation of HTT fragments having only the NT17 extension and no polyproline, the free energy profile becomes totally downhill at the simulation concentration (0.1 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhanced tendency to aggregate would lead to rapid aggregation, even for individuals having very short glutamine repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the proline-rich sequence, therefore, seems to be protective through slowing down aggregation with these frayed ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the P10 fragment is added, the aggregation becomes downhill only when there are more than 40 repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The N-terminal peptide extension enhances aggregation through stabilizing prefibrillar structures held together by the helical coiled coil-like structures, raising the local concentration for final -sheet formation (SI Appendix, Fig S10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By itself, the NT17 segment also has a very strong propensity to aggregate as a coiled coil; -helical aggregation followed by a structural transition to the -strand form occurs in another Q-rich protein, CPEB, which has been implicated in long-term memory (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coiled coils seem to play an essential role in aggregation of these proteins found in neurons (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inclusion_Bodies__the_Cytoskeleton__and_Aggregation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Giant aggregates are called inclusion bodies (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with Huntingtons disease, polyQ-expanded HTT exon 1-encoded protein fragments accumulate in compact inclusion bodies inside the neurons (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macdonald et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39) have provided a global value of the concentration of HTT averaged over the whole brain: 0.15 M. According to this calculation at this concentration, the aggregation free energy profile would be very uphill, even in full-length constructs containing longer repeats: NT17-Q40-P10 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global average value of the concentration, however, does not account for the different microenviroments found in neurons (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion bodies are associated with microtubules (2, 44), suggesting that HTT is transported along microtubules and concentrated into the inclusion bodies (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichment of HTT fragments inside the inclusion bodies then reaches the solubility limit (around 5 M for fragments with 40 repeats).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally, the solution becomes supersaturated, leading to macroscopic protein aggregates (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The close association of HTT with the cytoskeleton makes it possible that stretching by mechanical force from the microtubules contributes to aggregate formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical force-driven aggregation was seen in our simulations of another Q-rich protein implicated in the formation of long-term memory, CPEB (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical coupling of HTT with the cytoskeleton should be considered a candidate for the initial stage of forming inclusion bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggregation_and_Huntington_s_Disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although macroscopic aggregates are the hallmark of not only Huntingtons disease but also, several other neurodegenerative diseases (4), the significance of these macroscopic aggregates for pathogenesis remains under some dispute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some have suggested that the inclusion bodies themselves containing aggregated protein fragments are not so pernicious (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the toxicity of small oligomeric species of mutant protein fragments that have adopted specific conformational states may be critical (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrasate et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (48) have shown that, rather than the total HTT level determining cell death, the amount of diffuse intracellular HTT predicts whether cell death occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They, therefore, proposed that inclusion bodies actually protect neurons by decreasing levels of toxic forms (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blurred definition between oligomers and small, yet still macroscopic aggregates may, however, be a source of confusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement of our concentration-dependent free energy profiles with the known genetic thresholds would seem to argue against the idea that small oligomeric species cause the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are more consistent with the idea that aggregation does cause Huntingtons disease: either through structural defects caused by the aggregate itself, which may be entwined with the cytoskeleton, or by depleting the functional HTT inside the cytosol, eventually causing loss of function (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results now connect the structural and thermodynamic details of aggregate formation with the genetically known onset length for the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermediate structures detailed in these simulations may be good targets for drug discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
