Evaluating early-warning indicators of critical transitions in natural aquatic ecosystems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early-warning indicators (EWIs), statistical metrics of system resilience, have been hypothesized to provide advance warning of sudden shifts in ecosystems, or so-called regime shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we tested this hypothesis for four commonly used EWIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used empirical time series from five freshwater ecosystems with documented sudden, persistent transitions hypothesized to represent critical transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EWIs were detected in several of these long-term records, and in some cases several years before the transition; however, these EWIs varied in reliability, and agreement between indicators was low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, their applicability was strongly limited by the requirement for ecosystem-specific knowledge of transition-generating mechanisms and their drivers to choose relevant state variables for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early-warning indicators (EWIs) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generalizability of EWIs for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assessed four commonly used EWIs on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although EWIs could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, EWIs were detected considerably ahead of the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our results show that at present, EWIs do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring EWIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection_of_Case_Study_Ecosystems_and_State_Variables  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected five case study ecosystems based on expert knowledge of well-described regime shifts that can be qualified as critical transitions in aquatic ecosystems: Lake Müggelsee (Germany; LMS), Lake Veluwemeer (The Netherlands; LVM), Lake Zwemlust (The Netherlands; LZL), Lake Washington (United States; LW), and Lake Võrtsjärv (Estonia; LV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the literature on these case study ecosystems, we identified relevant critical transition-generating mechanisms, which guided our choice of 14 state variables for EWI analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case studies, mechanisms, state variables, and drivers are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more detailed description of each case study and rationale for choosing the 14 state variables is presented in SI Appendix, section S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transition_Detection_and_Seasonal_Adjustment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used three complementary methodspiecewise linear regression, Pettit, and STARS (Methods)to robustly assess the timing of transitions (i.e., breakpoints, defined as large, persistent step changes) in the time series of each state variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found one breakpoint in 12 state variables and two breakpoints in two state variables (Table 2 and Fig 1), resulting in 16 prebreakpoint time series (i.e., from start to step change) for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all state variables, the timing of the breakpoints confirmed the timing of transitions reported in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information on the data structure, including time period, sampling interval, number of data points, and the percentage of missing values in the prebreakpoint time series, are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each state variable showed significant differences in the means before and after the breakpoint (Table 2), with step magnitudes ranging from 0.241.59*standard deviation (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each prebreakpoint time series was detrended and seasonally adjusted using a Gaussian smoother with a bandwidth corresponding to 12 data points (for monthly datasets) or 26 data points (for fortnightly datasets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing of the residual time series for remaining linear trends and seasonality showed a persistent, but greatly reduced, seasonal signal in some time series (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EWI_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 14 of 16 analyzed time series, loss of resilience before the breakpoint was signaled by at least one of the four EWI metrics (coded + in Table 2; details provided in SI Appendix, section S3), based on the median of the trend distribution across yearly increments of rolling window sizes (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found trends towards increasing AR-1 and DR in 10 cases each (63%), toward increasing SD in nine cases (56%), and toward increasing or decreasing SK (according to the direction of the state change) in seven cases (44%) (Fig 2 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, AR-1 trends were increasing from negative values to positive values (SI Appendix, section S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded these trends as positive [coded (+) in Table 2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several cases, indicators showed trends opposite to the theoretical expectation (coded  in Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the state variable phytoplankton biomass in LMS showed the theoretically expected trends in all EWIs, whereas in two state variablesnonalgal attenuation in LVM and cyanobacteria biomass in LWall EWIs failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement was low between positive AR-1 and SD trends (five cases), but higher between positive AR-1 and DR trends (10 cases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logistic regression revealed no significant relationships (P less_than 0.05) between EWI behavior and mechanism (competition, IGP, or trophic cascade), state variable level (species, group, or ecosystem), step change height, length of prebreakpoint time series, nor sampling interval (fortnightly or monthly).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Robustness_to_Rolling_Window_Size_and_Significance_of_EWI_Trends  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the robustness of EWI trends to the size of the rolling window, shown as the distribution of trends around their median (boxplots in Fig 2 for AR-1 and SD and in SI Appendix, Fig S4 for DR and SK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large majority of trends were qualitatively robust to rolling window size, as demonstrated by the low number of trend distributions in which the boxplot crossed zero on the y axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested for the significance of the trends by estimating the rate of false positives using simulated surrogate time series (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among all 64 EWI trends (16 time series by four EWIs), only three trends were significant in 50% of the comparisons between data-based and surrogate-based trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional 29 EWIs were significant in less_than50% of comparisons, and 32 EWIs showed no significant differences between data-based and surrogate-based trends (gray bars in Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EWIs_in_Stepwise_Shortened_Time_Series  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether EWI trends could have been detected in incomplete time series that would have been available at 1 y or longer before the actual transition took place, we repeated the EWI analysis on stepwise shortened (i.e., yearly increments) time series of each state variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 14 of the 16 time series, at least one of the EWIs would have indicated a loss in ecosystem resilience between 1 and 10 y before the critical transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three instances, positive EWIs trends were seen in only the year before the shift (SI Appendix, Table S5), whereas in 17 instances, the median of the EWI trend distribution remained positive (i.e., showing the expected sign) up to the minimum time series period analyzed (3 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we assessed the detectability of four commonly used EWIs (AR-1, SD, SK, and DR) in empirical time series of freshwater ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining high-quality empirical time series with ecological understanding and standardized methods, we have shown that EWIs preceded critical transitions in natural aquatic ecosystems, in some cases even several years ahead of the shift, despite the potential shortcomings of empirical datasets, such as observation error, sparse sampling, and low signal-to-noise ratio (9, 24, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in a large proportion of cases the EWIs failed, and the cases with positive EWIs generally showed low or no significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found little agreement among signals, and observed no relationship between EWI trends and potential predictors, such as the ecological mechanism of the shift, state variable level, magnitude of the transition, or sampling interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Use_of_Ecological_Understanding_in_the_Choice_of_State_Variables  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The choice of case studies and state variables in this study was based on expert knowledge of ecosystems that likely experienced critical transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this choice was based on an understanding of the ecological mechanisms that can give rise to alternative states in aquatic ecosystems, it does not provide conclusive evidence that the regime shifts that we analyzed correspond to true critical transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, such a priori choices of state variables for EWI analysis implicitly excluded assumptions based on other transition types, such as responses to step changes in the driver (34), but offered clear expectations of the EWI behavior that should precede a transition (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mechanisms generating critical transitions can operate at all ecosystem levels, relevant state variables range from discrete variables, such as species-specific biomass (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), to aggregated variables, such as Secchi depth, turbidity, or metabolism (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the case studies were chosen based on the availability of long time series of monitoring data for relevant state variables at sufficiently high temporal resolution and with few missing values (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite our conscientious choice of ecosystems and state variables, we still found contradicting patterns in EWIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_and_Agreement_Among_Indicators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Not all EWIs were equally reliable in detecting impending transitions (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 44% of the 64 cases, the EWI failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in three cases where signals were positive were trends significant in 50% of data-based and surrogate-based trend comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our significance testing relied on estimating EWI trends in surrogate stationary data fitted to the original time series to determine the rate of false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, we lacked records to serve as controls when comparing trends from comparable aquatic systems in which no transition occurred to estimate the rate of true negatives (no alarm, or sensitivity) of the EWIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of such controls, one potential way to measure the no alarm rate is to derive trends from nonstationary models fitted to the data (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future work, it would be valuable to compare trends in EWI in study systems that did not exhibit any changes or in which changes were brought about by large external shifts in drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Agreement between AR-1 and SD trends has been postulated as a minimum requirement to signal the approach of a transition (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our dataset, these two indicators concurrently increased in only 5 of 16 time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical transitions with increasing AR-1 and decreasing SD have been observed in other studies as well (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such inconsistent trends between indicators may occur in ecosystems that are subject to multiple concurrent regime shift-generating processes that may or may not interact via shared state variables and that may react differently to drivers and environmental noise (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such connected regime shift processes work toward muffling variance in the measured state variable, then the variance-based EWI signal could be suppressed (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transitions from cycles to stable points also can generate decreasing variation (38) and may explain decreasing SD trends like in the LMS Cyclops vicinus abundances or the LV functional group U biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many cases, autocorrelation (AR-1) was generally low, and in some cases it was even negative (e.g., LW non-Daphnia cladocerans).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low AR-1 values (far from the theoretical value of 1 at which critical transitions occur) reflect the fact that transitions in the real world are likely triggered well before the actual tipping point is reached (25, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of the full power spectrum for changes in power in aggregated low vs. high frequencies over time indicated that higher-order AR processes did not provide more information than the AR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the reported low or negative autocorrelation in our records likely originated from too long sampling intervals in cyclic variables (e.g., population cycles), resulting in undersampled cycles of fast-growing plankton and its related variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Successful detection of EWIs often has been related to the availability of high sampling frequency data (40), although it has been shown that EWIs still can be detected robustly in infrequently sampled data as long as the time series are sufficiently long (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study was based on data sampled at (or averaged to) fortnightly and monthly intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monthly intervals are rather long compared with the generation or reaction times of the state variables tested in our study; for example, phytoplankton generation times are on the order of days, and thus monthly averages of biomass aggregate multiple generations of phytoplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we could not detect a relationship between sampling interval and the proportion of failing EWIs in our dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, data preparation, particularly choices regarding detrending and seasonal adjustment methods, can affect the autocorrelation structure in time series and hence the outcome of EWI analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Gaussian filtering with a fixed bandwidth based on the sampling frequency to detrend and seasonally adjust the data before EWI analysis (SI Appendix, section S6); however, despite this data preparation, some time series still showed reduced traces of seasonality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remaining seasonal signals may increase or decrease the intercept of the EWI trends, but not the sign of the trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Early_Detection_Based_on_Incomplete_Time_Series  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Informative changes in some of the EWI metrics were already detectable several years before the actual transition, although large differences in detection windows between state variables were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences may be explained in part by the fact that the actual shift is usually triggered by external stochastic perturbations, which in turn are often independent of the drivers of ecosystem stability loss (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in many cases EWIs indicated sustained instability over the period tested in our study, which may be attributed to either an insufficient time span available for testing (e.g., LZ) or unrecognized interacting processes that promoted prolonged instability in these ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite our informed and conscientious choice of case study ecosystems and state variables, we found relatively low detectability of EWIs before the documented transitions, and when EWIs were detected, the agreement among them was low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are in line with results from an assessment of the detectability of EWIs before nonlinear transitions (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is encouraging that we could detect EWIs in some of our empirical aquatic time series using data derived from commonly used monitoring schemes that were not designed for this purpose, the lack of reliability and agreement among signals limits the potential application of EWIs only to well-understood ecosystems (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such well-understood ecosystems, harnessing EWIs as metrics of loss of resilience may aid planning for the unpredictable and could be part of strategic foresight programs for management and conservation (44); however, our analysis suggests that these metrics can be of added value only in combination with existing frameworks (e.g., alternative stable-state theory) and in-depth ecosystem knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, taking into account the underlying assumptions and requirements of EWI analysis can inform managers about adaptations in monitoring schemes by advising about relevant variables and temporal sampling resolution to adequately capture changes in the resilience of systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One way forward may be the advent of automated, continuous high-frequency monitoring, ideally monitoring multiple lakes with similar properties for comparison (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase our understanding of critical transition generating processes, ecosystem models, such as PCLake, can help bridge the gap between simple minimal models and the full complexity of natural systems and allow combined analysis of, e.g., food-web theory and alternative stable states theory and indicators of ecosystem resilience (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, such insights can serve to broaden our search image in empirical EWI patterns instead of relying on a generic increase in variance without understanding the inherent variability in ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the meantime, the reliability of EWIs for predicting abrupt shifts in ecosystem state should be viewed with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data_Preparation_and_Breakpoint_Detection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data preparation and statistical analysis protocol was identical for all 16 state variable time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each time series was analyzed at the highest temporal resolution available or at a lower resolution that resulted in less missing data (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMS and LW were analyzed at fortnightly; all other case studies were analyzed at monthly intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our time series methodology requires continuous and equidistant data, we imputed missing values up to a maximum of four consecutive time steps using a Kalman filter (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time series with longer gaps were shortened to start or end at the gap (e.g., LV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each time series was standardized by mean centering and SD scaling for convenient comparison of step change heights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the step was determined by breakpoint analysis, given that step changes in the respective state variables may differ from the timing of whole-system step changes reported in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust estimates of the timing of step change were achieved using three complementary breakpoint estimation methods: (i) additive decomposition of time series in seasonal, trend, and residual components and subsequent iterative fitting of piecewise linear season and trend models (47) using the R package bfast (48); (ii) testing for step changes in the average using the Pettitt test (49); and (iii) STARS, a combination of a sequential partial CUSUM method and a t test (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If at least two methods showed similar timing for a step change (±12 mo), then the standardized original time series was split at that breakpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between prebreakpoint and postbreakpoint means of the time series were tested with the Welch two-sample t test (51) (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of a 1-y gap in the time series, breakpoint timing of two state variablesLV functional groups P (eutrophic epilimnion species) and U (summer epilimnion species)was determined differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assessed whether large changes in the biomasses of the functional groups occurred during the gap, indicating a potential shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pre-1978 and post-1978 time series showed significantly different means for functional group U (Welch two-sample t test, t = 3.52; df = 128; P less_than 0.001; difference in means, 0.29*SD) and functional group P (Welch two-sample t test, t = 4.67; df = 439; P less_than 0.001; difference in means, 0.55*SD), suggesting that the shift in functional groups U and P occurred during the year 1978 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both of these time series showed no further breakpoints in the years after 1978, we conservatively assumed 1977 to be the transition year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EWI_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The prebreakpoint time series was seasonally adjusted using a Gaussian smoother with a kernel bandwidth based on the number of data points per year (i.e., 12 for monthly datasets and 26 for fortnightly datasets; other methods are compared in SI Appendix, section S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bandwidth of 1 y was chosen to account for annually recurring patterns while retaining informative low- and high-frequency variability other than long-term trend and season (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three residual time seriesLMS Dreissena (two outliers) and Aphanizomenon period 1 and LW Cyanobacteria (one outlier each)local outliers were replaced by Kalman-imputed values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residuals were then passed on to analysis of EWIs AR-1, SD, SK, and DR with testing for robustness to the size of rolling window and testing for significance (false positives) using the R package earlywarnings (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the static choice of fixed compared frequencies in the EWI DR was confirmed to be sufficiently capturing changes of the full power spectrum of the prebreakpoint residuals time (based on its estimated smoothed fast Fourier periodogram).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Robustness_and_Significance_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The trends in the estimated temporal evolution of EWIs from the rolling window approach were quantified using the nonparametric MannKendall trend test, which tests for monotonic trends based on the Kendall  rank correlation coefficient (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the size of the rolling window can affect EWI trends (36), a robustness analysis was performed to estimate the distribution of trends and proportion of trends that did not differ in sign from the median of the trend distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done using yearly increments of the residuals time series covered by the rolling time window [2 to n  2 y, function sensitivity_ews (9), where n is the number of years in each prebreakpoint time series].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance testing was done by comparing the data-based EWI trend against a bootstrapped distribution of 200 surrogate time series-based EWI trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surrogate time series were generated based on an ARMA(p,q) model fitted on the residuals time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrapped distribution of trends depicts the probability that a particular trend could occur by chance in time series of the same ARMA structure [function surrogates_ews in R package earlywarnings (9)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data-based EWI trend was deemed significant if it fell on one of the 5% tails of the surrogate-based trend distribution ( = 0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This significance testing was repeated for all rolling window sizes, and the proportion (%) of significant trends over all rolling window sizes was reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relationship_of_EWIs_with_State_Variable_Categories_and_Agreement_Among_Signals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relationships between the occurrence of each EWI and the predictor variables mechanism (competition, IGP, or trophic cascade), state variable category (species, group, ecosystem), step change height, length of prebreakpoint time series, and sampling interval (fortnightly or monthly) were analyzed by logistic regression [identity link for continuous predictors (step change height and time series length); logit link for categorical predictors] with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median of the trend distribution across all time window sizes was used to assess agreement among EWIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Early_Detection_of_EWIs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the potential timeliness of EWIs in detecting the approaching transition, EWI trends were quantified on stepwise shortened prebreakpoint time series, starting with the full time period and continuing with stepwise reduction of the time series by cutting off the last year of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum time series length was set to 3 y to allow for meaningful Kendall  estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of years before the shift that an EWI could have been detected was set by assessing the maximum number of stepwise reductions before the theoretically expected EWI trend disappeared (i.e., when the median of the Kendall  trend distribution turned negative for AR-1, SD, and DR or changed sign for SK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data analyses and graphing were conducted using the R language environment for statistical computing (52) and associated library extensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
