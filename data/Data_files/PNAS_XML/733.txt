title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient transport of tropospheric aerosol into the stratosphere via the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonvolcanic stratospheric aerosols account for 20% of the radiative forcing of the entire atmospheric aerosol system since 1850.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asian summer monsoon (ASM) effectively pumps Asian pollutants to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, leading to enhanced aerosol formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in situ measurements combined with modeling work show that the aerosol formed within the ASM anticyclone is exported to the entire Northern Hemispheric stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On an annual average basis, we estimate that 15% of the Northern Hemisphere column stratospheric aerosol surface area originates from the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This surface area is comparable to the modeled contribution from the sum of the small volcanic eruptions over the period 2000 to 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An enhanced aerosol layer near the tropopause over Asia during the JuneSeptember period of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) was recently identified using satellite observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its sources and climate impact are presently not well-characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve understanding of this phenomenon, we made in situ aerosol measurements during summer 2015 from Kunming, China, then followed with a modeling study to assess the global significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in situ measurements revealed a robust enhancement in aerosol concentration that extended up to 2 km above the tropopause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A climate model simulation demonstrates that the abundant anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions from Asia coupled with rapid vertical transport associated with monsoon convection leads to significant particle formation in the upper troposphere within the ASM anticyclone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These particles subsequently spread throughout the entire Northern Hemispheric (NH) lower stratosphere and contribute significantly (15%) to the NH stratospheric column aerosol surface area on an annual basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contribution is comparable to that from the sum of small volcanic eruptions in the period between 2000 and 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the ASM contribution is smaller than that from tropical upwelling (35%), we find that this region is about three times as efficient per unit area and time in populating the NH stratosphere with aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a substantial amount of organic and sulfur emissions in Asia, the ASM anticyclone serves as an efficient smokestack venting aerosols to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As economic growth continues in Asia, the relative importance of Asian emissions to stratospheric aerosol is likely to increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the vertical structure and size distribution of the ATAL we launched three balloon sondes from Kunming, China (25°N, 102°E) on August 13, 14, and 17, 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each balloon carried an optical particle spectrometer, POPS (19), making high-quality in situ profile measurements of aerosol particle number density and size distribution in the 140- to 3,000-nm diameter range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected from the surface to 28 km in altitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each balloon payload also included sensors for ozone (20), water vapor (21), and optical particle backscatter (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional measurements of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity were made with an Intermet (iMet-1-RSB) radiosonde on the same balloon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To place the measurement location in context, we show in Fig 1 the time-averaged geopotential heights at 100 hPa from the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 data assimilation averaged for the time period of balloon operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area with the highest geopotential height (red in Fig 1) indicates the center of the ASM anticyclone circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-day back trajectories using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) HYSPLIT model were initiated at Kunming just above the tropopause for each of the balloon flight days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trajectories show that the air sampled by the balloons is representative of the ASM anticyclone region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The particle surface area density (SAD) vertical profiles in the UT and LS over Kunming (Fig 2) exhibit an enhanced layer near the tropopause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This aerosol layer extends from several kilometers below the tropopause up to 2 km above the tropopause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The layer is consistent with the location of the ATAL observed in satellite measurements and hereafter we will refer to it in that manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low values of SAD in the profiles below this layer suggest that aerosol from the lower troposphere is efficiently removed by scavenging associated with monsoon convection, and the ATAL is subsequently formed by in situ production of new particles from photochemically active sulfur and organic trace gases that were not completely scavenged during uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the vertical aerosol distribution near the tropopause presented here is similar in shape (yet about three times as high in SAD values) to that observed in the tropics (4, 23), suggesting a similar formation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once air parcels convectively lofted in the ASM reach the UT they tend to be contained by the strong anticyclonic circulation while continuing to ascend slowly into the LS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this period of slow ascent, photochemistry produces lower volatility species that both nucleate new particles and condense on previously formed particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation of enhanced aerosol above the tropopause clearly indicates that air enters the stratosphere within the anticyclone, consistent with the conceptual model described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and shown in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity in the measured particle size distributions in the UT and LS (Fig S2) suggests that nearly all of the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from short-lived photochemically active gases takes place in the UT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back-trajectory analysis (Fig 1) indicates that the air parcels sampled by the three flights have been circulating in the ASM for several days and are representative of a large area of the ASM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the ATAL was consistently observed in each flight suggests that it is a robust feature distributed throughout the ASM anticyclone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our measurements show that the aerosol SAD decreases by about 80% between the tropopause and 2 km above the tropopause (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there is no known sink of aerosol mass in the LS and particle sedimentation is negligible during the 4-mo ASM season for the particle sizes observed, this decrease must be due to horizontal mixing with cleaner background stratospheric air as the anticyclone weakens at higher altitudes (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the ATAL particles mix out of the anticyclone and are transported throughout the entire Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitude belt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have suggested that pollution could be transported horizontally from the ASM region into the core of the tropical stratospheric upwelling region (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, based on the latitudinal location (2040°N) and height (1719 km) of the ASM anticyclone, it is not clear how much of the air that ascends within the ASM anticyclone moves upward in the tropical LS vs. moving poleward and then descending through the lower extratropical branch of the BrewerDobson circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the transport pathway for ASM aerosol, we use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) sectional aerosol model coupled with the Community Earth System Model (CESM); details are given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the model, averaged over the entire ASM anticyclone region for August 2015, reproduces the vertical profile of aerosol surface area and size distribution observed by POPS in the UTLS reasonably well (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeled SAD in the UT (210 km below the tropopause) is generally higher than the observed values (Fig 2), suggesting insufficient wet removal, whereas the agreement near the tropopause is very good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional model validation for global UTLS aerosol has been reported in previous studies (3, 16, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the modeled AOD of the ATAL is about 0.008 (16), and that observed AOD by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation is about 0.005 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is likely that there are deficiencies in the convective transport and scavenging in the model (25, 26), as evidenced by the discrepancies between model and measurements in the mid troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the purposes of this study, our interest is in the UT and LS (UTLS) where measurement/model agreement is good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this study, it is the accuracy of the aerosol amounts and transport in the UTLS that is most important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the UTLS, the slow ascent of air in the UT within the ASM anticyclone is in balance with dynamical and radiative processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of zero radiative heating occurs near 15 km in the model, with positive heating rates above that, consistent with other climate/radiation models (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are sources of uncertainty: Studies (27, 28) have shown that UTLS radiative heating and corresponding air motion are sensitive to the vertical distribution of clouds, which likely introduces some errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other uncertainties exist in regards to aerosol transport, including inaccuracies of subgrid scale parameterizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not quantify those uncertainties relative to reality, our subsequent model analysis examines the differences between runs of the same model system, which likely minimizes errors in our conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our model, the ASM aerosol enters the LS both through ascent above the local tropopause in the ASM anticyclone and by horizontal transport out of the ASM dome (as indicated by black arrows in Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To diagnose the ASM contribution to the global stratospheric aerosol we compare two model simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is a normal, unperturbed control run that includes the ASM contribution to the stratospheric aerosol loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second, we remove the ASM effect by eliminating all particles and aerosol precursor gases within the ASM anticyclone dome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception is carbonyl sulfide (OCS), which is a long-lived, well-mixed tracer; ASM-related transport of OCS is not expected to significantly affect the stratospheric aerosol budget.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ease of computation, a 3D box (Fig S1B, volume colored in magenta, 15°45°N, 30°120°E, with latitude-dependent depth) is used to represent the dome during the period June through September (hereafter referred to as the 3D-box run).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the control run and the 3D-box run represents the contribution of the ASM to the overall stratospheric aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the ratio of that difference relative to the control run to compute the percent contribution plotted in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model details are given in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, only aerosol surface area densities, which are proportional to optical depth and therefore more relevant to radiative effects than number and volume densities, are discussed in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, the ASM contribution to stratospheric aerosol is confined to the NH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its largest contribution is in the 10°N40°N latitudinal band, and the peak coincides with the ASM anticyclone region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the peak region, 2035% of the annual averaged stratospheric column aerosol surface area is attributable to the ASM aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A illustrates the cross-latitude transport of the ASM aerosol in the stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between August and December a large portion of ASM aerosol moves poleward following the lower branch of the BrewerDobson circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aerosol is eventually flushed out of the stratosphere at high latitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The large contribution from the ASM to stratospheric aerosol SAD in the NH (about 15% annually) is statistically robust (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower and upper bounds of the contribution are 10% and 25.4% (Fig S4 A and B), respectively, determined through sensitivity study runs using either a shallow or deep 3D box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shallow box eliminates vertical transport across the tropopause within the ASM anticyclone, whereas a deeper box also eliminates horizontal mixing out of the ASM anticyclone dome region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed descriptions of the shallow and deep 3D boxes are given in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model results indicate that the ASMs contribution to the LS in the anticyclone region is primarily from direct vertical ascent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contributions to the broader NH stratosphere are the result of horizontal mixing out of the ASM region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate method (alternative 3D box hereafter) to estimate the ASM contribution is to set the concentrations of the various tracers inside the anticyclone to the mean of their values in the surrounding region (i.e., 150°210°E, 15°45°N) at each model step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S5, the heating rates inside the anticyclone are significantly higher than those in the adjacent regions outside of the anticyclone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating rates inside the model cannot be adjusted, and as a result of this greater heating particles in the lowest layer of the UT are pumped to higher altitudes faster inside the ASM anticyclone, resulting in an exaggerated upward aerosol flux in the model relative to what would be expected in reality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exaggerated flux prevents the complete removal of the ASM effect on the stratospheric aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this method provides another estimate of the lower limit of the ASM contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower limit calculated using this method is 7% (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tropical upwelling has long been known to be the major pathway for transport of tropospheric aerosol into the stratosphere (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantity the contribution to stratospheric aerosol from tropical upwelling we performed model simulations removing particles and condensable gases from the inner tropics (15°S15°N, 0°360°E) for the entire year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model results show that 35% of nonvolcanic stratospheric aerosol surface area in the NH is a consequence of upwelling from 15°S15°N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, the contribution from the inner tropics decreases from the equator (50%) to high latitudes (20%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ASM region, the model estimates that 70% of stratospheric aerosol originates from tropospheric SO2 and organics, with roughly equal contributions from within the ASM and from the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At mid to high latitudes (40°90°N), the ASMs contribution (1020%) is less than, but still comparable to, the tropical contribution (2535%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining sources of stratospheric aerosol are attributed to OCS and tropospherestratosphere transport from other regions; there is still upwelling from 15° to the subtropical jet edge (which, depending on season, can extend to the midlatitudes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ASM contribution to stratospheric aerosol is difficult to directly quantify using measurements alone partially due to contributions from volcanic eruptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large volcanic eruptions, such as that of Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pinatubo in 1991, greatly enhance the stratospheric aerosol loading for periods of up to a few years depending on the latitude, time, and injection height of the eruption (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 2000 a number of smaller volcanic eruptions have contributed to variability in the stratospheric aerosol layer (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the significance of the ATAL relative to recent volcanic activity, we performed a simulation of the 2011 Nabro volcanic eruption (13.37°N, 41.7°E), which was one of the larger tropical eruptions in recent years and contributed 23% of the volcanic SO2 injected above 10 km between 2000 and 2015 (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the model simulations are described in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model results show that the 2011 Nabro eruption led to an increase of 60% in the NH stratospheric aerosol surface area for about 1 y (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the consistent annual contribution of the monsoon (15% for the NH stratosphere annually), our study shows that the ASM makes a contribution comparable to that of the combined small volcanic eruptions in the period 20002015 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the major sources of stratospheric aerosols are volcanic eruptions, tropical upwelling, and production due to OCS reactions, in this study we find that the ASMs contribution to the stratosphere is significant, on the order of 15% for the NH annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is comparable to the combined contribution from small volcanic eruptions over the period from 2000 to 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropogenic emissions in the ASM region are much larger than those averaged over the entire tropics, allowing the ASM to be a significant source (7.5% globally averaged) even though it only has an area that is 22% of that of the inner tropics (15°S15°N, 0360°E, 35% contribution to the global stratospheric aerosol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the ASM anticyclone is only active for about 4 mo in each year, the ASM is currently about three times as effective in populating the NH stratosphere with aerosol as the tropics (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ASMs contribution to the stratosphere is expected to grow as emissions increase from the rapidly expanding economies in Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies (10, 33) indicate that the dominant source of air within the ASM anticyclone is from the Indian subcontinent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a substantial amount of organic and sulfur emissions in Asia, the ASM anticyclone is indeed an efficient chimney venting aerosols to the stratosphere, and its importance is likely to increase with time (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Particle number size distribution was measured by custom-built POPS (18) with sufficiently low size detection limit to capture over 60% of the ATAL particle surface area (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small size and low weight of the POPS makes it easily deployable on weather balloons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each particle passing the laser beam creates a pulse signal, which is used to calculate particle size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured particle counts multiplied by their surface area assuming a spherical shape were binned by size to construct the particle area size distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CARMA sectional aerosol model coupled with the CESM global model (24, 36) is used for this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CARMA, we track two types of aerosol in two sets of size bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One type consists of sulfuric acid particles formed through nucleation and condensation of water and sulfuric acid vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other set of bins includes particles containing mixtures of organics, black carbon, sea salt, dust, and condensed sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We run CESM/CARMA with a horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5° and 56 levels vertically (with 20 levels above 100 hPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A volatility-basis-set (37) method is used in CESM/CARMA to simulate SOA including oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and partitioning between gas and particle phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission databases used for SO2, VOCs, and primary organic aerosols (POA) are described in the ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted two types of model simulations to derive the contribution of ASM to the stratospheric aerosol loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both simulations are driven by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications offline meteorology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first was a control run of 5 y repeating the year 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second (3D-box run) was a 5-y simulation (with an additional 3-y spin-up, repeating the year 2011) where no aerosol or condensable gases (i.e., SO2 and VOCs) within a specified region were transported to the stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these cases have no volcanic emissions and we average the 5 y to obtain results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the ASM with the volcanic contribution we did a third simulation to simulate the 2011 Nabro eruption (13.4°N, 41.7°E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we use a fixed dynamics model formulation, neither ASM particles nor Nabro particles feed back into changes in the dynamical or thermodynamical fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the second type of simulation (3D-box run) we considered multiple cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the importance of the ASM aerosol transported into the stratosphere, we eliminated all particles and condensable gases inside the 3D box in the ASM anticyclone region just below the tropopause (Fig S1B, region colored in magenta) from June through September.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth of the 3D box is latitude-dependent, ranging from 1 km (15°25°N) to about 4 km (40°45°N) with the upper level set to be the local tropopause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The varying lower bound of the box is due to the decreasing zonal mean tropopause height with latitude (from 16 km at 15°N to 12 km at 45°N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper level of the box is fixed because the tropopause height within the ASM anticyclone is relatively constant with latitude at 1517 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the relatively high tropopause associated with the ASM, any tracer transported out of the ASM dome either vertically or horizontally is counted as a stratospheric source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lower latitudes (15°25°N) of the box we minimize the depth to one model layer (i.e., 100 hPa, 1 km thick); from 25°N to 35°N the depth of the box is about 2 km from to 100 hPa to 118 hPa (model pressure level), from 35° to 40°N the depth of the box is about 3 km from 100 to 139 hPa (model pressure levels), and from 40° to 45°N the depth of the box is about 4 km from 118 to 192 hPa (model pressure levels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the lower limit of the ASMs contribution to stratospheric aerosol surface area, we apply a shallow 3D box with a 1-km-thick layer at 100 hPa in the entire ASM region (Fig S1B, volume marked by blue dashed lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This eliminates the vertical transport of aerosol to the stratosphere but still allows the horizontal transport of aerosol from the ASM dome to the stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the upper limit, we apply a deep box (Fig S1B, volume colored in both magenta and green) that eliminates both vertical and horizontal transport from the ASM dome to the stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was run for 5 y using 2011 meteorology for both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the tropical contribution to the stratospheric aerosol layer, we removed particles and condensable gases from the tropical tropopause region (15°S15°N, 0°360°E) for the entire year to quantify the contribution from tropical upwelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in aerosol parameters between the control and 3D-box runs represent the contributions from the ASM circulation or the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the 2011 Nabro eruption simulation (13.4°N, 41.7°E) we injected 1.5 Tg SO2 from 10 to 17 km (i.e., eight model vertical levels from 312 hPa to 100 hPa) on June 13, following emissions estimated from previous studies (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran the model for 2 y from June 2011 to June 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the contribution of volcanic eruptions to stratospheric aerosol relative to that of the ASM we must consider the effective annual contribution from the 2011 Nabro simulation over the longer time period from 2000 to 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple estimate is to divide the 60% increase over the 1 y in the simulation by the 15 y of consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That gives a total contribution of a Nabro-type eruption of 4%/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As stated in the text, the 2011 Nabro eruption accounted for 23% of the total volcanic SO2 likely producing stratospheric aerosols for the period of 20002015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can then multiply 4%/y by the factor 1/23% to get an average volcanic contribution to NH stratospheric aerosol of 17.4%/y, which is comparable to the ASM contribution of 15%/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effectiveness of the ASM transport relative to inner tropics in populating the stratosphere with aerosol (approximately a factor of 3) is calculated using the relative contributions to the stratospheric global annual average aerosol surface areas (7.5% vs. 35%, respectively), the months of the year they are both active (4 vs. 12 mo), and their relative sizes (ASM is 22% smaller than the inner topics), which gives (7.5/35)*(12/4)(1/0.22) 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
