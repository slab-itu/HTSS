Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase stimulates thrombopoietin-independent hematopoiesis accelerating recovery from thrombocytopenia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) catalyze aminoacylation of tRNAs in the first step of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in higher eukaryotes, they acquired additional functions beyond translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we show that an activated form of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRSACT) functions to enhance megakaryopoiesis and platelet production in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were confirmed with human megakaryocytes differentiated from peripheral blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and with human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of YRSACT is independent of thrombopoietin (TPO), as evidenced by expansion of the megakaryocytes from iPS cell-derived hematopoietic stem cells from a patient deficient in TPO signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of an aaRS which may have implications for therapeutic interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
New mechanisms behind blood cell formation continue to be uncovered, with therapeutic approaches for hematological diseases being of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report an enzyme in protein synthesis, known for cell-based activities beyond translation, is a factor inducing megakaryocyte-biased hematopoiesis, most likely under stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show an activated form of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRSACT), prepared either by rationally designed mutagenesis or alternative splicing, induces expansion of a previously unrecognized high-ploidy Sca-1+ megakaryocyte population capable of accelerating platelet replenishment after depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, YRSACT targets monocytic cells to induce secretion of transacting cytokines that enhance megakaryocyte expansion stimulating the Toll-like receptor/MyD88 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Platelet replenishment by YRSACT is independent of thrombopoietin (TPO), as evidenced by expansion of the megakaryocytes from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic stem cells from a patient deficient in TPO signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest megakaryocyte-biased hematopoiesis induced by YRSACT offers new approaches for treating thrombocytopenia, boosting yields from cell-culture production of platelet concentrates for transfusion, and bridging therapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YRSACT promotes platelet production in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic representation of YRS domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Rossmann fold catalytic domain and anticodon-recognition domain, both essential for tRNATyr aminoacylation, constitute YRSMini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YRSACT contains a gain-of-function mutation (Y341A) in the context of full-length YRS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) A single injection of YRSACT (30 mg/kg), compared with vehicle (PBS), increased the blood platelet count of WT mice (n =14 in each group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) WT mice received one i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of anti-GPIb monoclonal antibody (5A7; day 0) to deplete platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YRSACT (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was injected on days 2 and 5 (n = 4) and blood cell counts were monitored at the indicated times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Plasma samples were collected before and after (day 2) 5A7 injection, and TPO levels were determined by ELISA (n = 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) BM cells of WT mice (n = 4) injected with YRSACT or vehicle (PBS) were harvested on day 3 and analyzed for MK ploidy by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown as mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI) (BD) or 25th to 75th percentile bars with median and min to max whiskers (E); in the latter panel, color-coded lines join the mean values (marked by a cross indicated inside each bar) of each ploidy distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ***P less_than 0.001 determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunns multiple comparison test (D) or two-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparison test (B, C, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
YRSACT_Promotes_Platelet_Production_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore YRS effects on extracellular activities, we injected the constitutively active YRSACT mutant (Fig 1A) or vehicle control into C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single dose significantly increased the platelet count over a 12-d period (Fig 1B); two doses accelerated the recovery from severe thrombocytopenia induced by an anti-glycoprotein (GP) Ib antibody (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels peaked at day 2 post thrombocytopenia induction and returned to baseline by day 5, before platelet recovery started (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, YRSACT effect on platelet production was concurrent with maximal TPO up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there were more 32N megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow (BM) of YRSACT-treated than control mice (Fig 1E), suggesting a mechanism of action of YRSACT on MKs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, YRSACT, compared with vehicle control, administered 8 and 48 h post irradiation to mice that had absorbed 300 cGy of -irradiation, limited the severity of thrombocytopenia and accelerated platelet count recovery (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the thrombopoietic function of YRSACT could be part of a general response to thrombocytopenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YRSACT_Enhances_ex_Vivo_MK_Expansion_Independent_of_TPO_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In agreement with in vivo results, culturing WT mouse BM cells in the presence of YRSACT for 3 d significantly stimulated MK expansion and maturation (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether this effect required TPO signaling through the c-mpl receptor (27), we compared cultures of BM cells from WT and c-mpl/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the latter contained fewer MKs, as expected, YRSACT caused a significant increase of c-mpl/ MKs and shift to higher ploidy, as seen with WT MKs (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, YRSACT and TPO added in combination to cultured WT BM cells yielded significantly more MKs than either alone (Fig 2C), particularly with ploidy 32N (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations indicate that YRSACT and TPO influence MK expansion and maturation through distinct and complementary mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a final control, we verified that YRSWT (23) had no effect on MK expansion (Fig 2 E and F), confirming that activation is essential for YRSACT function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since YRSWT and YRSACT were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with an identical procedure, these results also rule out the possibility of a confounding influence of endotoxin contamination on the described effects of YRSACT on MKs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Naturally_Occurring_YRS_Splicing_Variant_Has_a_Biological_Activity_Similar_to_YRSACT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsequent to the initiation of this work, natural splice variants of YRS were identified in different human tissues and cells (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these variants (YRSSV-N13; SI Appendix, Fig S2A), reported to be expressed in leukocyte, lung, and spleen, originates from an exon-skipping event that links two YRS segments in a way that should liberate critical elements in each and thereby mimic YRSACT (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expressed and purified this natural YRS variant and found that, similar to YRSACT, it increased the number of MKs in mouse BM cell cultures, particularly those with higher ploidy (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological role of a naturally occurring variant such as YRSSV-N13 as opposed to proteolysis-derived YRSACT is a topic of future interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MKs_Induced_by_YRSACT_in_Culture_Contain_a_Unique_Sca-1+F4_80+_Population  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Addition of YRSACT to mouse BM cell cultures markedly increased the number of adherent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, or in close proximity to adherent cells, we identified a population of large cells that expressed the specific MK marker GPIb but, unexpectedly, also the stem cell marker Sca-1 and the monocyte/macrophage marker F4/80 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there was no expansion of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs in BM cell cultures treated with TPO or IL-6 instead of YRSACT (Fig 3B), indicating that expanding this MK population is not a common property of agents stimulating platelet production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sca-1 is a recognized stem cell marker that is not normally expressed by differentiated cells such as MKs (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, freshly isolated WT mouse BM cells contained only a small proportion (4.5 ± 0.6%, n = 4) of mature polyploid MKs gated on CD41 expression, and that on forward scatter (FSC) were also positive for Sca-1 and F4/80 (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics of Sca-1+F4/80+ MK induction was tested in WT mouse BM cell cultures monitored daily for 3 d after addition of YRSACT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative increase of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs was progressive in the first 2 d and changed only marginally on day 3 (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the latter day, a comparison of Sca-1 and F4/80-positive or negative MKs (Fig 3 F and G) showed that the positive ones had a higher FSC indicative of advanced maturation (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YRSACT_Administration_Stimulates_the_Expansion_of_Sca-1+F4_80+_MKs_in_the_BM_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether Sca-1+F4/80+ MK expansion occurs in vivo as well as in BM cell cultures, we injected two YRSACT doses, or vehicle control, into mice rendered thrombocytopenic by anti-GPIb antibody treatment and then monitored the platelet count (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BM cells harvested 2 d after the last YRSACT dose, the percentage of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs was significantly higher in treated than control mice (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with in vitro results, Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs with 32N ploidy were significantly more numerous in YRSACT-treated than in control mice (Fig 4C), while the ploidy distribution of Sca-1F4/80 MKs was not changed by YRSACT treatment (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, YRSACT selectively expands a distinct MK population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increase of this distinct MK population in the BM coincides with the timing of YRSACT-induced platelet count recovery from thrombocytopenia, suggesting that Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs may be crucial for rapid platelet replenishment in extreme conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YRSACT_Targets_Monocytic_Cells_to_Mediate_MK_Expansion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Induction of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs is a distinct effect of YRSACT, but because enhanced platelet production involves also Sca-1F4/80 MKs, the contribution of multiple mechanisms that may include direct targeting of hematopoietic progenitors and/or other BM cells is suggested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the effect of YRSACT using expandable CD41+ hematopoietic progenitors generated by transducing WT mouse BM cells with the LIM-homeobox 2 gene (Lhx2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has been used to generate myeloid, erythroid, and MK lineages from BM cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs/iPSCs) (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD41 (integrin IIb) is expressed on MKs, but also on myeloid-biased long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that develop in vitro and in vivo into committed MK progenitors and mature MKs (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In culture, 30 to 60% of Lhx2-transduced CD41+ cells (CD41+Lhx2) maintained the c-kit+, Sca-1+, Lin (KSL) phenotype and also produced high-ploidy MKs (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct treatment of CD41+Lhx2 cells with YRSACT failed to influence MK expansion; in contrast, supernatant from YRSACT-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (hPBMC) cultures increased significantly not only the number of MKs but also the proportion of those with ploidy 16N and 32N (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that one or more distinct cell lineages present in BM cultures likely mediate MK expansion by YRSACT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this hypothesis further, we measured 59 cytokines in culture supernatants of WT BM cells treated or not with YRSACT and identified 11 that increased more than twofold (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included IL-6, IL-1, and VEGF-A, all known to stimulate megakaryopoiesis and/or thrombopoiesis (3336).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether monocytes/macrophages, which support stress-induced erythroblast proliferation and survival (37, 38), also mediate YRSACT effects on megakaryopoiesis, we injected YRSACT into WT mice previously treated with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes to deplete macrophages or PBS-encapsulated liposomes as control (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total BM cell numbers were not different in the two groups (Fig 5D, Left), but clodronate-treated mice had fewer MKs and fewer TER119+ erythrocytes than controls (Fig 5D, Middle and Right), consistent with macrophages mediating YRSACT-induced MK expansion and maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thrombopoietic_Activity_of_YRSACT_Is_Relevant_in_Human_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish that YRSACT influences human as well as mouse megakaryopoiesis, we used peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells from G-CSFtreated donors (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with mouse CD41+Lhx2 cells, direct YRSACT stimulation failed to boost MK development; in contrast, adding culture supernatant of YRSACT-treated hPBMCs increased the number of CD41+ MKs (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, iPS-derived human CD34+ cells (41) failed to respond directly to YRSACT, but MK expansion was seen after exposure to YRSACT-treated hPBMC culture supernatant (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested iPS-derived CD34+ cells generated from a patient with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this condition, MK expansion and differentiation are severely impaired as a consequence of mutations in the c-mpl gene (43) causing a defective response to TPO stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the normal counterpart, iPS-derived CD34+ cells from a CAMT patient failed to respond to YRSACT directly, but did so when exposed to YRSACT-treated hPBMC culture supernatant (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these findings show that YRSACT supports mouse and human MK expansion and maturation by stimulating monocyte/macrophage cytokine production independent of TPO signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IL-6_Plays_a_Pivotal_Role_in_Mediating_the_Effect_of_YRSACT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the monokines up-regulated by YRSACT, IL-6known to enhance thrombopoiesis in vivo (33, 34)increased dose-dependently in YRSACT-treated culture supernatants of monocytic THP-1 cells and hPBMCs, but not of T-cell lymphoblast-like Jurkat cells (SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In culture supernatants of mouse BM cells exposed to different YRSACT doses, IL-6 levels increased in parallel with MK and F4/80+ monocyte/macrophage numbers (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF-A and IL-1 also increased in response to YRSACT, but relatively less than IL-6, with peak levels in culture supernatants not exceeding 50 and 5 pg/mL, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When WT mouse BM cells were treated with YRSACT in the presence of antiIL-6Rblocking antibodies, MK expansion was attenuated (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, addition of YRSACT to cultures of BM cells from IL-6/ mice failed to influence MK expansion, while the percentage of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs was significantly higher than in untreated IL-6/ BM cell cultures (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that induction of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs and enhancement of megakaryopoiesis through up-regulation of monocyte/macrophage IL-6 secretion are independent and separate YRSACT functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Effect_of_YRSACT_Is_Dependent_on_the_Toll-Like_Receptor_MyD88_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We noted that many cytokines secreted by YRSACT-treated monocytic cells are regulated by NF-B (44) activated through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-initiated MyD88 signaling (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observationand the previous one that Pam3CSK4, a TLR2 ligand, promotes MK maturation (46)suggested that YRSACT binding to TLR2 on monocytic cells activates the MyD88/NF-B pathway to boost cytokine production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, YRSACT-treated hPBMC lysates enhanced IKK and IB phosphorylation (Fig 7C); this is known to be followed by phosphorylated IB degradation promoting NF-B nuclear translocation with expression of inflammatory cytokines (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, megakaryopoiesis was not enhanced (Fig 7D) following YRSACT stimulation of BM cells from mice lacking MyD88the adaptor for signaling downstream of all TLRs except TLR3 (47)and YRSACT failed to increase the platelet count of MyD88/ mice (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, YRSACT treatment of TLR2/ mouse BM cells enhanced megakaryopoiesis (Fig 7E), suggesting the involvement of other TLRs; coprecipitation by polyclonal anti-YRS antibodies of TLR2 and TLR4 from mixtures with YRSACT (Fig 7F) was in agreement with this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting a TLR4 role, YRSACT treatment of TLR2/ BM cells in the presence of TLR4-blocking antibodies reduced MK numbers, particularly of 16N ploidy, and decreased IL-6 levels in culture supernatants (SI Appendix, Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TLR2 and TLR4 may both contribute to YRSACT-induced stimulation of megakaryopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starting from this evidence, we investigated how activation could influence YRS function in stimulating megakaryopoiesis and found that, by coimmunoprecipitation, HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR4 bound YRSACT more robustly than YRSWT (SI Appendix, Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that without proteolytic cleavage, YRSWT does not efficiently bind to TLRs nor influence megakaryopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our result shown in Fig 2E and also with previous work (18, 23), these results indicate that a conformational change in activated YRS contributes to the repurposing of its function by enhancing binding to one or more receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
YRSACT_Mediates_MK-Biased_Hematopoiesis_Under_Stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the condition of homeostasis, MKs are thought to arise from a common MK/erythroid progenitor (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, alternative pathways originating from MK-biased or MK-primed HSCs that bypass intermediate commitment stages have emerged (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These direct pathways to megakaryopoiesis are gaining consideration for their relevance to platelet production in nonhomeostatic stress situations (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, stem-like megakaryocyte-committed progenitors (SL-MKPs) have been identified as an emergency machinery to produce platelets under inflammatory stress (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate previously unrecognized ex-translational activities of YRSACT that delineate a pathway to megakaryopoiesis based on two functions: (i) inducing a distinct subset of MKs; and (ii) up-regulating secretion of monokines, including IL-6, that support MK expansion and, ultimately, platelet production (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The YRSACT-induced Sca-1+F4/80+ subset of MKs, identified as such by expression of platelet-specific GPIb and large size indicating polyploidy, has not been previously characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these MKs, as opposed to less_than10% of those Sca-1F4/80, are also c-kit+ (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggestsconsistent with the notion that HSCs with high c-kit expression are biased toward MK development (52)that Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs originate directly from the HSC compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether they are linked to the previously reported SL-MKPs activated by stress inflammatory signals (51) remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that YRS secreted and activated under inflammatory stress such as viral infection may mediate the activation of SL-MKPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter, however, were identified among the population of LincKit+CD150+CD48CD34 long-term HSCs, with exclusion of cells expressing leukocyte/monocyte markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the progenitors of Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs may be close to but distinct from SL-MKPs; it remains to be established whether the expression of F4/80 indicates the potential of developing also into myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YRSACT, promoting inflammatory cytokine secretion through TLR/MyD88, may stimulate Sca-1+F4/80+ hematopoietic progenitors in a distinct MK-biased pathway leading to rapid thrombopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this concept, Sca-1+F4/80+ MKs appear in the mouse BM predominantly during the early phase of recovery from thrombocytopenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration here that YRSACT activates TLR/MyD88 signaling and cytokine secretion in human HSCs suggests the possibility of a similar function in human diseases associated with platelet depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it remains to be elucidated whether YRS levels in plasma are increased in patients under inflammatory stress or with hematological disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TLR_MyD88_Signaling_Pathway_Plays_a_Pivotal_Role_in_Mediating_the_Effect_of_YRSACT_on_MK_Expansion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We showed that interaction of YRSACT with TLR4and possibly other TLRsactivates the TLR/MyD88/NF-B pathway to stimulate secretion of monokines, particularly IL-6, which in turn promote MK expansion and maturation to enhance platelet production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same TLR/MyD88 pathway activated during YRSACT-induced megakaryopoiesis is also a key player in the host innate immune defense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are also engaged by host-derived molecules in response to tissue damage or stress (53), including heat shock proteins and high-mobility group box-1 protein (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like YRSACT, these ligands engage multiple TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the YRS that is secreted under stress and activated by leukocyte elastase, or a secreted active splice, may become available to stimulate TLR-based pathways, including but not limited to megakaryopoiesis (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to stress-stimulated signaling through TLR pathways, YRS translocates to the nucleus under stress and acts through its nuclear partners that include PARP-1 and TRIM28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress conditions that promote translocation to the nucleus include serum starvation and oxidative damage, and trigger pathways for cell rescue (9, 16, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mobilization of TLR pathways by YRS for megakaryopoiesis is only one of the several roles in stress responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether secreted YRS can also enter cells and the nucleus is a subject for future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recruitment_of_tRNA_Synthetases_for_Nontranslational_Functions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and tRNAs arose early in evolution as determinants of the genetic code rules, and thus were available for recruitment to novel roles during development of the tree of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both became involved in signaling pathways beyond protein synthesis, and both depended on modifications secondary to splitting (or fragmentation) to repurpose themselves (1, 5762).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tRNA synthetases, the addition of new domains correlates with progression in evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the UNE-S domain added to seryl-tRNA synthetase correlates with the passage from the invertebrate open to the vertebrate closed circulatory system (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UNE-S, which is dispensable for aminoacylation, harbors a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is essential to bring SerRS into the nucleus, where it regulates VEGF-A signaling and vascular development (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impairing NLS function prevents nuclear import and development of the closed circulatory system, explaining the selective pressure to retain UNE-S throughout vertebrate evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the ELR and EMAPII domains, needed for YRS ex-translational activities, were added at the stage of insects during evolution and then retained up to humans (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, TLRs (65) and functional analogs of IL-6 (66), both important for mediating YRSACT functions, have been identified in a variety of invertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, blood cells (thrombocytes) with functions similar to mammalian platelets are found only in vertebrates (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these cells evolved from the hemocyte of invertebrates, the mechanisms of nontranslational YRS functions identified here may have been operating before the appearance of mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By linking ex-translational functions to the essential genetic code through tRNAs and tRNA synthetases, these new functions were under the highest selective pressure for retention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exactly how this linkage occurred is unclear, but clues can be found in tryptophanyl- and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both, the amino acid-binding pocket captures either a protruding receptor side chain or a natural small ligand that matches the specificity of the pocket (16, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early development of binding pockets based on the architectures of amino acid side chains created a diversity of sites that could be exploited for the recognition of amino acid side chains protruding from other protein surfaces or recapitulated in cellular ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether protruding tyrosyl side chains on proteins in the megakaryopoiesis pathway have a role in the recruitment of YRS is open to further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_Management_of_Thrombocytopenia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinant IL-6 has been considered for treatment of thrombocytopenia, but serious side effects, such as fever, fatigue, and dilution anemia, presumably caused by the frequent systemic administration needed for pharmacological activity, have limited evaluation of its efficacy (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, among other possibilities, YRSACT provides a new approach to introduce IL-6 as a therapeutic agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed a single i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of YRSACT was sufficient to increase blood platelet counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with activation of monocytes/macrophages occurring in the BM microenvironment so that IL-6 release and pharmacological activity are localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, IL-6 plasma levels were minimally changed by YRSACT injection in mice (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, while less prominent than IL-6, we detected other cytokines (e.g., VEGF) that are released upon YRSACT administration and also are known for thrombopoietic activities (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it remains possible that other factors are also part of the polybiology associated with YRSACT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TPO mimetics are Food and Drug Administration-approved as a second-line treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their use is associated with risks that include thrombosis, BM fibrosis, and acute myelogenous leukemia (71, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, alternative treatment options are desired for thrombocytopenic patients unresponsive to TPO mimetics, such as those affected by CAMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because YRSACT can stimulate megakaryocyte expansion and maturation independent of TPO signaling, it could represent a first step toward the pharmacological treatment of pathological conditions for which TPO mimetics are not effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because of a distinct mechanism of action, YRSACT may enhance therapeutic benefits of TPO mimetics when coadministered in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, application of TPO mimetics is restricted due to limited efficacy in specific pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, earlier studies testing recombinant TPO or TPO mimetics in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia did not show significant shortening of critical thrombocytopenia (7375).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, further studies of ways to optimize the treatment regimen are ongoing (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because YRSACT induces megakaryocyte-biased hematopoiesis and accelerates platelet recovery, it may provide benefits in combination with TPO mimetics, and thereby provide the needed path toward optimization of the treatment regimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our demonstration of ex vivo activity suggests the possibility of YRSACT being used to boost the yield of cell culture-based methods for preparation of platelet concentrates for transfusions (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our data demonstrate the effectiveness of YRSACT in expanding MKs in a CAMT patient, and thus strongly suggest YRSACT as a bridging supportive therapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have demonstrated repurposing of an aaRS for hematopoiesis and platelet biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that endogenous YRS, either proteolytically cleaved or expressed as activated splicing variants, plays a role in regulating megakaryopoiesis under stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TPO-independent action of YRSACT and induction of MK-biased hematopoiesis leading to rapid thrombopoiesis suggest the therapeutic utility of YRSACT for hematological diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
