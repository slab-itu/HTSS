Polarized light modulates light-dependent magnetic compass orientation in birds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds have a light-dependent magnetic compass that is suggested to be mediated by light-induced, biochemical reactions in specialized magnetoreceptor molecules in the avian retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural skylight reaching these receptors is always directional and to some degree polarized, which has largely been neglected in biophysical models and behavioral experiments on the magnetic compass sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Training zebra finches in a spatial orientation assay, we show that overhead polarized light modulates radical pair-based magnetic compass orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic compass is only operational when overhead polarized light is aligned parallel, but not perpendicular, to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal fundamentally new properties of the light-dependent magnetoreceptor that significantly advance our understanding of how birds, and animals in general, perceive the Earths magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Magnetoreception of the light-dependent magnetic compass in birds is suggested to be mediated by a radical-pair mechanism taking place in the avian retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biophysical models on magnetic field effects on radical pairs generally assume that the light activating the magnetoreceptor molecules is nondirectional and unpolarized, and that light absorption is isotropic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, natural skylight enters the avian retina unidirectionally, through the cornea and the lens, and is often partially polarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cryptochromes, the putative magnetoreceptor molecules, absorb light anisotropically, i.e., they preferentially absorb light of a specific direction and polarization, implying that the light-dependent magnetic compass is intrinsically polarization sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test putative interactions between the avian magnetic compass and polarized light, we developed a spatial orientation assay and trained zebra finches to magnetic and/or overhead polarized light cues in a four-arm plus maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds did not use overhead polarized light near the zenith for sky compass orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, overhead polarized light modulated light-dependent magnetic compass orientation, i.e., how the birds perceive the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds were well oriented when tested with the polarized light axis aligned parallel to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the polarized light axis was aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the birds became disoriented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are the first behavioral evidence to our knowledge for a direct interaction between polarized light and the light-dependent magnetic compass in an animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reveal a fundamentally new property of the radical pair-based magnetoreceptor with key implications for how birds and other animals perceive the Earths magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A) Illustration of the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plus maze is centered on a wooden table inside the magnetic coil (Merritt design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of each of the four arms, the food reward (during training trials only) is hidden in one of the four red trays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cylinder in the center of the maze shows the release device from where the birds are remotely released to explore the maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unpolarized light source is centered above the maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear polarizers and/or depolarizers can be inserted in a filter holder just below the light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (BE) Orientation of zebra finches trained to relocate a food reward in the spatial orientation assay using magnetic compass cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Individual birds were trained to mN (Top) or mS (Bottom) under unpolarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orientation of birds tested under the training condition (C), in a vertical magnetic field (V) without any directional magnetic information (D), and in the presence of a 1.4 MHz RF field at 80 nT (RF) (E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (FJ) Orientation of zebra finches trained to relocate a food reward using magnetic compass cues in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned parallel to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (F) Individual birds were trained to either mN or mS, with the e-vector of overhead polarized light (violet double-headed arrow) aligned parallel to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orientation of birds tested in the presence of both cues (training condition) (G), in the presence of magnetic compass cues only (H), in a vertical magnetic field with access to polarized light only (I), and with magnetic compass and polarized light cues aligned perpendicular to each other (J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maze illustrations: Green arrows with mN symbolize training or testing in the presence of an Earth-strength magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gray boxes at the end of the maze indicate the food trays, with the red tray containing the reward (training only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four violet double arrows in the center of the maze indicate unpolarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular diagrams: Each dot represents the orientation of one bird; the arrows give the mean orientation of the group of birds; solid arrows with two dotted lines indicate significantly orientated groups (P less_than 0.05, Rayleigh test) with 95% CI; dashed arrows indicate nonsignificant distributions; P values of the Rayleigh test are given inside each circular diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MC, magnetic compass; PL, polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Watson U2 test statistics are given for comparisons between experimental groups: ***P less_than 0.001; **P less_than 0.01; *P less_than 0.05; ns, P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detailed statistics, see Tables S1S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Zebra_Finches_Use_a_Radical_Pair-Based_Magnetic_Compass_for_Spatial_Orientation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zebra finches trained to relocate a food reward in the spatial orientation assay using directional magnetic compass information learned the task rapidly, in only three to four training trials (Fig 1B and Table S1) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds trained to find the reward at either magnetic north (mN) or magnetic south (mS) were significantly oriented along the trained magnetic compass axis when subsequently tested in the presence of a magnetic field aligned in one of four topographic directions [P less_than 0.05, confidence interval (CI) test; Fig 1C; see SI Results and Discussion for discussion of axial orientation].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested in a vertical magnetic field, the birds oriented toward topographic northwest (Fig 1D) thus likely resorted to a fixed topographic response in the absence of trained directional cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which magnetoreception mechanism was involved in this learned response, we tested the zebra finches in the presence of a weak radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of low-intensity, oscillating RF fields at 0.110 MHz (intensity less_than1 T) is the most powerful tool to test for an involvement of a radical-pair mechanism in the primary magnetoreception process (19, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RF fields have been shown to influence the interconversion between the singlet and triplet excited states of the radical pairs and, thereby, alter or eliminate the effects produced by the Earths magnetic field (19, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with predictions from the radical-pair theory, zebra finches tested in the presence of such RF fields at the Larmor frequency (1.4 MHz; intensity 80 nT) were disoriented (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure to exhibit consistent orientation to the magnetic field in the presence of the RF field agrees with previous studies (19, 20, 35, 36) and provides the critical evidence that a radical-pair mechanism is involved in the trained magnetic orientation response shown by the zebra finches in the spatial orientation assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interaction_Between_Magnetic_Compass_and_Polarized_Light_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate putative interactions between polarized light and magnetic compass reception, we trained zebra finches to magnetic compass cues in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned parallel to the horizontal component of the magnetic field (Fig 1F and Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds tested under the training condition were significantly oriented along the trained magnetic compass/polarized light axis (P less_than 0.05, CI test; Fig 1G), comparable to the responses of birds trained and tested to magnetic compass cues under unpolarized light (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, birds trained in the presence of both cues were not significantly oriented when tested under either cue presented alone during the probe trial (Fig 1 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the birds tested for magnetic compass orientation under unpolarized light (Fig 1H) was significantly different from the control group (Fig 1G), suggesting that the birds were not able to orient with the magnetic compass anymore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds tested in the presence of the overhead polarized light axis in a vertical magnetic field (Fig 1I) showed a tendency to orient along the trained polarized light axis, similar to the control group (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when tested with the two cues aligned perpendicularly to each other, the birds tended to orient along the trained magnetic compass axis, but perpendicular to the polarized light axis (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difficulty of the birds trained to magnetic compass cues in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned parallel to the magnetic field to orient with access to only one of the two cues was surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests one of the following explanations: (i) magnetic compass and overhead polarized light cues are two independent compass cues that have to be recalled together when learned together, (ii) changes in the polarization state of the overhead light alter the visual perception of the maze to such a degree that the birds become confused or create secondary cues that the birds could use for orientation, or (iii) overhead polarized light directly interacts with the magnetic compass and modulates how the birds perceive the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

No_Evidence_for_Overhead_Polarized_Light_as_Independent_Compass_Cue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the birds learned the spatial orientation task using two independent directional cues that both had to be available to solve the task (explanation 1), we would expect both the magnetic field and overhead polarized light to be independent compass cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The avian magnetic compass is clearly an independent compass and functional without polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our zebra finches were able to learn to orient to magnetic compass cues in the maze under unpolarized light (Fig 1C; see also Fig 3 B and F below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is further supported by numerous experiments testing magnetic compass orientation in birds under fully depolarized light (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 1822).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear, however, whether birds use overhead polarized light as an independent compass cue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is convincing evidence that birds use directional information from the skylight polarization pattern for orientation and compass calibration (reviewed by refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 and 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that polarized light cues from different parts of the sky have different functions (30, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that migratory songbirds calibrate their magnetic compass exclusively with information from the vertically aligned e-vector near the horizon at sunrise and sunset, and not with polarized light information from the zenith (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sunrise/sunset polarized light cues from the lower half of the sky are suggested to be used as compass cues to determine the departure direction (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not known, however, whether birds use overhead polarized light information near the zenith for sky compass orientation and whether they can perceive polarized light at times of the day other than sunrise and sunset (25, 26, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether birds can use an overhead polarized light axis as an independent orientation cue, we trained zebra finches to find a food reward in the two trays along the e-vector axis of overhead polarized light (Fig 2A and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite repeated training, however, the birds did not consistently orient with respect of the trained polarized light axis (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They seemed to be unable to use the e-vector alignment for orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore unlikely that polarized light cues near the zenith provide independent directional information for compass orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skylight polarization compass and calibration reference sense(s) thus appear to respond uniquely to e-vectors of light from the region of sky at intermediate elevations and/or to vertical e-vectors near the horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disorientation of the zebra finches trained to magnetic compass cues in the presence of polarized light aligned parallel to the magnetic field and tested under either one of the two cues separately (Fig 1 H and I) can therefore not be explained by two independent compass cues that have to be recalled together when learned together (explanation 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

No_Innate_Orientation_Response_to_Polarized_Light_or_Change_in_Visual_Perception_of_Maze_by_Polarized_Light  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the overhead polarized light axis does not provide compass information, could it change the visual environment in the maze or introduce light artifacts instead (explanation 2)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak alignment along the polarization axis shown by the birds trained to magnetic compass and polarized light cues and tested under polarized light cues in a vertical magnetic field (Fig 1I) may be explained by an innate alignment response along the polarization axis or by light artifacts produced by differential reflection of the polarized light on the maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the zebra finches did not show any innate preference for a specific polarization axis, as demonstrated by the random orientation of birds trained to magnetic compass cues (Fig 2C and Table S5) and then tested in the presence of overhead polarized light in a vertical magnetic field (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total lack of orientation suggests that the birds did not use any light intensity artifacts to orient in the maze, or that the polarized light generated a response pattern that the birds mistook for that generated by the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that the birds tested with the two cues aligned perpendicular to each other (Fig 1J) tended to orient perpendicular to the polarized light axis further argues against an experimental artifact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak alignment of the birds along the polarization axis in Fig 1I could instead be due to a calibration or transfer of information during training between the magnetic compass and polarized light cues in the lower part of the surroundings close to the maze arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is to date no evidence that birds have true polarization vision (44, 45), i.e., that they can differentiate the angle of the e-vector of polarized light independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to train zebra finches to polarized light stimuli presented on modified liquid crystal display screens in a two-choice conditioning experiment (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in control experiments where we trained zebra finches to color cues in the maze, we found no significant differences between birds tested under different alignments of overhead polarized light (Fig S1 and Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is unlikely that the changes in the polarization state of the overhead light altered the birds visual perception of the maze to such a degree that the birds became disoriented or created secondary cues that they could use for orientation (explanation 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_Interaction_of_Polarized_Light_with_the_Primary_Magnetic_Compass_Receptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If overhead polarized light does not provide directional information (explanation 1) and the behavior of the birds in Fig 1 can be explained by neither an innate preference for a polarization axis nor by artifacts (explanation 2), could polarized light instead play a role in radical pair-based magnetoreception (explanation 3)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we used zebra finches that had never been trained to polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We trained these birds to magnetic compass cues under unpolarized light (Fig 3A and Tables S8 and S9) and tested them in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field (Fig 3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of the birds in the different testing conditions was strikingly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control group that was tested for magnetic compass cues under unpolarized light was oriented along the trained magnetic field axis (Fig 3B; P less_than 0.05, CI test), comparable to the control group in Fig 1C (P  greater than  0.2, U2 = 0.07, Watson U2 test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds tested with polarized light aligned parallel to the magnetic field were likewise well oriented along the trained magnetic compass/polarized light axis (Fig 3C; P less_than 0.05, CI test), suggesting that the parallel alignment was not affecting magnetic compass reception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the group of birds tested in the presence of perpendicularly aligned polarized light showed no significant pattern of orientation (Fig 3D), indicating that the perception of the magnetic field had changed to such a degree that made magnetic compass information unreadable or uninterpretable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under natural conditions, the degree of polarized skylight is generally less than 80% (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the observed effects of polarized light on the magnetic compass were present also at lower degrees of polarization, we repeated the experiments by using 50% instead of 100% polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We trained birds under unpolarized light to relocate the food reward by using magnetic compass information at mN, mS, magnetic east (mE), or magnetic west (mW) (Fig 3E and Tables S10 and S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds subsequently tested under the training condition were significantly oriented toward the trained magnetic direction (Fig 3F; P less_than 0.05, CI test; see SI Text for discussion of unimodal response).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds tested in the presence of 50% polarized light aligned parallel to the magnetic field were significantly oriented along the trained magnetic compass axis (Fig 3G; P less_than 0.05, CI test), comparable to the response observed under 100% polarized light (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested with the axis of 50% polarized light aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the birds were not able to orient anymore (Fig 3H), as has been observed under 100% polarized light (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Polarized_Light-Sensitive_Magnetic_Compass  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The differential magnetic compass response shown by zebra finches tested in the presence of polarized light aligned parallel (Fig 3 B and C) or perpendicular (Fig 3 F and G) to the magnetic field demonstrates that overhead polarized light affects light-dependent magnetic compass orientation and, thereby, changes the birds perception of the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds were equally well oriented under unpolarized as under fully or partially polarized light with the e-vector axis aligned parallel to the horizontal component of the magnetic field (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C and 3 B, C, F, and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, birds tested with the two cues aligned perpendicularly to each other did not seem to be able to properly read the magnetic compass information (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1J and 3 D and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, polarized light aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field appears to directly interfere with the primary magnetoreception of the light-dependent magnetic compass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If true, we would expect birds not to be able to learn to orient by using their magnetic compass when trained with overhead polarized light aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, zebra finches trained and tested for magnetic compass orientation in the presence of polarized light aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field were totally disoriented (Fig 4 and Table S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Magnetic compass orientation was affected in our zebra finches by overhead polarized light not only when polarization was maximal (100%), but also when only 50% of the light was polarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the magnetic compass might be affected by overhead polarized light also under natural conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the degree of skylight polarization is 50% only under optimal weather conditions and close to sunrise and sunset when the e-vector is aligned roughly along the geographic northsouth axis (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effect would therefore only arise in geographic areas with magnetic declinations diverging significantly from 0° and/or at high latitudes close to summer and winter solstice, when the sun rises and sets close to geographic north/south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If magnetic compass orientation is impaired by perpendicularly aligned polarized light of less_than50%, it would affect animals primarily near solar noon, when the e-vector near the zenith is aligned along the geographic eastwest axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, the interaction of polarized light with the magnetic compass could be a mechanism to weaken the magnetic modulation pattern and, thereby, minimize a potential interference with the visual system during times of day when vision is crucial for other tasks, like e.g., foraging or predator detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural selection is likely to have influenced the design of the magnetic compass to reduce the confounding effects of the varying e-vector alignments of overhead polarization to a minimum, while using the advantages of the photo- and polarization selection effects (see below; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of overhead polarized light on magnetic compass orientation demonstrated here reveal a fundamentally new property of the light-dependent, radical pair-based magnetic compass that has hitherto largely been neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide convincing evidence that the primary magnetoreceptor is photo- and polarization selective, and thereby provide the foundation for a magnetic compass based on light-induced rotational order, as suggested by recent biophysical models (13, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property relaxes the requirement for an intrinsic rotational order of the receptor molecules (as long as rotational motion is restricted) and opens for putative cryptochrome magnetoreceptors distributed in any, also nonrandomly oriented, cells in the avian retina (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects are expected to occur also in other organisms orienting with a light-dependent magnetic compass based on radical-pair reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings thereby add a new dimension to the understanding of how not only birds, but animals in general, perceive the Earths magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Axial_vs_Unimodal_Control_Directions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Axial orientation along the trained axis in birds trained to magnetic compass cues and tested for magnetic compass orientation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 C and G and 3B) instead of the expected unimodal orientation relative to the reward is commonly observed in magnetic training assays (35, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may (i) be related to the unnatural situation not allowing the distinction between the correct side of the magnetic field axis, or (ii) be the effect of anthropogenic noise in the experimental setup (48), making the magnetic modulation pattern difficult to see.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, electromagnetic noise from the control switches in the box regulating the power to the magnetic coils was likely the problem, because after exchanging some of them with new ones, the orientation of the birds became unimodal (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_Experiments__Training_to_Color_Cues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We carried out control experiments not involving magnetic or polarized light cues to test whether RF fields or overhead polarized light had any effects on the birds orientation not related to the magnetic compass sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds were trained in the spatial orientation assay in the local geomagnetic field to locate a food reward in a red tray from four trays of different colors that were always arranged in the same relative order (red, blue, white, and yellow, in a clockwise order; Fig S1A and Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Training and testing procedures were identical to those in the magnetic/polarized light assay, with the exception that total training quality = 3 was considered a valid training, because most birds learned this task easily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds that had been successfully trained in at least three different arms were included in the analysis, whereas birds that spent  greater than 540 frames in the center were excluded for statistical reasons (see SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The birds readily learned this task and were highly significantly oriented toward the red tray in the probe trial (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their orientation was affected by neither the RF field nor the addition of overhead polarized light (Fig S1 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that RF fields and overhead polarized light per se have no effects on the birds spatial orientation abilities that are not related to the magnetic compass sense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We trained female and male zebra finches, at least 6 mo of age, to use directional magnetic compass and/or polarized light cues to locate a hidden food reward in a visually symmetric four-arm (plus) maze (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maze was centered in a magnetic coil (Merritt design), thus the magnetic field could be directed toward any of the four maze arms [mN at geographic north (gN), geographic south (gS), geographic east (gE), or geographic west (gW)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual birds were trained to find a food reward at the end of one of the maze arms under one of three training conditions (for example, see Fig S2): (i) birds were trained to either mN or mS (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B, 2C, and 3A) or to mN, mS, mE, or mW (Fig 3E) under unpolarized light; (ii) birds were trained to either mN or mS in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned parallel (Fig 1F) or perpendicular (Fig 4A) to the horizontal component of the magnetic field; or (iii) birds were trained along an overhead polarized light axis, i.e., they were rewarded in the two trays on either side of the polarized light axis, in a vertical magnetic field (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds that successfully passed the training trails were tested in a probe trial without food reward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were allowed to search the maze for 90 s, and their movement was tracked with a custom-made video tracking program that automatically counted the number of frames that the bird spent in each of the four arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of an individual bird was calculated from the time (number of frames) spent in each of the four maze arms during the 90-s trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual mean orientations for birds tested in the presence of a magnetic field were then recalculated relative to mN (0°, taking into consideration that different individuals were tested in one of four magnetic fields), and relative to the trained magnetic compass direction (correcting for whether a bird was trained to mN, mS, mE, or mW; Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the individual mean orientation of birds tested in the presence of polarized light was recalculated relative to the alignment of the polarized light axis during the probe trial, and relative to the trained polarized light axis (where applicable), whereby the north and east end of the polarization axis was set to 0°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each experimental condition, the mean orientation of the group of birds was calculated by using vector addition of the individual mean directions, disregarding the individual mean vector lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all groups, we compared whether a unimodal or axial distribution best fitted the orientation data by calculating the mean vector length for the two distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the axial distributions, we doubled the individual mean angles (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the distribution that best described the data, i.e., the one with the larger mean vector length, the Rayleigh test was performed to test for significance (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the CI test to examine whether the groups of birds were oriented relative to the trained magnetic direction or polarized light axis, i.e., whether the trained direction was included in the 95% CI of the distributions of birds in significantly oriented groups (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Watson U2 tests were used to test for differences between experimental groups (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods, Fig S3, and Table S13 for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were carried out in accordance with ethical permission from the Malmö-Lund Animal Ethics Committee, permits M 17608, M 15811 and M 42312.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Site_and_Model_Species  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All behavioral experiments were carried out between 2011 and 2015 at Stensoffa Ecological Field Station (55° 42 N, 13° 25 E) near Lund, Sweden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used zebra finches as model species, both females and males at least 6 mo of age from our breeding colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds were housed in a wooden building, and trained and tested in a separate testing building made entirely of wood and nonmagnetic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The testing building was divided into the main testing area with the experimental setup and a small booth for the experimenter with a video screen to observe the birds, switches for the arena lights, and the opening mechanism for the release device (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The birds were trained to use directional magnetic compass and/or polarized light cues to locate a hidden food reward in a visually symmetrical four-arm plus maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maze (1.2 × 1.2 m; Fig 1A) was made of transparent Plexiglas and covered with plastic mesh on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A red tray was located at the end of each arm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the trainings, the food reward (millet seeds) was placed in the tray, where it was invisible to the birds until they jumped onto the tray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the center of the maze, a release device (Plexiglas cylinder with a mesh top) could be remotely lifted to release the bird into the maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The maze was centered in a magnetic coil (Merritt design; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49; 2 × 2 × 2 m), which was aligned along the cardinal magnetic directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coil had two wraps along the northsouth (NS) and one wrap along the eastwest (EW) axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the wraps along the NS axis was used to compensate the horizontal component of the natural magnetic field, which resulted in a vertical magnetic field without directional information (total intensity of 47,550 nT; remaining horizontal component less_than100 nT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining two wraps, one each along the NS and EW axis, were used to create the testing fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The testing fields had the same magnetic properties as the natural magnetic field (total intensity 50,600 nT, inclination = 69.8°), but could be directed toward any of the four maze arms (mN at gN, gS, gE, or gW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before each training/testing session, the alignment of the magnetic field was confirmed with a magnetic compass, and on a regular basis, the intensities of the magnetic field components were checked with a high-speed three-axis digital fluxgate magnetometer (Applied Physics Systems; Model 693).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This magnetic coil setup is comparable to doubly wrapped coils (49), because during any experimental condition, with the exception of the vertical magnetic field condition, two coil wraps carry a current, eliminating any potential biases produced by the coil (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 12-V car batteries with custom-made regulators to power the magnetic coil to avoid RF contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline RF fields in the experimental area were measured with a magnetic field probe (Probe 901 from E & H Near Field set 7405; ETS Lindgren) connected to a spectrum analyzer (Agilent N9340B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum analyzer measured the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field between 10 kHz and 6 MHz for a period of 10 min at 3-kHz resolution bandwidth (1,850 measurement points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic coil, arena lights, and camera were switched on during the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured fields were below 0.1 nT (Fig S3), thus well below the values known to disturb the orientation of birds (19, 20, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All light reaching the maze came from a central light source (ø 0.3 m) located 1 m above the maze (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full-spectrum white light produced by halogen and/or light-emitting diode lights was led through at least one translucent Plexiglas diffuser before reaching the maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overhead, linearly polarized light was produced by a circular sheet of a linear polarizer (ø 0.3 m; P500, 3Dlens Cooperation; transmittance 43%, polarizing efficiency 99.9%, spectral range 380700 nm) inserted just below the overhead light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce the 100% polarized light, we used one sheet of the polarizer, covered with one layer of wax paper on one side that fully depolarized the light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the filter could be flipped to either side to be used as either polarizer or depolarizer, keeping light irradiance constant between conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce 50% linearly polarized light, we added five sheets of transparent mylar/polyester to the sheet of polarizer, with their polarization axes aligned at various angles relative to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact degree of linear polarization was determined with a spectrophotometer (QE65000; Ocean Optics) with a mounted linear polarizer (Glan-Thompson Calcite Polarizer; GTH5M-A) and a quarter wave retarder (Fresnel Rhomb Retarder, FR600QM; both from Thorlabs) and by photo-polarimetric methods as described in Horváth and Varjú (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize potential brightness cues due to reflection of polarized light, we covered the roof and walls of the magnetic coil with matte white fabric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light measurements with a radiometer (IL 1400 with detector SHD033; International Light Technologies) confirmed that there were no detectable differences between different alignments of polarized light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light irradiance levels in the center of the maze varied slightly between testing years (2011: 0.11.8 µW/m2; 2012: 9.4 µW/m2; 2013: 9.416.5 µW/m2; 2014: 9.416.5 µW/m2; 2015: 3.75 µW/m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they were consistent within a birds experimental series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no differences in orientation between birds tested at different light irradiance levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Training_and_Testing_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual birds were trained to find the food reward under one of three training conditions (Fig S2 A and B): (i) birds were trained under unpolarized light to either mN or mS (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B, 2C, and 3A) or mN, mS, mE, or mW (Fig 3E); (ii) birds were trained to either mN or mS in the presence of overhead polarized light aligned parallel (Fig 1F) or perpendicular (Fig 4A) to the horizontal component of the magnetic field; (iii) birds were trained along an overhead polarized light axis, i.e., they were rewarded in the two trays on either side of the polarized light axis, in a vertical magnetic field (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experimental condition, we balanced the number of birds trained to the different magnetic training directions as much as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within an experimental series (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 BE and FJ and 3 AD and EH), individual birds were repeatedly trained under the same training condition and tested in probe trials under different experimental conditions (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of the different experimental conditions was pseudorandomized as much as possible between individuals to avoid biases or effects of testing order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no differences in orientation between birds tested in different orders, thus there is no indication that the birds performance improved or worsened over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 4 were only tested under one experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each experimental condition, only the first valid probe trial (see below) of an individual bird was included, thus each individual bird is only represented once in each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We balanced the number of birds tested in either one of the four magnetic testing fields and/or the two polarized light axes in each experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All probe trials were recorded for subsequent analysis with a CCD camera connected to a digital video recorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The camera was located above the maze in the center of the overhead light source (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current (12 VDC) to the camera was filtered with an RF filter (1JX2454) from Dearborn Electronics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The movies were reduced to 12 frames per second, and the position of each bird was automatically tracked with a video tracking program written in MATLAB 2013b (The MathWorks Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program provided a complete track of the movements of each bird and automatically determined the start of the track, which was when the bird entered the first arm (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program then automatically counted the number of frames that the bird spent in each of the four arms during the 90-s trial, ensuring that the person analyzing the videos had no influence on the final outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary tests showed that the first arm choice did not provide a reliable measure of orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the orientation of an individual bird was calculated from the number of frames the bird spent in each of the four maze arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not distinguish where exactly in the arm the bird was located, but grouped all frames in the north arm as 0°, in the east arm as 90°, in the south arm as 180° and in the west arm as 270°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of frames in each arm direction was summed up by vector addition that resulted in an individual mean direction relative to gN and an individual mean vector length for each track as illustrated in Fig S2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To guarantee that the mean vectors were based on comparable numbers of frames between animals, we excluded probe trials from subsequent analyses when a bird spent less than half of the time (less_than45 s or less_than540 frames) in one of the arms (for numbers of excluded experiments per condition, see Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The individual mean orientation of birds tested in the presence of a magnetic field was recalculated (Fig S2E) relative to mN (0°, taking into consideration that different individuals were tested in one of four magnetic fields), and/or relative to the trained magnetic compass direction (correcting for whether a bird was trained to mN or mS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the individual mean orientation of birds tested in the presence of polarized light was recalculated (Fig S2E) relative to the polarized light axis and/or relative to the trained polarized light axis, whereby the north and east end of the polarized light axis was defined as 0°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trained polarized light direction was defined as 0° for training along the polarized light axis (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1F and 2A), or 90° for training perpendicular to the polarized light axis (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each experimental condition, the mean orientation of the group of birds was calculated by using vector addition of the individual mean directions, disregarding the individual mean vector lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We always calculated the mean orientation relative to topographic North (Tables S1S12) and relative to the last trained arm (all P  greater than  0.1), which both act as important controls for topographic biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all groups, we compared whether a unimodal or axial distribution best fitted the orientation data by calculating the mean vector length for the two distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the axial distributions, we doubled the individual mean angles as described in Batschelet (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the distribution that best described the data, i.e., the one with the larger mean vector length, the Rayleigh test was performed to test for significance (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the CI test to examine whether significantly oriented groups of birds were oriented relative to the trained magnetic direction or polarized light axis, i.e., whether the trained direction was included in the 95% CI of the distributions of birds in the different experimental groups (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Watson U2 tests were used to test for differences in the mean direction and/or spread between significantly oriented groups (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where two groups with mean vector lengths r  greater than  0.75 were compared (Fig S1), we used a WatsonWilliam F test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All circular statistics were carried out either with the Matlab Toolbox CircStat by Philipp Berens and Marc J. Velasco or Oriana Version 3 (Kovach Computing Services).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
