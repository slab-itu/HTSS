Evidence for the principle of minimal frustration in the evolution of protein folding landscapes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A detailed understanding of how different sequences that fold into the same structure affect the folding energy landscape presents one of the current challenges of the protein folding field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principle of minimal frustration suggests that naturally evolved proteins with the same structure should have similar folding rates and that modulation of thermodynamic stability should occur via unfolding rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally tested this hypothesis using 15 different thioredoxins, with sequences either obtained from the extant organisms or resurrected using ancestral sequence reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that all of these proteins fold with similar rates and that their dramatic differences in stability are because of the differences in the unfolding rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theoretical and experimental studies have firmly established that protein folding can be described by a funneled energy landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This funneled energy landscape is the result of foldable protein sequences evolving following the principle of minimal frustration, which allows proteins to rapidly fold to their native biologically functional conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a protein family with a given functional fold, the principle of minimal frustration suggests that, independent of sequence, all proteins within this family should fold with similar rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, depending on the optimal living temperature of the organism, proteins also need to modulate their thermodynamic stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the difference in thermodynamic stability should be primarily caused by differences in the unfolding rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis experimentally, we performed comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analyses of 15 different proteins from the thioredoxin family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight of these thioredoxins were extant proteins from psychrophilic, mesophilic, or thermophilic organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other seven protein sequences were obtained using ancestral sequence reconstruction and can be dated back over 4 billion years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that all studied proteins fold with very similar rates but unfold with rates that differ up to three orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unfolding rates correlate well with the thermodynamic stability of the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, proteins that unfold slower are more resistant to proteolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide direct experimental support to the principle of minimal frustration hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Protein_Family  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trx is a class of essential small (12 kDa) redox proteins found in nearly all known organisms (47) and believed to be present in early life (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They function as antioxidants by facilitating the reduction of other proteins through cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The / protein fold of Trx consists of five antiparallel -sheets sandwiched by four -helices and is highly conserved (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied extant Trx from eight different organisms, including those living under extreme environmental conditions: psychrophilic (optimal growth temperature from 5 to 10 °C) Shewanella benthica (TrxSB) and Colwellia piezophilia (TrxCP); mesophilic (optimal growth temperature of 37 °C) Escherichia coli (TrxEC) and Homo sapiens (TrxHS); and thermophilic (optimal growth temperature of 70 °C) Thermus thermophilus (TrxTT), Pyrococcus yayanosii (TrxPY), Methanococcus jannaschii (TrxMJ), and Sulfolobus tokodaii (TrxST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extant_Trx_Stabilities_and_Folding_Unfolding_Kinetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies of stability of Trxs indicated that these proteins are highly stable (41, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, even at pH 2, the transition temperatures range between 40 and 95 °C (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variation in the transition temperatures seems to correlate with the optimal growth temperatures of the corresponding organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Trxs from thermophilic organisms, such as TrxTT, TrxPY, TrxMJ, and TrxST, have much higher Tm values than their mesophilic homologs TrxEC and TrxHS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mesophilic proteins, in turn, have higher melting temperatures that the proteins from psychrophilic organisms TrxSB and TrxCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation of the growth temperature and protein stability is also evident from the denaturant-induced unfolding studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows urea-induced unfolding profiles for the same set of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The midpoint for the urea-induced unfolding transitions ranges from 1.5 to 7 M. For one protein, thermophilic TrxST, the midpoint is probably even higher, because no indication of unfolding was observed at 10 M urea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How are the differences in thermodynamic stabilities manifested in the kinetic stabilities?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in thermodynamic stability can be caused by the differences in the folding rates, unfolding rates, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus performed characterization of the folding and unfolding of extant Trx variants using standard stopped flow methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C shows the experimentally measured folding and unfolding rate, kobs, in the form of chevrons for the extant Trx variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each data point on the chevron is an average of at least five independently measured traces, and their SDs are reported as the error bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is evident from these chevron plots that there is minimal variation in the rates of Trx folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They all fold in the absence of denaturant in 80 ± 60 ms, and the difference between the fastest (20 ms) and the slowest (140 ms) is only sevenfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More notably, inspection of the chevron plots shown in Fig 2D reveals that the variation in the unfolding rates is dramatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolation to a zero denaturant concentration gives unfolding rate constants in the range between 7 and 22,000 s [6 d; i.e., 3,000-fold difference between the fastest (TrxCP) and the slowest (TrxPY) unfolding Trx proteins].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the unfolding rates correlate with stability, whereas folding rates show little correlation with stability within the extant Trx protein family (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that the differences in stabilities of extant Trx are largely caused by the differences in the unfolding rates of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ancestral_Trx_Stabilities_and_Folding_Unfolding_Kinetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarity of the folding rates among extant Trx proteins is not an unexpected finding, because we are assessing the kinetics of a specific fold, and there are several reports correlating various topology metrics to folding kinetic rates (4952).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the observed robust folding rates suggest that the Trx energy landscapes are unfrustrated (3, 5, 29, 36, 53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation, in turn, implies that the folding of extant proteins of the Trx family obeys the principle of minimal frustration and that variations in stability are caused by the unfolding rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Was this part of the evolutionary considerations?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To answer this question, we turned our attention to the analysis of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the Trx proteins for which sequences were obtained from ASR (41, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASR is a bioinformatics technique that allows sequence extrapolation from extant protein sequences back to their common ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been used to resurrect ancestral nodes for a number of proteins and shown to produce catalytically and/or functionally active proteins (4042, 5658).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences for the ancestral Trx proteins were obtained using maximum likelihood sequence reconstruction, targeting several Precambrian nodes during Trx evolution (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seven sequences that were studied here are last animal and fungi common ancestor (TrxLAFCA), last eukaryotic common ancestor (TrxLECA), last bacterial common ancestor (TrxLBCA), last -proteobacteria common ancestor (TrxLGPCA), archaea/eukaryota common ancestor (TrxAECA), last cyanobacterial, deinococcus and thermus common ancestor (TrxLPBCA), and last archaeal common ancestor (TrxLACA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sequences were dated back to over 4 billion years, thus enabling us to probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding/unfolding for proteins with sequences that arguably represent a wide evolutionary timespan (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the crystal structures of these proteins have been determined and support the high conservation of the Trx protein fold (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thermodynamic stabilities of the ancestral Trx proteins at pH 2 are compared in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the extant Trx proteins, ancestral Trx variants showed significant variation in their transition temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins that are dated earlier on the evolutionary tree (e.g., LACA and AECA) have higher Tm values than the more recent proteins, such as LECA and LAFCA, which in turn, are more stable than TrxEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium urea-induced unfolding profiles also support this correlation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in transition temperatures at pH 2 agree well with the Tm values obtained at pH 7 (Fig S1), indicating a generality of the stability trend (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of folding/unfolding experiments for ancestral Trx variants measured using standard stopped flow methods are presented in the form of chevron plots in Fig 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, as in the case of the extant Trx proteins, the folding rates of ancestral Trx are very similar, whereas the unfolding rates vary dramatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation might suggest that the principle of minimal frustration played a role in the sequence selection early on in evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both ancestral and extant Trx proteins maintain strong correlation of increasing apparent unfolding barrier (i.e., decrease in the unfolding rate) with increase in thermodynamic stability, whereas the apparent folding barrier (as defined by the folding rates) remains independent of the thermodynamic stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal and kinetic stabilization conferred to the oldest ancestral variants is comparable with the most stable extant Trx proteins (e.g., TrxPY and TrxMJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation that both extant and ancestral Trx proteins fold with similar rates directly supports the assumption that protein sequences have evolved with minimal energetic frustration so as to rapidly fold into their stable 3D states (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also clear that the differences in thermodynamic stabilities are primarily caused by differences in unfolding rates for this protein family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlation_of_Kinetic_Stability_with_Resistance_to_Proteolysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The variation in the unfolding rate defines kinetic (unfolding rate) stability of proteins, and it was argued that one of the important consequences of the kinetic stability is to protect proteins from proteolytic degradation (5961).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the correlation of the kinetic stability and resistance to proteolysis, we treated Trx samples with pepsin and thermolysin (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both proteases have very broad sequence specificity but very different pH activity profiles: pepsin has maximal activity at acidic pH (pH 2.0), whereas thermolysin is maximally active at neutral pH (pH 7.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both pepsin and thermolysin resistance directly correlate with the unfolding rates at pH 2.0 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the thermolysin resistance directly correlates with the unfolding rates measured previously for a subset of Trx variants at pH 7.0 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation holds for both extant and ancestral Trx variants, supporting the notion that, independent of the pH, high kinetic stability indeed confers proteins with greater resistance to proteolytic digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of the Trx functional fold using extant proteins from organisms inhabiting a variety of living temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compared the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of eight extant proteins with seven Trx proteins obtained through ASR with an evolutionary timespan of 4 billion years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main goal was to use this model protein family for studying the evolution of protein folding and unfolding rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that, despite a dramatic difference in the thermodynamic stabilities, Trx proteins fold with a very similar rate, and the variation in thermodynamic stability is largely defined by the unfolding rates (i.e., the more thermodynamically stable proteins are kinetically more stable as well).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation in kinetic stability correlates with the resistance against proteolytic degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that differences in thermodynamic stability are largely defined by the differences in unfolding rates based on 15 different proteins from the Trx family seems to be specific not only to this protein family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carstensen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) compared stabilities and folding kinetics of modern ()8-barrel protein HisF with its designed ancestral homolog Sym1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors found that Sym1 shows the same folding mechanism as HisF and that the higher thermodynamic stability of Sym1 is caused by major changes in the unfolding rates (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, compilation of literature data for other protein families, although not as extensive as this study and limited to extant proteins, shows very similar trends (Fig 5) (i.e., the stability within a given protein structural family is largely modulated by the unfolding rates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding can be mapped to the funneled landscape, in which the transition state for a given protein fold remains minimally frustrated and modulation of the thermodynamic stability is achieved primarily through the optimization of the interactions in the native state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The illustration of the likely scenario of such effect, mapped onto a hypothetical folding energy landscape, is shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, it remains to be seen if other ancestrally reconstructed proteins maintain similar kinetic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they do, ASR may be an efficient way to engineer kinetically stable enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein_Expression__Purification__and_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gene sequences of extant Trx proteins were codon-optimized and synthesized (Blue Heron Biotechnology Inc.) for expression in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA sequences of ancestral Trx proteins were optimized in a similar manner as described previously (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences for the extant and ancestral Trxs are given in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His6 tags were engineered at the N terminus of all protein sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmids containing genes for the extant and ancestral proteins were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and cells were grown at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the cell density reached 0.8 optical units at 600 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested after 6 h of induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All proteins were purified to homogeneity under native conditions using nickel- nitrilotriacetic acid (Novagen; Merck KGaA) affinity resin followed by size exclusion column chromatography according to previously published protocols (6365).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purities and identities of the recombinant proteins were confirmed by SDS gels and MALDI-TOF MS as previously described (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, a single major peak was observed with a mass within 25 Da of that expected on the basis of the amino acid sequence (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficients listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oligomerization state of all Trxs was characterized via analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge at pH values 3.0 (30 mM glycine-HCl), 5.5, and 7.0 (30 mM sodium cacodylate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm using either short- or long-column cells, and samples were allowed to equilibrate at three different rotor speeds at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global analysis of the centrifugation profiles was done as previously described (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S3 shows molecular masses obtained from AUC experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Scanning_Calorimetry_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a VP-DSC instrument (Microcal/GE-Healthcare) at a scan rate of 1.5°/min using protein concentrations of about 1.0 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buffers used were 30 mM glycine-HCl for pH values 23.5 experiments and 30 mM sodium-cacodylate for pH 7.0 experiments (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were extensively dialyzed against the corresponding buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw DSC data were analyzed using the Origin-DSC (OriginLab) software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global fitting of the heat capacity profiles was done using in-house scripts using the nonlinear regression (NLREG) routine (68, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equilibrium_Stability_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initially, all Trx protein stocks were extensively dialyzed in acidified water and diluted 20-fold into 30 mM glycine-HCl or buffered urea solutions adjusted to pH 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dilutions were done to final protein concentrations of 410 M depending on their fluorophore quantum yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stock protein samples were diluted into buffered urea with concentrations incrementing up to 9.5 M and incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Tryptophan emission spectra were collected as a function of urea concentration using a fluorescence plate reader (TECAN Infinite M1000 Pro) in a 384-well black plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plate and samples were thermostated in the instrument at room temperature (23 °C ± 1 °C) for 5 min before data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation was done at 295 nm with a gain of 150.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 450 nm in 1-nm increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxMJ does not have a tryptophan; therefore, tyrosine emission fluorescence was used instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trx proteins that did not produce a significant intensity change were additionally characterized via far-UV CD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urea unfolding profiles (intensity at 355 nm vs. urea concentration) were fitted globally for all Trx variants according to the linear extrapolation model (70, 71) using in-house written NLREG scripts as previously described (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Kinetic_Stopped_Flow_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All Trx protein samples were prepared as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data for chevron plots were collected by standard stopped flow methods on a JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter operating in fluorescence mode that was equipped with an SFM 300 mixing module (BioLogic Science Instruments) containing a high density (HDS) mixer and a 30-µL FC-15 observation cuvette (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buffer containing 30 mM glycine-HCl adjusted to pH 2 was used for all kinetic experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Folding and unfolding reactions were initiated by a 20-fold dilution of protein-buffered stock solutions (80200 µM) with the desired buffered urea concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of slow kinetics of unfolding, equilibration in buffered urea was required before refolding experiments could be successfully initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reagent syringes, mixing chamber, and observation cuvette were thermostated at 20 °C using a circulating water bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence emission intensity from an N-WG 320-nm (N-WG 305 nm for TrxMJ) cutoff filter (BioLogic Science Instruments) was collected after excitation at 295 nm (280 nm for TrxMJ) through a 3-nm slit from a mercury lamp source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voltages applied to the photomultiplier tube were set constant based on the fluorescence signal intensity at maximum amplitude (920 V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Trx model system required multiexponential fits with a slow phase related to proline isomerization (7476).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pertinent fastest folding and unfolding phases are reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rate constants, kobs, were obtained using stretched exponential as previously described (73):I(t)=pbt+yo+Aexp(±kobst),[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where I(t) is fluorescence intensity as a function of time, yo is the initial fluorescence intensity, A is the amplitude of the change between initial and final fluorescence intensities, kobs is the observed kinetic rate constant associated with the fluorescence intensity relaxation, and pb is the sloping baseline correction for the photobleaching effect used in the Bio-Kine32 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All traces were corrected for instrumental dead time (6 ms) before fitting, because some Trx protein variants showed significantly fast kobs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The natural logarithms of the kobs are plotted as a function of urea concentration in the form of chevron plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each data point on the chevron plot is an average of five individual traces, and errors are taken as the SDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolated kf(H2O) and ku(H2O) values were obtained by globally fitting the chevrons of all Trx variants to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 below (77) using in-house scripts for the NLREG data-fitting package:ln(kobs)=ln[exp(ln(kf(H2O))+mf[urea]RT)+exp(ln(ku(H2O))+mu[urea]RT)],[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where kf(H2O) and ku(H2O) are the folding and unfolding rates in the absence of denaturant, respectively, and mf and mu are the kinetic folding and unfolding m values (measured in kilojoules per mole per molar), respectively (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent folding/unfolding barriers have been calculated as Gfol/unf#=RTln(kf/u), where R is the universal gas constant (8.184 J/mol K), and T is the temperature (Kelvin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteolytic_Digestion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extant and resurrected Trx variants were subjected to proteolytic digestion to assess their kinetic stabilities at two pH values using appropriate proteases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the acidic range, pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich) digestion was done in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 2.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteolysis were carried out at 37 ± 1 °C, with a protein/enzyme mass ratio of 10:1 and a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the desired digestion lapse time, an aliquot was removed and quenched with 50% (wt/vol) ammonium hydroxide solution to a final concentration of 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the neutral range, thermolysin (Sigma-Aldrich) digestion was done in 50 mM sodium phosphate and 0.5 mM calcium chloride, pH 7 buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteolysis was carried out at 50 ± 1 °C, with a protein/enzyme mass ratio of 10:1 and a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the desired digestion lapse time, an aliquot was removed and quenched with 10% (vol/vol) formic acid to a final concentration of 0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein aliquots were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 20 °C until SDS/PAGE gels were ran.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were diluted in a 1:1 ratio with 2× bromophenol dye containing -mercaptoethanol and resolved on precast 420% (wt/vol) Precise Protein SDS/PAGE gels (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and subsequently, they were destained and scanned at 1,200-dots per inch resolution using a flatbed scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Band intensities were analyzed with ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because some of the proteins were highly resistant to proteolysis, even at elevated temperatures, the t1/2 could not be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we based our analysis on the fraction of the native band remaining in solution after 2 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
