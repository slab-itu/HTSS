Rapid genome reshaping by multiple-gene loss after whole-genome duplication in teleost fish suggested by mathematical modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All genes are duplicated by whole-genome duplication (WGD), reverting in number over time, but the actual timing of genome reshaping through gene loss remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the spatiotemporal loss/persistence pattern of 6,892 gene lineage pairs after the teleost-specific WGD, using careful orthology assignment and a reliable time-calibrated tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that massive gene loss did occur in the first 60 My, mainly due to events involving the simultaneous loss of multiple redundant genes, and the rate of loss then slowed to an approximately constant level for the subsequent 250 My.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar genomic gene arrangements within teleosts imply that rapid gene loss led to the reshaping of the teleost genomes before their major divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is believed to be a significant source of major evolutionary innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redundant genes resulting from WGD are thought to be lost or acquire new functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the rates of gene loss and thus temporal process of genome reshaping after WGD remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WGD shared by all teleost fish, one-half of all jawed vertebrates, was more recent than the two ancient WGDs that occurred before the origin of jawed vertebrates, and thus lends itself to analysis of gene loss and genome reshaping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a newly developed orthology identification pipeline, we inferred the postteleost-specific WGD evolutionary histories of 6,892 protein-coding genes from nine phylogenetically representative teleost genomes on a time-calibrated tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that rapid gene loss did occur in the first 60 My, with a loss of more than 7080% of duplicated genes, and produced similar genomic gene arrangements within teleosts in that relatively short time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematical modeling suggests that rapid gene loss occurred mainly by events involving simultaneous loss of multiple genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the subsequent 250 My were characterized by slow and steady loss of individual genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our pipeline also identified about 1,100 shared single-copy genes that are inferred to have become singletons before the divergence of clupeocephalan teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our comparative genome analysis suggests that rapid gene loss just after the WGD reshaped teleost genomes before the major divergence, and provides a useful set of marker genes for future phylogenetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inferred spatiotemporal process of gene loss and persistence after TGD in teleost ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The estimated numbers of gene loss events in the teleost phylogeny, time-scaled tree of vertebrates (11, 41) with the timing of genome duplication events at the base of vertebrates (VGD1/2) and teleosts (TGD), and the number of extant species (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species used in this study are connected by solid branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers were parsimoniously inferred from the presence or absence of TGD-derived gene lineage pairs belonging to 6,892 orthogroups and mapped onto the time points of TGD (306 Mya), nodes ag (a: 245 Mya; b: 158; c: 120; d: 105; e: 41; f: 164; g: 86) (11), and h (74 Mya) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the left side of the tree, ortholog arrangements are compared between representatives (connected by bold branches in the tree) by CIRCOS (circos.ca) using orthology information for 5,655 orthogroups belonging to the 1to1 category (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Definition of terms relating to WGD events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An orthogroup is a monophyletic group containing WGD-derived paralogs (gene lineages) of all focal species (Sp1) and orthologs of their sister species (Sp2), ignoring lineage-specific gene duplications (GeneA-1 and -1) or gene loss (GeneA-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Approximation of the pattern of the number of gene loss and persistence events associated with TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated number of retained paired gene lineages at nodes a to h and current teleosts (Ca, Ze, Co, Ti, Pl, Me, St, Te, and Fu) were used to compare the fit of the one-phase [e2t (14)] and two-phase models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Region of C detailing the recent pattern of gene loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid and dashed curves have been corrected upward to remove the bias expected to result from parsimony analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approximations are effectively insensitive to fluctuations in the estimated numbers of gene lineage pairs and times for the TGD event and ancestral nodes (a to h) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolutionary scenario is essentially unchanged if the number of gene lineage pairs estimated without the BS 70% criterion or the divergence times estimated by nuclear gene (28)/mitochondrial genome (42) data were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the two-phase model can be roughly approximated by a double-exponential curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Automated_Pipeline_Analysis_for_WGD-Derived_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the spatiotemporal loss/persistence pattern of TGD-derived gene (hereafter gene lineage; Fig 1B) pairs, we accurately identified orthologous and paralogous relationships between tetrapod and teleost genes (involving TGD-derived gene lineage pairs in teleosts) by conducting rigorous phylogenetic and reconciliation analyses with the species tree for all protein-coding gene sequences retrieved mainly from Ensembl (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homologous gene clades identified in the above procedure were regarded as orthogroups, including paralogous gene lineages derived from TGD in teleosts and their orthologous one in tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We regard gene loss as the absence of a gene from a specific species in an identified orthogroup, according to well-established genomic and gene annotation datasets such as provided by Ensembl (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study (Fig 1A), we are specifically focusing on gene loss events during post TGD evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using human and medaka protein-coding gene sequences as representatives of tetrapods and teleosts, we used the following three-step approach in our novel automated pipeline: candidate ortholog selection using BLAST search and neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis (Fig S1A), orthogroup identification by ML gene tree analysis using the candidates (Fig S1B), and reliable orthogroup recognition using a 70% bootstrap criterion (BS 70% criterion) (Materials and Methods) (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to identify all reliable orthogroups of bony vertebrates, we integrated the results from a medaka-centered analysis into those from a human-centered analysis (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the sensitivity of our automated pipeline by comparing with the dataset used in our previous study (13) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that such an approach could easily be adapted to other evolutionary lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In general, our pipeline analysis differs from Ensembl in the following points: (i) taxon sampling with special reference to the TGD by distinguishing duplicates derived from WGD or lineage-specific duplication and identifying reciprocal patterns of gene lineage loss among teleost lineages (but see SI Text); (ii) sophisticated gene tree estimation by deleting distantly related sequences such as those from nonbilaterians, potentially erroneous sequences published in Ensembl, and ambiguously aligned sites; and (iii) filtering of orthologs/paralogs by excluding ambiguously estimated gene trees using a specific criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses of the type we have performed always involve finding a balance between overly permissive acceptance of both real and spurious data, and overzealous rejection of data that may be real but fails to pass certain criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have chosen to take a conservative approach, consistent with our objective of producing a reliable set of marker genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that our main conclusions are not artifacts of the strict criteria (e.g., BS 70% criterion and long-branch deletion option in Fig S1), we have also performed our analysis without them, as reported in multiple places below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our conclusions regarding the temporal pattern of gene loss are shown to be robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orthology_Paralogy_Identification_from_Genome-Wide_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Automated analysis using 20,368 human and 19,686 medaka protein-coding genes inferred 6,892 orthogroups with high reliability (Table 1, Dataset S1, and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 6,892 orthogroups, we identified 1,237 pairs of TGD-derived gene lineages in more than one teleost species (1to2 category) (ignoring lineage-specific duplications).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 5,655 orthogroups (1to1 category) had only one gene lineage in all nine teleost species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These orthogroups can be considered to have lost one of the pair of TGD-derived gene lineages during the period between the TGD event and the basal separation of otocephalan and neoteleost lineages (Fig 1A, node a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above estimation indicates that, in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of nine teleosts, orthology/paralogy of a total of 8,129 (5,655 singleton + 2 × 1,237 duplicate pairs) loci (gene lineages) was successfully elucidated for the 6,892 (5,655 + 1,237) orthogroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that 18% (1,237/6,892) of gene lineages in the MRCA have remained paired since the TGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the BS 70% criterion was not applied, 28% (4,262/15,353) of the gene lineages remained paired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The orthologs belonging to 6,892 orthogroups were plotted along each chromosome to compare conserved synteny blocks among species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result (Fig 1A, Left, Fig S2, and Dataset S2) shows that the genomes of teleosts are organized similarly to each other but not to those of tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that 141 GO terms were significantly overrepresented among the TGD-derived paired gene lineages, with Padj less_than 0.05 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the highly significant genes associated with the 141 terms were those of proteins involved in signaling (e.g., glutamate receptor signaling pathway) and ion transport (e.g., ion channel complex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, five GO terms were significantly underrepresented among TGD-derived paired gene lineages, with Padj less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These underrepresented genes included those for housekeeping functions such as RNA processing and DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporal_Loss_Persistence_Pattern_of_Genes_After_TGD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the proportion of TGD-derived gene lineage pairs remaining in the genomes of current teleosts, we counted the number of pairs in each teleost (SI Text and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of the number of gene lineage pairs in the ancestral genome soon after TGD, on average 10% (692/6,892) of them (Fig 1A, Right) remained paired until the present and 16% (2,398/15,353) remained when the BS 70% criterion was not used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these numbers of TGD-derived paired gene lineages, we parsimoniously estimated the ancestral number of gene lineage pairs at each node (ah in Fig 1A) of the teleost time-calibrated phylogenetic tree (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting the number of gene lineage pairs at every node against its divergence time, we estimated the temporal pattern of gene loss/persistence (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated pattern suggests that many of the gene lineage pairs (5,655/6,892) rapidly lost one gene lineage during the initial 60 My (from the TGD to node a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, on average, more than one-half (692/1,237) of the gene lineage pairs in the ancestor of the nine teleosts (node a) persisted over the next 250 My (from node a to the present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-phase curve was also observed when the BS 70% criterion was not used (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Development_of_a_Two-Phase_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a new model for the observed temporal pattern of gene loss after the TGD event (Fig 1C) to better understand the process and mechanism of gene loss after WGD (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after a WGD, unusually high levels of redundancy are to be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At such exceptional times, overall selection against gene loss may be reduced, allowing the loss of multiple genes in single events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such situations may be relatively rare over long evolutionary timescales, their possibility should be considered to allow for a full understanding of post-WGD gene loss patterns over both short and long timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we have intentionally incorporated the possibility of events that result in the simultaneous loss of multiple genes in our new model (two-phase model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two-phase model is an extension of the classical one-phase model based on exponential decay of duplicated genes (14), extended to incorporate the possibility of simultaneous loss of multiple genes (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have uncovered examples of the deletion of contiguous clusters of genes or large chromosomal segments (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some genes dispersed throughout a genome and coregulated (but not necessarily colocalized) may be simultaneously inactivated (16) by the deletion of a common enhancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was further extended to estimate the number of gene lineage pairs counted parsimoniously using the species phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the estimated temporal pattern of gene loss/persistence is fitted by the two-phase model (Fig 1C, solid line) far better than the classic one-phase model (dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new model fits the recent part of the process particularly well (Fig 1D; from node a to the present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapid_Reshaping_of_Teleost_Genome_After_TGD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study suggests that rapid reshaping of the teleost genome occurred just after the TGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis showed the rapid loss of genes generated by TGD just after the event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 82% [5,655/(5,655 + 1,237)] of those gene lineages [72% (11,091/15,353) without the BS 70% criterion] were rapidly lost during the initial 60 My (first phase), whereas the paired gene lineages still present 60 My after the WGD (node a in Fig 1C) were more slowly lost after that time (second phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although rapid gene loss after the TGD was so far suggested based on the analysis of specific gene families (8, 13), the actual temporal gene loss pattern along with a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree has not previously been examined by genome-wide analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the conventional view that WGD is followed by rapid gene loss has been questioned by studies of gene loss rate after lineage-specific WGD events in salmonid (17) and carp (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be resolved through detailed comparative analyses using the pipeline and gene loss model developed in this study in the light of the different possible mechanisms such as autopolyploidization vs. allopolyploidization (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that the rapid gene loss after the TGD detected here may be one of the key factors that shaped the basic structure of teleost genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the close similarity of gene arrangements between zebrafish and medaka genomes (Fig 1A, Left), we propose that the genome reshaping after the TGD was rapid, mostly completed before the divergence of zebrafish and other major teleosts (node a in Fig 1 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the eel transcriptome (SI Text and Dataset S3) suggested that the temporal gene loss pattern around the divergence of the eel lineage was also explained by the two-phase model, at least according to our tree-based analysis, implying that the genome reshaping was almost finished before the divergence of all extant teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that the ancestral genomic structure of bony vertebrates is conserved between ancestors of amniotes and just before TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene arrangements of human and medaka genomes (Fig 1A, Left) is different probably due to the TGD and following genomic reshaping discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those of human and chicken exhibit substantial similarity, although partial chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., fusions, fissions, and translocations) are reported within amniotes (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our preliminary analysis of the garpike genome implied that garpike has similar genomic gene arrangements as amniotes, in particular compared with chicken (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations further support the notion that the ancestral teleost genome was rapidly reshaped with extensive rearrangements after the TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGD-associated genomic rearrangement is also reported in angiosperms (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of the garpike genome is expected to provide a comprehensive view of the origin and early evolution of bony vertebrate genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanisms_of_Gene_Loss_After_TGD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the mechanisms of gene loss after the WGD event, we fitted different loss models to the observed data (Fig 1C) and found that the two-phase model, which includes multiple gene loss, provided a better fit than did the single gene loss model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a major cause of the rapid gene loss may have been multiple gene loss events, such as deletions of chromosomal segments containing multiple genes as suggested by studies of yeast (3), bird (21), and teleost (15) genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, inactivation of coregulated gene groups (cis-regulated gene sets [e.g., in plant (16)] and trans-regulated gene networks) might also be regarded as the simultaneous loss of multiple genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-annotated whole-genome data of representatives from the two basal teleost lineages will allow us to better trace the multiple-gene loss process in the first phase (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second phase of gene loss after TGD (Fig 1D), the loss rate could have slowed for two possible reasons, not mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the context of the two-phase model, the slow decay observed in the second phase can be explained by the decrease in loss of redundant multiple-gene blocks or coregulated gene groups, simply because fewer of them remain as time goes by after the WGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, there is the possible involvement of natural selection in retaining paired gene lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had originally speculated that the rate of the temporal gene loss pattern in the second phase was slowed mainly due to natural selection for the retention of paired gene lineages, each of which acquired different function, potentially by neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization and dosage constraints (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the existence of such selective forces, we added an additional parameter to model gene retention (specifying a fixed fraction of gene lineages for which both duplicates are marked as essential and thus protected from loss in the model) to the two-phase model and fitted it to the observed data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the most likely value of the parameter was estimated to be 0 (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this result indicates that our analysis of the temporal gene loss pattern cannot detect any selective force of gene retention, the analysis does not deny the existence of any such force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a general observation that many isozyme loci appear to be present in multiple copies in teleost lineages, although present as single copies in tetrapods (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 and references therein), implies the existence of such forces retaining the paired gene lineages derived from TGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Kassahn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) suggested that the TGD-derived paired gene lineages in teleost genomes generally show signs of having experienced subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization (22) from the analysis of protein domain repertoire and gene expression localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, an additional analysis of the shared preserved paired gene lineages across all nine teleosts (Fig S5) indicates that the number of such lineages (136 orthogroups) cannot be explained by chance (SI Text and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, an analysis comparing lengths of coding sequences (SI Text and Fig S6) indicated that the longer genes, likely containing more protein domains and motifs, are more common among 1to2 than 1to1 orthogroups, as shown in the previous studies (13, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses also imply that natural selection contributed to retention of some of the paired gene lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, if the redundant gene lineages mostly disappeared in the first phase through multiple gene loss (Fig S7), the low gene loss rate observed in the second phase (Fig 1D) may reflect general gene turnover of established genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the diversification of major lineages of teleosts [Fig 1A; 27,000 spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  placed in 40 orders (26)] seems to have occurred mainly in this second phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance_of_Orthology_Identification_for_Comparative_Genomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present gene tree-based pipeline can produce gene orthology identifications, anchoring orthologous or paralogous chromosomal regions (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a tree-based orthology identification approach may be crucial for comparative genome analysis in lineages that have experienced WGD such as flowering plants and budding yeast (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that tree-based analysis may fail to identify a gene that has evolved much more rapidly than other WGD-derived paired gene lineages (20), even if such genes might be important for teleost evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the inferred orthology of physically separated chromosomal regions, one may find additional orthologous genes, as well as the traces of early multiple gene deletions, that cannot be identified based solely by tree-based analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because our results are formulated in terms of gene lineages rather than individual genes, it is not straightforward to incorporate such a synteny analysis here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Marker_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It should be noted that our pipeline offers unique opportunities to establish a large set of orthology-confirmed phylogenetic marker genes for bony vertebrates (including teleosts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the phylogenetic relationships of teleosts have been analyzed using data obtained from mitochondrial genomes (27), nuclear genes [1020 or so nuclear single-copy genes (11, 28)], or conserved noncoding elements (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most relationships among major teleost lineages have been resolved but controversies remain, especially within the Percomorpha (27) due to the limited availability of reliable nuclear sequence markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For further progress in the molecular phylogenetics of vertebrates, a greater number of reliable, orthology-confirmed nuclear gene markers is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For teleosts, they are desired to be 1:1 single-copy genes (30) that have lost one of a pair after TGD but before teleost diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We successfully found about 1,100 genes (fish-evol.unit.oist.jp/db/TGD16/1139phyMarker_CDNAalignments.tar.gz) belonging to 1to1 orthogroups between four tetrapods and nine teleosts by excluding cases of reciprocal gene lineage loss between teleost lineages (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that such patterns of loss between otocephalan and neoteleost lineages are unrecognizable in the tree-based approach, some need more detailed assessment paying due attention to synteny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis suggests that rapid gene loss has left useful markers for the estimation of detailed phylogenetic relationships of teleosts and other vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BLAST_Search  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human and medaka protein-coding sequences (amino acids) were used as queries for a BLASTP search (31) against all protein-coding sequences in 17 selected animal genomes (see below) in Ensembl release 76 (12) except for lancelet (Assembly, version 1.0: genome.jgi.doe.gov/Brafl1/Brafl1.home.html) (Fig S1A1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include 13,937 protein-coding loci in fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), 50,817 (predictions) in lancelet (Branchiostoma floridae), 16,671 in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis), 10,415 in lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), 18,442 in Xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis), 18,596 in Anole (Anolis carolinensis), 15,508 in chicken (Gallus gallus), 20,368 (excluding genes on alternative genome assemblies and mitochondrial genes) in human (Homo sapiens), 23,042 in cave fish (Astyanax mexicanus), 26,459 in zebrafish (Danio rerio), 20,095 in cod (Gadus morhua), 21,437 in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), 20,379 in platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), 19,686 (excluding mitochondrial genes) in medaka (Oryzias latipes), 20,787 in stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), 19,602 in Tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis), and 18,523 in fugu (Takifugu rubripes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting BLAST top 10 hits were screened using an E-value cutoff of less_than103 (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where transcript variants existed for a single locus, only the longest sequence was used in the present analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Alignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary sequences of the proteins obtained by the BLASTP search (Fig S1A1) were aligned using MAFFT (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiple sequence alignments were trimmed by removing poorly aligned regions using TRIMAL 1.2 (33) with option gappyout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding cDNA sequences were forced onto the amino acid alignment using PAL2NAL (34) to generate nucleotide alignments for later comparative analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gene sequence was checked, and removed from the alignment as spurious BLAST hits (Fig S1A2) if the sequence was shorter than 55% of the length of the query sequence in the unambiguously aligned sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of removed BLAST hits ranged from 8% to 10%, leading to no significant change in our main conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Tree_Search  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by NJ and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods using the first and second codon positions of each gene sequence aligned with bootstrap analysis based upon 100 replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To select tetrapod/teleost ortholog candidates primarily from the BLASTP hit sequences, initially, NJ analysis was conducted using the software package Ape in R using the TN93 model (35) with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (36) (Fig S1A3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the resultant NJ tree, gene sequences that have three times longer branch length from the root than that of the query sequence were removed to avoid including dubious sequences (Fig S1A4), although the analysis without this option produced similar result (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resultant gene trees, however, often have some weakly supported nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such cases, one needs to revise ambiguous nodes in comparison with the topology of the broadly accepted phylogenetic relationshipsthe species tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we then conducted rearrangement/reconciliation analysis using a method implemented in NOTUNG (37) for the NJ (Fig S1A5) gene tree in comparison with the species tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first step, NOTUNG rearranges weakly supported nodes of the gene tree, to minimize duplication and extinction of genes, using parsimony with equal weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the threshold to 70% for bootstrap support values of nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the rearranged tree was reconciled with the species tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ortholog candidates were selected from the rearranged NJ tree (marked with open circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify orthologs and TGD-derived paired gene lineages, the selected ortholog candidates from rearranged NJ analysis were realigned and subjected to codon-partitioned ML analysis (Fig S1B6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis was performed by RAxML 7.2.8 (38), which invokes a rapid bootstrap analysis and search for the best scoring ML tree with the GTRGAMMA (general time-reversible (39) with the gamma) model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting ML trees were also subjected to rearrangement/reconciliation analysis for identification (Fig S1B7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene trees with excessively long branch lengths (i.e., 2.0 base substitution per site) between tetrapods and teleosts were removed from subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Criterion-Based_Orthogroup_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To select reliable orthogroups, the ML trees derived from rearrangement/reconciliation analysis were filtered using a criterion (BS 70% criterion) based upon the bootstrap value of key nodes (Fig S1C8): nodes BV (monophyly of the bony-vertebrate genes) and TO (monophyly of the teleost genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the filtration of orthogroups of 1to2 category, we evaluated bootstrap support values for two additional key nodes: nodes D1 and D2 (monophylies of daughter clades Teleost-1 and -2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a cutoff value, we set the bootstrap probability at 70% for the key nodes to avoid including orthogroups identified with ambiguous gene trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To investigate gene functions of orthogroups in the 1to2 category, GOs were analyzed using FuncAssociate 2.0 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GOs were assigned to each orthogroup on the basis of the Ensembl gene ID of the human ortholog as a representative of each orthogroup, because human genes are generally well characterized with respect to their gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the GO assignments, we tested whether the particular GOs were overrepresented or underrepresented in the 1to2-category orthogroups (1,102 including human genes) compared with all orthogroups belonging to 1to2 and 1to1 categories (6,264 including human genes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance of the odds ratio was assessed by Fishers exact test with adjusted P value (Padj) based on 1,000-fold replication of null-hypothesis simulations conducted by FuncAssociate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporal_Pattern_of_Gene_Loss_Persistence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall temporal pattern of gene loss/persistence following the TGD was explored on the basis of our orthogroup gene trees and time-calibrated teleost phylogeny (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, gene loss indicates the absence of a gene from a specific lineage in an identified orthogroup in the post-TGD evolution (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pipeline analysis, gene loss may be due to absence of sequences in the Ensembl database and/or sequencing errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence data retrieved from Ensembl (pep/cdna.all) does not include genes without detection of their product or prediction from sequence analysis of species comparison (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-76/fasta/homo_sapiens/pep/README in detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of gene lineage losses that occurred among ancestral nodes of the teleost tree (Fig 1A) was estimated using the parsimony method of Sato et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13) (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the estimated number of remaining gene lineage pairs after the TGD was used to plot the temporal pattern of gene loss (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this plot, the number of gene lineage pairs at TGD, ancestral nodes (a to h), and current teleosts (Ca, Ze, Co, Ti, Pl, Me, St, Te, and Fu) were used as the vertical coordinate, and the absolute time of the TGD and teleost divergence (11) was used as the horizontal coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed the two-phase model by extending the classical exponential model for single-gene loss (14) by including the possibility of multiple gene loss and by considering the underestimation bias of parsimony inferences (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data points were fitted by the one-phase [exponential: e2t (14)] and two-phase models of gene loss, and parameters were estimated by the least-squares method using the software package R. The time ranges of TGD and ancestral nodes were taken from the literature (11, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analysis of gene loss process, the tacit assumption was that the genome rediploidization processes have been completed before the divergence of clupeocephalan lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Orthology_Paralogy_Identification_from_Genome-Wide_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To accurately identify tetrapod/teleost orthologs and teleost genome duplication (TGD)-derived paralogs (paired gene lineages), orthogroups were estimated (Table 1) on the basis of phylogenetic analysis using all 40,054 protein-coding gene sequences from human (20,368) and medaka (19,686) as queries through our automated pipeline (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Automated_Pipeline  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the sensitivity of our automated pipeline (Fig S1) by analyzing the dataset used in our previous study (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies analyzed the TGD-derived paired gene lineages based on the metazoan gene trees obtained from EnsemblCompara (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the metazoan gene tree in EnsemblCompara may not be appropriate for the analysis of the genes derived from whole-genome duplications (WGDs), because the EnsemblCompara is not designed for such a purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our pilot study (13) used taxonomic sampling with special reference to the TGD-derived gene lineages by focusing on tetrapods and teleosts and manually conducted tree-based analysis, which we applied to this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based mainly on phylogenetic analysis, Sato et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13) explored teleost orthologs of 130 human protein-coding genes from four teleost genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, they identified 116 orthogroups between tetrapods and teleosts, and 45 pairs of TGD-derived gene lineages among them (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that 38.8% (45/116) of protein-coding gene lineages were still duplicated (paired) in the MRCA of the four teleosts after the TGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Application of our automated pipeline to the above 130 gene sequences produced almost the same result as that of Sato et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 130 genes, orthogroups were identified for 117 genes (Table S3 and fish-evol.unit.oist.jp/db/TGD16/SHN/SB70BL10/130results.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 48 were classified into the 1to2 category and 69 were classified into the 1to1 category (41.02% [48/(48+69)] gene lineage pairs in the MRCA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proportion (41.02%) obtained by the automated analysis in the present study is close to the 38.8% obtained by the manual analysis in Sato et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that our automated pipeline is reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we mainly used the BS 70% criterion to exclude results derived from ambiguous gene trees even though this reduced the ratio of the number of 1to2 orthogroups to that of 1to1 orthogroups (down to 30.9% [17/(17 + 38)]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underestimate of the number of 1to2 orthogroups compared with 1to1 orthogroups due to the use of the BS 70% criterion can be partly explained by the larger number of key nodes applied to the 1to2 orthogroups (three or four key nodes, BV, TO, D1, and/or D2, in Fig S1C8) compared with the 1to1 orthogroups (two key nodes, BV and TO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that our main conclusion is not changed by the strict BS 70% criterion, we also provided the estimates obtained from the analysis without the criterion in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Synteny_Information  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the distribution of orthologs and TGD-derived paired gene lineages by mapping ortholog/paralogs inferred in orthogroups of the 1to1 (5,655) and 1to2 (1,237) categories onto chromosomes (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare our synteny information with that of previous studies, we examined how many orthogroups of the 1to2 category are supported by previously published information on the results of analysis of a paralogous chromosomal region derived from WGD (5), namely doubly conserved synteny (DCS), in the medaka genome (supplementary table 15 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of the TGD-derived pair set estimated in this study and Kasahara et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) showed that 48% of orthogroups in our 1to2 category (Dataset S1) have DCS support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 52% of orthogroups were not supported by DCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inconsistencies with respect to Kasahara et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) would be reasonably explained by the following: in the DCS analysis, (i) an ortholog has been lost specifically in medaka but retained in some other teleosts, (ii) an ortholog has been lost only in human but retained in some other tetrapods, and (iii) synteny around the medaka ortholog was not conserved; and/or (iv) the identified gene lineage pairs derived from TGD or those from a local chromosomal duplication just after TGD cannot be distinguished in the present pipeline analysis with the available genome data, although we expect the number of latter cases would be small for the following reasons: (i) most of the lines shown between the identified TGD-derived gene lineage pairs (Fig S2B) distributed widely across all chromosomes consistent with what would be expected as a consequence of TGD, and (ii) only 13 of 1to2 orthogroups (out of 1,237) contained multiple duplicates possibly derived from both the TGD and the local chromosomal duplications (Fig S5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Counting_Method_of_TGD-Derived_Paired_Gene_Lineages_in_Current_Teleost_Genomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To count the number of TGD-derived gene lineage pairs in current genomes of teleost species (Fig 1A), one needs to exclude genes derived from lineage-specific duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the orthogroup of 1to2 category (Fig S3A1), the absence or presence (0 or 1) of TGD-derived gene lineage pairs excluding lineage-specific duplicates is 1 for zebrafish and fugu (A2) because they have a TGD-derived gene lineage pair and 0 for cod because it has no pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the orthogroup of 1to1 category (Fig S3B), on the other hand, the number of TGD-derived gene lineage pair is 0, of course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the number of TGD-derived gene lineage pairs is 692 on average (belonging to the 1,237 orthogroups of 1to2 category) as summarized in Fig S3C and Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate the proportion of TGD-derived paired gene lineages in current teleost genomes, one needs to count the total number of gene lineages derived from TGD for each species (Fig S3 A and B) as the denominator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the orthogroup of 1to2 category (A1), the number of gene lineages (0, 1, or 2) excluding species-specific duplicates is assigned as 2 for zebrafish and fugu genomes (A2) because they have orthologs in both teleost daughter clades (Teleost-1 and -2), and 1 for cod genome because it has lost an ortholog in the Teleost-1 clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the orthogroup of 1to1 category (Fig S3B), the numbers of gene lineages excluding lineage-specific duplicates are assigned as 1 for zebrafish and fugu and 0 for cod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, the number of gene lineages derived from TGD (belonging to the 6,892 orthogroups) is 6,378 on average as summarized in Fig S3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the proportion of TGD-derived paired gene lineages in current teleost genomes can be calculated as 21.7% (692 × 2/6,378) on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Fittings_Under_Alternative_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess any possible bias due to the criterion requiring a bootstrap value of at least 70% (BS 70% criterion in Fig S1C8), we estimated the gene loss process by using the gene lineage pairs obtained from the analysis without this criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the original result (Table 1), the pipeline analysis produced 15,353 putative orthogroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, 4,262 orthogroups were classified into 1to2 and 11,091 were classified into 1to1 categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result (Fig S4A) suggests that the 72% [11,091/(4,262 + 11,091)] of gene lineages were rapidly lost during the initial 60 My (first phase) before node a, whereas the remaining paired gene lineages were more slowly lost after that time (second phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we fitted the two models to the plots obtained without the BS 70% criterion, the two-phase model still showed a better fit than the classical one-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the gene loss process estimated without the BS 70% criterion also showed the rapid gene loss and can be expressed by the two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the BS 70% criterion in the present study to estimate the fraction of gene lineage pairs more precisely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the sensitivity of the two-phase model to divergence times, the plots were also fitted to the model using the time-scaled tree based on nuclear gene (28) and mitochondrial genome (42) data (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-phase model was also supported by these two time-calibrated trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the two-phase model (D) can be roughly approximated by a double-exponential curve (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_Including_Eel_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the gene loss pattern before the divergence of major clupeocephalan lineages, we conducted the pipeline analysis using data including transcriptome data [45,975 protein-coding gene sequences (44)] of the European freshwater eel (Elopomorpha), as a representative of basal teleost lineage (Fig S4E1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same analysis shown in Fig S1 was applied to 20,368 human and 19,686 medaka protein-coding genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result (Dataset S3), we found that 85.1% [5,198/(911 + 5,198)] of gene lineages were rapidly lost during the initial 20 My between TGD and the divergence of the eel lineage (node i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated gene loss pattern can be fitted by the two-phase model around node i (Fig S4 E2 and E3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The estimated number of retained gene lineage pairs in eel (105) is smaller than those of other teleosts (379544).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this point, the orthologous relationships of genes between eel and the other teleost lineages need to be identified more carefully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the orthologs of the clupeocephalan genes from eel data, however, is a challenging issue due to the following technical reasons: (i) The transcriptome data of eel might not cover all protein-coding gene sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some gene lineages are difficult to sequence because of differential expression patterns between the products of paired gene lineages through subfunctionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Some eel sequences might not be identified as a member of orthogroups in their gene trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The poor taxon sampling from basal teleost lineages makes the eel orthologs difficult to identify, possibly misleading the phylogenetic analysis (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, recent studies (20, 30) suggest that phylogenetic methods frequently fail in assessing the orthology of clupeocephalan to the two basal teleost lineages, whereas the assessment is often straightforward within clupeocephalans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the uncertainties described above, the eel data are consistent with our two-phase model, and this is the best that can be achieved at present given the currently available genome data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Example_of_Gene_Tree_for_Gene_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explain how to assign gene categories, typical examples of gene trees are shown in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene histories of some orthogroups (Fig S5 EH) were difficult to trace even though their gene trees fulfilled our criterion (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the numbers of these cases are small in comparison with the total number of identified orthogroups in 1to2 (1,237) or 1to1 (5,655) categories, we believe that they do not have a considerable impact on our major conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Function_of_TGD-Derived_Paired_Gene_Lineages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using gene ontology (GO) annotations, we examined whether teleost genes in orthogroups belonging to the 1to2 category have any characteristics in gene function differing from those in the 1to1 category (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that there was an overabundance of genes coding for proteins involved in signaling and ion transport in the 1to2 category (main text) as seen by Kassahn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a comparative analysis of five teleost genomes, Kassahn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) also pointed out that the TGD-derived paired gene lineages were enriched in proteins involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, and transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their and our results may mean that various receptors, including chemosensory and immune receptors, and their downstream signaling molecules, tend to remain duplicated possibly due to subfunctionalization/neofunctionalization (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome studies of budding yeasts, flowering plants, and land vertebrates have suggested that genes having functions of transcription and regulatory controls tend to be retained in duplicate after WGD, possibly due to constraint on their productdosage balance (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of constraint may also have affected the retention of a part of the TGD-derived paired gene lineages we identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our pilot study based on 130 gene sets (13) suggested that the TGD-derived gene lineages have significantly longer length of protein-coding gene sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the analysis based on the genome-wide data of this study, we also found a significant difference in gene lengths between 1to2 and 1to1 orthogroups (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein peptides encoded by the genes belonging to 1to2 orthogroups tended to be long (1,000 aa) rather than short (less_than200 aa) among nine teleosts (with the BS 70% criterion: 2 = 1,110.8, df = 2, P = 6.14 × 10242; without the criterion: 2 = 327.2, df = 2, P = 8.69 × 1072) and four tetrapods (with the criterion: 2 = 289.8, df = 2, P = 1.18 × 1063; without the criterion: 2 = 89.1, df = 2, P = 4.60 × 1020).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that longer sequences likely contain more protein domains and motifs, this result implies that some of the gene lineage pairs have been maintained by subfunctionalization (13, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Investigation_of_Possible_Action_of_Natural_Selection_on_Pair_Retention  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test for the action of natural selection on the retention of TGD-derived paired gene lineages, we examined an alternative hypothesis that paired gene lineages may be retained solely by chance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is one of the predictions of the passive or random loss model (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that 136 orthogroups retain gene lineage pairs among all nine teleosts (Fig S5A2 and Dataset S1) and tested whether this number is consistent with chance or purely random loss in each lineage independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under this alternative hypothesis, retention and loss of gene lineage pairs is considered to occur by chance in the ancestors of all nine species (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whenever the genomes of two descendants of a MRCA have less TGD-derived gene lineage pairs than the MRCA, we assume that the choice of which gene lineage pairs are passed down to the descendants is purely random and also independent for the two descendants lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if one were to assume that the MRCA of Tetraodon and fugu had Ne TGD-derived gene lineage pairs, then, given that the Tetraodon genome contains NTe = 622 such pairs, the probability of any given pair being transmitted from this MRCA to Tetraodon would be 622/Ne or NTe/Ne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of fugu, the corresponding probability would be NFu/Ne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming independent loss in each lineage, the probability that any given TGD-derived gene lineage pair present in the MRCA of Tetraodon and fugu would also be present in both Tetraodon and fugu must be NTe/Ne × NFu/Ne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuing in this manner, the probability of parallel retention among all nine species would be as follows:p=(Nf/Na×Nb/Na)×(NCo/Nb×Nc/Nb)×(Ng/Nc×Nd/Nc)×(NSt/Nd×Ne/Nd)×(NTe/Ne×NFu/Ne)×(NCa/Nf×NZe/Nf)×(NTi/Ng×Nh/Ng)×(NPl/Nh×NMe/Nh),orp=(NCa×NZe×NCo×NTi×NPl×NMe×NSt×NTe×NFu)/(Na2×Nb×Nc×Nd×Ne×Nf×Ng×Nh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nine complete genome sequences of extant teleosts provide us with (Fig 1A) NCa = 736, NZe = 778, NCo = 560, NTi = 815, NPl = 740, NMe = 612, NSt = 674, NTe = 622, and NFu = 691.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our parsimony analysis provides us with lower bounds on the numbers of retained TGD-derived gene lineage pairs in the hypothetical MRCA genomes at nodes ah (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lower bounds are Ma = 1,237, Mb = 982, Mc = 967, Md = 875, Me = 769, Mf = 976, Mg = 909, and Mh = 849, so we can write Na  1,237, Nb  982, Nc  967, Nd  875, Ne  769, Nf  976, Ng  909, and Nh  849.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that, under the assumption of independent loss in each lineage,p0.047.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We therefore expect to see at most 1,237 × 0.047  58 out of 1,237 orthogroups retain TGD-derived gene lineage pairs in all nine extant teleost genomes, and yet, in the present study, we observe 136 (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the largest possible value of p consistent with our data (p = 0.047, which will make our analysis as conservative as possible), the predicted distribution of retained pairs is, under the assumption of random assortment, the binomial distribution B(1,237, 0.047).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When gene lineage pairs are assumed to follow the hypothesis of random loss, the probability that the 136 orthogroups retain gene lineage pairs in at least nine teleosts is P = 6.64 × 1021.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our analysis suggests that about 78 (136  58) orthogroups may not have been retained by chance, but possibly by selection acting to preserve paired gene lineages arising from TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate gene functions for the 136 orthogroups, GO analysis was conducted (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed that 12 GO terms were significantly overrepresented among the 136 orthogroups, with Padj less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the highly significant genes associated with the 12 terms were those of proteins related to vesicle or positive regulation of cell migration/motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, no GO term was significantly underrepresented among the 136 orthogroups, with Padj less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogenetic_Marker_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our pipeline analysis produced about 1,100 sets of phylogenetic marker genes for bony vertebrates with special reference to teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, these markers were identified only from genes belonging to 1to1 orthogroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, orthology-confirmed marker genes can also be selected from genes belonging to 1to2 orthogroups such as the 136 orthogroups including the paired gene lineages across all nine teleosts (Fig S5A2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For phylogenetic questions based on the genome-wide data, transcriptome sequencing has been applied when whole-genome sequencing is impractical (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of some genes, however, is difficult because of differential expression patterns between the products of paired gene lineages through subfunctionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we focused on phylogenetic markers from genes belonging to the 1to1 orthogroups for future phylogenetic study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_LBD_on_the_Inference_of_Rapid_Gene_Loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We incorporated the LBD option (Fig S1A4) to exclude erroneously assembled sequences from the downloaded datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when evolutionary rates are significantly different between gene lineage pairs (e.g., the POMC gene in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), the LBD option could incorrectly identify some orthogroups of the 1to2 category as belonging to the 1to1 category by exclusion of gene lineages with accelerated evolutionary rate (Fig S5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this type of misidentification were to occur in a large number of orthogroups, the increase in the number of orthogroups of the 1to1 category could lead to an incorrect or exaggerated inference of rapid gene loss after TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that our inference of rapid gene loss could be an artifact caused by use of the LBD option, we conducted the analysis without this option and compared the result with that from the original analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For 3,103 gene analyses using the LBD option in the original pipeline analysis, we also conducted additional analysis without this option (fish-evol.unit.oist.jp/db/TGD16/3103_noLBD/results.htm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the analysis without the option identified 464 orthogroups as belonging to the 1to2 category without the BS 70% criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, the analysis using the LBD option identified only 26 orthogroups as 1to1 category with the BS 70% criterion by excluding gene lineages with accelerated evolutionary rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For confirmation, when we replaced the 3,103 results from the original analysis with those from the corresponding gene analyses without the LBD option, the fraction of remained gene lineage pairs at node a [18.6% (1,229/[1,229 + 5,394]) showed only a slight difference from the original analysis (18.0% in Table 1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the possible exclusion of gene lineages with accelerated rates by the LBD option does not change our major conclusion that the gene loss process after TGD exhibits rapid gene loss and can be described by the two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the result of this sensitivity analysis, we retained the LBD option in the original pipeline analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Model_Prediction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the sensitivity of parameters for gene loss models estimated in Fig 1C, the parameters were evaluated using 1,000 randomly generated plots (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the 1,000 random plots for the sensitivity test, the values of estimated numbers of gene lineage pairs and times at ancestral nodes (a to h) and TGD were varied within their respective 95% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the plots randomly, 95% confidence intervals of retained gene lineage pairs were estimated for each time point using the SD of the number of gene lineage pairs persisting in current teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Times at ancestral nodes were randomly chosen within the range of 95% confidence interval of estimates, and the time of TGD was randomly chosen within the range of estimated times between the basal neopterygian and teleost nodes (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, parameter estimations are not very sensitive to the fluctuations of 1,000 randomly generated plots and the two-phase model fits the randomly generated plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Orthology_Database  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data (gene trees and sequence alignments, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  used in 21,706 gene analyses (20,368 human- and 1,338 medaka-centered analyses; Table 1 and Dataset S1) are accessible at the Orthology Database of Fish-Specific WGD-Derived Genes (FishOrthoDB: fish-evol.unit.oist.jp/cgi-bin/TGD.cgi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8 shows the web page of results from GLI2 gene analysis as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the above process for 21,706 query gene sequences are summarized in the online database (FishOrthoDB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This database provides the basic information necessary for the estimation of the evolutionary history of teleost protein-coding genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction_of_the_Two-Phase_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we explain the two-phase model, a mathematical expression of the common observation that most paired gene lineages (Fig 1B) resulting from a WGD are lost over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an extension of the passive (6) or random loss model (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), with only one additional component: The possibility of loss of multiple genes in single events, such as the deletion of a chromosomal segment or loss of coregulated gene groups (cis-regulated gene sets/trans-regulatoryassociated gene networks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model does not include mechanisms for preservation of gene lineage pairs such as subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization or selection for dosage balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, given data, it cannot be rejected as a null model, then, on that basis alone, we can neither state that we have evidence for such mechanisms, nor that we have evidence against them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model does not take into account the special properties of any specific genes or gene families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it does not attempt to model in any detail possible mechanisms leading to the loss of gene blocks or coregulated gene groups, although it is clear that segmental deletions resulting from errors in meiosis, illegitimate recombination, or double-strand break repair are candidates (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the model also allows for events that would result in the loss of expression (i.e., inactivation, rather than deletion) of single or multiple genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible dependencies of mutation, inactivation, or deletion rates on 3D chromosome structure, or even chromosome length play no role in this model, and the chromosomal locations of genes are ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be very clear, the model is designed to be compatible with a high or low rate of local gene order rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of this in-built ambiguity, the two-phase model cannot be said to take hitchhiking (49) into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the model treats gene lineages as basic units, not individual genes, and therefore ignores lineage-specific duplications, making no use of the number of genes in an orthogroup or gene lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The point we are trying to stress here is that the model is minimalist, and intentionally so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a theoretical point of view, one advantage of this is that we can present an explicit solution, which we do here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It will be useful to begin with a reformulation of the passive loss model, from the specific point of view we are taking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We make the following assumptions:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a consequence, if both WGD-derived paired gene lineages are present in the post-WGD genome, simultaneous loss of both is forbidden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let f(t) denote the fraction of redundant gene lineage pairs in the post-WGD genome at time t. As a fraction, it only takes on values between 0 and 1:0f(t)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [f(t) is the fraction of redundant gene lineage pairs at a given time t. If we were to have 15,000 singleton (essential) gene lineages and 10,000 WGD-derived gene lineage pairs (redundant) in a hypothetical genome, then the total number of orthogroups would be 25,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 10,000 of the total number of orthogroups would have redundant (paired) gene lineages, so, in this way of thinking, the fraction of redundant gene lineage pairs would be f(t)=10,000/25,000=0.4 at the given time t.] Because both WGD-derived paired genes are, according to our assumptions, considered to be redundant, all (i.e., 100% of) genes in the genome immediately after the WGD event (at t=0) are considered to be redundant, and we express this with the following initial condition:f(0)=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The differential equation which expresses the passive model of redundant gene loss can be written as follows:df(t)dt=×f(t),[S2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where0  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
is a constant that represents the single gene lineage loss rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because f(t) can be interpreted as the probability that a given, randomly chosen, orthogroups gene lineages are redundant (i.e., paired), one can think of f(t) as the probability of fixation of a single gene lineage inactivation or deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The well-known solution to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 with initial condition [S1] is a single-exponential decay curve:f(t)=et.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is the prediction of the passive or random loss model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assumptions_of_the_Two-Phase_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before altering any equations, let us state the assumptions we are making for the two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first five are identical to what we wrote above for the passive loss model:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Also note that assumption v (that the number of genes in the genome is always large, meaning that it is taken to be infinite) minimizes the influence of assumptions iv and vii, which prevent multiple (gene block/coregulated gene group) loss events from resulting in the loss of both WGD-derived gene lineages of any gene present in the pre-WGD genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason is that, for an infinite number of genes, the chance of attempting to delete a block of multiple genes, containing both WGD-derived paired gene lineages of any pre-WGD gene, is vanishingly small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, there is no term in our differential equation [S4] (below) that takes either assumption iv or assumption vii into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us now add a new term to the differential equation, which will represent the possibility of loss of blocks of n genes (actually, gene lineages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we must now relax the assumption that gene lineages are lost independently, to allow for the loss of blocks of multiple gene lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new differential equation, which, together with the initial condition [S1], defines the two-phase model, is as follows:df(t)dt=×f(t)n××{f(t)}n,[S4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where0  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
is a constant that represents the rate of events in which n gene lineages are simultaneously lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n appears as the exponent in {f(t)}n, which is intended to represent the probability that, in a given random selection of n orthogroups, all of them consist of redundant gene lineage pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our model assumptions, a loss event can only be fixed if all gene lineages that would be lost are redundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the additional term in the two-phase model explicitly takes into account the possibility of single events that result in the loss of n gene lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the two-phase model can only differ from the passive loss model ifn1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that n be interpreted as an average number of gene lineages lost in a single event in which multiple gene lineages are lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be possible to formulate a more complex model, with a spectrum of block loss sizes, but we have chosen not to do this to avoid introducing more unknowns than we have data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If =0, the two-phase model reverts to the passive loss model, and the solution is the single exponential decay given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If 0, the solution to the two-phase model, given by differential equation [S4] and initial condition [S1], is as follows:f(t)=(+n×)1n1×et×[+n×+n××(1e(n1)t)]1n1[S5]=et×[11(n×)×(e(n1)t1)]1n1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Application_to_the_Number_of_Retained_WGD-Derived_Gene_Lineage_Pairs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To apply Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 to data involving actual numbers of WGD-derived gene lineage pairs, we need to multiply by the total number of orthogroups (i.e., the number of genes in the pre-WGD genome), N, which gives us the total number of retained WGD-derived gene lineage pairs at any given time:F(t)=N×f(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In comparing with data, we therefore have a function F, which depends upon four parameters (, , n, and N) and the time elapsed since the WGD (t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The correct interpretation of F(t) is that it is the two-phase model prediction for the number of retained WGD-derived gene lineage pairs in a single (organismal) lineage from the time of the WGD to the present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the strength of the genome data analysis presented in this paper lies in comparisons between gene lineages based mainly upon genomic data collected only in the present, we must take an extra step of modeling the outcome of our pipeline parsimony analysis on the raw predictions of the two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we must develop a model of the process of parsimony analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal is to overcome the inherent tendency of parsimony analysis to underestimate numbers of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The central issue in parsimony analysis, as performed by our pipeline, is the inference of the pattern of presence and absence of gene lineage pairs in ancestral genomes, on the basis of the pattern of presence of pairs in extant genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a pair is present in one or more of the extant genomes included in our analysis, then parsimony implies that the pair was present in their common ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a pair is not present in any of the extant genomes included in our analysis, then the logic of parsimony analysis dictates that we should infer the loss of that pair in a common ancestor (i.e., absence of the pair in the most recent common ancestor), although there remains the nonparsimonious possibility that the pair was in fact present in the most recent common ancestor but was lost independently in the several (organismal) lineages leading to the extant genomes included in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is for this reason that it is expected that parsimony analysis will give us a lower bound on the number of pairs present in the most recent common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order that we can apply the principles of parsimony analysis to the two-phase model (or indeed any other such model, including the passive loss model), we need to make an assumption concerning the dependence or independence of paired gene lineage loss in separate organismal lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same minimalist spirit underlying the two-phase model itself, we have chosen to assume that paired gene lineage loss in separate organismal lineages is independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are aware of the fact that there are many reasons to expect convergent loss for specific gene families, but we once again take the point of view of the hypothetical average gene, for which convergent loss would not be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With this assumption of independent loss, we can now proceed to estimate, from F(t), the fraction of gene lineage pairs which would be lost in all descendants of a given lineage at a given time, given a specific phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This becomes our parsimony estimate of the number of pairs absent in the common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is then a simple matter to estimate the number of pairs present in that same common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us begin with the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, represented by node e in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is estimated to have lived around 41 Mya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The teleost WGD is estimated to have occurred around 306 Mya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equivalently, we can say that the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu is estimated to have lived 265 My after the TGD event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we measure time in millions of years, the two-phase model would predict that the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu had F(265) retained WGD-derived gene lineage pairs, and that the genomes of extant Tetraodon and fugu fishes have F(306) retained WGD-derived gene lineage pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keeping within the confines of the two-phase model, we would then expect that F(265)F(306) pairs of gene lineages have been lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be specific, we estimate that, compared with the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, the fugu genome has lost F(265)F(306) paired gene lineages, and the Tetraodon genome has also lost F(265)F(306) paired gene lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assumption of independent loss requires us to treat these losses as truly independent, meaning that we have the following (model) result:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The probability that a gene lineage pair, which was present in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, has been lost in both the Tetraodon and also the fugu lineages is as follows:Pe=(F(265)F(306)F(265))×(F(265)F(306)F(265)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two-phase model parsimony estimate for the number of retained gene lineage pairs in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu must then be as follows:Ne=F(265)×(1Pe),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
because it is the number of gene lineage pairs that were not lost in both the Tetraodon and fugu lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can apply the same reasoning to any other model, such as the passive loss model, by substituting the appropriate function F. When we are speaking of the two-phase model, we mean the function F defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6, which is in turn defined in terms of the function f in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the passive or random loss model, we can still define the function F using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6, but must use the function f defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, we have a model-specific function F, which we use to compute model-specific values of Pe and Ne as shown above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fit Ne to the value 769 in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us now move on to node d of Fig 1A, representing the most recent common ancestor of stickleback, Tetraodon, and fugu, which is estimated to have lived 201 My after the TGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, we will first compute the probability that a gene lineage pair present in this ancestor could be lost in all three lineages (stickleback, Tetraodon, and fugu), calling the result Pd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same logic applied above, we can already state thatNd=F(201)×(1Pd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we already have the probability that a gene lineage pair, present in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, is lost in both Tetraodon and fugu (that is Pe), the calculation of Pd is not as complicated as it might have been.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea is simple: We need to lose gene lineage pairs in the stickleback lineage and also in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu or, if they are still present in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, in these lineages separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final component of the calculation is in fact Pe, which we earlier defined as the probability that a gene lineage pair, which was present in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu, has been lost in both the Tetraodon and also the fugu lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The probability that a gene lineage pair, present in the most recent common ancestor of stickleback, Tetraodon, and fugu, is lost in the stickleback lineage is as follows:F(201)F(306)F(201).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The probability that a gene lineage pair, present in the most recent common ancestor of stickleback, Tetraodon, and fugu, is lost in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu is as follows:Pde=F(201)F(265)F(201).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The probability that a gene pair, present in the most recent common ancestor of stickleback, Tetraodon and fugu, is not lost in the most recent common ancestor of Tetraodon and fugu but is lost in both the Tetraodon and fugu lineages is as follows:(1Pde)×Pe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taking all of these results together, we have the probability, that a gene lineage pair, which was present in the most recent common ancestor of stickleback, Tetraodon, and fugu, is lost in all these organismal lineages is as follows:Pd=F(201)F(306)F(201)×[Pde+(1Pde)×Pe].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This style of argument works analogously for nodes b and g (of Fig 1A) also, and nodes a and c are obvious extensions of the same idea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, we have been using our numerical best estimates for the number of million years after teleost-specific WGD of various branchings, but these are of course only estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we write Te instead of our best estimate of 265 My, and Tp (where the p stands for present) instead of our best estimate of 306 My, etc., then we can write the full set of (probability) equations as follows:Ph=(F(Th)F(Tp)F(Th))2,Pgh=F(Tg)F(Th)F(Tg),Pg=F(Tg)F(Tp)F(Tg)×[Pgh+(1Pgh)×Ph],Pcg=F(Tc)F(Tg)F(Tc),Pf=(F(Tf)F(Tp)F(Tf))2,Paf=F(Ta)F(Tf)F(Ta),Pe=(F(Te)F(Tp)F(Te))2,Pde=F(Td)F(Te)F(Td),Pd=F(Td)F(Tp)F(Td)×[Pde+(1Pde)×Pe],Pcd=F(Tc)F(Td)F(Tc),Pc=[Pcg+(1Pcg)×Pg]×[Pcd+(1Pcd)×Pd],Pbc=F(Tb)F(Tc)F(Tb),Pb=F(Tb)F(Tp)F(Tb)×[Pbc+(1Pbc)×Pc],Pab=F(Ta)F(Tb)F(Ta),Pa=[Paf+(1Paf)×Pf]×[Pab+(1Pab)×Pb],  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and our full set of parsimony estimates for the number of gene lineage pairs at nodes a to h (in Fig 1A) as follows:Nh=F(Th)×(1Ph)849,Ng=F(Tg)×(1Pg)909,Nf=F(Tf)×(1Pf)976,Ne=F(Te)×(1Pe)769,Nd=F(Td)×(1Pd)875,Nc=F(Tc)×(1Pc)967,Nb=F(Tb)×(1Pb)982,Na=F(Ta)×(1Pa)1,237,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where we have included the full genomic parsimony pipeline-derived estimates for these numbers in the rightmost column as targets for fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now we can turn directly to the question of parameter fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the two-phase model, we have four parameters: N, , , and n. We already have eight equations (of the sort Na1,237) that are suitable for a fitting procedure, but it is always advisable to have many more equations than parameters, so we can add nine equations from the WGD-derived gene lineage pair counts in the nine extant species genomes (note that these are not results of parsimony analysis):F(Tp)736,F(Tp)778,F(Tp)560,F(Tp)815,F(Tp)740,F(Tp)612,F(Tp)674,F(Tp)622,F(Tp)691,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and we have the total number of orthogroups considered in the analysis, without which the node gene lineage pair counts would have no meaning, giving us a consistency requirement thatF(0)=6,892.If we fit using this (absolute) requirement and the 17 equations above to the two-phase and passive loss models, then the results are as illustrated in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the passive loss model can be rejected, whereas the two-phase model fits very well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Returning to the two-phase model fit, it is useful to note that the data points that are being fitted to are all in what we can call the second phase of decay, when the rate of loss of gene lineage pairs has slowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This long tail is very well defined in the data, and we are therefore able to infer the value of  fairly precisely, which is useful because  plays the role of 2 in standard models of gene loss via random mutations, except that it applies to gene lineages here instead of single genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connection is not accidental: A long time after WGD, the solution to the two-phase model approaches the simple (single) exponential decay associated with single gene lineage loss:f(t)(+n×)1n1×et(fortlarge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reason for this is that, in the context of our model, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new blocks of redundant gene lineages to delete as time goes by, so losses of blocks of genes are essentially never fixed long after a WGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of the two-phase model, this is the natural explanation of the slow decay observed in the second phase of gene loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the uncertainties in our data, we must however caution against any denial of subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, selection, or hitchhiking solely on the basis of our failure to reject the two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-phase model remains a null model, and one that aims only to explain most genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed studies of specific genes or gene families are required before one can make any concrete statements regarding any selection in the evolution of teleosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approximation_of_Solutions_to_the_Two-Phase_Model_by_Double_Exponentials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is sometimes reasonable to simply try to fit a curve to data, without an underlying model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-phase gene lineage loss we observe looks very much like a double-exponential function, which one might describe in terms of the following function:f(t)=(1q)×et+q×et,where 0q1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Does Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 have an approximation of this sort?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a rough sense, the answer is yes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we take a very low rate of block loss (i.e., 0), we can consider a Taylor expansion of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 around =0:f(t)(1n(n1))×et+n(n1)×ent+O(2),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where O(2) represents the error (growing with 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we have the approximate relations qn/[(n1)] and n. For larger , these relations cannot be expected to hold very accurately, but the general idea, that Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 has an approximation that looks like a double exponential, will continue to be valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An_Extension_of_the_Two-Phase_Model_That_Includes_Subfunctionalization_or_Neofunctionalization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Let us now consider including subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will do so in a simple and straightforward manner, leaving out many facts that are known about these phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplest change we can make to the two-phase model in this direction is to reserve some fraction () of gene lineage pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fraction of pairs will not be lost, but rather be said to become essential due to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new differential equation would be as follows:df(t)dt=×{f(t)}n××{f(t)}n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The solution to this extended two-phase model is as follows:f(t)=(1)×et×[n×(1)n1××(e(n1)t1)]1n1+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has one extra parameter than the original two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we set =0, then we revert to the original two-phase model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
