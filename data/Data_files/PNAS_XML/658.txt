Probing equilibrium of molecular and deprotonated water on TiO2(110)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding how water binds and dissociates on surfaces has broad implications in a vast range of physical and chemical processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative stability of molecularly and dissociatively bound water has been debated for decades on many oxide surfaces, but it has never been successfully measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study describes unique instrumentation, direct measurements, and a state-of-the-art computation and theory approach that yield a detailed kinetic and dynamic description of water deprotonation equilibrium on TiO2(110), a prototypical surface commonly used in mechanistic studies of photocatalytic water splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique study demonstrates that the molecularly bound water on TiO2(110) is preferred over the surface-bound hydroxyls by only 0.035 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding adsorbed water and its dissociation to surface hydroxyls on oxide surfaces is key to unraveling many physical and chemical processes, yet the barrier for its deprotonation has never been measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we present direct evidence for water dissociation equilibrium on rutile-TiO2(110) by combining supersonic molecular beam, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio molecular dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure the deprotonation/protonation barriers of 0.36 eV and find that molecularly bound water is preferred over the surface-bound hydroxyls by only 0.035 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that long-range electrostatic fields emanating from the oxide lead to steering and reorientation of the molecules approaching the surface, activating the OH bonds and inducing deprotonation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developed methodology for studying metastable reaction intermediates prepared with a high-energy molecular beam in the STM can be readily extended to other systems to clarify a wide range of important bond activation processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The STM images of clean TiO2(110) composed of rows of topographically low-lying fivefold-coordinated titanium ions (Ti5c, imaged bright) and high-lying bridging oxygen ions (Ob, imaged dark) are shown in Fig 1 A and C. A small fraction of Obs is missing, resulting in vacancies (VOs) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1B shows the result after dosing H2O with a room-temperature effusive molecular beam (incident energy of 0.06 eV) on the TiO2(110) at 80 K. In all STM experiments, H2O coverage was kept very low (0.05 ML) to keep the observed molecules isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one type of feature, corresponding to water monomers centered on the Ti5c rows (17, 18), is seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their uniformity is demonstrated in a high-contrast image (Fig 1B, Right) and by the reproducibility of the line profiles (Fig 1B, Inset, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under limited surface mobility conditions (less_than160 K), the H2O molecules do not diffuse on the Ti5c rows on an experimentally observable timescale (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they are unable to reach VO sites where they are known to dissociate and form bridging hydroxyl pairs (HObs) (3, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas the H2O features (Fig 1B) are centered on Ti5c sites, their appearance cannot be taken as conclusive evidence for the purely molecular binding of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the equilibrium, H2O + Ob  HOt + HOb, where HOt is the Ti5c-bound terminal hydroxyl, the majority species (H2O) determine the appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence comes indirectly from studies of water reactions with O adatoms (19) and from water-assisted cross-row hydrogen transfer of HOb species (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theoretical studies predict the higher stability of molecularly bound H2O by less than 0.1 eV (13, 1618).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further probe the preparation of metastable species by colliding water molecules of high-incident energy (1.3 eV in Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the low-incident energy experiment (Fig 1B), two distinct types of features (65% H2O and 35% P) are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P features are round and also centered on Ti5c sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High contrast is needed (Fig 1D, Left) to clearly discern their differences from H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The line profiles in the inset further reveal that the P features are distinctly smaller and 30% less intense than H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in the area shown in Fig 1B the P features are not present, they comprise 5% of the total population at low H2O incident energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large-scale images illustrating the overall distribution of the species at both low- and high-incident energies are shown in SI Appendix, section S1 and Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The appearance of the P features is surprising, as heuristically, pairs of two bright features (HOt and HOb) due to water dissociation are expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further interrogate the chemical makeup of the P species, we carry out temperature-dependent experiments for water with incident energy of 1.3 eV (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments allow us to follow the thermal equilibration of the HOt and HOb species with H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first type of experiment, we image continuously the same area while the sample temperature is increased from 111 to 114 K (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion of one P feature (yellow circle) to H2O (white circle) shows that the P features contain all of the atoms from the water molecule and that none of them has been irreversibly lost to the vacuum or subsurface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence strongly supports that the P features comprise the HOb/HOt pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evidence from tip-pulse manipulation experiments and STM image simulations is provided in SI Appendix, section S1 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We quantify the temperature-dependent fraction of P features, FP(T), relative to the total number of H2O + P features observed on the surface, FP(T), in Fig 2B (circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial H2O adsorption temperature is stabilized between 80 and 150 K, water is dosed, and the surface is imaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below 110 K, FP remains approximately constant and equal to 0.35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above 110 K, a sharp drop is detected and T  greater than  130 K, FP drops to 0.05 and remains approximately constant up to 150 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temperature dependence of FP allows us to determine the barrier for the H2O recombination, HOb + HOt  H2O, by first-order kinetics (SI Appendix, section S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a prefactor of 1 × 1012 s1, the optimum fit to the data (solid line, Fig 2B) yields the recombination barrier, ER = 0.355 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted lines show the lower- and upper-bound values of 0.345 and 0.365 eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, assuming equilibrium at 140 K, the value of FP(140K) = 0.05 reveals that H2O is only 0.035 eV lower in free energy than the HOb + HOt pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3A, we further probe the H2O dissociation barrier, H2O  HOb + HOt, in experiments where different seeding gases (neat, He, H2) and nozzle temperatures are used to vary the H2O incident energy (see Methods and further details in SI Appendix, section 3 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low-incident energies (less_than 0.3 eV), the FP is approximately constant (0.05), increases above 0.3 eV, and reaches 0.35 at 1.3 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed break at 0.3 eV is a consequence of H2O dissociation barrier as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar FP dependence is observed for the azimuth parallel to the Ti5c rows (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity along the two azimuths with very different corrugation of both physical and potential energy surfaces suggests that the energy dissipation may not be strongly dependent on the incident angle and exhibit so-called total energy scaling as seen previously on corrugated MgO(001) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the origin of the observed incident energy and temperature dependence of FP, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) studies of H2O collisions with a stoichiometric TiO2(110).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that extensive conformational sampling of molecularly bound H2O resulted in only a single stable binding configuration indicating that the P features are not the result of an alternate metastable binding configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We start with a sample (100200) of thermalized water configurations (T = 300 K) uniformly distributed at 7 Å above the surface (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We add translational kinetic energy, EK = 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.3 eV with velocities in the direction concurrent with the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propagate each trajectory until the molecules collide with the surface and dissipate their excess energy; see SI Appendix, section S5 for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure reproduces both the types and relative populations of species observed in the experiments, as reported in Fig 3A (red squares) and SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the AIMD trajectories we observe the following: (i) At all incident energies, the fate of the species is determined by its collision point: those that land on the Ti5c sites dissociate and remain adsorbed, whereas the rest are scattered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, at low EK there is a pronounced steering toward the Ti5c sites due to electrostatic attraction; hence, the overall number of retained species is highest at low energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Irrespective of their fate after the collision, all of the molecules experience a reorientation as they approach the surface such that one OH bond is approximately perpendicular to the surface normal (Fig 3A, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reorientation is the result of large, nonuniform electrostatic fields radiating out from the surface, coupling to the OH-bond dipole at distances 6 Å, that orient the molecules before impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this reorientation breaks the twofold degeneracy associated with the water binding configuration, as discussed in more detail in SI Appendix, section S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The torquing of the molecules induces coupling of the translational/rotational/vibrational modes and amplifies the kinetic energy transfer to the water OH-bondstretching mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of events leading to bond breaking steadily increases with EK, and those that do break have on average a higher OH-bond kinetic energy, EOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for the lowest EK = 0.1 eV, there is a finite dissociation probability (5%) as a consequence of the steering of molecules into the bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This long-range electrostatic coupling seen here for an oxide is distinct from metals and has consequences for how one can extract meaningful chemistry from molecular beam data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generalize the interpretation of the EK-dependent product cross-section, we note that this energy transfer effectively raises the temperature of the OH mode, and the resulting velocity distribution at the collision point can be represented by a Boltzmann distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIMD trajectories resulting in OH bond breaking contribute to the long tail of P(EOH, EK) (Fig 3B, blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the probability, PD(EOH), of whether or not a molecularly adsorbed species with EOH will break, we fit the reaction coordinate (Fig 2B) to a classical electrostatic potential (see SI Appendix, section S6 for details) and simulate an ensemble of events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting PD(EOH) (Fig 3C) is well-described by a Fermi function, as a result of the existence of well-defined energy barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can combine these factors into a probability describing the OH-bondbreaking process:PD(EK)=P(EOH,EK)PD(EOH)dEOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]This model accurately reproduces the results of the AIMD trajectories as shown in Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows us to decouple the vibrational excitation probability, P(EOH, EK), from the bond-dissociation event probability, PD(EOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas P(EOH, EK) depends solely on electrostatics and is well-described by density-functional theory (DFT), the latter, PD(EOH), is associated with the potential energy landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we fit the experimental data using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and obtain a barrier height of ED = 0.36 ± 0.01 eV (Fig 3A, red line), only 0.04 eV lower than that obtained from DFT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of quantum and isotopic effects is further discussed in SI Appendix, section S7, providing a DFT estimate of a zero-point energy-corrected barrier ED = 0.24 eV, which is below that of experiment by 0.12 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis presented in SI Appendix, section S7 implies that the system is near the cross-over between the classical and quantum regimes at the experimental temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The complete energy diagram describing the equilibrium of water deprotonation on TiO2(110) determined from our studies is shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unique, site-specific experiments provide a direct measure of the acid/base properties of water on an oxide surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of different computational approaches unravels the mechanism and underlying physical principles leading to water dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reveal the surprising role of long-range electrostatics in the energy transfer and redistribution before collision with the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further distill a simple and meaningful theoretical framework for the interpretation of the kinetic energy dependence of scattering cross-sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a blueprint for extracting chemical insight from supersonic beam studies of oxide surfaces and provides energetic quantification of important surface reactions relevant to catalytic materials and environmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were carried out in an Omicron low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (LT-STM) system, which consists of a preparation chamber, microscopy chamber, and molecular beam chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system is equipped with LT-STM/AFM, XPS, UV photoelectron spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TiO2(110) sample (Princeton Scientific) was mounted on a standard Omicron Ta sample holder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering and annealing up to 900950 K. Auger electron spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of impurities on the sample surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of VOs on the surface determined from the images was 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrochemically etched and UHV-annealed tungsten tips were used for imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all STM experiments, H2O coverage was kept very low (0.05 ML) to keep the observed molecules isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All STM images were recorded in constant-current mode at a positive sample bias of 1.21.6 V and tunneling currents of 580 pA. Based on the information from the manufacturer, the reported TiO2 sample temperatures can be up to 3 K higher during counter heating ( greater than  80 K) than the real sample temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deionized H2O was purified by several freezepumpthaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and dosed on TiO2(110) directly in the STM stage with the molecular beam incident at 60° with respect to the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were carried out at different two azimuths pointing along and across the Ti5c and Ob rows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both quasi-effusive and supersonic molecular beams were used for water deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neat H2O beam was created by expanding 20 torr of water through a 50-µm orifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supersonic beams were produced by passing 500 torr of either helium or hydrogen through a water bubbler at room temperature and expanding the resulting mixture through a 50-µm orifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heatable nozzle assembly (300900 K) was used to vary the energy of the incident H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are provided in SI Appendix, section S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Details  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All DFT calculations were performed using the CP2K package (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exchange-correlation energy was described by the generalized gradient approximation with the spin-polarized PerdewBurkeErnzerhof functional (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wave functions were expanded in optimized double- Gaussian basis sets (35) and the plane waves were expanded with a cutoff energy of 400 Ry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core electrons have been modeled by scalar relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials with 12, 4, and 1 valence electrons for Ti, O, and H, respectively (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brillouin zone integration is performed with a reciprocal space mesh consisting of only the -points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TiO2(110)-p(6 × 2) surface was used to model the TiO2 substrate, consisting of 6 OTiO trilayers (18 atomic layers), and only the bottom Ti atomic layer was frozen while the remaining layers were allowed to relax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slab was repeated periodically with a vacuum depth of 20 Å in the direction of the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of water dissociation equilibrium on the parameters and methods of the calculations has been discussed in detail elsewhere (13, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All AIMD simulations were performed by sampling initial conditions using a canonical [constant number, volume, temperature (NVT)] ensemble using NoséHoover thermostats (38, 39) with a time step 0.5 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collision simulations were performed within the microcanonical [constant number, volume, energy (NVE)] ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature of the TiO2 substrate is set as 10 K and the initial translational kinetic energy of water, EK, is chosen to be 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.3 eV, respectively, consistent with the range of beam energies in the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be comparable with the experiments, we started the simulation with a H2O molecule in the gas phase, initially located at 7 Å above the surface, with a velocity at 60° to the surface normal and perpendicular to the Ob rows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 208 independent runs at EK = 0.1 eV due to the relatively low percentage of dissociated water seen in the experimental studies at low EK values and 104 for EK = 0.4, 0.7, and 1.3 eV; each run was propagated for a total time of 13 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1 ns of combined AIMD trajectories was performed and used for the data analysis presented in SI Appendix, section S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For characterizing the potential energy surface of the water dissociation event, the location and energy of the transition state was performed using the climbing image nudged-elastic-band method (40) including 16 replicas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence criterion for the maximum forces on the atoms is set as 2 × 103 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibrational analysis was further used to confirm the transition states with only one imaginary frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
