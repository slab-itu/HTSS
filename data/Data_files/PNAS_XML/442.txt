Functional analysis of molecular interactions in synthetic auxin response circuits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Auxin-regulated transcription plays a role in almost every aspect of plant growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent structural studies of domains from auxin-activated transcription factors and auxin-degraded repressors have raised fundamental questions about the protein complexes required for auxin response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we leverage the power of a synthetic yeast system to identify and systematically characterize the simplest auxin response unit in the absence of the potentially confounding influence of other family members and interacting pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Auxin-regulated transcription pivots on the interaction between the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) repressor proteins and the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent structural analyses of ARFs and Aux/IAAs have raised questions about the functional complexes driving auxin transcriptional responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To parse the nature and significance of ARFDNA and ARFAux/IAA interactions, we analyzed structure-guided variants of synthetic auxin response circuits in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed that promoter architecture could specify ARF activity and that ARF19 required dimerization at two distinct domains for full transcriptional activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, monomeric Aux/IAAs were able to repress ARF activity in both yeast and plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This systematic, quantitative structure-function analysis identified a minimal complexcomprising a single Aux/IAA repressing a pair of dimerized ARFssufficient for auxin-induced transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Promoter_Architecture_Can_Specify_ARF_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several lines of inquiry, including recent structural studies, suggest that specificity in auxin responses reflects differences in ARFDNA interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using flow cytometry, we quantified the activity of a panel of ARFs on the native Arabidopsis IAA19 promoter (pIAA19::Venus) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No IAA repressor was present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ARFs assayed included five activator ARFs (ARF5, ARF6, ARF7, ARF8, and ARF19) and a repressor ARF (ARF2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed previously (19), ARF7 and ARF19 were effective activators of the pIAA19::Venus reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although pIAA19 has five AuxREs within 300 nucleotides of the transcriptional start site, ARF8 was the only other ARF tested that effectively activated Venus expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARF8 also negatively impacted yeast growth, making further comparisons difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To distinguish between differences in ARF activation strength and differences in ARF affinity for different AuxRE configurations, we tested the same panel of ARFs against additional synthetic promoters containing previously characterized AuxRE arrays with variable number, spacing, and orientation of sites (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit influence from flanking sequences, promoter variants were generated within a mutated IAA19 promoter where all of the native AuxREs were rendered nonfunctional (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Into this ARF-insensitive promoter, we introduced a pair of inverted AuxRE repeats spaced by seven nucleotides used in the ARF DNA-binding domain structural studies (16), as well as in early biochemical assays (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequence has historically been called ER7 (20, 21), terminology we are retaining here for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ARF19 and ARF8 could activate the ER7-containing promoter to approximately half the extent of the native pIAA19 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARF7, ARF2, and ARF5, which has been shown to bind to this sequence in vitro (16), exhibited only minimal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we introduced tandem repeats of the P3 element [P3(2x)], which has been used in both binding assays and transient expression studies (14, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each P3 element is composed of an ER7 sequence separated from an additional AuxRE site by three nucleotides (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARF6 could modestly activate the P3(2x) promoter, whereas it was inactive on the ER7 and pIAA19 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introduction of the P3(2x) element also resulted in a dramatic increase of ARF19 activity, more than double the activity observed with the native pIAA19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ARF7 showed essentially the same level of activity on the P3(2x) promoter as it had on the native pIAA19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, ARF5 strongly activated the P3(2x)-containing promoter, despite exhibiting only minimal activity on the native pIAA19 and ER7 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine how the spacing between two binding sites influences ARF-specific activity, we varied the number of nucleotides between a pair of AuxREs in either an inverted repeat (ER) or direct repeat (DR) conformation (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified activation by ARF19 and ARF5 on ER promoters with five (ER5), seven (ER7), or nine (ER9) base pairs between the two inverted AuxRE sites (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with in vitro DNA-binding studies (16), seven-nucleotide spacing between repeats yielded optimal activity for both ARFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same trend was observed when comparing ARF activity on DR promoters containing three (DR3), five (DR5), or seven (DR7) base pairs between two direct AuxRE repeats, although the DR7 reporter had the highest background activity (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the most widely used auxin transcriptional reporter uses tandem AuxRE repeats with five-nucleotide spacing (DR5) (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When five tandem DR5 repeats replaced the pIAA19 sequence upstream of the mutated A1 site, all of the activator ARFs were active (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that spacing differences alone are unlikely to confer ARF specificity on a target gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is consistent with a recent genome-wide analysis that found a dramatic impact of AuxRE orientation on the binding preferences of ARF2 and ARF5 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven bases may be the optimal spacing for ARF DNA binding and activity, as this spacing results in minimal DNA torsion or changes in protein conformation (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ARFs_Activate_as_Dimers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the impact of ARF homotypic interactions on transcriptional activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize the sensitivity of these assays, we focused on the most active ARF-promoter combination: ARF19 and the P3(2x)::Venus reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin this analysis, we confirmed that ARF19 activity required the homologous residues identified as critical for ARF5 DNA binding (DB) and N-terminal dimerization (DD) in the DNA-binding domain (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the ARF5 data, the H138A (db1) and R188A (db2) DNA-binding mutations resulted in the total loss of ARF19 activity (Fig 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G247I (dd1), which caused the most severe disruption of dimerization in ARF5, resulted in an almost complete loss of ARF19 activation activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A250N (dd2) and A255N (dd3) mutations retained modest levels of ARF19 activity, consistent with the observation that these mutations do not completely disrupt ARF5 dimerization in the DNA-binding domain (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we probed the impact of PB1 interactions on ARF19 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we engineered homologous mutations into ARF19 that were previously shown to compromise one or both PB1 interaction surfaces in ARF7 (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we generated the following ARF19 variants: K962A (k), to disrupt the positively charged face (head); a double mutation D1012A and D1016A in the OPCA motif (o), to disrupt the negatively charged face (tail); and all three mutations in combination, to disrupt interactions at both faces (ok) (Fig 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each PB1 mutant expressed on its own lacks a complementary interface required for PB1 domain interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each variant should therefore provide a similar level of transcriptional activation, representing the efficacy of an ARF19 PB1 monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, all variants exhibited similar diminished activity on the P3(2x)::Venus reporter compared with wild-type ARF19 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early in vitro studies using truncated ARFs indicated that PB1 interactions might be required to stabilize ARF binding to DNA (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the observed reduction in transcriptional activation by ARF19 PB1 mutants might reflect reduced binding to the P3(2x) promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays supported this interpretation (Fig 2B and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARF19 DNA binding was significantly reduced when the PB1 domain was mutated, although this reduced binding was still substantially stronger than what was observed when the DNA-binding domain was mutated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multimerization potential of the PB1 domain has led to speculation about the composition of the minimal complex required for ARF action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ARF19 PB1 monomers showed a significant reduction of activity, we wanted to test the activation potential of ARFs limited to dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we compared expression of the P3(2x)::Venus reporter in yeast expressing wild-type ARF19, either the o or k mutants, or a circuit containing both a k and o variant (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that wild-type ARF19 had the capacity to form dimers or higher order complexes, whereas o or k mutants could only dimerize within the DNA-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a mixed k and o population could dimerize in the DNA-binding domain and form only a single (dimer) interaction through the PB1 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this reconstituted PB1 dimer was a more effective activator than the monomeric PB1 mutants (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, dimerization at both N and C termini contributes to optimal DNA binding and activity of ARF19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IAAs_Can_Function_as_Monomers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Continuing upstream in auxin response, we sought to examine the functional consequences of limiting IAA PB1 domain interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the primary functional attribute of the IAA PB1 domain is interaction with an ARF, repression of ARF activity by the IAA is the most straightforward output of this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a yeast auxin response circuit, where only a single ARF and IAA were expressed, we could directly measure the impact of each PB1 face on IAA repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An N-terminal fusion of the first 300 amino acids of the TOPLESS (TPL) corepressor to IAA3/SHY2 (TPLN300:IAA3) strongly repressed ARF19 activity in a PB1-dependent manner (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations on both PB1 interaction surfaces of IAA3 (ok) showed a loss of repression similar to a complete PB1 deletion (PB1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single interface PB1 IAA mutants (k and o) maintain repression of ARF19, albeit with reduced strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed for TPLN300:IAA14/SLR and TPLN300:IAA7/AXR2 (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further refine the functional stoichiometry of ARFIAA complexes, we assayed IAA repression strength when the PB1-mediated interaction potential of both the IAA and ARF partner were limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPLN300:IAA3 single PB1 mutants repressed almost as well as wild-type TPLN300:IAA3 when coexpressed with an ARF19 PB1 mutant with a complementary interaction surface [Fig 3B; TPLN300:IAA3 o|ARF19 k (red); TPLN300:IAA3 k |ARF19 o (blue)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPLN300:IAA3 k mutants were less effective repressors than TPLN300:IAA3 o mutants in circuits where PB1 domains of ARF19 could self-dimerize (green), similar to what was seen in wild-type ARF19 circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference suggests that although a single face is sufficient for repression, the positive (K) IAA3 PB1 interface may be the preferred surface for heterodimerization with ARF19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although a single PB1 interface is sufficient for ARFIAA interaction in Y2H and in vitro assays (912), there is conflicting evidence for whether this limited interaction is sufficient for repression in planta (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if an IAA with a single PB1 interface was also capable of mediating repression in plants, we transformed Arabidopsis seedlings with single and double PB1 mutants of a stabilized form of IAA14/SLR (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to test slr because of the striking solitary root phenotype for which it was named (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have previously demonstrated that pIAA14::slr transgenic plants largely recapitulate the phenotype of the slr mutant where the initiation of nearly all lateral roots is inhibited (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that a loss of repression could be quantified by the number of lateral roots formed by slr PB1 mutant transgenic plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, transgenic lines expressing slr double PB1 (ok) mutants exhibited similar lateral root densities (number of lateral roots per millimeter of primary root) as those expressing a wild-type IAA14, indicating a loss of the dominant negative solitary root phenotype (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, multiple independent lines expressing slr single PB1 mutants (k or o) exhibited a significant decrease in lateral root density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels of the transgene in multiple lines were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and had no correlation with lateral root density (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with our observations in yeast: A single IAA PB1 interface retains the capacity to repress ARF activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ARFIAA_Affinity_Tunes_Auxin_Sensitivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previous work, we demonstrated the importance of auxin-induced IAA degradation rate in tuning cellular sensitivity to auxin (19, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In circuits containing only an IAA and AFB receptor, IAAIAA PB1 interactions had modest or no influence on IAA degradation rates (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with in vitro assays indicating that IAAs have only weak affinity for homotypic PB1 interactions compared with the strength of heterotypic interactions with ARF PB1 domains (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low levels of auxin, we observed a modest slowing of WT IAA degradation rate when ARF19 was coexpressed (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the IAA PB1 domain appears to primarily mediate interaction with an ARF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modest reduction of repression strength in single IAA PB1 mutants was likely a result of a decrease in ARF affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that we could visualize the relative affinity of the IAA3 PB1 mutant constructs for ARF19 by tracking their cellular localization (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When expressed alone, fluorescence of YFP-IAA3 was diffuse throughout the cell, whereas the coexpression of ARF19 strongly enhanced nuclear localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, localization of YFP-IAA3 single and double PB1 mutants remained diffuse even in the presence of ARF19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a marked decrease in ARF interaction with just a single IAA PB1 mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effective auxin signaling requires a sensitive balance between the strength of IAA interactions with ARFs and with auxin receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One measure of this balance is the ease with which repression can be reversed following auxin exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated that only repression by TPLN100:IAA fusions can be relieved by auxin, whereas TPLN300:IAA repression seems to be insensitive to auxin treatment (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even the single interface TPLN100:IAA3 PB1 mutants (k and o) could not repress ARF19 activity (Fig S7A), impeding our ability to assay auxin response dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because expression levels of the TPLN300 and TPLN100 fusions are not correlated with their ability to repress (Fig S7B), the difference in the sensitivity of repression activity to PB1 mutations may reflect different modes of repression enacted by the different TPL truncations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent structure of the N-terminal portion of TPL suggests that this result likely reflects the loss of a second TPL dimerization domain in the N100 fragment (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative, we used yeast expressing TPLN300:IAAs to test whether loss of ARF affinity resulting from mutations in a single surface of the IAA PB1 domain could increase auxin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, auxin could relieve repression of TPLN300:IAA k or o mutants (Fig 3D and Fig S3A), whereas repression was maintained when TPLN300 was fused to a wild-type IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, although the o and k mutations in TPLN300:IAA3 were both moderately auxin-sensitive, there was a marked contrast in the auxin response of the TPLN300:IAA14 single PB1 mutants (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TPLN300:IAA14 k variant was quite sensitive to auxin, resulting in an almost total reversal of repression, whereas the strain expressing the TPLN300:IAA14 o variant exhibited only a modest response to auxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPLN300:IAA7 PB1variants followed a similar pattern of auxin response as those observed for TPLN300:IAA14 (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results indicate that although a single IAA PB1 face results in diminished ARF affinity, it is still sufficient for repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand plants, one must understand auxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simple structure of the nuclear auxin signaling pathway, and its reliance on highly conserved and modular aspects of eukaryotic biology, has enabled remarkable progress toward this ambitious goal (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic auxin response circuits in yeast have made it possible to quantitatively and systematically analyze the requirements for auxin response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, we have validated some of the predicted structurefunction connections, called others into question, and defined the functional roles of various molecular interactions driving auxin-regulated transcription (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Promoter architecture, particularly the number and orientation of AuxREs, strongly influences ARF activation potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of ARF8, which led to growth defects in yeast, ARF19 was the only ARF active across all promoter variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARF6 and ARF7 were weaker activators in general, whereas ARF5 activity varied considerably with changes in binding-site configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low basal activity of the promoter variants made it difficult to discern any repressive activity of ARF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the specific activities we observed for the activator ARFs demonstrate the utility of this system for probing the role of promoter architecture on ARF function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of repressible promoters as well as the coexpression of more than one ARF (i.e., activator and repressor) may lend new insight into repressor ARFs and the functionality of mixed ARF complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effective activation by ARF19 requires dimerization in both the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal PB1 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support a model where an ARF dimer has contacts at both termini (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexibility of ARF binding to direct or inverted repeats suggests that binding-site orientation may drive differential conformation of the flexible middle region (Fig 4B), potentially leading to the recruitment of specific coactivators (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary contacts in the PB1 domain could serve to stabilize the conformation of the middle region following DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, both bHLH and MYB transcription factors have been shown to interact with ARFs through the PB1 domain (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupled with proximal binding sites to the ARFs (3638), PB1-mediated interactions between an ARF and another transcription factor may provide the same or further enhanced DNA binding as what we observed in ARFARF PB1-driven dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would account for ARF binding of single AuxRE sites as well as the integration of regulatory control from other signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The potential for oligomerization via both the ARF and IAA PB1 domains has challenged the classic model of auxin signaling where the PB1 domain mediates a single binary interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that the ARFs can activate effectively as dimers but do not rule out the possibility that the PB1 domain could mediate higher order complex formation on more complex promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the current study provides strong evidence that IAAs can function as monomers (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated in both yeast and plants that an IAA with a single PB1 interface can repress ARF activity, despite the associated decrease in affinity for the ARF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assays also detected a potential face preference in the PB1 interaction between ARFs and IAAs, a quality that may be dependent on specific ARFIAA pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential auxin sensitivity of single PB1 mutants in different IAAs may therefore be indicative of basal differences in affinity for ARF19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar reasoning could account for the seemingly contradictory data from previous in planta repression assays (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some IAAs may have such low basal affinity for one or more ARFs that any further compromise of this interaction potential through a PB1 mutation renders them poor competitors for wild-type IAAs expressed in the same cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our yeast assays rely on a TPL fusion for repression, repression strength is primarily a proxy for ARFIAA interaction strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a TPL:IAA fusion is somewhat artificial in nature, repression in our system is dependent on the PB1 domain to mediate an IAAARF interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the close correspondence of our yeast and plant data indicates that TPL recruitment in planta is not impacted by PB1 mutations in the IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our studies have shed new light on the nature of IAAARF interactions, the mechanistic details of IAA-mediated repression remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement for a TPL:IAA fusion in yeast, along with the differences in strength and auxin reversibility of TPLN300 and TPLN100 repression, highlight key gaps in our knowledge around TPL recruitment and action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPL recruitment and its own multimerization could stabilize ARFIAA interactions, which would explain why IAAs expressed without TPL fusions are poor repressors in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that binding of the IAA to the ARF could lead to conformational changes in the flexible middle region of the ARF that blocks recruitment of coactivators (33, 39) or changes the module composition of core transcriptional machinery like the Mediator complex (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of the middle region in ARF7 and ARF19 has been shown to inhibit IAA interaction (41), indicating that signal integration from other pathways may take advantage of a link between an IAA interaction and the activity of the ARF middle region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nuclear auxin response pathway is a robust and tunable circuit that underlies almost every aspect of plant growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is becoming ever more apparent, however, that auxin does not work alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work ex situ has demonstrated the baseline for auxin response at the molecular level, which can now be used as a breadboard for testing additional layers of regulation and integration with other signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a wealth of transcriptome data (42, 43) can now be used to generate hypotheses about the likelihood of binding by a specific ARF through integration of cell type-specific expression maps of auxin signaling components (44) and binding-site preferences from protein binding arrays (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast auxin response circuits provide a resource to rapidly test these hypotheses and inform experimental designs in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating studies in plants, in vitro, in silico, and ex situ we can uncover how evolution has tinkered with the auxin nuclear pathway to accommodate innovations in plant life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strain_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ARFs were driven by the yeast ADH1 promoter and integrated at the HIS3 locus into a W303-1A MATa strain containing a pIAA19::Venus reporter variant integrated at URA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haploid strains were assayed to measure activity of different promoterARF combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maintain consistency across circuits of increasing complexity, ARF19 variant strains containing the P3(2x)::Venus reporter were mated to a MAT W814-29B strain containing the AFB2 auxin receptor integrated at LEU2 (YNL 175) for measuring activity of ARF19 point mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In experiments testing the activity of ARF19 PB1 dimers, each strain tested contained two genomically integrated copies of ARF19 to ensure a similar metabolic load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second ARF19 variant was introduced at the HIS3 locus of YNL175 before mating to W303-1A MATa strains containing an ARF19 variant and the P3(2x)::Venus reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAAs were expressed from the yeast GPD promoter and N-terminally tagged with either a TPLN300 or TPLN100 fragment for repression assays or YFP for degradation assays as described previously (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAAs were integrated at the TRP1 locus into a MAT W814-29B strain containing the AFB2 auxin receptor integrated at LEU2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For repression assays, IAA strains were then mated to W303-1A MATa strains containing an ARF19 variant and the P3(2x)::Venus reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S2 for a complete list of strains used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmid_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ARF and Aux/IAA point mutants were generated in pDONR vectors through Gibson assembly (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating yeast expression vectors were then generated through Gateway cloning as previously described (19, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For biochemical assays, epitope tags (4×-FLAG or 4×-MYC) were introduced as N-terminal fusions upstream of Gateway recombination sites in the HIS3-targeting single integrating vector (19) before an LR reaction to introduce the ARF19 variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 300-bp IAA19 promoter sequence was ordered as a gBlock gene fragment from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT) with a GA mutation introduced at the second position of each AuxRE site (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gibson assembly was used to swap the mutated pIAA19 gene fragment for the native IAA19 promoter sequence upstream of the Venus coding sequence in a URA3 single integrating Gateway vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AuxRE arrays were ordered as oligos or gBlock gene fragments with Gibson overhangs to introduce the sequences into the mutated pIAA19::Venus reporter construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S3 for oligo and gene fragment sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Yeast_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast transformations were performed using a standard lithium acetate protocol (47) into MATa W303-1A or MAT W814-29B (gifts from the Gottschling laboratory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) and Synthetic Complete (SC) mediums were made according to standard protocols and supplemented with 80 mg·mL1 adenine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MATa and MAT strains were mated by coinoculating strains at low density into YPD medium and growing overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm in a MaxQ 4000 Benchtop Oribital Shaker (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diploids were selected by streaking out 5 L of culture on SC plates lacking the appropriate amino acids and choosing a single colony to isostreak on YPD plates before glycerol stocking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence measurements were taken with a custom BD Accuri SORP flow cytometer with a CSampler 96-well plate adapter using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm and an emission detection filter at 545/35 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 20,000 events above a 40,000 FSC-H threshold (to exclude debris) were measured for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were exported as FCS 3.0 files and processed in R using the flowCore, plyr, and ggplot2 software packages and custom scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scripts and full datasets are available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ARF_Activity_and_IAA_Repression_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A freshly grown colony was inoculated in 500 L of SC media and grown at 30 °C with shaking at 375 rpm in 2,000 L Eppendorf Deepwell Plates 96.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 16 h of growth, cultures were either diluted 1:100 (haploid strains) or 1:200 (diploid strains) into fresh SC media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence measurements were taken after 6 h of additional growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For auxin response assays, diluted cultures were grown for 2 h before addition of 10 M auxin (IAA) or mock treatment [95% (vol/vol) ethanol].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence measurements were taken after 4 h of additional growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data for at least three independent replicates were pooled and plotted for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

YFP-IAA strains were grown as described previously (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal YFP-IAA expression was measured in haploid strains lacking the presence of an auxin receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For doseresponse assays, diploid strains coexpressing the AFB2 auxin receptor and a YFP-IAA variant ± ARF19 or ARF3 were diluted 1:200 into four separate wells containing 500 L of fresh SC media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 h of additional growth, an auxin dose (0.05, 0.5, or 5 M IAA) or mock treatment [95% (vol/vol) ethanol] was added to one of the four identical wells for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for differences between basal YFP-IAA expression levels, doseresponse fluorescence measurements were normalized by subtracting background autofluorescence and dividing by fluorescence levels of mock-treated strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast were grown overnight in 2550 mL liquid YPD at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next morning cultures were diluted to an OD of 0.2 into fresh YPD media and grown until an OD of 1.01.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then pelleted at 4 °C, rinsed once with TBS, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell pellets were lysed by glass bead disruption in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell lysate protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded onto 420% TGX gel (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-GFP (Sigma) was used to probe for YFP-tagged Aux/IAAs, anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology) was used to probe for Myc-ARF variants, and anti-PGK1 (Abcam) was used as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chromatin_Immunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast were inoculated in liquid YPD and grown at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 18 h of growth, cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh YPD to a final volume of 200 mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four hours postdilution, cells were treated with 20 mL of fix solution [11% (vol/vol) formaldehyde, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HepesKOH] for 20 min at room temperature with shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were further treated with 36 mL of 2.5 M glycine for 5 min to quench the cross-linking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then pelleted at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold TBS, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were lysed in breaking buffer [100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 1 mM PMSF] before sonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were processed in a Bioruptor Plus sonication device at 50% for 25 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following centrifugation (to pellet cellular debris), the supernatant was used for the IP reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) coupled to Protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies) was used to probe for FLAG-tagged ARF19 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following elution from the beads, samples were incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse cross-links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR for three independent replicates was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) in a C100 thermocycler fitted with a CFX96 Real-Time Detection System (Biorad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_and_Analysis_of_Transgenic_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 2-kb fragment of the IAA14 promoter (26) was cloned into pGREEN Gateway-compatible vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PB1 mutations were introduced through Gibson assembly in pDONR vectors containing the coding sequence for slr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constructs were transformed into Col-0 wild-type plants using the floral dip method (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T2 seeds of transgenic plants were sown on 0.5× Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium, 0.8% phytoagar plates supplemented with Kanamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plates were stratified at 4 °C for 2 d and grown in continuous light conditions for 7 dpg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted from transgenic seedlings and sequenced to confirm genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following selection, transformants were transplanted to plain 0.5× LS, 0.8% phytoagar plates and grown vertically in continuous light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were imaged at 14 dpg using an EPSON V500 scanner, and root density was measured in ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary roots were traced using a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium tablet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after imaging plants were flash-frozen at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was extracted from plants using a Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma), and 1g of cDNA was prepared using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analyzed using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) reactions run in a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative expression levels were calculated using the formula (Etarget)CPtarget/(Eref)CPref (50) and normalized to reference gene At1g13320.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yeast strains were grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm in SC medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 and grown for an additional 4.5 h. Yeast samples were assembled on glass coverslips with 1% agarose pads placed over the cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains were immediately visualized using a Leica DMI 3000B microscope fitted with a Leica 100× N-PLAN 1.25 oil objective and illuminated with a Lumencor SOLA light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were captured using Leica LAS AF version 2.6.0 software and a Leica DFC 345FX camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
