Characterizing treatment pathways at scale using the OHDSI network  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale international observational research is feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disease definitions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treatment pathway event flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The index date for each case was the time of first exposure to one of the medications deemed relevant to that disease according to the medication classes defined in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had to have been observed for at least 1 y before the index date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had to have at least one diagnosis code from Table 1 within the 1-y preindex to 3-y postindex period, and the patient could have no codes from the exclusions in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the patient had to have an exposure to one of the relevant medications for that disease in each 120-d period after the index date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data sources that allowed less-frequent updates (180 d for a prescription and five refills), the windows were adjusted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 illustrates the treatment pathways for the three diseases across all data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For diabetes, metformin was the most commonly prescribed medication; it was prescribed 75% of the time as the first medication and remained the only medication 29% of the time, thus confirming general adoption of the first-line recommendation of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists diabetes treatment algorithm (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertension shows the slight predominance of hydrochlorothiazide as a starting medication but the more significant predominance of lisinopril as a sole therapy, with hydrochlorothiazide being a sole therapy only rarely (hydrochlorothiazide is frequently paired with another active ingredient in combination medications).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depression shows a more even spread of medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, 10% of diabetes patients, 24% of hypertension patients, and 11% of depression patients followed a treatment pathway that was shared with no one else in any of the data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, for almost one quarter of hypertension patients, the response to the question, In an underlying population of 250 million, based on my 3-y treatment pathway, what patients are like me?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  would be No one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 shows the treatment pathways for selected data sources to illustrate their heterogeneity (see Supporting Information and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3 for all data sources).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of metformin in diabetes is not quite ubiquitous, as shown by comparing the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) (Fig 3C) with United States Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second-line diabetes therapy is far more variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, gliclazide use is reported only in the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) (Fig 3B), in which it is the predominant second-line therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertension shows a wide array of starting medications that are not consistent among the sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrochlorothiazide is used to varying degrees (Fig 3 DF), but lisinopril is relatively consistent in its use and placement as the top solo medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depression shows a generally more even distribution of medication use, but the most common medication varies by sources even within the United States (Fig 3 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 shows several metrics of medication use for the three diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A shows a trend of increasing use of monotherapy (defined here as the use of a single medication in the entire 3-y window) from 2000 to 2012 for all three diseases, equally high for diabetes and depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B illustrates that for hypertension and depression, unlike diabetes, the monotherapy trend is not driven by a single medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4C shows the degree to which a single medication dominates as a starting medication for the disease, with less convergence for hypertension and depression than for diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same metrics, split out by data source, are shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The figure confirms the overall trends but also illustrates heterogeneity by source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5A shows that diabetes monotherapy ranges from 10% in General Electric Centricity (GE) to 80% in Ajou University School of Medicine (AUSOM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adoption of metformin as a first (Fig 5C) and single (Fig 5B) medication over the studied time period, several data sources, such as Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), lag the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this difference could be a data-collection issue, it may simply reflect the difference in the severity of illness of patients represented by these two academic medical centers compared with broader populations or even differences in skill levels of prescribers at different sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hypertension and depression there was no one dominant medication (Fig 5 E and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5F shows the effects of differing formularies (i.e., list of allowable drugs): the United Kingdom (CPRD) and Japan (JMDC) show no use of hydrochlorothiazide, Sound Korea (AUSOM) shows significant use, and the United States sources are generally between these extremes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5 is also significant for what it fails to show: It fails to show a consistent bias between use of electronic health record data and use of claims data, other than that explained by sample size and differences in population (e.g., academic medical center, as noted above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, even though health records report medication orders and claims data report medication prescription fills, the two types of sources corroborate each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the graphs, sources are not generally grouped by type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in many cases, United States claims (CCAE) and United Kingdom health records (CPRD) track each other well (Fig 5 AD, G, and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors apparently have a larger effect on variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one consistent difference is the reduced noise associated with the larger sample sizes (Table 2) generally available in claims databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the World Health Organizations Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (23) to group medications into classes to see if diseases varied in the extent to which medications were changed or added within the same medication class (within-class medication change) or a different one (between-class medication change).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three diseases did not show a large change over the time period (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depression shows a stronger tendency to stay within class than diabetes or hypertension, but it had fewer classes (6 classes; also see Supporting Information and Table S1) than diabetes (23 classes) or hypertension (29 classes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This descriptive analysis demonstrates that coordinated efforts across an international collaborative can overcome many of the logistic and methodological challenges associated with observational study designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The profiles of treatment pathways are based on more than 250 million patient records, although some overlap is possible because of payers and health care providers reporting on the same patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OHDSI successfully addressed patient privacy and diverse research regulatory constraints, adopted a consistent data model, and distributed queries across a broad population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although this study happened to be of treatment pathways for three diseases, all the involved data sources have adopted a common industry standard for longitudinally recorded visits, diagnoses, procedures, medications, and (where available) laboratory tests, and any combination of the data can be used to answer future questions across medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A query authored at one OHDSI site may be run at all sites without further modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the wide variety of data sources, significant consistency is shown in Fig 5, with largely similar rates and similar upswing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, outliers are also seen, highlighting the danger of drawing broad inferences from single-site or even single-country observational studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study corroborates previous work by the OHDSI researchers, which illustrated the danger of naively combining data from disparate sources (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in treatment pathways over time, between countries, between practice types, and across sitessuch as the apparent lag in the adoption of metformin for treatment of diabetes mellitus in some sitespoints to potential challenges for generalizing randomized trial results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, differences in treatment practices between studied and nonstudied groups could threaten the ability to generalize the efficacy of even nonmedication interventions such as education to nonstudied groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing diseases, we see consistent differences, perhaps related to the availability, appropriateness, or acceptance of concrete recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetes shows greater adoption of a single medication, especially in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depression, which has far less concrete guidelines, has a roughly similar rate of single-medication use, but no one medication stands out as predominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additions and changes of medications are more likely to be within the same medication class for depression than for the other diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences among diseases are not solely the result of formal recommendations, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metformin, which was approved in the United States relatively recently (1995), already dominated the market as a first-line therapy in 2000 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proportion of patients with a sequence of medication use that is unique across all data sourcesalmost one quarter the patients with hypertensionis striking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may point to a failure of the field to converge on an effective treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation in first medications (Fig 3 DF) corroborates this fact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When precision medicine becomes a reality, with fine-grained, reliable knowledge of patient characteristics, it may be possible to assign a unique sequence tailored to a patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the time being, however, much of this variation probably reflects ineffective differences in practice and a trial-and-error approach to diseases that are difficult to treat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results have general and specific implications for randomized clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterogeneity implies that randomized trials may not be broadly generalizable if not designed properly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multicenter trials should not be a convenient sample of academic medical centers but a purposeful selection of environments that represent the diversity of practice in health care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During analysis, trial results cannot simply be aggregated but may need to be stratified by practice characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, trials in diabetes, hypertension, and depression can use our uncovered pathways and their prevalences for future trial design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, hypotheses and control groups for trials in these diseases should consider actual rather than assumed practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a medication of interest is always given in sequence after another one, then a randomized trial of the causal effect of new-onset use of that medication will not be relevant to current practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There has been related work on empirical treatment pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One project generated algorithms for mining time dependencies, although it was applied only to a cohort of 113 stroke patients (25), and is most appropriate to extract the maximum information from a small dataset in terms of the computation required and the detail returned per case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using previous experience to guide future recommendations is a related area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous experience, especially experience explicitly rated by physicians, can be used to generate recommendations (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed pathways can be extracted from hospital event logs (27), although they generally have been extracted from a single environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale data have been used to study specific medications in specific diseases, such as rosiglitazone in diabetes using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the future, our OHDSI framework may be able to facilitate randomized trials at three stages: design, execution, and generalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the design stage, in addition to the characterization illustrated in this study and discussed above, observational databases may improve both the estimation of the number of subjects available and the gross estimation of the effect sizes and variances to calculate the number of subjects needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For execution, observational databases may facilitate subject recruitment and data collection in pragmatic trials (29), andmore ambitiouslythey may complement randomized trials by providing direct evidence for causation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key problem is avoiding or controlling confounding, using methods that model statistical and information theoretic relationships within a set of variables such as structural equations and graphical models (30), methods that place candidate associations in a context to judge the plausibility of causation such as the Hill Criteria (31), methods that correct effect size estimations such as the use of propensity scores (32), designs that reduce confounding such as self-controlled case series (33), and others (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If confounding can be addressed, then observational trials can increase sample size, add diversity, and handle more complex interventions such as sequences of treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the characterization illustrated in this study to assess the risk of generalization failure, observational databases may be able to improve generalization (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By mimicking the randomized clinical trial in the study population as well as other target populations, the observational version may reveal trends in effect sizes that are applicable to the randomized trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the leap from observational researchs associations to causality is similar to the leap from randomized trials causes to individual treatment because both are subject to assumptions and confounders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fuller (37) separates the generalization procedure into two parts: (i) going from the study population in which the trial was carried out to the local population to which the individual belongs, and (ii) going from the local population to the individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former may be aided by observational databases, and the latter is an example of precision medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full count of 682 million records (17) that have been converted to OHDSIs data model has implications for a worldwide database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although that number includes duplicate patients, OHDSIs successful conversion of a number of records equal to almost 1/10th of the worlds population as a voluntary effort implies that converting the entire world population to a single, highly detailed data model is technically feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also shows the success of an open, voluntary approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OHDSI will distribute an open request for applications for queries against its databases for researchers at any level, from high school student to Nobel Laureate, selecting queries based on feasibility and potential impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study and the OHDSI framework have limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the strict definition of 1 y off treatment followed by 3 y on continuous treatment reduces sample size and could cause biases such as loss of patients with severe disease who die within 3 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, data derived from electronic health records and from claims databases are naturally noisy with missing values, and observational data are subject to confounding, both measured and unmeasured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OHDSI network is voluntary, so participation may vary from study to study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the OHDSI project exploited 250 million patient records and assessed treatment pathways for three different chronic diseases over time, across national boundaries, and across distinct data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study proved feasible, with largely consistent results but also with significant heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variability in treatment pathways was found, and diseases differed in patterns of drug use such as the favoring of a single medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale international observational studies can use a consistent data model, cover a broad population, and address patient privacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each sites Common Data Model (23) was populated with patient characteristics, health care visits, diseases, medications, procedures, and, optionally, other types of data such as laboratory tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data elements were translated to standard terminologies such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (diseases, procedures) (38), RxNorm (medications) (39), and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (laboratory tests) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data sources depended on the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some sites used administrative claims, usually obtained from clinical data distributors, and other sites used local electronic health record data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medication information came from insurance claims, pharmacy fulfillments, prescriptions, or clinical narrative documentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a query against the OHDSI Common Data Model as follows (also see Supporting Information, including de-identified Datasets S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients were included if they had at least one exposure to an antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, or antidepressant medication and at least one diagnosis code for the corresponding diseasetype 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or depressionat any time in their record and had no excluded diagnoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The index date was considered to be the first exposure to the medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had to have at least 1 y of history in the database before the index date to increase the likelihood that this was a first treatment of the disease by any medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had to have at least 3 y of continuous treatment after the index date with some medication targeted to the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three years was chosen to ensure sufficient time to characterize a pathway, although this requirement lost patients who died within the 3-y period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous treatment was required to ensure that patients were not treated elsewhere during the period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these strict definitions reduced the number who qualified327,110 diabetes patients, 1,182,792 hypertension patients, and 264,841 depression patients had 3 y of uninterrupted therapyit produced a more consistent cohort across data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the flow of events necessary for a patient to qualify for the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A patients sequence could come from any time in a database as long as it satisfied the 4-y time window (1 y before and 3 y after the index date).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tabulations and graphs, we use a sequences index date to determine its year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diagnosis code was defined in Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (38) and in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (41) and was mapped to other terminologies including the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medications were defined according to their ingredients using the RxNorm terminology (39) and were grouped according to classification hierarchies such as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (23) and First Data Banks terminology (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chosen medication classes and diagnoses are listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of measuring intraclass medication changes, classes were defined at the second level of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification hierarchy (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequence of medications taken by each patient was extracted from the databases, ordering them by first exposure to the medication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that only the first exposure was recorded for patients who switched from a medication and then back to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence does not distinguish between switching medications and adding medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination medications with multiple active ingredients were treated as if the multiple ingredients were prescribed independently but simultaneously to avoid inducing measured diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were limited to 20 medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then counted the number of individuals within the database who had each observed sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created tabular and graphical summaries of the sequence results, stratifying by disease, database, and index year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran the analyses on 11 databases, summarized in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full source code for the analysis is freely available (44); it is implemented in Structured Query Language coupled with R (45) for aggregated data generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sunburst plots were generated from medication sequences (using software written in Hypertext Markup Language 5 and JavaScript using Data-Driven Documents, available at OHDSI.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare consistency of medication use across diseases, we defined three metrics: (i) the proportion of cases with only one medication in the sequence (monotherapy); (ii) the proportion of cases in which the sequence contains only the most common monotherapy medication for that disease; and (iii) the proportion of cases in which a sequence begins with the most common starting medication for that disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These metrics were chosen so that we could compare diseases in a generic way, with no specific knowledge of the diseases other than tallying the most common medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher proportions generally imply greater agreement on treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each site confirmed Institutional Review Board approval for the study or confirmed that their analysis did not require approval because it was exempt or was deemed nonhuman subjects research (e.g., because the database had previously been de-identified).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Medication sequences were generated from 11 OHDSI Common Data Model data sources as described in Materials and Methods and illustrated in Fig 1 in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full source code for the conversion is available at www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=research:treatment_pathways_in_chronic_disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sunburst plots (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 in the main text) were calculated as the proportion of cases that had a given sequence of medications: one medication, two medications, three medications, and four medications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer sequences were truncated to four medications and were included with other four-medication sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When binning across sources, the simple sum was used, and therefore sources with greater sample size had greater weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sunburst plots themselves were generated using software written in Hypertext Markup Language 5 and JavaScript using Data-Driven Documents (available at OHDSI.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proportion of cases with one medication in the sequence (referred to as monotherapy in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4A and 5 in the main text) was calculated as the sum of the number of cases with sequences with exactly one medication divided by the total number of cases, binning by year and then by data source and year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When binning by year for this metric and the others, the simple sum across all sources was used, and therefore sources with greater sample size had greater weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the proportion of cases in which the sequence contains only the most common monotherapy medication for that disease (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4B and 5 in the main text), we selected the one medication for each disease that had the highest proportion of monotherapy across all sources and across all years, and then we calculated the proportion of cases with sequences that had only that medication, binning by year and then by source and year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the proportion of cases in which a sequence begins with the most common starting medication for that disease (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and 5 in the main text), we selected the one medication for each disease that was most the frequent first medication in a sequence across all sources and across all years, and then we calculated the proportion of cases with sequences that started with that medication, binning by year and then by source and year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the World Health Organizations Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification (www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/) to group medications into classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For type 2 diabetes mellitus and for depression, we used a single-level ancestor in the ATC hierarchy; for hypertension we used two levels, resulting in the classes shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of transitions within a sequence is one less than the number of medications in the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of within-class transitions is the number of sequential pairs that both belong in the same medication class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of medication changes within class was then the simple sum of within-class transitions for all cases divided by the simple sum of transitions for all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For calculating the proportion of cases with a sequence that was shared with no one else, the sequence had to be unique across all sources and all years, not just within source or within year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5 in the main text shows only a sample of three sources for each disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1 shows all sources for type 2 diabetes mellitus, Fig S2 shows all sources for hypertension, and Fig S3 shows all sources for depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequences derived from the data sources are available in this Supporting Information as four files: rxpath5cell_dictionary.xlsx (Dataset S1), rxpath5cell_diabetes2.xlsx (Dataset S2), rxpath5cell_hypertension.xlsx (Dataset S3), and rxpath5cell_depression.xlsx (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of licensing requirements for the data sources, cell counts have been limited to a minimum of five.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences with fewer than five cases were truncated until the common initial section of several sequences surpassed a total count of five, and the truncated portion was marked Other (code 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the count of unique sequences cannot be calculated from this dataset, but the rest of the metrics and visualizations should be approximately the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The file rxpath5cell_dictionary.xlsx defines the medication codes and source codes used in the other files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The files rxpath5cell_diabetes2.xlsx, rxpath5cell_hypertension.xlsx, and rxpath5cell_depression.xlsx each contain the sequences for the corresponding diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They include the code of the source, the year (where 9999 combines all years), the number of cases in that source and year bin that had a given sequence, and then the codes of the 20 first medications in that sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sequences ends when 0 is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a sequence of 1597756, 0, 0,  implies that glimepiride was the sole medication, and a sequence of 1529331, 1, 0, 0,  indicates a collection of uncommonly used sequences that started with acarbose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
