Structural basis for Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nosocomial infections and infections of indwelling devices are major healthcare problems worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These infections are strongly associated with the ability of pathogens to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Panantibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most troublesome pathogens, capable of colonizing medical devices by means of Csu pili, an adhesive organelle that belongs to the widespread class of archaic chaperoneusher pili.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report an atomic-resolution insight into the mechanism of bacterial attachment to abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that archaic pili use a binding mechanism that enables bacterial adhesion to structurally variable substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest a simple and cheap solution to reduce infections of A. baumannii and related pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acinetobacter baumanniia leading cause of nosocomial infectionshas a remarkable capacity to persist in hospital environments and medical devices due to its ability to form biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biofilm formation is mediated by Csu pili, assembled via the archaic chaperoneusher pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray structure of the CsuC-CsuE chaperoneadhesin preassembly complex reveals the basis for bacterial attachment to abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsuE exposes three hydrophobic finger-like loops at the tip of the pilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing the hydrophobicity of these abolishes bacterial attachment, suggesting that archaic pili use tip-fingers to detect and bind to hydrophobic cavities in substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antitip antibody completely blocks biofilm formation, presenting a means to prevent the spread of the pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of hydrophilic materials instead of hydrophobic plastics in medical devices may represent another simple and cheap solution to reduce pathogen spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the tip-fingers binding mechanism is shared by all archaic pili carrying two-domain adhesins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of flexible fingers instead of classical receptor-binding cavities is presumably more advantageous for attachment to structurally variable substrates, such as abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Csu pili-mediate bacterial attachment to abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two fingers of a polyethylene glove, Left and Right in the image, were dipped into culture medium of Escherichia coli expressing and not expressing Csu pili, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize bacteria, expression of yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) was induced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To produce a convenient model to study the function of Csu pili, the Csu gene cluster was cloned in Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of pili resulted in strong adherence of the recombinant strain to hydrophobic plastics, in particular polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials are widely used in medical equipment implicated in the spread of A. baumannii (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the case of the A. baumannii 19606 prototype strain (6), recombinant E. coli biofilms were particularly pronounced at the liquidair interface and were visualized as a fluorescent ring of bacteria coexpressing Csu pili with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or a blue ring after staining cells with crystal violet (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion of the strain to hydrophilic surfaces, such as glass and cellophane, was also observed (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such biofilms were easily washed away, suggesting that Csu pili mediate tight bacterial attachment only to hydrophobic substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the induced strain revealed thin (3.5 nm), compared with the classical type 1 and P pili (17, 18), but unusually long pili (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletions of CsuA/B and CsuE completely abrogated pilus assembly (SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletions of CsuA and CsuB led to assembly of a few abnormal fibers (SI Appendix, Fig S3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the deletion mutants were capable of biofilm formation on plastics, suggesting that all four subunits are required to form functional pili (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas CsuA/B, CsuA, and CsuB may have structural roles as building blocks of the pilus stalk (6, 7, 19), CsuE must be critical for initiation of assembly, similarly to tip-located TDAs of type 1 and P pili (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain insight into the role of CsuE, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of CsuE complexed with the CsuC chaperone (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of the CsuC-CsuE complex was solved using selenomethionine single anomalous dispersion (Se-SAD) phasing to a resolution of 2.3 Å (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refinement statistics are shown in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two copies of the CsuC-CsuE heterodimer are present in the P1 unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of CsuC is virtually the same in both copies, with an RMSD deviation between C atoms of 0.5 Å, and is similar to the structure of CsuC in the CsuC-CsuA/B complex (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of CsuE molecules revealed much larger differences (RMSD 1.4 Å) (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsuE folds into two -barrel domains (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angle between the domains gives the molecule an overall C-like shape, bending over domain 1 of CsuC (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-terminal domain of CsuE binds in the cleft between the CsuC domains (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has an incomplete Ig-like fold that lacks the canonical C-terminal strand G (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The missing strand is provided by CsuC, which inserts its strand G1 into a hydrophobic groove at the edge of -sheet DCCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the groove is likely to accept a donor strand during pilus assembly to connect CsuE to the rest of the fiber, we refer to this domain as the pilin domain (CsuEpd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, CsuEpd shows significant structural similarity to CsuA/B (Z-score = 9.9, SI Appendix, Fig S7), which currently serves as a prototype of stalk pilins in the archaic CU pathway (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like CsuC-bound CsuA/B, CsuEpd has a large fraction of disordered or poorly ordered sequence (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S8A), further supporting our previous conclusion that nonclassical chaperones, unlike their classical counterparts, maintain subunits in a substantially disordered conformational state (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The N-terminal domain is connected to CsuEpd by a three-residue linker with a proline in the middle (Fig 2 A and C and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrophobic interactions and a network of hydrogen and ionic bonds dominate the interface between the domains (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CsuE N-terminal domain (CsuENTD) has a mixed / structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core of the domain is formed by an Ig-like sandwich that adopts a -barrel shape due to switches of edge strands A and D between the -sheets (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association of strand A1 with strand G12 results in a mixed parallelantiparallel structure of the second -sheet (Fig 2B), which is also a common feature of lectin domains of TDAs in both classical and alternative systems (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, CsuENTD shares considerable structural similarity with lectin domains of CfaE and FimH (Z-scores of 6.9 and 5.5, respectively), again pointing to a possible role of CsuENTD in bacterial adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, comparison of these structures (SI Appendix, Fig S10) uncovered a major topological difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CsuENTD, both -sheets are split due to loop insertions in all major -strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the structure consists not of one, but rather two -barrels, each of which is partially sealed by an -helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique arrangement makes CsuENTD longer than other TDAs of known structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its length is further increased by the presence of three large loops forming a three-fingered structure at the tip of CsuENTD (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the finger loops are very hydrophobic, with hydrophobic motifs consisting of 24 surface-exposed residues, only one of which has a polar side chain (Asn45) (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two hydrophobic fingers are conserved among archaic TDAs, whereas the third loop is specific for Csu pili of A. baumannii (Fig 2E and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hydrophobic nature of the finger loops prompted us to examine their possible involvement in A. baumannii biofilm formation on hydrophobic substrates (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduced four mutations decreasing the hydrophobicity of the fingers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacement of residues L40ALA43 with SGSG or SG, residues I140VGIGV145 with SSGSGS, and residues L157GI159 with SGS disrupted hydrophobic fingers 13, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to deletion of the entire CsuE subunit, these mutations neither decreased the level of assembly of Csu pili (Fig 3B) nor affected their morphology (SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mutations in finger 3 dramatically decreased, and mutations in fingers 1 and 2 practically abolished biofilm formation (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide conclusive evidence that the three-finger structure indeed plays an essential role in biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the role of the finger loops in binding to hydrophobic plastics, we examined the effect of mutation I140VGIGV145  SSGSGS on binding of CsuE complexed to CsuC, and of CsuENTD (SI Appendix, Fig S12), to polystyrene surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable quantitative analysis of protein binding to plastics, wild-type and mutant CsuC-CsuE and CsuENTD were labeled with Eu3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical amounts of equally labeled wild-type and mutant proteins were incubated in polystyrene plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both wild-type and mutant proteins bound to polystyrene plates in our experimental setup, measurements of Eu fluorescence in the samples revealed that wild-type proteins consistently bound more efficiently to plastics than the corresponding mutants (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result strongly suggests that the hydrophobic fingers directly mediate binding of Csu pili to hydrophobic plastics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate Csu pili-mediated biofilm formation, we raised polyclonal antibodies against self-complemented CsuA/B subunit (A/B) and CsuENTD (EN) and examined the effect of these antibodies on biofilm formation of A. baumannii (Fig 4) and Csu pili-expressing E. coli (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cultures were incubated with different dilutions of A/B and EN antibodies and preimmune serum (negative control) and then assayed for biofilm formation in wells of polystyrene microtiter plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EN diluted up to several thousand times completely blocked biofilm formation of A. baumannii (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A/B also inhibited biofilm formation, but inhibition was observed only at high concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result further underlines the critical role of CsuENTD in bacterial adhesion to hydrophobic plastics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Csu gene cluster is highly conserved and is present in nearly all clinical isolates of A. baumannii (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study Csu pili expression in different A. baumannii strains, we analyzed bacterial surface extracts of five unrelated isolates of A. baumannii from the Culture Collection of the University of Gothenburg (SI Appendix, Table S1), including type strain 19096T [known to express large amounts of Csu pili (6)], with Western blotting using A/B serum (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Csu pili were detected in all five isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three isolates, the expression level was about two to three times lower than in 19096T, and in one isolate it was notably higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EN antibody completely blocked biofilm formation of all five isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Csu pili are constitutively expressed in a wide variety of A. baumannii isolates and are responsible for A. baumannii biofilm formation on hydrophobic plastics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding further highlights the role of Csu pili in the spread of A. baumannii in medical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong inhibitory effect of EN antibody presents a means to prevent the spread of the pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of hydrophilic materials instead of hydrophobic plastics in medical devices represents another simple solution to reduce pathogen outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we observed much weaker biofilms on gloves made of polyvinyl chloride than on polyethylene gloves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another multidrug-resistant pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, assembles phylogenetically related CupE pili, which have recently been shown to mediate morphologically similar biofilms (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable sequence similarity between two-domain tip subunits CsuE and CupE6 and the presence of two hydrophobic loop motifs in CupE6 corresponding to hydrophobic fingers 1 and 2 in CsuE (Fig 2E) suggest that CupE pili may use a similar attachment mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we predict that the means suggested for A. baumannii above might also be applied to control the spread of P. aeruginosa infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of binding mechanisms of archaic and classical pili reveals an important conceptual difference (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many other proteins, which function relies on substrate or receptor recognition, classical pili use a depression or a binding cavity, which is complementary in shape and chemical properties to the minimal binding determinant of the host cell receptor (1315, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that archaic pili have no such binding cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, they use protruding finger-like loops that may insert into cavities in substrates to establish tight attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of flexible fingers (SI Appendix, Fig S5) instead of preformed receptor-binding cavities may have an important advantage when bacteria need to attach to structurally variable substrates, such as abiotic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although being less specific, this flexible mode of binding may promote an equally tight attachment because, in the process of surface scanning, the fingers would likely find a suitable cavity in the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fingers 1 and 2 are predicted in all TDA subunits of archaic pili (SI Appendix, Fig S11), suggesting that the tip-fingers binding mechanism is shared by all archaic systems and has likely evolved early in nonpathogenic bacteria to mediate adhesion to abiotic substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our first atomic-resolution insight into bacterial colonization of human-made substrates may be very useful in addressing another very important medical problembiofilm-associated infections of indwelling medical devices (IMDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IMDs are often colonized by bacterial and fungal pathogens, increasing mortality rates by more than 25% in some cases (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knowledge of the nature of microbesubstrate interactions presented here will help development of device coatings preventing colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Bacterial_Strains_and_Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characteristics and source of the bacterial strains used in this study are given in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligonucleotides are listed in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression plasmids were constructed based on the pBAD-ENSPA plasmid (25) or pET101D expression vector (Invitrogen) as described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pBAD-Csu plasmid and its derivatives were used to express wild-type and mutant Csu pili, and the pET101-CsuENPD6H plasmid and its derivative were used to express wild-type and mutant CsuENTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletions and substitutions were generated using reverse PCR as described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CsuC-CsuE expression and purification is described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To express CsuENTD, E. coli BL21-AI was transformed with pET101-CsuENPD6H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cells were cultivated in Luria Broth (LB) medium containing ampicillin (80100 mg/L) at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were grown at 110 rpm in baffled flasks to an optical density (OD) of 0.81 at 600 nm and were induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.2% arabinose for protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culture was grown for a further 2.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and CsuENTD was purified from the periplasm by metalion affinity chromatography at 4 °C using a 5-mL HiTrap Ni-IMAC column (GE Healthcare) essentially as the CsuC-CsuA/B complex (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample of CsuENTD was used to generate polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Innovagen AB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details of crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection and phasing were previously published (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model building and refinements were performed by the PHENIX refinement module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manual corrections were done with the molecular modeling program COOT (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refinement statistics are given in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biofilm_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E. coli strain BL21 harboring pBAD-Csu or its derivatives was cultured overnight in LB medium in the presence of 100 mg/L ampicillin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One milliliter of the fresh medium in a 12-mL polypropylene tube was inoculated with 20 L of the overnight culture and then grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for 2 h. Arabinose was added to 0.02% final concentration to induce expression of the Csu pili, and the cells were further grown with shaking at 200 rpm for 2.5 h. The cell density was determined by measuring OD at 600 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubes were emptied and rinsed briefly with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biofilms were stained with 1% crystal violet for 15 min, rinsed with water, and dissolved in 1.5 mL of 0.2% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hundred microliters of this solution was transferred into microtiter wells, and OD was measured with a 96-well plate spectrometer reader at 595 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study A. baumannii biofilms, strains from the Culture Collection, University of Gothenburg (CCUG), were transferred with an inoculation loop from an agar slant into 5 mL of Super Broth (SB) medium in a 12-mL polypropylene or polystyrene tube and grown overnight at 37 °C without shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the following day, the tubes were emptied, rinsed with PBS, and remaining biofilms were analyzed as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study biofilms of living cells, E. coli strain BL21 was cotransformed with plasmids pBAD-Csu and pYPet-His (gift from Patrick Daugherty, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, Addgene plasmid #14031), overexpressing Csu pili and YFP, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria were cultured overnight in LB medium in the presence of 100 mg/L ampicillin and 25 mg/L chloramphenicol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the following day, 20 mL LB medium was inoculated with 1 mL of the overnight culture, grown for 2 h, and expression of pili and YFP was induced for 2.5 h with 0.04% arabinose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induced cells were used to examine biofilm formation on various surfaces (plastic and glass tubes, gloves, and straps of cellophane).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uninduced cells were used as a negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, biofilms were rinsed gently (hydrophilic surfaces) or thoroughly (hydrophobic surfaces) with water, and YFP fluorescence was observed on a Dark Reader blue transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research) and photographed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biofilm_Inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell culture samples were mixed with antibody or serum dilution in an Eppendorf tube for 30 min at 22 °C with gentle shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two 150-µL aliquots from each mixture were transferred with a micropipette to wells of a microtiter plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate was incubated at 22 °C for 2 h without shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wells were then emptied and washed three times with 300 µL of distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any remaining biofilm was stained with 1% crystal violet for 30 min, washed with water again, and dissolved in 250 µL of 0.2% Triton X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical density at 595 nm was determined with a 96-well plate spectrometer reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Purification_of_Csu_pili  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E. coli strain BL21 harboring pBAD-Csu or A. baumannii strains from CCUG were cultured in appropriate medium as described above, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min, washed with 0.5 mM Tris, 75 mM NaCl, pH 7.3, and suspended in the same buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4,000 g for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants containing detached pili were carefully removed and stored at 4 °C before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial cells or purified pili were sampled with Formvar-coated gold grids, negative-stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and visualized using a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operated at 80-kV acceleration voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell cultures grown for biofilm assay were mixed with Laemmli buffer, and the samples were incubated at 22 °C or boiled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 18% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto an Immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in Bio-Rad A-buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, with 20% methanol and 0.1% SDS) at 100 V for 1 h. Membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS/Tween, incubated with primary anti-CsuA/B rabbit polyclonal antibody (Innovagen AB), followed by incubation with secondary IRDye 68RD-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein bands were detected and quantified with the Odyssey system (Li-Cor Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_CsuE_Binding_to_Plastics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eu+3 labeled proteins were incubated in 5.5-cm polystyrene Petri dishes (Sarstedt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots were withdrawn at different time points to measure delayed Eu+3 fluorescence and generate binding curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix for detailed experimental protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
