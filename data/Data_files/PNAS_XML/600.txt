Pure circular polarization electroluminescence at room temperature with spin-polarized light-emitting diodes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most of the experiments on the spin manipulation in semiconductors, the principal materials in modern electronic and photonic devices, were carried out at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields because thermal energy tends to randomize spin information in the semiconductor that is nonmagnetic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report very surprising experimental results of pure circular polarization electroluminescence at room temperature with no external magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are obtained by electrically injecting moderately high density of spins into semiconductor double heterostructures, the structures that were invented in connection with semiconductor lasers one-half century ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest the appearance of some spin-dependent nonlinear processes that lead to recovering and even enhancing the injected, initial spin information in semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report the room-temperature electroluminescence (EL) with nearly pure circular polarization (CP) from GaAs-based spin-polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External magnetic fields are not used during device operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two small schemes in the tested spin-LEDs: first, the stripe-laser-like structure that helps intensify the EL light at the cleaved side walls below the spin injector Fe slab, and second, the crystalline AlOx spin-tunnel barrier that ensures electrically stable device operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of CP is depressively low in the low current density (J) region, whereas it increases steeply and reaches close to the pure CP when J  greater than  100 A/cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, either right- or left-handed CP component is significantly suppressed depending on the direction of magnetization of the spin injector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spin-dependent reabsorption, spin-induced birefringence, and optical spin-axis conversion are suggested to account for the observed experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Spectral-Resolved_CP_Degree_Plots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Shown in Fig S1 are the spectral dependence of CP (PCP) obtained from three different chips with different current densities J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCP values are extracted from + and  EL spectra that are also shown together in the figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the data obtained at J = 184 A/cm2 from chip B, the PCP values are nearly independent of the photon energy within the limit of the energy region specified by the emission bands A and B, reflecting the degenerated heavy- and light-hole valence bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in the PCP value in the relatively high photon energy region (h  1.40 eV) at J = 184 A/cm2 from chip B should be treated carefully because the emission intensity in the corresponding photon energy region is fairly weak in this particular case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EL_Spectra_from_the_Spin-LED_Chip_Without_a_Crystalline_AlOx_Tunnel_Barrier  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S2 shows + and  EL spectra obtained from one of the spin-LED chips in which the Au/Ti/Fe spin injectors were deposited directly on top of DH and processed in the same fashion as those having the -AlOx barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chips exhibit weak EL consisting primarily of band A at RT, and the difference in intensity between the two circular components is very small; e.g., if any, PCP  3 Ã— 105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chips were usually short-circuited and ceased emitting light when a current was increased at J = 40 A/cm2 or higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these experimental results, we suppose that, without the -AlOx barrier, a current tends to concentrate in the region close to the cleaved edge and causes severe degradation during experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the role of the -like AlOx barrier is not only to avoid the conductivity mismatch (16, 17) but also to promote uniform current/spin injection by capping unwanted local current paths and to prevent the formation of an interface layer caused by the chemical reaction between magnetic and semiconductor materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rate_Equations_on_the_Basis_of_Fig_5A  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rate equations for electrons and photons in a p-GaAs active layer can be expressed as below:dN1dt=GN11N14+RaN3S,[S1]dN2dt=N11N23,[S2]dN3dt=N23N32+N14RaN3S,[S3]dSdt=N11RaN3SSph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S4]Here, N1, N2, and N3 represent densities of electrons in the C.B., in the band-tail states, and in the V.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  near the Fermi level, respectively, whereas S is the density of photons in the p-GaAs active layer (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time constants j (j=14) are those of radiative recombination (process A), dielectric relaxation (process B), intraband relaxation (process C), and nonradiative recombination (process E), respectively, whereas ph is the photon lifetime in a GaAs active layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation rate G in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 is expressed by G = J/ed, in which J is the current density, e an electron charge, and d the thickness of the active layer, whereas reabsorption rate Ra is expressed by Ra= {(N1  N3)/N3}B, in which  represents the optical confinement coefficient and B the Einstein coefficient for the spontaneous transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Referring to Fig S3, the first term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 represents the rate of electron injection into the C.B., the second and third terms are for the electron annihilation from the C.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  due to radiative and nonradiative recombination, respectively, and the fourth term is generation due to the reabsorption which is proportional to the photon density S and the carrier density N3 around the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 results from the radiative recombination between the C.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and the band-tail states, whereas the second term represents the intraband relaxation (e.g., electronphonon scattering) within the band-tail states., The second term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 represents the extraction of electrons from the V.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  due to the dielectric relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third term in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 is determined by the escape rate of photons from the active layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As for the representative values for time constants, radiative recombination time 1 is 15ns for p  1018cm3 in GaAs, the dielectric relaxation time 260fs, the electronphonon scattering time 3 on the order of subpicoseconds, and the nonradiative recombination time 4  greater than  1 in the relatively large J region in which relatively fast nonradiative recombination centers are presumably saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of ph, which depends on the optical path length, the refractive index, the absorption coefficient, and the internal reflection coefficient at the cleaved edge, is estimated to be on the order of 10 ps or lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To simulate the dynamics of spin-polarized carriers and photons, spin-resolved electron and photon densities, NiÂ± and SÂ±, should be introduced in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the optical selection rule (Fig 5B) that reflects the degenerated HH- and LH bands in the V.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  should be incorporated in those equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concretely stated, the term RaN3S should be replaced by the following term: (3/4)RaN3Â±S+(1/4)RaN3SÂ±.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the spin-relaxation term (at least for N1, N1Â±/Â±spin), which also opens the pathway of conversion between spin-up and -down electrons, should be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One would be able to compute quantitatively the dynamics of spin-LEDs when all these factors were included in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will an interesting subject for properly drawing a blueprint for a spin-LED with pure CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
