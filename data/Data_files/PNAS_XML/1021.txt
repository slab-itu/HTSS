Characterization of SPP inhibitors suppressing propagation of HCV and protozoa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an essential host factor for propagation of hepatitis C virus (HCV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that dibenzoazepine-type -secretase inhibitors suppressed the maturation of all genotypes of HCV core proteins through a specific interaction with Val223 in SPP, and no drug-resistant virus emerged after several passages of HCV in the presence of the SPP inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SPP encoded by Plasmodium falciparum was functionally similar to human SPP, and treatment with the SPP inhibitors suppressed the propagation of protozoa, including P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural analysis in silico revealed that Phe258 of SPP participates in binding to the inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds possessing a high affinity to Val223/Phe258 in SPP might be novel therapeutics for chronic hepatitis C and protozoiasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane aspartic protease involved in the maturation of the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processing of HCV core protein by SPP has been reported to be critical for the propagation and pathogenesis of HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examined the inhibitory activity of inhibitors for -secretase, another intramembrane cleaving protease, against SPP, and our findings revealed that the dibenzoazepine-type structure in the -secretase inhibitors is critical for the inhibition of SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial distribution showed that the -secretase inhibitor compound YO-01027 with the dibenzoazepine structure exhibits potent inhibiting activity against SPP in vitro and in vivo through the interaction of Val223 in SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with this SPP inhibitor suppressed the maturation of core proteins of all HCV genotypes without the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, in contrast to the treatment with direct-acting antivirals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YO-01027 also efficiently inhibited the propagation of protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that SPP is an ideal target for the development of therapeutics not only against chronic hepatitis C but also against protozoiasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T), and two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Huh7 and Huh7.5.1) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GT1 (Con1 strain) (30) and GT2 (JFH1 strain) (31) replicon cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 1 mg/mL of G418.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 AM) at room temperature (23 °C ± 2 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal experiments conformed to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (32) and were approved by the Institutional Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used in the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_HCV_and_T_gondii  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HCV derived from the GT2a JFH-1 strain mutated in E2, p7, and NS2 as shown (33) was prepared by serial passages in Huh7.5.1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 1.5 × 106 Huh7.5.1 cells seeded on a 10-cm dish were incubated for 1 d and were inoculated with HCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0, and the culture medium was changed to fresh medium at 2 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture supernatants were collected at 4 d postinfection, and infectious titers were determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  J6/JFH1 and Con1/JFH1 were prepared as previously described (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A lentiviral vector, FUGW (#14883) was obtained from Addgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FUGW was inserted into the puromycin N-acetyl-transferase gene and the GFP gene under the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence, and the resulting plasmids were designated FUIPW and FUIGW, respectively (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid pCMV-VSV-G (#8454) was obtained from Addgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-Rev were obtained from David Huang, The Walter & Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Australia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cDNAs of GT1 (TN strain), GT1 (H77C strain), GT2 (J6 strain), GT2 (J8 strain), GT2 (JFH1 strain), GT3 (S52 strain), GT4 (ED43 strain), GT5 (SA13 strain), GT6 (HK6a strain), and GT7 (QC69 strain) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cDNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into FUIGW together with FLAG tag sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPP gene encoded in P. falciparum was synthesized by IDT, amplified by PCR, and cloned into FUIPW together with an ER retrieval sequence fused with HA tag sequences (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPP mutants were generated by the overlap extension method and were cloned into FUIPW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cloning procedures were performed using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech), and the sequences were confirmed by using an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Lentiviruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293T cells (2 × 106) were seeded on a 10-cm dish and incubated at 37 °C for 1 d. The lentiviral transfer vector FUIPW (1.5 µg), 2 µg of pMDLg/pRRE, 2 µg of pRSV-Rev, and 1 µg of pCMV-VSV-G were mixed with 500 µL of Opti-MEM and 40 µL of polyethylenimine and were incubated for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA complex was inoculated into HEK293T cells, and the culture medium was changed at 4 h posttransfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culture supernatants were collected at 3 d posttransfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the infection of lentivirus, 2 × 105 cells (2 mL) were seeded on six-well plates and were incubated for 1 d. The virus-containing culture supernatants (2 mL) and 8 µL of Polybrene (4 mg/mL; Sigma) were inoculated into cells and centrifuged at 1,220 × g for 45 min at 32 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable cell lines were selected by puromycin at 2 d postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
qRT-PCR for HCV RNA was performed using a TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit and a ViiA7 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primers were used: HCV, 5-GAGTGTCGTGCAGCCTCCA-3 and 5-CACTCGCAAGCACCCTATCA-3; GAPDH, 5-TGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAGGG-3 and 5-ACATCGCTCAGACACCATG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following probes were used: HCV, 5-6-FAM/CTGCGGAAC/ZEN/CGGTGAGTACAC/-3IABkFQ; GAPDH, 5-6-FAM/AAGGTCGGA/ZEN/GTCAACGGATTTGGTC/-3IABkFQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV RNA was determined by the Ct method using GAPDH as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HCV_Titration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded on 24-well plates (3 × 104 cells per well) and were incubated for 1 d. The culture supernatants serially diluted by medium were inoculated and incubated for 2 h. Then the culture supernatants were removed, 1% methylcellulose containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin was added, and the culture was further incubated for 2 d. The supernatants were removed, washed once with PBS, and then incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS three times and were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 containing PBS for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-NS5A antibody (1/2,000) diluted by 2% FBS/PBS at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated for 1 h with AF488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1/2,000) diluted by 2% FBS/PBS at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the cells were washed three final times with PBS, the viral proteins expressing foci were counted under an immunofluorescent microscope (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 135 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatants were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE (Novex gels; Invitrogen) and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membranes were then blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 135 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% skim milk, incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Pierce) and were detected by an LAS-3000 image analyzer system (Fujifilm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_IC99_in_the_Combination_of_SPP_Inhibitors_and_DAAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Huh7 cells were seeded on a 24-well plate (3 × 104 cells per well) and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then infected with HCV (JFH1 strain) at an MOI of 5 and were incubated for 2 h. The supernatants were replaced with fresh medium containing compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 d postinfection, the infectious titers in the culture supernatants were determined by using a focus-forming assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IC99 curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dosing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dosing of YO-01027 was performed as previously described (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, YO-01027 was formulated in 1-mM solutions containing 0.5% (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween-80 in H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CoreTg mice were dosed i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  once a day for 14 d with vehicle or with 5.0 µmol/kg YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BALB/c mice were dosed i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  once a day with vehicle or with 5.0 µmol/kg or 10 µmol/kg YO-01027 at 24 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Live_Imaging_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 8-wk-old BALB/c mice were i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infected with 1 × 102 parasites (RH strains) expressing luciferase in 100 mL PBS, and bioluminescence was assessed on the indicated days after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the detection of bioluminescence emission, mice were i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injected with 3 mg of d-luciferin (Promega) in 200 mL PBS, maintained for 5 min, and then anesthetized with isoflurane (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abdominal photon emission was assessed during a 3-s exposure by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS 100; Xenogen) and was analyzed as described previously (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hematoxylin_and_Oil_Red_O_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formalin-fixed livers were impregnated with 30% sucrose and frozen with Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten-micrometer-thick frozen sections were stained with hematoxylin (H&E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize lipids, frozen sections were stained with Oil Red O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frozen sections were washed with running tap water for 5 min, rinsed with 60% isopropanol for 1 min, and then stained with freshly prepared Oil Red O solution for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were then rinsed with 60% isopropanol, followed by light staining of the nuclei with HE for 15 s. The sections were observed under a microscope (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Homology_Modeling_and_Docking_Simulation_of_SPP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural information of a presenilin/SPP homolog (PSH) from Methanocellus marisnigri JR1 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)(PDB ID code: 4HYG.A; https://pdbj.org/mine/resources/4hyg) as a template to model SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jr1 SPP sequences were aligned by HHPred (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred), and a structural model of SPP was built using the program Spanner (https://sysimm.ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp/spanner/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poorly aligned and flexible regions of modeled SPP were selected manually and resampled by Spanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D information of YO-01027 was obtained from ZINC (https://zinc.docking.org/substance/22056928), and docking simulation of YO-01027 with SPP was conducted using the AutoDock Vina docking program (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural alignment of modeled SPP and presenilin-1 (PDB ID code: 5A63.B; https://pdbj.org/mine/summary/5a63) was conducted by the SALIGN server (https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/salign/) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrostatic potential was calculated using an Adaptive PoissonBoltzmann Solver (APBS) tool (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To render the structure images (and make mutants of SPP in silico), the open-source PyMOL Molecular Graphics System 1.8.4.0 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Viability_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Huh7 cells (2 × 104 cells in 50 µL of culture medium) were added to black 96-well plates (Corning) and then serially diluted compounds (50 µL) were added to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell viability was measured by using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parasite_Culture_and_Drug_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
P. falciparum strain 3D7 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 25 µg/mL l-glutamine, Hepes, NaHCO3, 50 µg/mL hypoxanthin, gentamicin, 10% human serum, and RBCs at 3% hematocrit in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 at 37 °C as previously described (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasites were synchronized to ring stage by three 5% sorbitol treatments (45) and then were treated with the indicated drugs for 48 h. Parasitemia and morphological changes were observed under a microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ME49 and RH strains of T. gondii were maintained in Vero cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Dibenzoazepine-Type_Structure_in_-Secretase_Inhibitors_Participates_in_the_Inhibitory_Activity_of_SPP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our prior study demonstrated that the cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP is essential for maturation of the core protein and that an immature core protein generated by the inhibition of SPP activity was degraded by proteasomes after ubiquitination by TRC8 (Fig 1A) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, to assess the inhibitory activity of -secretase inhibitors for SPP, we constructed a dicistronic lentiviral vector to express the FLAG-tagged core protein and GFP (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the -secretase inhibitors we examined, YO-01027 exhibited more potent suppression of the maturation of HCV core protein than LY-411575 or RO-0492907, as we reported previously (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, other compounds such as compound E, compound 34, LY-450139, DAPT, avagacestat, and MK-0752 showed no effect on the processing of HCV core protein (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore classified these -secretase inhibitors into two groups based on whether they inhibited SPP activity (Fig 2) and found that the -secretase inhibitors capable of inhibiting SPP activity have a conserved dibenzoazepine-type structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YO-01027 and compound E have the same structure except for dibenzoazepine, and YO-01027 but not compound E inhibited SPP activity, suggesting that dibenzoazepine-type -secretase inhibitors can inhibit SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YO-01027_Is_a_Potent_Inhibitor_of_the_Propagation_of_HCV_and_Protozoa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the toxicity of the -secretase inhibitors, we determined the viability of Huh7 cells treated with the inhibitors at a concentration of 3 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although treatment with LY-411575, YO-01027, and LY-450139 exhibited no significant cell toxicity, avagacestat showed cell toxicity at 4 d posttreatment (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to examine the effect of YO-01027 and LY-411575 on the replication of HCV, we treated GT2 and GT1 replicon cells with YO-01027 and LY-411575 for 3 d. Treatment with YO-01027 and LY-411575 exhibited no effect on the replication of HCV RNA (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the effects of the -secretase inhibitors on the production of infectious HCV particles, Huh7 cells infected with HCV were treated with various concentrations of the inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IC99 values were 230 nM for YO-01027 and 76.7  for LY-411575 (Fig 3A), suggesting that YO-01027 exhibited a more potent inhibitory effect on the production of infectious particles in the culture supernatants (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not see any effects by using LY-450139 and avagacestat (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined the effects of LY411575 and YO-01027 on the propagation of two chimeric HCVs, J6/JFH1 and Con1/JFH1, that possessed the structural proteins of GT2 and GT1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Huh7 cells infected with the chimeric viruses were incubated with LY-411575 or YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Propagation of both J6/JFH1 and Con1/JFH1 was significantly suppressed by the treatment with LY-411575 and YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, treatment with YO-01027 impaired the propagation of J6/JFH1 to an undetectable level (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the synergistic effects of SPP inhibitors and DAAs on the propagation of HCV, we first determined the IC99 values of telaprevir and daclatasvir on HCV propagation; these values were 114 nM and 5.28 nM, respectively (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Huh7 cells infected with HCV were treated with SPP inhibitors and DAAs, and the IC99 values against each combination were determined (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All IC99 values were plotted on an isobologram based on the Loewe combination index (46), and the combination of SPP inhibitors and DAAs was found to exhibit synergistic effects on the propagation of HCV (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that YO-01027 is a potent inhibitor of the production of infectious HCV particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previous study demonstrated that the SPP gene is encoded in protozoa such as P. falciparum and is likely to be essential for their survival (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the role of P. falciparum-encoded SPP (pfSPP) on the maturation of HCV core protein, we determined the expression of HCV core protein in SPP-knockout Huh7 (SPPKOHuh7) cells by assessing the expression of pfSPP (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of core protein in SPPKOHuh7 was restored by the exogenous expression of either hsSPP or pfSPP (Fig 3E), suggesting that pfSPP can compensate for the function of hsSPP in cleaving HCV core protein in SPPKOHuh7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to examine the effect of pfSPP on the propagation of HCV, we determined the intracellular viral RNA and infectious titers in the supernatants of SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing either hsSPP or pfSPP upon infection with HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV propagation in SPPKOHuh7 cells was restored by the expression of either pfSPP or hsSPP (Fig 3F and Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the maturation of core protein (Fig 3G) and HCV propagation (Fig 3H) were impaired in SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing pfSPP by treatment with YO-01027, suggesting that pfSPP was functionally similar to hsSPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For investigation of the effects of the -secretase inhibitors on the propagation of P. falciparum, synchronized P. falciparum was inoculated with hematocrit and -secretase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with YO-01027 exhibited 10-fold higher inhibition of the propagation of P. falciparum compared with treatment with LY-411575 (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, propagation of the ME49 strain of T. gondii, which possesses a luciferase reporter gene, was also significantly more inhibited by treatment with YO-01027 than by treatment with LY-411575 (Fig 3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with LY-411575 or YO-01027 at concentrations up to 30 µM exhibited no significant cell toxicity in SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing pfSPP (Fig S1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to examine the effect of host SPP on the propagation of the ME49 strain of T. gondii, we inoculated parental and SPP-knockout MEFs and Huh7 cells with the ME49 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagation of T. gondii was similar among the cell lines (Fig 3K), suggesting that a parasite but not the host SPP participates in the propagation of T. gondii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we examined the effect of YO-01027 on T. gondii in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BALB/c mice i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  infected with the RH strain possessing a luciferase reporter gene were treated with 5 mol/kg or 10 mol/kg of YO-01027 i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at 24 h postinfection, and the growth of parasites was determined using an IVIS imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth of parasites was significantly suppressed by treatment with YO-01027 (Fig 3L), and the survival times of infected mice were slightly extended by the YO-01027 treatment (Fig 3M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that YO-01027 is capable of inhibiting the propagation of HCV and protozoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

YO-01027_Ameliorates_Liver_Steatosis_in_CoreTg_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effect of YO-01027 on the liver pathogenesis in CoreTg mice, we administered YO-01027 to the mice for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mRNA expression of the HCV core protein in the livers of CoreTg mice and the body weights of the mice were not changed by the treatment with YO-01027 (Fig 4A), the expression of the core protein was significantly reduced by the treatment (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil Red O staining of the liver sections revealed that the lipid accumulation in the livers of the CoreTg mice was also ameliorated by 2-wk treatment with YO-01027 when the mice were 24 wk old (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The synthesis of liver fatty acids is tightly regulated by SREBP-1c, a family of steroid regulatory element-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, but not that of SREBP-1a or SREBP-2, was reduced in the livers of CoreTg mice by the YO-01027 treatment (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that treatment with YO-01027 ameliorates liver steatosis in CoreTg mice by suppressing the expression of HCV core protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SPP_Inhibitors_Are_Broad-Spectrum_Antivirals_Against_HCV_of_All_Genotypes_with_a_Low_Risk_of_the_Emergence_of_Drug-Resistant_Breakthrough_Viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to assess the effects of YO-01027 on the maturation of HCV core proteins derived from various genotypes of HCV, we constructed expression vectors for HCV core proteins derived from GT1 to GT7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment of Huh7 cells expressing these core proteins with YO-01027 efficiently suppressed the maturation of core proteins derived from all HCV genotypes (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a further examination of the emergence of drug-resistant viruses by treatment with the inhibitors, culture supernatants from Huh7.5.1 cells infected with HCV and treated with 1  of LY-411575, 0.1  of YO-01027, or 0.1 µM of telaprevir for 4 d were inoculated into naive Huh7.5.1 cells treated with same compounds (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After five rounds of passages, HCV in the culture supernatants exhibited resistance to the treatment with telaprevir (Fig 5C), but HCV was sensitive to the treatment with LY-411575 and YO-01027 even after 15 passages (Fig 5D), suggesting that the SPP inhibitors are broad-spectrum antivirals against all genotypes of HCV with a low risk of the emergence of drug-resistant breakthrough viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Val223_of_SPP_Interacts_with_the_Dibenzoazepine-Type_Structure_of_YO-01027  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the molecular interactions between SPP and -secretase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the crystal structure of a presenilin/SPP homolog (PSH) from M. marisnigri JR1 has been resolved (47), we constructed the 3D structure of human SPP in silico based on the structure of PSH (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymatic active site of SPP had been identified as Asp219 and Asp265 (20), and the structures of PSH and presenilin-1 show a cavity-like structure in an enzymatic active site and a large hole surrounded by TM2, TM3, TM5, and TM7 (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeled structure of SPP showed the same cavity-like structure and a large hole (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the interaction of SPP with -secretase inhibitors, we performed a docking simulation by using YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in silico simulation indicated that the dibenzoazepine structure of YO-01027 interacts with Val223, Phe192, or Ala259 of SPP (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the amino acid residue responsible for the interaction with YO-01027, we established SPPKOHuh7 cell lines stably expressing mutant SPP with Val223, Phe192, and Ala259 replaced by Ile, Trp, and Leu, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results showed that the expression of SPP was comparable in the wild type and mutants (Fig 7B) and that the SPP mutants retained the ability to process HCV core proteins (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mutant SPPs in which Phe192 was replaced by Trp and Ala259 was replaced by Leu were still sensitive to the YO-01027 treatment, the substitution of Ile for Val223 resulted in resistance to the YO-01027 treatment (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the SPP mutant in which Val223 was replaced by Ile also showed resistance to other dibenzoazepine-type -secretase inhibitors, i.e., LY-411575 and RO-0492907 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that YO-01027 interacts directly with enzymatic active sites (Asp219 and Asp265) of SPP and that the dibenzoazepine structure of YO-01027 interacts with Val223 of SPP (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phe258_in_SPP_Determines_the_Accessibility_of_the_-Secretase_Inhibitors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further elucidate the structureactivity relationship between -secretase inhibitors and SPP, we compared the docking simulation of YO-01027 to SPP with that to presenilin-1 (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on Phe258 of SPP because this amino acid is close to the dibenzoazepine structure in YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the 3D structure of presenilin-1 around SPP Phe258 has not yet been determined (Fig 8B), the amino acid residue corresponding to SPP Phe258 in presenilin-1 is Gly378 (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that the benzyl group of SPP Phe258 prevents compound E from interacting with SPP (Fig 8C), because the only difference between YO-01027 and compound E is the dibenzoazepine structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test our hypothesis, we constructed the in silico structure of a mutant SPP in which Phe258 was replaced with Gly, and we performed a docking simulation of both the wild-type SPP and mutant SPP with compound E. Although the wild-type SPP exhibited no interaction with compound E in our docking simulation, the Phe258Gly mutant of SPP interacted with compound E much as the wild-type SPP interacted with YO-01027 (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm our in silico data in vitro, we established SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing the Phe258Gly mutant of SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of SPP was comparable in the wild type and the Phe258Gly mutant (Fig S3A), and the SPP mutant still retained the ability to process HCV core proteins (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing the Phe258Gly mutant of SPP were treated with either compound E or YO-0127 upon the expression of HCV core protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment not only with YO-01027 but also with compound E resulted in significant inhibition of the core protein expression in SPPKOHuh7 cells expressing the SPP Phe258Gly mutant (Fig 8E), whereas other compounds such as semagacestat, avagacestat, compound 34, DAPT, and MK-0752 showed no effect on the processing of HCV core protein (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that SPP Phe258 determines the accessibility of the -secretase inhibitors to an active site of SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous research revealed that SPP plays crucial roles in the propagation of HCV and the development of core-induced pathogenesis and that SPP is therefore a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics against chronic hepatitis C (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SPP encoded in protozoa participates in their propagation (21), suggesting that SPP inhibitors would be applicable as not only antivirals but also as antiprotozoals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression of SPP by the -secretase inhibitors have been largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore in the present study we attempted to determine the interaction between the -secretase inhibitors and SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings showed that some -secretase inhibitors are capable of inhibiting SPP activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although YO-01027 shares the same structure as compound E, except for the dibenzoazepine structure, YO-01027 inhibited SPP in our experiments, but compound E did not, suggesting that the dibenzoazepine-type structure plays a crucial role in the inhibition of SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in silico docking simulation of hsSPP with YO-01027 suggested that three binding sites and the mutation of Val223 in SPP abolished the inhibitory activity of YO-01027, indicating that SPP Val223 interacts with the dibenzoazepine-type structure in YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results also showed that Phe258 is a spatial obstacle to the incorporation of compound E into SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the inhibitory activity of YO-01027 was still higher than that of compound E in the Phe258Gly mutant of SPP, we speculate that the interaction between SPP and the dibenzoazepine-type structure of YO-01027 might be responsible for the potent inhibitory activity of YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comparison of the amino acid sequences of members of the SPP family revealed that the amino acid residue Val223 in SPP is conserved not only in presenilin-1 but also in SPP-like 2A (SPPL2A), SPPL2B, and SPPL3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, dibenzoazepine-type -secretase inhibitors might be able to inhibit other SPP family enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Phe258 in SPP is conserved in SPPL3 but not in presenilin-1, SPPL2A, or SPPL2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, enhancing the interaction of a compound containing SPP Val223 and Phe258 might improve SPP-specific inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observed that compound E and compound 34 have a benzodiazepine structure, but compound 34 could not inhibit the activity of the Phe258Gly SPP mutant (Fig S3C), suggesting that structures other than the dibenzoazepine structure participate in determining specificity for SPP inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data could provide clues for the development of novel inhibitors that are specific for SPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although treatment with DAAs targeting viral proteins including NS3, NS5A, and NS5B have achieved a 90% SVR rate (5, 6), the emergence of viruses resistant to DAAs is an important issue that must be considered (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of host proteins that are crucial for efficient viral propagation is a suitable method of suppressing the emergence of drug-resistant breakthrough viruses (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV has various genotypes and a highly diverse amino acid sequence due to the low fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and thus it is difficult for antivirals targeting viral proteins to inhibit all genotypes of HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of SPP suppressed both the maturation of HCV core proteins derived from all the HCV genotypes examined and the propagation of HCV without the emergence of drug-resistant viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, combined treatment with SPP inhibitors and DAAs showed synergistic effects, suggesting that combination therapy with SPP inhibitors and DAAs might be an effective treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C, with a low frequency of emergence of drug-resistant viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HCV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, which contains four genera: Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Hepacivirus, and Pegivirus (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal signal sequences of the core proteins of Hepacivirus and Pestivirus are processed by SPP (53), and those of Flavivirus are cleaved by the viral protease NS3 (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cleavage of the signal sequence of the core protein is essential for the maturation of the core protein in viruses of the family Flaviviridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also explored the possibility of the application of SPP inhibitors in other infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some protozoa encode SPP in their genomes, and SPP has been suggested to play a crucial role in the life cycle of these protozoa (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we observed that SPP inhibitors suppressed the propagation of P. falciparum and T. gondii by inhibiting the SPP encoded in their genomes, not by the inhibiting SPP in the host cell genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LY-411575, NITD679, and NITD731 were previously shown to inhibit the activity of pfSPP (21), and all three of these compounds contain the dibenzoazepine structure, which is consistent with our data (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these results suggest that SPP is an ideal drug target for the development of novel therapeutics for chronic hepatitis C and protozoiasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the development of SPP-specific inhibitors is still required, because all the compounds used in this study were developed as -secretase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase III clinical trials of semagacestat (LY-450139) resulted in no improvement of Alzheimers disease and unfortunately enhanced tumorigenesis of skin and other cancers (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that LY-450139 had no inhibitory activity on SPP (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, specific inhibitors for SPP which exert no inhibitory effects on -secretase are needed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Toward this goal, further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the 3D structure of SPP and the structural interaction between SPP and YO-01027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
