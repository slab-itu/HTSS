Effectiveness of UNAIDS targets and HIV vaccination across 127 countries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite extraordinary advances in the treatment of HIV, the global pandemic has yet to be reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a mathematical model for 127 countries to evaluate Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) targets for expanding diagnosis and treatment of the infected, and partially efficacious HIV vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the current levels of diagnosis and treatment, we estimated 49 million new HIV cases globally from 2015 to 2035.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving the ambitious UNAIDS target is predicted to avert 25 million of these new infections, with an additional 6.3 million averted by the 2020 introduction of a 50%-efficacy vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides country-specific impacts of a partially effective HIV vaccine and demonstrates its importance to the elimination of HIV transmission globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HIV pandemic continues to impose enormous morbidity, mortality, and economic burdens across the globe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, innovations in antiretroviral therapy, diagnostic approaches, and vaccine development are providing novel tools for treatment-as-prevention and prophylaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the added benefit of an HIV vaccine in the context of goals to increase rates of diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression in 127 countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under status quo interventions, we predict a median of 49 million [first and third quartiles 44M, 58M] incident cases globally from 2015 to 2035.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS 959595 target was estimated to avert 25 million [20M, 33M] of these new infections, and an additional 6.3 million [4.8M, 8.7M] reduction was projected with the 2020 introduction of a 50%-efficacy vaccine gradually scaled up to 70% coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This added benefit of prevention through vaccination motivates imminent and ongoing clinical trials of viable candidates to realize the goal of HIV control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Projections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under status quo rates of diagnosis and treatment, our model projects a median of 49 million [first and third quartiles 44M, 58M] new infections globally (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our projections indicate that the 909090 target could avert 22 million [17M, 29M] of these infections, whereas the 959595 target could avert a further 3.3 million [2.8M, 3.8M] infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, vaccination alone is predicted to avert 17 million [15M, 23M] infections beyond status quo interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining vaccination with the 959595 target would avert 31 million [26M, 39M] infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Regional_Projections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Underlying these global averages, there is regional variability that arises from country-specific transmission rates and prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both vaccination and UNAIDS targets averted the most infections in Eastern and Southern Africa (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this region, vaccination with status quo interventions averted 7.7 million [6.8M, 8.9M] infections, whereas vaccination combined with the 959595 target averted 14.2 million [12.2M, 16.6M] infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same strategy combinations in North America, 216,000 [197,000, 240,000] and 391,000 [345,000, 444,000] infections were averted (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S8), respectively, although this region is only 19% less populous than Eastern and Southern Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UNAIDS targets based on antiviral treatment affect the number of PLHIV by prolonging survival (which increases PLHIV compared with status quo) and by reducing transmission (which decreases PLHIV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, vaccination averts new infections, reducing PLHIV without the concomitant improvement in survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transmission reduction achieved by vaccination is greater in African regions that have a high incidence, including Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, than in Asian countries with lower incidence, such as India (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Country-Level_Projections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viral suppression both increases the number of PLHIV by prolonging survival and reduces new PLHIV by lowering transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance between these factors, and thus the overall impact of UNAIDS targets on PLHIV varied (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4S140).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In countries with increasing per-capita incidence, such as South Africa and Swaziland, the UNAIDS targets reduced PLHIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the projected number of PLHIV in Swaziland under the 909090 target was 6% [-4%, 14%] lower, and under 959595 was 8% [-3%, 18%] lower compared with projections under status quo interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in countries where per-capita incidence is already declining, such as United States and India, the UNAIDS targets have a relatively greater benefit on improving survival than reducing transmission, thereby increasing PLHIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In India, for instance, the predicted number of PLHIV was 54% [48%, 59%] greater under 909090 and 60% [53%, 67%] greater under 959595 compared with status quo projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, vaccination universally reduces PLHIV (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4S140).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even when status quo diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression are not improved, vaccination was able to reverse the trend of increasing global incidence (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the rollout of a 50%-efficacy vaccine in 2020, with scale up at 25% coverage annually to a maximum of 70% coverage, was projected to reduce PLHIV by 36% [32%, 41%] and HIV-related mortality by 11% [9%, 13%].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining vaccination with the 959595 target reduced PLHIV by 22% [12%, 34%] and HIV-related mortality by 59% [57%, 62%], compared with projections under status quo interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synergy was predicted to be most substantial where UNAIDS targets are insufficient to reverse the epidemiological trajectory, such as in Rwanda.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, even in the United States, where the 959595 target reduced 2035 per-capita incidence by 55% [42%, 65%], the addition of a 50%-efficacy vaccine achieved a 76% [69%, 81%] reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uncertainty_Analysis_of_Vaccine_Characteristics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given uncertainty of the prospective vaccine profile, we simulated model projections across a range of possible scenarios (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initiating rollout in 2025 (compare 2020) reduced infections averted from 18.7 million to 11.3 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slower scale-up of 10% (compare 25%) annually averted a predicted 15.7 million infections, 3 million less than the base-case vaccination scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower coverage of 50% (compare 70%) averted 14.7 million infections, whereas a higher coverage of 90% averted 21.8 million infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering alternative efficacies, infections averted ranged from 12.3 million with a conservative 30% efficacy to 24.0 million with an optimistic 70% efficacy, compared with 18.7 million with the base case of 50% efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sensitivity_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sensitivity analysis regarding the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and treatment parameters showed that predictions of vaccination effectiveness were more sensitive to the transmission rate, acute progression rate, and transmissibility within and after the acute phase than to the reduction in transmissibility during viral suppression (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the effectiveness of UNAIDS goals were more sensitive to transmission rate, relative transmissibility during viral suppression, and acute progression rate than to transmissibility within and after the acute phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected effectiveness of both vaccination and UNAIDS goals were relatively insensitive to delay between ART initiation and viral suppression, annual number of coital acts, and improved survival due to viral suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating country-level and global intervention effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Rwanda, where viral suppression is estimated at 74% of PLHIV, the 959595 UNAIDS target would avert 19% [14%, 25%] of new infections, whereas vaccination alone would avert 33% [32%, 34%].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In South Africa, where rates of viral suppression are substantially lower at 34%, the UNAIDS 959595 target would avert 49% [41%, 55%] of new infections, whereas vaccination alone would avert 31% [31%, 32%].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, vaccination was projected to have 1.7 [1.4, 2.4] times the impact of the 959595 target in Rwanda and 0.6 [0.6, 0.8] times the impact in South Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, in Rwanda and other countries already achieving high levels of viral suppression, the benefit of further improving treatment is limited, whereas vaccination would be paramount for HIV elimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Country-specific PLHIV trends also have implications for estimating the future morbidity and economic burdens of HIV in different regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections of growing numbers of PLHIV underscore the urgency of expanding capacity to treat cardiovascular, cognitive, and liver complications associated with long-term ART use, particularly in resource-limited settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The feasibility of achieving these UNAIDS goals is challenged by interruptions across the HIV/AIDS treatment cascade (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, civil unrest in Afghanistan and Yemen, and draconian drug laws in Indonesia (28), have hampered diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, other countries, including Malaysia, the United States, and India, attain high diagnosis rates but struggle to engage people in treatment, because of inadequate infrastructure and coordinated health care or fear of stigma (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the UNAIDS targets may be more aspirational than practical (30), obstacles to vaccination will likewise include its accessibility to at-risk populations, in addition to the immunological challenges of developing an efficacious and durable vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the challenges inherent in treatment as prevention and in vaccination, a combined approach would be the most feasible and effective strategy to address the HIV pandemic in each of the 127 countries considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate model fitting to a variety of countries, for many of which only estimates of prevalence, incidence, as well as proportions diagnosed, treated, and with viral suppression were available, simplifying assumptions were made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not consider the vaccine waning exhibited by the RV144 candidate, the robust, but imperfect, vaccine-mediated immune protection that we modeled could correspond to a regime of boosters, as indeed has been expanded in the HVTN 100 candidate protocol (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vaccination and treatment-as-prevention approaches considered here would be complementary to other HIV prevention modalities, such as adult medical male circumcision (31), preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) and antibody-mediated protection (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of these interventions is likely to have synergistic effects on mitigating HIV transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings and modeling approaches may have conceptual applicability beyond HIV by showing the added benefits of partially protective vaccines for other diseases when implemented in conjunction with drug therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, rather than expecting vaccines with perfect efficacy to replace existing drug therapies, a multifaceted strategy that includes partially protective vaccines may nonetheless be necessary to achieve elimination, as we demonstrated for HIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While we explicitly model the clinical stages of acute, chronic without viral suppression, chronic with viral suppression, and AIDS, we did not incorporate explicit CD4 strata, both because population-level data on CD4 counts are not available for most countries and because CD4 levels are no longer pertinent as thresholds for treatment decisions (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, given the lack of estimates for most countries assessed regarding high-risk groups, such as sex workers, people who share needles, men who have sex with men, and prisoners, we did not incorporate risk-group strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our fitting of transmission rates to each country will subsume transmission within these risk groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting interventions to high-risk groups would likely achieve greater effectiveness for a lower overall population coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the effectiveness of the measures considered here would be conservative, particularly for vaccination, relative to campaigns that integrated risk-group targeting of intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the simplifications, our projections of new infections, PLHIV, and HIV-related deaths are consistent with other studies (2224, 36, 37) of the 909090 targets and vaccination based on more complex models with CD4, age, and risk strata for selected countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, model complexity limits the broad applicability of a model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, previous studies did not evaluate interventions in 103 of the 127 countries that we considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent results from the HTVN 100 vaccine trial have bolstered optimism for the development and deployment of an HIV vaccine in the near term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV vaccination would enable a strategic shift from reactive to proactive control, as suggested by our finding that an HIV vaccine with even moderate efficacy rolled out in 2020 could avert 17 million [15M, 23M] new infections by 2035 relative to expectations under status quo interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While overarching targets proposed by UNAIDS encourage global efforts to meet shared goals, it will become increasingly important to tailor control strategies at the country level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many countries, including the United States, Uganda, and Nigeria, the UNAIDS goals, as ambitious as they are, would be insufficient to reverse the growth of PLHIV without at least a partially efficacious vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in countries for which UNAIDS goals are sufficient to turn the tide on the HIV epidemic, such as India, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, vaccination would greatly accelerate elimination, saving millions of lives annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a model of HIV transmission and progression that stratifies HIV infection into acute, chronic undiagnosed, chronic diagnosed, chronic treated, chronic virally suppressed, and AIDS (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral suppression (defined as plasma HIV RNA below 1,000 copies per mL) not only extends survival but also reduces transmission, both aspects of which were incorporated into our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Country-specific transmission rates were fitted to estimates of the historical trajectories of incidence and prevalence, spanning from as early as 1990 for some countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations of our model project the number of people in each HIV stratum from 2015 to 2035, from which statistics such as prevalence and incidence were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For every scenario of intervention combinations, we conducted 1,000 model simulations, sampling values of model parameters from empirical distributions for each simulation, and summarized the results with median and percentiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix, SI Methods and Datasets S1S5 for a more detailed description of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
