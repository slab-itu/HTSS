Climate vulnerability and resilience in the most valuable North American fishery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate change is impacting global fisheries and societies that depend on them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying climate adaptation measures requires understanding how environmental changes and management policies interact in driving fishery productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincident with the recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that interactions between warming waters, ecosystem changes, and differences in conservation efforts led to the simultaneous collapse of lobster fishery in southern New England and record-breaking landings in the Gulf of Maine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that sound, widely adopted fishery conservation measures based on fundamental biological principles can help capitalize on gains and mitigate losses caused by global climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Managing natural resources in an era of increasing climate impacts requires accounting for the synergistic effects of climate, ecosystem changes, and harvesting on resource productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock's reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trends in SST anomalies (blue lines) from 1984 to 2014 and landings (orange lines) of American lobster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) GoM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) SNE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When forced with observed monthly landings and water temperatures, the model captures the past dynamics of both the GoM (r2 = 0.75) and SNE lobster stocks (r2 = 0.81, Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model-estimated mean abundance increased by 515% from 1985 to 2014 for the GoM stock, and decreased by 78% from 1997 to 2014 for the SNE stock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when temperatures were fixed at the 19841999 average, variations in abundances were much smaller for both stocks (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that recent rapid warming in the northwest Atlantic has played an integral role in driving the boom in the American lobster fishery in the GoM and its collapse in the warmer SNE region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temperature effects on recruitment (number of 1-y-old lobsters) was the primary factor driving population abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased individual growth rate and reduced size at maturity (22) led to an increase in egg production in the GoM stock, but to a modest increase in recruitment (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the production of 1-y-old lobsters per egg was greatly enhanced by the northeastward shift of the estimated 16.4 °C optimal summer temperature (Fig 3), boosting GoM stock abundance in recent years, and explaining the northeast shift in lobster distribution (23) and the current record high landings in Atlantic Canada (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, summer inshore temperatures in the south increasingly exceeded the thermal optimum for lobster recruitment (Fig 3), resulting in recruitment failure in the SNE stock (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differences in predation pressure and prevalence of shell disease also contributed to the disparate population trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing of large predators, including Atlantic cod, reduced predation mortality on lobsters, precipitating the rise of lobster abundance in the GoM (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated that, without the removal of large predators, lobster abundance in the GoM would have increased by 434% instead of 515% since 1985.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SNE, the more diverse communities of small predators maintained an elevated predation mortality on smaller lobsters, canceling out the reduction of predation mortality caused by the removal of larger predators (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the outbreak of shell disease in 1998 increased the natural mortality in SNE, contributing to the stock collapse in the region (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preserving larger, more fecund females is an ongoing issue in fisheries management, and differences in the level of protection afforded to large lobsters in the two regions amplified the effects of ecosystem changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1917, lobster harvesters in Maine began a V-notching program to preserve reproductive females, and V-notching of all egg-bearing females has since been mandatory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1930s, harvesters and legislators in Maine collectively decided to impose a maximum size limit of 128 mm carapace length (CL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in SNE, a maximum size limit varying from 133 mm to 171 mm CL among areas was imposed only in 2008, and the practice of V-notching is voluntary and less common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the role of these conservation measures on past stock dynamics by applying the management measures from one stock to the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model simulations revealed that, without conservation measures to protect large lobsters and reproductive females, lobster abundance in the GoM would have increased by 242% instead of 515% (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if more restrictive conservation measures had been implemented earlier in SNE, the stock abundance would have decreased by only 57% instead of 78% (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, because of their higher fecundity, preserving large females can dampen the negative effects and amplify the benefits of warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the model to project trends in American lobster fisheries out to 2050 using temperature conditions from the ensemble of climate projections of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using constant exploitation rates equal to the average of the last 5 y, model projections indicate that the GoM lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warmest temperature scenario that we explored (0.05 °Cy1) gives the largest and steepest decline in abundance (62% relative to 2014; Fig 4A), while the coolest scenario (0.03 °Cy1) shows a more gradual decline (40% relative to 2014; Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected decline in abundance is caused by temperature-induced decreases in recruitment and increases in predation mortality on small lobsters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model projections also showed that maintaining measures to preserve large reproductive females can mitigate negative impacts of warming on the GoM lobster fishery in future decades (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an outbreak of shell disease would amplify the temperature-induced decreases in abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model projections for the southern stock showed that no recovery to the abundance levels observed in the mid-1990s can be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight recovery to the mid-1980s levels is possible if temperature follows the coolest scenario (Fig 4C) or if shell disease were to disappear (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model assumptions and limitations in climate forecasts call for caution when interpreting projections of absolute abundances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the relatively coarse resolution of climate models limits the ability to predict the frequency and strength of processes affecting recruitment, such as marine heat waves, storms, and variation in coastal currents (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent high-resolution climate projections show that the northwest Atlantic should warm at 3 times the global average rate (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the warmest scenario used in this study may be more realistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we assumed that current stock boundaries reflect actual population units with independent demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption was necessary given the limited understanding of American lobster population structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous studies have suggested connectivity between management units, including the potential for upstream regions on the Canadian shelf to contribute larvae to the GoM region (26), recruitment mostly originates from local sources within the stock area (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, our model does not consider the potential for rapid evolutionary adaptation (28), which could help the species counter stressful temperature conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our model assumes that temperature is the sole climatic driver of population changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other stressors of climate change, such as acidification and deoxygenation, are affecting marine ecosystems (29) and may impact lobster productivity in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is a growing appreciation for how protecting large individuals can increase population resilience to elevated exploitation rates (30) and reduce fluctuations caused by climate variability (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The northern cod population in Atlantic Canada experienced truncation of its age structure by selective fishing (32), which impeded its resilience to several years of combined high exploitation rates and poor environmental conditions and precipitated its collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the disproportionate removal of larger individuals of five fish species in the Barents Sea increased populations sensitivity to environmental fluctuations, because population growth rates became more dependent on recruitment than on adult survival (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, the lack of conservation measures to preserve large lobsters in SNE, combined with higher mortality rates caused by an outbreak of epizootic shell disease, precipitated the recruitment failure caused by rapid warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the maintenance of a high egg production in the GoM prepared the fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions (i.e., lower predation mortality and optimal temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that sound harvest strategies based on fundamental biological principles can dampen negative and reinforce positive effects of ecosystem changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of current harvest strategies in Maine was facilitated by the flexibility of Maines Lobster Management Zone Law, and by the ability of industry leaders to influence legislation (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The informal establishment of territorial use rights promoted a strong conservation ethos in the industry, encouraging the adoption of sustainable harvest strategies to the detriment of immediate economic returns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case study of the American lobster confirms that a strong sense of resource stewardship and flexible governance facilitate the adoption of effective conservation measures and confer resilience in fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the fishing community level, continued reliance on one successful fishery may present a risk (20), especially given that rates of ecosystem changes can outpace reactive management decision processes (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coastal communities should adopt anticipatory adaptation measures, such as diversifying their portfolios of economic opportunities (36), to build resilience against the multiple impacts of climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population_Dynamics_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamics of lobster populations from the GoM and SNE were reconstructed using a temperature-dependent size-based model (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of lobsters at size was simulated using a cohort equation,Ns,x,y,t+1=Ns,x,y,teMs,x,y/12+Rs,x,y,tCs,x,y,t,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Ns,x,y,t is the number of lobsters of stock s in size bin x (43 size bins from 13 mm to 223 mm CL) in year y and month t, Cs,x,y,t is the number of lobsters landed, Ms,x,y is the instantaneous rate of natural mortality, and Rs,x,y,t is the number of recruits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual growth was modeled using a temperature-dependent von Bertalanffy growth function (see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The instantaneous rate of natural mortality was modeled with three components: a predation mortality (Mp), a background mortality (Mo), and a disease mortality (Md).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disease mortality was imposed only for SNE starting in 1998 following the outbreak of the epizootic shell disease that occurred in the region (11, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the limited information of the effect of shell disease, we set Md=0.1 for all size classes (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background mortality ensured that nonpredated large lobsters experienced mortality and was assumed to be a function of asymptotic mass (37), Mos,y=ms,y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predation mortality built upon previous work on community size spectrum (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predation mortality for a lobster of mass m was assumed to be proportional to the density of predators Np(mp,s,y) in mass bin mp, for stock s and year y, to the probability of being ingested during an encounter with a predator (mp,m), and to the volume search by an individual predator V(mp),Mp(m,s,y)=mpminmpmaxNp(mp,s,y)(mp,m)V(mp)dmp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The volume search by a predator was assumed to be an allometric function of mass (40) V(mp)=mp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of ingestion was modeled using a function similar to a log-normal density function (41),(mp,m)=exp(ln(m/mp22)),[3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where  is the preferred predatorprey size ratio, and  is the width of the function (Table S1); (mp,m) takes a value of 1 at .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the density of predators was modeled with a linear size spectrum,log(Np(mp,r,y))=(r,y)+log(mp)*(r,y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The size spectrum of lobster predators was compiled based on abundance data from scientific bottom-trawl surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters  and  were region-specific and varied annually due to the effects of temperature and fishing on the size spectrum (see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following evidence of cannibalism in the species (42), we used a Ricker model to estimate recruit numbers from total egg production (TEP) (see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended the Ricker model with a quadratic temperature term to consider thermal optimum for lobster settlement (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was fitted to both the GoM and SNE stock combined using a mixed-effects model, allowing for stock specific productivities but a common temperature effect,Rs,y=sTEPs,y1sTEPs,y1eSSTyeSSTy2s,y,[5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Rs,y is the number of recruits for stock s at year y, SSTy is the summer inshore sea surface temperature (SST) from the year of settlement, s and s are random effect coefficients specific to each stock,  and  are fixed effect coefficients common to both stocks, and s,y is a log-normal error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recruitment occurred in July (66%) and October (34%), and recruits were distributed to the first three size classes with the following proportions: 0.658, 0.334, and 0.008 (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stock recruitment (SR) function assumed that the two stocks correspond to closed populations: No dispersal of eggs or exchange of recruits occurs between the two populations and with other lobster populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the models capacity to reconstruct past dynamics for the GoM and SNE lobster stocks by comparing our abundance estimates with abundance estimates from the last stock assessment report (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model uncertainty was quantified by a bootstrap of the residuals of the predator size spectrum, maturity, and SR functions (1,000 iterations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also considered the uncertainty arising from averaging temperature data and projections across the spatial domains by sampling temperature from a normal distribution of mean and SD estimated using all of the temperature cells that composed each spatial domain (see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using different hindcast simulation scenarios, we evaluated the role of five factors that may have contributed to the simultaneous collapse of the lobster fishery in SNE and record landings in the GoM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline simulation used observed temperatures and actual harvest strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature simulation used constant temperatures equal to the mean of the first half of the time series (19841999) to evaluate the role of the recent rapid warming in the northeast United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The harvest strategies simulation evaluated the role of the difference in harvest strategies by swapping management strategies between the two regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V-notching and a maximum size limit of 128 mm CL were imposed in SNE starting in 1996, while no V-notching and a maximum size limit of 140 mm CL were imposed in the GoM throughout the time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the growth and maturity simulation, growth rate and size at maturity were set constant and equal to values observed in 1984.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the predation simulation, we removed temporal trends in the lobster predator size spectrum to evaluate the role of the fishing of predators in lobster abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the shell disease simulation, we removed the natural mortality effects caused by shell disease in SNE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lastly, we performed five model projections out to 2050 to evaluate future impacts of warming, changes in harvest strategies, and shell disease prevalence on population abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first three projections used the mean, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of the ensemble of climate projections of CMIP5 (see SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections from only RCP 8.5 were used to limit the number of simulations, and because projections of the radiative forcing are similar across the RCPs out to 2050 (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploitation rates were set constant and equal to the average of the last 5 y (20102014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The harvest strategies observed in 2014 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the fourth simulation, we switched harvest strategies between the two stocks, similar to the hindcast harvest strategies simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V-notching was applied to SNE instead of GoM, and maximum fishing sizes of 140 mm CL and of 128 mm CL were applied to the GoM and SNE stocks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the fifth simulation, we removed the shell disease mortality from the SNE stock and applied it to the GoM stock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth and fifth simulations used the mean of the ensemble of climate projections and the 20102014 average exploitation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the five model projections, predator density was modeled as a function of projected temperature and fishing pressure using the same linear size spectrum function as in the model hindcast (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
