Entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system for rotaviruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rotaviruses (RVs) are a group of viruses that cause severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, no strategy has been developed to generate infectious RVs entirely from cloned cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a reliable reverse genetics platform has been a major roadblock in the RV field, precluding numerous studies of RV replication and pathogenesis and hampering efforts to develop the next generation of RV vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we developed a plasmid-based reverse genetics system that is free from helper viruses and independent of any selection for RV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology will accelerate studies of RV pathobiology, allow rational design of RV vaccines, and yield RVs suitable for screening small molecules as potential antivirals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rotaviruses (RVs) are highly important pathogens that cause severe diarrhea among infants and young children worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RV replication and pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of an entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we describe the recovery of recombinant RVs entirely from cloned cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy requires coexpression of a small transmembrane protein that accelerates cell-to-cell fusion and vaccinia virus capping enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this system to obtain insights into the process by which RV nonstructural protein NSP1 subverts host innate immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By insertion into the NSP1 gene segment, we recovered recombinant viruses that encode split-green fluorescent proteintagged NSP1 and NanoLuc luciferase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology will provide opportunities for studying RV biology and foster development of RV vaccines and therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Development_of_a_Reverse_Genetics_System_for_RV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the efforts to develop improved reverse genetics systems for Reoviridae viruses, we discovered two important modifications that significantly increase nonfusogenic MRV and RV replication and enhance recombinant virus recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fusogenic orthoreovirus FAST proteins are the smallest known nonenveloped viral fusogenic proteins (15) and promote viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, we speculated that FAST proteins could accelerate replication of other Reoviridae viruses, including MRV and RV, which do not encode a FAST homolog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, yields of MRV and RV were significantly increased (by 15-fold and 40-fold, respectively) in infected cells transfected with a FAST expression plasmid relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether FAST expression increases the efficiency of the MRV rescue system, we cotransfected BHK-T7 cells with the rescue vector set of the reverse genetics system for MRV strain T1L (9) and a FAST expression plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coexpression of FAST protein (0.005 µg) resulted in an 600-fold increased viral yield compared with that in cells transfected with the MRV rescue vector set alone (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no infectious virus was synthesized in the presence of the highest concentration of FAST protein (0.05 µg) (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRV and RV mRNAs are capped at their 5 ends, but their 3 ends are not polyadenylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a VV-based reverse genetics system for Reoviridae viruses (2, 9, 1113), T7pol transcripts are efficiently capped in the cytoplasm by the VV capping enzyme, which consists of two subunits, D1R and D12L (1719), thereby increasing translation efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, primary transcripts synthesized from rescue plasmids in the cytoplasm of cells stably expressing T7pol are presumably not capped and thus poorly translated, suggesting that viral recovery might benefit from the VV capping enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coexpression of the VV capping enzyme allowed more efficient virus recovery (125-fold) relative to the original MRV rescue system (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional 1,150-fold increase in yield was achieved by coexpression of FAST and the VV capping enzyme along with the MRV rescue plasmids (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the reverse genetics systems for MRV using FAST and the VV capping enzyme greatly improved rescue efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on these improved systems for MRV, we sought to develop a plasmid-based system for RV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, cDNAs representing each of the 11 RV dsRNA gene segments from strain SA11 were introduced into plasmids at sites flanked by the T7 promoter sequence and the antigenomic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription using T7pol and self-cleavage by the HDV ribozyme generated RNA transcripts corresponding to viral positive-sense RNAs containing the authentic viral 5 and 3 ends, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BHK-T7 cells were cotransfected with 11 plasmids, each corresponding to a single RV gene segment, along with expression plasmids encoding FAST and VV capping enzyme (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 35 d of incubation, transfected cells were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing and lysates were passaged in MA104 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few days after the first passage, a significant cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in MA104 cells, suggesting recovery of recombinant strain (rs) SA11 derived from cloned cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, we did not recover any recombinant virus following several passages from cells transfected with the 11 RV cDNA rescue vectors in the absence of FAST protein and VV capping enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility of contamination with parental virus, a unique MluI site was engineered (as a genetic marker) into the NSP4 gene segment of rsSA11 derived from cloned cDNAs (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also engineered BamHI, EcoRV, and EcoRI sites into the NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 gene segments, respectively, of another recombinant SA11 (rsSA11-3) generated by reverse genetics (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplified NSP gene fragments derived from rsSA11 and rsSA11-3 were cleaved by the corresponding restriction enzymes, whereas the RT-PCR products from the parental virus were resistant to digestion (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the expected mutations were present as genetic markers in the targeted gene segments (Fig S2A), confirming that rsSA11 and rsSA11-3 originated from cloned cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electropherotypes of rsSA11 and rsSA11-3 were indistinguishable from that of parental SA11 (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication kinetics and peak titers for these viruses were virtually identical (Fig 1D), demonstrating similar replication characteristics of native and recombinant viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reassortment is the process by which segmented RNA viruses exchange gene segments during coinfection of a single host cell with different strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the newly developed reverse genetics system, we recovered a monoreassortant virus, rsSA11/KUVP6, containing the human strain KU VP6 gene segment in an otherwise simian strain SA11 genetic background (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrophoretic pattern of rsSA11/KUVP6 revealed comigration of the VP6 RNA with that of strain KU (Fig 2B), and the monoreassortant virus exhibited replication kinetics similar to those of native SA11 (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery of monoreassortant viruses demonstrated the utility of the reverse genetics system for rescue of reassortant viruses with unique genetic combinations that had not been reported previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_C-Terminal_Region_of_NSP1_Is_Essential_for_Targeting_of_Interferon_Regulatory_Factor_3_and_Evasion_of_Innate_Immune_Surveillance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RV NSP1 antagonizes interferon (IFN) signaling by promoting degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of the C-terminal region of NSP1, including the pLxIS motif, for interaction with IRF3, followed by degradation, was demonstrated using recombinant NSP1 proteins and spontaneous mutants encoding C-terminal truncations in duplicate sequences of NSP1 (2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the C-terminal region of NSP1 is essential for inhibiting IFN signaling by antagonizing the function of IRF3, we engineered isogenic rsSA11-dC103, which differs from wild-type rsSA11 only by harboring a C-terminal 103-residue truncation of NSP1 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes of recombinant viruses were confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of viral dsRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The truncated NSP1 gene segment was smaller than the wild-type NSP1 gene segment (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of NSP1 in cells infected with rsSA11 or rsSA11-dC103 was confirmed by immunoblotting with NSP1-specific antiserum (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the truncated NSP1 mutant and wild-type viruses revealed that replication of rsSA11-dC103 was hampered in simian and human cell lines (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed significant degradation of IRF3 in HT29 cells infected with rsSA11 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, rsSA11-dC103 did not induce IRF3 degradation (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase assays revealed that the IFN- promoter element was activated in cells infected with rsSA11-dC103, but not in cells infected with rsSA11 (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we assessed the replication of rsSA11 and rsSA11-dC103 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which is required for the nuclear translocation of IRF3 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication of rsSA11-dC103 was significantly greater in TBK1-deficient (TBK1/) MEFs than in TBK1+/ MEFs, even though the titers of rsSA11-dC103 were lower than those of rsSA11 in TBK/ cells (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that the C-terminal region of NSP1 is required to antagonize the innate immune response by inducing the degradation of IRF3, a transcription factor required for IFN expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Development_of_RV_Efficient_Gene_Transduction_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether RVs capable of expressing an exogenous small fragment could be generated from cloned cDNAs, we exploited the split-green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) system for labeling NSP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The split-GFP system is based on the autoassembly capacity of two GFP components, the GFP110 detector fragment and GFP11 tag fragment, to restore a fully fluorescent signal (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduced the small GFP11 fragment (16 residues) at the C-terminal end of the NSP1 ORF (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electropherotype analysis of rescued rsSA11-GFP11 virus expressing NSP1 as a GFP11-tagged fusion protein revealed the predicted migration of the NSP1 gene segment relative to that of rsSA11 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rsSA11-GFP11 exhibited replication kinetics similar to those of rsSA11 in MA104 cells (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the GFP tag is functional, BSR cells were transfected with the GFP110 expression plasmid and infected with rsSA11-GFP11 or rsSA11 viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A GFP signal was observed in rsSA11-GFP11infected cells expressing GFP110, but not in mock-transfected cells or rsSA11-infected cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that efficient complementation of NSP1-GFP11 with GFP110 occurred to generate a specific GFP signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSP1-GFP11 protein exhibited a diffuse distribution pattern and localized at the perinuclear region of virus-infected cells, whereas NSP5 was detected in viroplasms (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with those of previous studies (2527) and indicate that the distribution of rsSA11-GFP11 NSP1 is the same as that of native NSP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RV mutants harboring significant sequence variation in NSP1 replicate efficiently in cell lines (28, 29), and RNA interference targeting of gene 5 to inhibit NSP1 mRNA expression has confirmed the nonessential role of this protein in viral replication (30), suggesting that the NSP1 gene segment can tolerate large insertions without a significant effect on viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate a recombinant RV expressing a reporter gene, we incorporated the gene encoding NanoLuc luciferase (NLuc) into the NSP1 gene segment of rsSA11 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrophoretic pattern of the NSP1-NLuc gene from rsSA11-NLuc revealed that it migrated slower than the corresponding NSP1 gene from rsSA11 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the plaques formed by rsSA11-NLuc on CV-1 monolayer cells were smaller than those of rsSA11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells infected with rsSA11-NLuc were positive for bioluminescent signals (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rsSA11-NLuc replicated efficiently in MA104 cells (over 106 pfu/mL at 48 h postinfection), although its replication kinetics were slightly impaired compared with rsSA11 (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activities of NLuc in cell lysates infected with rsSA11-NLuc could be detected as early as 12 h postinfection and increased over time (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrated the utility of rsSA11-NLuc for antiviral screening using a known RV inhibitor, ribavirin (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CV-1 cells infected with rsSA11 or rsSA11-NLuc were cultured with ribavirin at increasing concentrations; the cells did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity in the range of concentrations used in the experiment (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong bioluminescence signals were observed in cells infected with rsSA11-NLuc at low concentrations (010 µM) of ribavirin and decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, viral titers in infected cell lysates also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition (Fig S5B), supporting the validity of screening with rsSA11-NLuc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic stability of rsSA11-NLuc to express NLuc was unchanged through five passages (Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that replication-competent RVs encoding a reporter gene can be recovered by plasmid rescue and used for antiviral screening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We succeeded in developing an entirely plasmid-based RV reverse genetics system in which FAST protein and capping enzyme were coexpressed along with rescue plasmids in BHK-T7 cells (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism underlying the remarkable effects of FAST protein, which induce cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation in nonfusogenic RV and MRV replication in infected and transfected cells, remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous studies (15, 16, 32) suggest that the cell fusion activity of FAST proteins accelerates cell-to-cell transmission of virus infection and ensures rapid release of progeny virions from apoptotic syncytia, thereby promoting systematic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAST proteins also may increase cotransfection efficiency, resulting in increased virus production in reverse genetic systems via fusion of transfected cells with neighboring cells, leading to formation of syncytia carrying all 14 transfected plasmids (11 RV cDNA plasmids and expression plasmids encoding FAST and VV capping enzyme).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The currently available reverse genetics systems for RVs are based on vaccinia-driven T7pol expression (1113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible to rescue Reoviridae viruses that have capped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA using VV expressing T7pol, VV infection has negative effects on RV replication and rescue efficiency in reverse genetics systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the improved FAST- and VV capping enzyme-based reverse genetics system free of any helper virus for RV and MRV described herein is applicable to the recovery of any member of the Reoviridae family, particularly attenuated recombinant viruses that replicate poorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two licensed RV vaccines, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline) and RotaTeq (Merck), are currently available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotarix is based on a single human strain, and RotaTeq is a combination of five bovine × human strain monoreassortants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a new RV vaccine, Rotavac (Bharat Biotech International), was licensed in India in 2014 (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these vaccines are effective against RV-associated severe gastroenteritis, concerns about their efficacy, safety, and cost have inspired the development of new vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated a recombinant RV containing silent mutations in three gene segments (NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3) and a monoreassortant virus harboring the human RV strain KU VP6 gene on the strain SA11 genetic background (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in contrast to earlier helper virus-based reverse genetics systems, the RV rescue system described here can be easily used for rapid generation of infectious RVs containing multiple mutations in several different gene segments simultaneously, as well as reassortants with any desired gene segment combination and features that could serve as vaccine candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We confirmed that the C-terminal 103 residues of NSP1 are required to inhibit IFN signaling by inducing proteasome-dependent degradation of IRFs (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to previous studies, NSP1 also inhibits NF-B activation by inducing degradation of -TrCP and down-regulating p53, which induces apoptosis and transactivates several genes involved in antiviral responses (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, NSP1 interacts with the p85 subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated antiapoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these observations indicate that NSP1 can interfere with multiple antiviral pathways, including IFN and apoptosis signaling, to promote efficient viral replication and infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSP1 mutants, including a C-terminal truncation incapable of blocking IFN signaling and apoptosis pathways, may be attractive candidates for the development of new attenuated RV vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the reverse genetics system to modify the NSP1 gene segment to engineer RVs expressing reporter genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recombinant RV harboring the split-GFP system was generated by inserting a small GFP11 tag into the C terminus of the NSP1 ORF (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the split-GFPbased recombinant NSP1 mutants will be useful tools for understanding NSP1 trafficking and interactions with host proteins, including IFN signaling components, in infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a similar approach using the split-GFP system could be used to study other RV proteins in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also applied the reverse genetics system to generate a replication-competent recombinant RV expressing the NLuc gene fused to the N-terminal 27 residues of NSP1 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results confirm that NSP1 is not required for viral replication, a finding consistent with a previous study that used siRNA gene silencing (30), and that the NSP1 gene segment is suitable for insertion of a heterologous sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attenuated replication kinetics of rsSA11-NLuc could be explained by the defect in the IFN suppressor activity of NSP1, or by the influence of reduced packaging efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the replication and luciferase activity of rsSA11-NLuc were inhibited by ribavirin, a known anti-RV inhibitor, suggesting that the reporter virus would be a useful tool for high-throughput screening for antiviral therapeutics (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the replication-competent RV carrying the NLuc gene makes it possible to track RV infection in vivo and develop an oral RV vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we developed a plasmid-onlybased reverse genetics system for RV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique opens new horizons for the study of RV replication and pathogenesis, as well as for the development of antiviral drugs and new vaccines that protect against this important gastrointestinal pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Viral dsRNAs were extracted from purified SA11 virions using Sepazol RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral genomic cDNAs including intact 5 and 3 termini were amplified from viral dsRNA by full-length amplification of cDNA as previously described (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, a self-priming oligo DNA linker, C9 anchor primer, was attached to the 3 ends of viral dsRNAs using T4 RNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and adaptor-ligated RV dsRNAs were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified viral cDNAs were synthesized using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length viral cDNAs were amplified with a single primer complementary to the C9 anchor primer using KOD-Plus-Neo polymerase (Toyobo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplified viral cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript KS (+) and subjected to sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycle sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye terminator (Applied Biosystems), and viral sequences were determined on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete genome sequences of strain SA11 have been deposited in the GenBank database and assigned accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC178564LC178574.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To generate antiserum against SA11 NSP1, rabbits were immunized with mixed synthetic peptides (corresponding to 234-VIFNTYTKTPGRSIYRN-250 and 216-LPSSKLKQIYFSDFTKE-232 of SA11 NSP1) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Medical and Biological Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiserum against SA11 NSP5 was generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant NSP5 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct the NSP5 expression vector, the NSP5 coding region was amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers containing BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant PCR product was digested with both enzymes and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGEX6P-3 vector (GE Healthcare) to yield pGEX/NSP5 encoding NSP5-GST (GST) fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Escherichia coli XL-1 blue cells were transformed with pGEX/NSP5 and incubated with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSP5-GST fusion protein was purified using Sepharose 4B column chromatography (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbits were immunized with purified GST-NSP5 by standard procedures (Medical and Biological Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MA104 cells were infected with wild-type rsSA11 or rsSA11-dC103 at an MOI of 0.1 pfu per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were lysed, and proteins were size fractionated by SDS/PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral proteins were detected using 1:2,000 dilution of anti-NSP1 antiserum and 1:2,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect IRF3 and viral proteins, infected HT29 cells were harvested 6 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were detected using Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) and LAS-3000 (Fujifilm) following incubation with anti-IRF3 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or antibody specific for NSP5 and the appropriate secondary antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IFN-_Promoter_Reporter_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 293T cells were cotransfected with pIFN-Luc, which expresses firefly luciferase under the control of the IFN- promoter (47), and pRL-SV40 (Promega), which expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter (as an internal control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve hours after transfection, cells were infected with recombinant viruses at an MOI of 10 pfu per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 h, luciferase activities were detected using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) and Luminometer AB-2200 (Atto).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Indirect_Immunofluorescence_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BSR cells transfected with pCAG-GFP110 were infected with rsSA11 or rsSA11-GFP11 at an MOI of 0.1 pfu per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixteen hours after infection, cells were fixed with 10% (vol/vol) formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and viral proteins were stained with anti-NSP5 antiserum, followed by CF 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Nacalai Tesque).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to label nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed on a FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MA104 cells were infected with rsSA11 or rsSA11-NLuc at an MOI of 0.01 pfu per cell and incubated with 0.5 µg/mL trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 03 d of incubation, NLuc activity in cell lysates was quantified using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay system (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase signals of plaques formed by rsSA11-NLuc on CV-1 monolayer cells were visualized using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay system and an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) (Xenogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After observation, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antiviral_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monolayers of CV-1 cells cultured in 96-well plates were infected with wild-type or recombinant viruses at an MOI of 0.001 pfu per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After adsorption for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS and the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL trypsin and 0200 µM ribavirin (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen hours after infection, viral titers in cell lysates were determined by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize luminescence signals in infected cells, NanoLuc substrate was added to each well, and luciferase signals were detected by IVIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor cell cytotoxicity during ribavirin treatment, monolayers of CV-1 cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL trypsin and 01,000 µM ribavirin (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirteen hours after infection, WST-1 reagent (Roche) was added to each well, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Absorbance at 440 nm was measured using a PowerScan HT microplate reader (DS Pharma Biomedical).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viral titers were analyzed by t test, and IFN- reporter assays were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukeys multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism (version 5.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
