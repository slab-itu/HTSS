Nonlinear, interacting responses to climate limit grassland production under global change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global environmental change involves many factors that occur simultaneously, yet they are usually studied in isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a long-term global change experiment that subjected California grassland to multiple individual and simultaneous changes in temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed nonlinear and interactive effects of temperature and precipitation on grassland net primary production (NPP), which defined a ridge-shaped NPP response surface to these two variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Added nitrogen raised the peak of the NPP response surface, and added CO2 shifted the peak to lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach was validated by tests showing an absence of progressive effects over the years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other ecosystems, our approach may be similarly powerful for probing the effects of multifactor global change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and pollutants are altering ecosystems and the goods and services they provide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among approaches for predicting ecosystem responses, long-term observations and manipulative experiments can be powerful approaches for resolving single-factor and interactive effects of global changes on key metrics such as net primary production (NPP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine both approaches, developing multidimensional response surfaces for NPP based on the longest-running, best-replicated, most-multifactor global-change experiment at the ecosystem scalea 17-y study of California grassland exposed to full-factorial warming, added precipitation, elevated CO2, and nitrogen deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-factor and interactive effects were not time-dependent, enabling us to analyze each year as a separate realization of the experiment and extract NPP as a continuous function of global-change factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a ridge-shaped response surface in which NPP is humped (unimodal) in response to temperature and precipitation when CO2 and nitrogen are ambient, with peak NPP rising under elevated CO2 or nitrogen but also shifting to lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that future climate change will push this ecosystem away from conditions that maximize NPP, but with large year-to-year variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The JRGCE is located in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, San Mateo, California (37°24N, 122°14.5W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site occupies 0.75 ha within a 5-ha stand of California annual and perennial grassland and has a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the period from 1998 to 2014, annual precipitation, which occurs almost entirely from November through April, varied from 240 to 1,280 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summer 1997, we established 36 circular plots 2 m in diameter, subdivided into four equal-sized subplots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 19971998 growing season (year 1) was a pretreatment year, after which treatments were applied for 16 consecutive growing seasons (years 217), from the time of germination (November) to plant senescence (June).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treatments consisted of four global change factorstemperature, precipitation, CO2, and nitrogenat either ambient or an elevated level, applied in a complete factorial, randomized block design with eight replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factorial combinations of CO2 (via free-air CO2 enrichment) and warming (via heaters suspended above the plot) were applied at the whole-plot level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 treatment was targeted at +300 µmolmol1 over background via free-air CO2 enrichment; the actual enrichment was +275.3 µmolmol1 over the level measured in low plots, which averaged +32.8 µmolmol1 higher than the CO2 concentration measured at the Mauna Loa observatory (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warming treatment increased from +80 Wm2 (years 25), to +100 Wm2 (years 612), to +250 Wm2 (years 1317).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each plot, the four subplots received factorial combinations of precipitation (via emitters mounted outside the plot perimeter) and nitrogen deposition (via nitrate addition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitation treatment was +50% of ambient rainfall, plus two 10-mm additions after the last rainfall event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nitrogen treatment was +2 g Nm2y1 as nitrate solution in November and +5 g Nm2y1 as nitrate pellets in late January or early February.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional four plots (eight subplots) served as controls for the treatment infrastructure and received no treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wildfire spread into the JRGCE in July 2003, affecting two blocks of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In July 2011, replicate prescribed burns were carried out across four of the blocks, including the two blocks that burned in 2003.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ecosystem responses included NPP (grams per square meter per year) and its components ANPP and BNPP, which were measured as dry biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For aboveground biomass, we harvested all plant matter in a 141-cm2 area in each subplot at the peak of standing biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In years 13 we harvested biomass once (in May), and in years 417 we harvested from each subplot twice: the first one timed to peak biomass in the phenologically most advanced plots (mid-April to early May), and the second one 3 wk later at the peak of less advanced plots (early to late May).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations shifted each year to avoid harvesting the same spot for at least three years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both harvests, we separated out the litter and weighed the oven-dried biomass (70 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we analyzed the aboveground biomass from the single harvest (years 13) and the maximum of the two harvests (years 417).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first aboveground harvest we took four soil cores from the harvested area, two shallow (015 cm) and two deeper (1530 cm), and the cores from a given depth were combined and weighed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roots were removed by a combination of washing and hand-picking, and then were dried and weighed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was applied to the entire soil sample from each depth except in 1999, when roots were removed from a weighed subsample of soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 19992003 and 2011 we used manual slide-hammer corers; in 20042007 we used a pneumatic corer that removed multiple cores simultaneously, and in 20082010 and 20122014 we used a single-core pneumatic corer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for possible differences in these corers, we calculated an area-based measure of root biomass from the root biomass in the sample together with the core weight, gravimetric soil moisture, and soil bulk density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were highly correlated (R2  0.9) with measurements based on root biomass and core diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No cores were processed in 1998 or 2007, so there are no BNPP or NPP values for those years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1999, 2001, and 2006, no deep cores were taken, and we estimated the deep root biomass as the plot-specific average in other years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across all plots and years, root biomass at 1530 cm was about one quarter that of 015 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for root turnover, we multiplied the root biomass by 1.54 to obtain final BNPP values (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We began by testing time-dependent treatment effects (progressive effects) using standard ANOVAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 shows the ANOVA coefficients of treatment effects (elevated vs. ambient) on log-transformed (to satisfy normality) primary production (NPP, ANPP, and BNPP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that treatment effects are mostly nonsignificant except for nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These treatment effects do not show trends in the sign, magnitude, or significance over 17 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both findings are consistent with Dukes et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of time dependence leads us to integrate experimental treatment and natural variation over 17 y, by quantifying the actual environment each plot experienced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the environment in terms of four continuous variables and two factor variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For temperature (T), we used data from a Jasper Ridge weather station to calculate the average ambient air temperature during the growing season, defined as the 184-d period from the mean date of germination in fall to the mean midpoint between the two harvest dates; for warmed plots we added the mean effect of the warming treatments (1 °C, 1.5 °C, and 2 °C for the three successive generations of heaters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For precipitation (P), we summed rainfall from the first germinating event until the harvest date to obtain ambient values; for treated plots, we augmented this by the amount of rainfall supplements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the ambient and elevated CO2 concentration (C) was measured hourly, at the level of the plant canopy, using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) calibrated against a reference traceable to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a check on CO2 concentration in the elevated plots, we used a CO2 fractionation model (30), assuming ci/ca is the same for plants at ambient and elevated CO2 (31), in combination with the 13C values in harvested plant tissue and the 13C of the fumigation CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation based on the 13C of the plants indicated an average elevated CO2 of 717 µmolmol1, confirming that the plants experienced approximately the CO2 concentration that the IRGA measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nitrogen (N), we determined ambient nitrogen deposition from annual maps from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevated nitrogen deposition was calculated as the ambient value plus the 7 gm2y1 that we applied manually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the fire in 2003 (F03), we created a factor variable for the following year (2004) to represent whether or not the plot was burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we created another factor variable for the burn in 2011 (B11) for the plots in the following year (2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present pairwise relationships between primary production and global change factors (T, P, C, and N) in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand ecosystem responses to multifactor global changes, we used linear mixed-effects models to analyze NPP, with main and interactive global change factors as fixed effects and plot as random effects (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For main-effects terms, we used linear functions for T, P, C, N, F03, and B11, as well as quadratic functions for T2 and P2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our choice of quadratic functions was motivated by the pairwise relationships in Fig 1 and verified by model comparison (next paragraph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For interaction terms, we used full factorial combinations of global change factors (TP, TC, TN, PC, PN, CN, TPC, TPN, TCN, PCN, and TPCN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPP variables (NPP, ANPP, and BNPP) were log-transformed to satisfy normality, and environmental variables (T, P, C, and N) were standardized (subtracting the mean and dividing by SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standardization makes coefficients comparable among global change factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the log-scale NPPs and standardized environmental variables, the estimated fixed effects (main and interaction terms) should be interpreted as proportional change in production (d log y) with respect to an SD change in environment (dx, where x is a SD of T, P, C, or N): dlogy/dx=(dy/y)/dx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the fire effects should be interpreted as proportional change in production with respect to whether or not the plot-subplot had burned in the wildfire (F03) or prescribed burn (B11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We summarized the estimated coefficients of global change factors (T, P, C, and N) in Fig 2 and the estimated coefficients of global change factors (T, P, C, and N) and fires (F03 and B11) in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis controls for fire effects but focuses on environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the models nonlinear terms, we used an information-theoretic approach for model comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We separately fitted (i) linear model, with predictors of linear and interaction terms of global change factors, and (ii) nonlinear model, with the same linear predictors as in i plus quadratic temperature (T2) and precipitation (P2) terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated their Akaike information criterion (AIC) values respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIC measures the relative quality of models for a given set of data, by estimating the information lost when the model represents the process that generates the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practically, AIC rewards goodness of fit (likelihood) and penalizes overfitting (number of parameters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower AIC indicates a preferred model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S2 shows the AIC values of linear and nonlinear models for NPP, ANPP, and BNPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, nonlinear models have lower AIC than linear models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison verifies the use of quadratic temperature (T2) and precipitation (P2) terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To synthesize joint multifactor global change effects, we used the fitted models to predict primary production in the four-dimensional environment space (T, P, C, and N) without fires, spanning the entire experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set up continuous gradients for temperature (8.6912.28 °C) and precipitation (2401,380 mm), as well as categorical levels for CO2 (ambient 409 µmolmol1, elevated 680 µmolmol1) and nitrogen (ambient 0.25 gm2y1, elevated 7.25 gm2y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We visualized our predictions by temperature and precipitation interaction at different CO2 and nitrogen level combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We summarized the modeled NPP, overlaid with observed NPP in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included similar surfaces for ANPP and BNPP in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess model performance, we compared modeled vs. observed primary production, summarized by goodness-of-fit measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeled values were calculated as the expected (or fitted) primary production given environmental variables at unique temperatureprecipitationCO2nitrogen combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modeled values were then compared with the observed primary production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5A shows that the modeled and observed NPP, ANPP, and BNPP are close to the 1:1 reference line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then summarized their goodness of fit by Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a measure between 1 and +1, where a higher value indicates a better fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all groups, the modeled and observed primary production are highly correlated (rNPP = 0.64, rANPP = 0.68, and rBNPP = 0.54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assessment validates that the model can predict the data well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To check model assumptions, we performed residual diagnostics, focusing on progressive (year-dependent) effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progressive year effects would result in model residuals (unexplained component of observed data) that correlate with year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residual diagnostics in Fig S5B show that the residuals are not correlated with year, providing additional evidence of the absence of progressive effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5C validates the normality assumption of the model residuals, supporting log-transformed NPP variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All analyses were performed in R version 3.2.4 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data and code are available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we show the mathematical details of the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exploratory_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For plot i, year t, the response variable NPP (or ANPP, BNPP) is yit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for year-dependent treatment effects, we first performed standard ANOVAs separately for each year,log(yit)=Zitt+it,[S1]where Zit is the design matrix with main and interaction terms (0: plot with ambient treatment; 1: plot with elevated treatment), ts are treatment effects (ANOVA coefficients) across years (t), and it is random error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across all of the single-factor and interactive effects, there are no consistent temporal trends in the treatment effects (t) that are significant at P less_than 0.05 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To integrate the experimental treatments and natural variation, we plotted the response variable NPP (or ANPP, BNPP) yit, against actual temperature Tit, precipitation Pit, CO2 Cit, and nitrogen Nit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the pairwise relationships between the responses (averaged on log scale, mean ± SE) and each of the predictors: yit vs. Tit, yit vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pit, yit vs. Cit, and yit vs. Nit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these are marginal relationships that do not account for interactions among predictors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted theses marginal relationships with linear and quadratic functions, which motivates our functional choice in the joint modeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Joint_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed the following linear mixed-effects model to jointly quantify how NPP and its components respond to global changes across experimental manipulation and natural variation:log(yit)=Xit+bi+it,[S2]where the response log(yit) is log-transformed NPP (or ANPP, BNPP), a design matrix Xit includes global changes across treatment and year, a fixed effect  quantifies main and interactive environmental effects, a random effect bi quantifies the plot-specific effect on NPP, and random error it is assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2,itN(0,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The design matrix isXit=[T2,P2,T,P,C,NTP,TC,TN,PC,PN,CN,TPC,TPN,TCN,PCN,TPCN,F03,B11]it,[S4]where T is standardized temperature, P is standardized precipitation, C is standardized CO2, N is standardized nitrogen, F03 is a factor variable denoting whether or not the plot was burned in the 2003 wildfire, and B11 is a factor variable denoting whether or not the plot was burned in the 2011 control burn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, the estimated environmental effects are=[T2,P2,T,P,C,N,maineffectTP,TC,TN,PC,PN,CN,two-wayinteractionTPC,TPN,TCN,PCN,three-wayinteractionTPCN,four-wayinteractionF03,B11]fireeffect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]Because we focus on environmental effects in this analysis, we presented only T, P, C, and N coefficients in the main text but included F03 and B11 coefficients in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated s are plotted in Fig 2 (except fire effects are presented in Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nonlinear (quadratic) terms T2 and P2 are justified by comparing a quadratic model with design matrix S4 vs. a linear model with the following design matrix:Xit=[T,P,C,N,TP,TC,TN,PC,PN,CN,TPC,TPN,TCN,PCN,TPCN,F03,B11]it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]We then calculated the AICs for both models and found that nonlinear models always have lower AICs (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Response_Surface_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multidimensional surfaces were model predictions based on setting all possible combinations of T, P, C, and N and setting F03 and B11 to ambient levels:log(y)=X^,[S7]where y is predicted NPP (or ANPP, BNPP), X includes standardized T and P gradients, C and N levels, and ambient F03 and B11, ^ is estimated environmental effects in Fig 2 and Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4 present the predicted y (surfaces and contour lines) as well as the observed yit (bubbles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed in-sample prediction to assess model performance,log(yit)=Xit^+b^i,[S8]where y^it is fitted (modeled) NPP (or ANPP, BNPP), Xit is the observed environment, ^ is estimated fixed effect, and b^i is estimated random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first compared modeled (y^it) vs. observed (yit) NPP and its components in Fig S5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the correlation between y^it and yit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then performed residual diagnostics to check whether the model assumption S3 has been satisfied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated residual is^it=log(yit)log(y^it).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]The plot of residuals against year in Fig S5B shows independence of year (no progressive year effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histogram of residuals in Fig S5C shows normality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
