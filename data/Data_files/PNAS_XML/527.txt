Diabetic wound regeneration using peptide-modified hydrogels to target re-epithelialization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current treatments for diabetic chronic wounds fail to achieve effective therapeutic outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these treatments focus on angiogenesis, but diabetes often involves endothelial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hallmark of regenerative wound healing is rapid, effective re-epithelialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we present QHREDGS (glutamine-histidine-arginine-glutamic acid-aspartic acid-glycine-serine), a prosurvival peptide derived from angiopoietin-1, as a therapeutic candidate that targets re-epithelialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immobilized QHREDGS peptide promoted cell survival against hydrogen peroxide stress and collective cell migration of both normal and diabetic human keratinocytes in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical relevance was demonstrated further in type 2 diabetic mice: A single treatment with a low QHREDGS dose immobilized in chitosancollagen was effective in promoting wound healing, and a single high-dose peptide treatment outperformed a clinically approved porous collagen dressing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is a clinical need for new, more effective treatments for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of epithelial cell migration is a hallmark of nonhealing wounds, and diabetes often involves endothelial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, targeting re-epithelialization, which mainly involves keratinocytes, may improve therapeutic outcomes of current treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we present an integrin-binding prosurvival peptide derived from angiopoietin-1, QHREDGS (glutamine-histidine-arginine-glutamic acid-aspartic acid-glycine-serine), as a therapeutic candidate for diabetic wound treatments by demonstrating its efficacy in promoting the attachment, survival, and collective migration of human primary keratinocytes and the activation of protein kinase B Akt and MAPKp42/44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QHREDGS peptide, both as a soluble supplement and when immobilized in a substrate, protected keratinocytes against hydrogen peroxide stress in a dose-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collective migration of both normal and diabetic human keratinocytes was promoted on chitosancollagen films with the immobilized QHREDGS peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical relevance was demonstrated further by assessing the chitosancollagen hydrogel with immobilized QHREDGS in full-thickness excisional wounds in a db/db diabetic mouse model; QHREDGS showed significantly accelerated and enhanced wound closure compared with a clinically approved collagen wound dressing, peptide-free hydrogel, or blank wound controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerated wound closure resulted primarily from faster re-epithelialization and increased formation of granulation tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no observable differences in blood vessel density or size within the wound; however, the total number of blood vessels was greater in the peptide-hydrogeltreated wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings indicate that QHREDGS is a promising candidate for wound-healing interventions that enhance re-epithelialization and the formation of granulation tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To evaluate the effect of the QHREDGS peptide on keratinocytes, we first focused on normal neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) cultured with the soluble QHREDGS peptide at doses previously reported to be effective for endothelial cell survival (low: 100 µM; high: 650 µM) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of proliferating HEKs in the population was not affected by the presence of the QHREDGS peptide at either concentration as quantified by BrdU incorporation (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant difference in the HEK migration rate was observed with the soluble QHREDGS peptide at either concentration (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the effect of the soluble QHREDGS peptide on keratinocyte survival under oxidative stress, we preconditioned HEKs by incubating the cells with or without the QHREDGS peptide and then exposed the HEKs to 500 µM H2O2 for 2 h (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An endpoint cell integrity assay showed a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of viable HEKs in the presence of supplemented QHREDGS (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the full-length protein from which the QHREDGS peptide was derived, angiopoietin-1, is known to protect skin cells from oxidative damage and to increase the activation of the prosurvival Akt and MAPKp42/44 pathway (19), we investigated whether improved survival upon H2O2 stress in the presence of the QHREDGS peptide was associated with the up-regulation of Akt and MAPKp42/44 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEKs treated with 500 µM H2O2 showed transient phosphorylation of both Akt (Fig 1D) and MAPKp42/44 (Fig 1E) at 15 min by Western blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the presence of the soluble QHREDGS peptide during preconditioning and H2O2 treatment increased the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKp42/44, and the increase was dose-dependent (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immobilized_QHREDGS_Peptide_Promotes_HEK_Attachment__Survival__and_Migration_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we observed increased survival without excessive proliferation in the presence of soluble QHREDGS, we did not observe enhanced keratinocyte migration (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absence of accelerated migration motivated our further optimization of the method by which we presented the peptide to the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the QHREDGS peptide is reported to function primarily through integrin interactions (13, 15), and an ever-growing body of literature shows that the efficacy of integrin ligands is increased when immobilized to a matrix (20, 21), we covalently immobilized the QHREDGS peptide to a chitosancollagen hydrogel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chitosan and collagen interact through a combination of thermal and ionic mechanisms, stabilized by polyanion (collagen) and polycation (chitosan) electrostatic interactions (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation of the QHREDGS peptide to chitosan was achieved using previously described methods (23), and chitosancollagen films with or without immobilized QHREDGS peptide were cast in the wells of 24-well or 96-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification using fluorescently labeled peptide, FITC-QHREDGS, demonstrated effective immobilization in both low (4.7 ± 0.1 nmol/cm2) and high (13.8 ± 1.4 nmol/cm2) peptide concentrations and the absence of the peptide in the control condition (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized to the mass of chitosan in the films, the amount of immobilized QHREDGS peptide was 14.9 ± 0.3 nmol/mg in the low peptide concentration and 44.1 ± 4.6 nmol/mg in the high peptide concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was no significant difference in the attachment of HEKs to the various chitosancollagen films (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in chitosan-only films, in which adhesion was poor, the QHREDGS peptide clearly promoted HEK attachment in a dose-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that, although the QHREDGS peptide can promote HEK attachment, the presence of collagen adhesion sites in the setting of the chitosancollagen film masks this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed the increased activation of Akt and MAPKp42/44 during 2-h attachment on chitosancollagen films in the presence of immobilized QHREDGS peptide (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the effect of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide on HEK survival following treatment with 500 µM H2O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEKs were allowed to attach to the chitosancollagen films for 4 h and then were treated with H2O2 for 2 h (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent cell-integrity assessment showed an increased percentage of viable HEKs in the presence of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEKs treated with 500 µM H2O2 and nontreated controls were also compared using Western blot analysis, which showed that the phosphorylation of MAPKp42/44 was increased in the presence of immobilized QHREDGS peptide relative to the control (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Keratinocyte migration is essential for wound healing, because a wound cannot heal in the absence of re-epithelialization (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the effect of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide on HEK migration in 2D monolayers using an Ibidi migration assay system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the Ca2+ concentration in the culture medium was increased from 0.06 mM to 0.12 mM upon initiation of the migration assay to ensure collective HEK migration (essential for wound healing), as demonstrated by the formation of E-cadherinmediated cellcell junctions (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide accelerated collective HEK migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerated migration was not caused by increased proliferation, because there was no difference in cell density among the three groups as characterized at the migration endpoint (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immobilized_QHREDGS_Peptide_Promotes_Diabetic_Human_Primary_Keratinocytes__Attachment__Survival__and_Migration_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In diabetic chronic wounds, keratinocytes experience hyperglycemia and supraphysiological oxidative stress, which challenge keratinocytes proliferation and survival (7, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined the effect of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide on adult diabetic human epidermal keratinocytes (DHEKs) by seeding DHEKs onto chitosancollagen films in the presence or absence of immobilized QHREDGS peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the results with normal HEK cells, we found the presence of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide promoted DHEK attachment to chitosan-only films (SI Appendix, Fig S4) but did not affect DHEK attachment to chitosancollagen films (Fig 3A).Western blot analysis showed that the activation of MAPK and Akt was increased in DHEKs in the presence of the QHREDGS peptide during a 2-h attachment (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of prolonged inflammation (25), human chronic wounds experience three to four times higher oxidative stress (26) and oxidative damage (27) than acute wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic this scenario, we investigated the effect of immobilized QHREDGS peptide on DHEK survival following a 2-h treatment with 2 mM H2O2 (an exposure four times higher than used for the HEK survival assay) after DHEKs were allowed to attach to the chitosancollagen films for 4 h (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-integrity assessment showed that DHEK survival under H2O2 stress was improved in the presence of immobilized QHREDGS peptide (Fig 3D), despite the higher H2O2 concentration used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DHEKs treated with 2 mM H2O2 and nontreated controls were also compared by Western blot analysis, which showed that the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKp42/44 upon H2O2 treatment was increased in the presence of immobilized QHREDGS peptide in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then assessed the effect of immobilized QHREDGS peptide on DHEK migration using the Ibidi migration assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the Ca2+ concentration in keratinocyte growth medium (KGM), 0.1 mM, was sufficient to ensure collective DHEK migration, as demonstrated by the formation of E-cadherinmediated cellcell junctions, without additionally elevating the Ca2+ concentration (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the immobilized QHREDGS peptide also accelerated DHEK collective migration (Fig 3F), and this acceleration was not caused by differences in cell density as characterized at the migration end point (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QHREDGS-Immobilized_Hydrogel_Promotes_Wound_Healing_in_db_db_Diabetic_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether the QHREDGS peptide immobilized to the chitosancollagen hydrogel could accelerate wound healing in diabetic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hydrogel system was chosen as a delivery vehicle because of its rapid gelation under physiological conditions and its persistence for a period of 3 wk in vivo (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo biocompatibility had been demonstrated in previous myocardial infarction model studies (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, only one application of the hydrogel onto the wounds was needed for the 2-wk study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full-thickness excision wound (Fig 4A) was created on 8-wk-old male BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J mice (db/db).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was selected because the animal is leptin-receptor deficient and represents a type II diabetes model characterized by hyperglycemia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this strain heals wounds primarily by the formation of granulation tissue rather than by contraction (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification using fluorescently labeled peptide demonstrated that in reconstituted chitosan solutions the amount of conjugated QHREDGS peptide was 17.5 ± 2.2 nmol/mg chitosan in low-concentration conditions and 41.5 ± 1.4 nmol/mg chitosan in high-concentration conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the final chitosancollagen hydrogel these concentrations were converted to a peptide concentration of 43.8 ± 4.4 M in the low-concentration conditions and 103.8 ± 3.5 M in the high-concentration conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a view to future clinical translation, we first tested the low-concentration condition in the in vivo studies to minimize the amount of peptide applied to the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single application of 50 L low-concentration chitosancollagen hydrogel (2.2 nmol immobilized QHREDGS peptide; low-peptide treatment) was applied to the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chitosancollagen hydrogel alone without the peptide (control treatment) and a no hydrogel/no peptide (blank condition) were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secondary dressing, Tegaderm film, was applied on top of the wound, with or without the hydrogel, to maintain a moist environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4B, the presence of immobilized QHREDGS in the hydrogel resulted in significantly smaller wounds on day 14 than in the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image analysis of the wound gross morphology performed by an investigator blinded to the study groups demonstrated faster wound healing in the low-peptide group starting on day 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of the chitosancollagen hydrogel without the immobilized QHREDGS peptide (control treatment) had no significant effect on the wound closure rate compared with the blank controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined the wound histology by Massons trichrome staining and confirmed the location of the epithelial tongue using pan-keratin staining (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wound edge was defined as the distance between the two boundaries of intact skin (thin musculature of the panniculus carnosus).There was no significant difference among the three groups in the wound-edge distance, indicating no difference in wound contraction over 14 d (Fig 4 D, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epithelial gap, defined as the distance between the two advancing epithelial tongues (Fig 4C), was smaller in the low-peptide group than in the blank and control groups (Fig 4 D, ii and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The re-epithelialization percentage, defined as the ratio of the distance that has been re-epithelialized over the wound-edge distance, was significantly higher in the presence of the QHREDGS peptide than in the controls (Fig 4 D, iii and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-peptide group also developed significantly more granulation tissue (Fig 4 D, iv) than did the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the epidermal thickness of the advancing epithelial tongue was significantly smaller in the peptide group than in the blank and control groups (Fig 4 D, v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the epithelial thickness of the skin remote from the wounds among the three experimental groups (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunostaining for CD31 (SI Appendix, Fig S8 A and C, iiii) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) (SI Appendix, Fig S8 B and C, iv) indicated no significant differences in the blood vessel density (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 C, ii, and S9) and myofibroblast content among the groups (SI Appendix, Fig S8 C, iv), although total number of blood vessels in the wound was significantly higher in the low-peptide group than in the blank and control groups at day 14 (SI Appendix, SI Results and Fig S8 C, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High_Peptide_Hydrogel_Outperforms_a_Clinically_Approved_Wound_Dressing_in_Wound_Closure_of_db_db_Diabetic_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the full potential of the peptide-modified hydrogels and as a benchmark against an FDA-approved and clinically available treatment, a high-peptide hydrogel (high-peptide treatment) was compared with ColActive collagen dressing (collagen treatment) in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 21 d, visual inspection indicated essentially closed wounds in animals in the high-peptide group (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the animals were killed, analysis of wound images indicated 100% wound closure in three of the five animals in the high-peptide group, in one of five animals in the collagen-treatment group, and in none of the five animals in the blank or the peptide-free hydrogel controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages of the high-dose peptide hydrogel treatment became apparent at day 8 after treatment (Fig 5B) and persisted throughout the healing period up to day 21, at which point the wounds in the high-peptide group were essentially closed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the linear range of wound closure (Fig 5B, days 216), the fitted line slopes indicated a significantly higher rate of wound closure in the high-peptide group (8% of wound area/d) than in the blank (3%/d) and peptide-free hydrogel (4%/d) control groups and in collagen-treatment (5%/d) groups (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference in the rate of wound closure in the peptide-free hydrogel and the ColActive dressing groups; the rate of wound closure was significantly faster in the high-peptide hydrogel group than in all other groups (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological analysis (Fig 5C) indicated that only the animals in the high-peptide group had a significant difference in the wound-edge distance (Fig 5 D, i), epithelial gap (Fig 5 D, ii), re-epithelialization percentage (Fig 5 D, iii), and epithelial thickness (Fig 5 D, iv) relative to the blank group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wounds in the high-peptide group the epithelial thickness was also comparable to that of the unwounded epidermis (Fig 5 D, iv and SI Appendix, Fig S7B), whereas the other treatment groups had epithelium that was significantly (more than two times) thicker than the unwounded epidermis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these histological measures of wound closure and epidermis quality, the high-peptide group significantly outperformed both the control group treated with peptide-free hydrogel and the collagen treatment group (Fig 5 D, iiiv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in the high-peptide group, one mouse with complete wound closure also exhibited hair regrowth at the wound periphery as seen in gross morphology (SI Appendix, Fig S11A) and histology (SI Appendix, Fig S11B) images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Picrosirius red staining indicated disruption of the native collagen organization in day 21 wounds in blank-, peptide-free hydrogel-, and collagen-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, collagen organization equivalent to the unwounded skin was identified in wounds treated with the high-peptide immobilized hydrogel (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining for the neural marker protein gene product 9.5 (PgP9.5) confirmed a low density of positive cells in all groups, with no appreciable differences among groups (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with the inability of diabetic mice to regenerate neurons fully (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences in the vascular density among the groups at day 21 (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To delineate further whether there were differences in blood vessel densities in the early stages of healing, we compared the time course of early vessel development in the high-peptide and blank groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At days 4 and 8 after injury there were no appreciable differences in blood vessel density in the two groups (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, observe an increase in vessel density and in CD31+ area between day 4 and day 8 in the high-peptide group but not in the blank control group (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood vessel density and the percentage of area covered by endothelial cells remained statistically unchanged between day 8 (SI Appendix, Fig S15) and day 21 (SI Appendix, Fig S14) according to ANOVA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively these results indicate that the treatment with high-dose peptide hydrogel leads to sufficient angiogenesis to drive the rapid formation of granulation tissue without the massive vessel overgrowth early on followed by a pronounced vessel regression that is often reported with treatments that overstimulate early angiogenesis (3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Angiogenesis has been a primary target of therapeutic interventions in wound healing by local application of growth factors [e.g., epidermal growth factor (35, 36), fibroblast growth factor (37, 38), vascular endothelial growth factor (39, 40), and angiopoietin (41)] or angiogenic cells (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diabetic patients are often reported to have dysfunctional endothelium that cannot respond efficiently to growth-factor stimulation (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetics also suffer from the insufficient recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, which are critical for wound repair (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, many of these approaches failed to meet the FDA-accepted primary efficacy endpoint standard of complete wound closure within 12 weeks for any dose (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chose to take a different approach here, by considering the hallmarks of true regenerative healing as observed during the closure of embryonic wounds and scarless healing in model organisms such as flies, zebrafish, and newts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all these models, rapid, coordinated, and collective migration of epidermal cells is critical for regenerative healing (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we focused on developing a hydrogel treatment that would promote the collective migration of keratinocytes and enhanced formation of granulation tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cellcell interactions in collective cell migration, including local tractions pulling cooperatively toward unfilled space (termed kenotaxis) (49), mechanical exclusion interactions between cells (50), and intercellular adhesion and tension (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our in vitro studies, calcium concentration was increased when necessary to ensure that both normal and diabetic keratinocytes migrated collectively rather than individually so that the treatment effect on collective migration could be described accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following its discovery (52), there has been a growing recognition that angiopoietin-1 is an important regulator of cellular processes including vascular protection (53), cardiac remodeling (5456), inflammation (5759), and wound healing (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the insolubility of angiopoietin-1, its derivatives have been developed to promote wound healing by angiogenesis (6062).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we assessed the effect of a water-soluble peptide, QHREDGS, derived from the fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-1 and conserved among species (54), on promoting the survival and collective migration of normal and diabetic keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, supplementation of the culture medium with soluble QHREDGS peptide protected human keratinocytes against H2O2 stress and induced up-regulation of Akt and MAPKp42/44 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous reports for angiopoietin-1 in human keratinocytes and melanocytes (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the effect of the QHREDGS peptide on cell migration and cutaneous wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies also reported that a scrambled peptide (DGQESHR or DQSHGER) does not exert prosurvival effects similar to that of the QHREDGS peptide in cardiac cells (14, 63), endothelial cells (13), and induced pluripotent stem cells (15), motivating the omission of the scrambled peptide in the studies described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, the QHREDGS peptide functions through interactions with 1-containing integrins that are involved in cellmatrix interactions, rather than Tie2 receptors that reside mainly on endothelial cells (13, 15, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the QHREDGS peptide can act on various cell types, including keratinocytes, that express the 31-integrin implicated in their enhanced survival and migration (6466).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrin interaction also motivated the presentation of the QHREDGS peptide as a matrix-bound ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the short peptide sequence QHREDGS can be modified using versatile chemical methods and does not require a specific orientation or conformation to function, as does the full-length protein (67), and peptides are less susceptible than full-length proteins to degradation caused by proteolysis or hydrolysis during modification and after delivery to the native environment (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we used 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry to conjugate the QHREDGS peptide to the backbone of chitosan, which is a zero-length cross-linker that does not add any other moieties to the final product; these features are important for further clinical translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide immobilization also provides the advantages of localized action in the target tissue and a lower total dose than required for application in an encapsulated or soluble form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the prosurvival effect of the QHREDGS peptide was preserved after it was conjugated and immobilized in the chitosancollagen films and that the immobilized QHREDGS peptide was able to promote keratinocyte collective migration, whereas the soluble peptide did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in the context of the chitosancollagen film system, the conjugated QHREDGS peptide is presented in close proximity to collagen, thereby creating an environment reminiscent of the collagenglycosaminoglycan interaction in the native ECM (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using DHEKs from an adult diabetic patient, we determined that the prosurvival, promigratory effects of immobilized QHREDGS peptide could be translated to diabetic keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetic chronic wounds often occur in the elderly population (the source of the primary DHEKs in this study) because of age-associated comorbidities (70), and advanced protein glycosylation that can alter the functional properties of important ECM components, such as collagen, has been associated with diabetes and aging (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these challenges, the immobilized QHREDGS peptide was effective in the in vitro diabetic wound-healing model, suggesting the possibility of in vivo benefits for diabetic wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our previous in vitro study showed that the QHREDGS peptide promoted endothelial cell survival, metabolism, and tube formation mediated by integrin interactions (13), the accelerated diabetic wound healing shown in the animal studies here was not associated with the significantly enhanced blood vessel density per area of granulation tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the peptide-treated group there was more granulation tissue and consequently a higher total number of blood vessels in these wounds, but there was no increase in blood vessel density relative to the other groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with our previous study in a rat myocardial infarction model, which showed an increase in large vessels within the myocardial infarction border zone but no difference in the total vascularization (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angiogenesis is critically important for wound healing (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We view the stable and steady growth of blood vessels in our system as an advantage, because previous studies reported leaky vasculature and, in some cases, angioma formation in treatments that overemphasized angiogenesis (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternatively, the diabetic endothelium is associated with enhanced degradation of nitric oxide, an important regulator of inflammation, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization, because of the presence of excessive ROS (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study, we showed that the QHREDGS peptide could induce enhanced endothelial cell nitric oxide production (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is possible the improved wound-healing effects induced by the QHREDGS peptide might be attributable in part to nitric oxide production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future studies, the QHREDGS peptide could be combined with biomaterials (72) and/or peptides (62) shown to strongly enhance angiogenesis in wound healing to investigate synergistic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our previous study demonstrated the retention of the chitosancollagen hydrogel over 3 wk postinjection in the infarcted rat heart, an extremely dynamic, inflammatory environment (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we applied the QHREDGS peptide in the same chitosancollagen hydrogel as a single treatment and found that even a low dose was sufficient to accelerate wound healing in a clinically relevant, genetically modified db/db diabetic mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a single application of a high peptide dose significantly outperformed a clinically available wound dressing, resulting in complete wound closure at 3 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approved ColActive dressing significantly accelerated wound healing by 67% compared with the untreated wounds in the blank group; the high-peptide immobilized hydrogel accelerated healing by 167% compared with untreated wounds and by 60% compared with the ColActive dressing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the peptide on the rate of wound closure was dose-dependent, based on a comparison of data from days 211 from our two independent animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we show potential for hair regrowth (SI Appendix, Fig S11) and reinnervation (SI Appendix, Fig S13), it is important to emphasize that robust and full hair regrowth and reinnervation in the wounds of diabetic animals is generally not reported (61, 7585).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of these animals to regenerate nerves fully has also been recognized (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This failure is in contrast to wound-healing studies in healthy animals, such as burn injury models, that reported hair regrowth (72) and signs of reinnervation as judged by the presence of PgP9.5 in the wound (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to induce an effective wound-healing response with a single application is an important clinical consideration, because it removes the need for frequent repeated applications that can disturb the healing process, it reduces the pain and discomfort associated with frequent dressing changes, and it requires fewer healthcare resources (70, 86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of a single mouse model for the analysis of therapeutic efficacy could be seen as a potential limitation of our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the db/db diabetic mice are those used most often as a model of human diabetic chronic wounds (87), and the genetically modified db/db diabetic mouse has been used previously to support clinical trial development with other molecules (88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To tease out the extent to which the QHREDGS peptide could induce wound healing, we selected a larger, 8-mm diameter initial wound size rather than the commonly used 6-mm wound (76, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low dose of peptide was tested in vivo based on the concept that pharmaceutical agents should be applied at a minimal effective dosage to avoid potential side effects [e.g., an increased rate of mortality secondary to malignancy was reported for patients treated with 45 g of Regranex (180 nmol PDGF-BB) (89)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high dose was tested in vivo because of the more profound effects on keratinocytes observed with the high peptide dose in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a single low dose of 4.4 nmol peptide/cm2 of wound area was effective in promoting granulation tissue formation and wound closure in vivo, whereas daily application of 0.4 nmol Regranex/cm2 of wound area was needed to promote granulation tissue formation but did not shorten the time to wound closure in a db/db mouse model (90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QHREDGS peptide is available by cost-effective synthesis with a precisely defined composition, offering an additional advantage in potential clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cost of the synthetic QHREDGS peptide used in our study was $1.6 Canadian dollars (CAD)/mg, which is 20 000-times cheaper than the commercially available rhPDGF-BB, an active component of the FDA-approved Regranex, which costs $33,000 CAD/mg (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of the hydrogel components, collagen and chitosan, also was motivated by clinical translation considerations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chitosan has been approved by the FDA for use in humans in topical applications (e.g., HemCon bandages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, collagen is a component of numerous wound dressings currently on the market in different formulations such as freeze-dried sheets, pastes, pads, powders, and gels (e.g., INTEGRA Matrix Wound Dressing, BIOSTEP collagen matrix dressing, BGC Matrix, Stimulen Collagen, ColActive, and others).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have demonstrated that in diabetic wounds keratinocyte survival and collective migration represent promising alternative therapeutic targets that support re-epithelialization, a hallmark of wound regeneration and closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a genetically modified diabetic mouse, the immobilized QHREDGS peptide accelerated the wound-healing process by promoting the rate of re-epithelialization and the formation of granulation tissue without significantly affecting angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the immobilized QHREDGS peptide did not increase the number of -SMApositive cells (e.g., myofibroblasts) that can induce the antithetic wound-regeneration processes of wound contraction, collagen overproduction, and scar formation (91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our reported results give rise to a number of questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mainly, the efficacy of a potential therapeutic intervention providing synergistic regulation of angiogenesis and re-epithelialization in diabetic chronic wounds is yet unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the chitosancollagen hydrogel system is capable of simultaneously delivering other molecules, because the chitosan backbone is amenable to various chemical modifications (92, 93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the QHREDGS peptide promoted keratinocyte adhesion and collective migration in vitro, as well as survival against H2O2 stress through Akt and MAPKp42/44 pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, the QHREDGS peptide immobilized to a chitosancollagen hydrogel accelerated diabetic wound healing by enhanced re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data in both normal and diabetic human primary keratinocytes and in a db/db diabetic mouse model demonstrate the translational relevance of the QHREDGS peptide in treating diabetic wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose the QHREDGS peptide as a therapeutic candidate for promoting diabetic wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that the QHREDGS peptide would promote keratinocyte migration and survival under H2O2 stress and that a single application of QHREDGS-immobilized chitosancollagen hydrogel would accelerate wound healing in diabetic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endpoints and peptide dosage were selected on the basis of previous studies and preliminary results (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For animal studies, mice were randomized, and gross morphology analysis was performed by an investigator blinded to the study groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details on primary human keratinocytes cell culture, evaluation of soluble QHREDGS in vitro, the proliferation assay, H2O2 treatment of HEKs with soluble QHREDGS peptide, the conjugation of QHREDGS to chitosan, solvent casting of chitosancollagen films, coating validation; keratinocyte attachment on chitosan-only films, H2O2 treatment of keratinocyte on the chitosancollagen films, the EarlyTox cell-integrity assay, Western blotting, the migration assay, calcium increase for HEK migration, immunostaining, histological analysis, and microvessel and positive staining analysis algorithms are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animals__Wound_Model__and_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto approved all described animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight-week-old, genetically diabetic, maleBKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J mice (db/db) (Stock 000642) were ordered from Jackson Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were acclimatized for 1 wk, and their blood glucose levels were tested with a glucometer (Accu-Chek; Aviva) to confirm that plasma glucose levels were above 300 mg/dL on the day before surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The chitosancollagen hydrogel was prepared in a manner similar to that described previously (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final hydrogel consisted of 2.5 mg/mL chitosan (with or without conjugated QHREDGS peptide) and 2.5 mg/mL type I collagen neutralized by 1 N NaOH and 10× PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final hydrogel solution was mixed thoroughly and kept on ice until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For in vivo application, the pre-gel solution was warmed for about 10 min at 37 °C to initiate the gelling process and was applied to the wound site with a 23.5-gauge needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To benchmark the peptide hydrogel versus an FDA-approved therapy, a commercially available ColActive collagen dressing was gifted by Covalon Technologies, Inc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (5%), and the dorsal surface of the mouse was shaved with an electric shaver, followed by treatment with a hair-removal cream (Veet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Betadine and 70% ethanol were applied in series to the surgical site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight-millimeter biopsy punches (VWR) were used to create middorsal full-thickness wounds by excising the epidermis and dermis, including the panniculus carnosus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty microliters of hydrogel without conjugated QHREDGS peptide (control group), 50 µL of hydrogel containing a total of 2.2 nmol peptide (low-peptide group), 50 µL of hydrogel containing a total of 5.9 nmol peptide (high-peptide group), or a circular (8-mm diameter) ColActive collagen dressing (collagen group) was applied topically to the wound beds, or the wounds were left untreated (blank group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wound beds then were covered by Tegaderm film (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4B and 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) was given s.c. before and immediately after the surgery as an analgesic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the mice were housed individually and observed every other day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digital photographs of wounds were taken every 2 d at the same distance by a camera (Canon) with a calibration scale on the side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed using CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation, on day 4 (blank and high-peptide groups), day 8 (blank and high-peptide groups), day 14 (blank, control, and low-peptide groups), or day 21 (blank, control, collagen, and high-peptide groups) as indicated in the Results and figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All results are presented as mean ± SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 11.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between experimental groups were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post hoc test for pairwise comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear regression was used to calculate wound-closure rates, and significant differences were determined by comparing the slopes of the fitted lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A value of P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
