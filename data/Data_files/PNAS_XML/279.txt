Immunization with a heat-killed preparation of the environmental bacterium Mycobacterium vaccae promotes stress resilience in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hygiene, or old friends, hypothesis proposes that lack of exposure to immunoregulatory microorganisms in modern urban societies is resulting in an epidemic of inflammatory disease, as well as psychiatric disorders in which chronic, low-level inflammation is a risk factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important determinant of immunoregulation is the microbial community occupying the host organism, collectively referred to as the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that stress disrupts the homeostatic relationship between the microbiota and the host, resulting in exaggerated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of mice with a heat-killed preparation of an immunoregulatory environmental microorganism, Mycobacterium vaccae, prevents stress-induced pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a strategy of reintroducing humans to their old friends to promote optimal health and wellness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The prevalence of inflammatory diseases is increasing in modern urban societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammation increases risk of stress-related pathology; consequently, immunoregulatory or antiinflammatory approaches may protect against negative stress-related outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that stress disrupts the homeostatic relationship between the microbiota and the host, resulting in exaggerated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated immunization with a heat-killed preparation of Mycobacterium vaccae, an immunoregulatory environmental microorganism, reduced subordinate, flight, and avoiding behavioral responses to a dominant aggressor in a murine model of chronic psychosocial stress when tested 12 wk following the final immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, immunization with M. vaccae prevented stress-induced spontaneous colitis and, in stressed mice, induced anxiolytic or fear-reducing effects as measured on the elevated plus-maze, despite stress-induced gut microbiota changes characteristic of gut infection and colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae also prevented stress-induced aggravation of colitis in a model of inflammatory bowel disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of regulatory T cells negated protective effects of immunization with M. vaccae on stress-induced colitis and anxiety-like or fear behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide a framework for developing microbiome- and immunoregulation-based strategies for prevention of stress-related pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

M_vaccae_Increases_Proactive_Coping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reactive, as opposed to proactive, coping behavior may increase the risk of developing stress-related disorders in humans (24) and anxiety- and depressive-like responses in rodents (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we quantified reactive versus proactive coping responses during exposure to the chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC) procedure (26) (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) (for details, see SI Materials and Methods; Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we immunized male C57BL/6NCrl mice with either vehicle or a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae [National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) 11659; 0.1 mg, subcutaneously] (Fig S2A) on days 21, 14, and 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 1, mice were assigned to the single-housed control (SHC) group or CSC group, with four CSC mice being housed together with a dominant male for 19 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed stress coping behaviors of M. vaccae- or vehicle-immunized mice during 2 h of CSC exposure on days 1, 8, and 15, effects of preimmunization with M. vaccae on CSC-induced changes in the gut microbiome on days 21, 14, 7, 1, 8, and 15, anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze (EPM) on day 19, and pathophysiology on day 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
M. vaccae immunization did not affect body weight gain before CSC exposure (vehicle, 6.4 ± 0.3 g; M. vaccae, 6.9 ± 0.3 g; Students t test, P  0.05) and did not affect CSC-induced reduction in body weight gain (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, immunization with M. vaccae decreased the number of submissive upright posture displays (Fig 1A) [linear mixed model (LMM) for AM behavior, M. vaccae × time, F(2, 93.0) = 9.6, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were particularly evident during the first hour of CSC exposure on day 1, when M. vaccae-immunized mice showed a 63% reduction in the amount of submissive upright posture relative to vehicle-injected mice (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas 95.7% of vehicle-injected mice were defeated, as measured by displaying at least one submissive upright posture, only 65.2% of M. vaccae-immunized mice were defeated during the first hour on day 1 (Fishers exact test, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae-immunized mice also showed reduced numbers of flight and avoiding behaviors (Fig S2C) [LMM for AM behavior, M. vaccae, F(1, 131.5) = 10.8, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in the number of times experimental CSC mice attacked or chased the resident male (Fig S2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae-treated mice had a higher dominance index [the sum of proactive behaviors (attacks, chasing) minus the sum of reactive behaviors (submissive upright postures, flight, avoiding)] (Fig 1B) [LMM for AM behavior, M. vaccae × time, F(2, 90.2) = 4.5, P less_than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, during the 19-d CSC procedure, 69.6% of M. vaccae-immunized mice displayed at least one proactive behavior, whereas only 21.7% of vehicle-treated mice did so (Fig 1C) (Fishers exact test, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A nearly identical pattern of behavior was observed during CSC exposure when the interval between the final immunization and CSC exposure was extended to 2 wk (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1C and S2 FK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae decreased the number of submissive upright posture displays (Fig S2F) [LMM, M. vaccae, F(1, 37.6) = 14.9, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae-immunized mice also showed reduced numbers of flight and avoiding behaviors (Fig S2G) [LMM for AM behavior, M. vaccae × time, F(2, 28.8) = 10.5, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no differences in the number of times experimental CSC mice attacked or chased the resident male (Fig S2 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae-treated mice had a higher dominance index (Fig S2J) [LMM for AM behavior, M. vaccae × time, F(2, 30.2) = 14.8, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, during the 19-d CSC procedure, 62.5% of M. vaccae-immunized mice displayed at least one proactive behavior, whereas only 25.0% of vehicle-treated mice did so (Fig S2K) (Fishers exact test, P = 0.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these data demonstrate that immunization with M. vaccae induced a long-lasting shift toward a more proactive coping response (27), characterized by decreased submissive, flight, and avoiding behaviors, during chronic psychosocial stress that, based on previous studies in rodents and humans, may decrease vulnerability to the development of more persistent anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When tested on day 19, following the 19-d CSC procedure, CSC exposure had anxiolytic or fear-reducing effects in M. vaccae-immunized mice but not vehicle-immunized mice, as measured by time spent on the open arms of the EPM (Fig 1D and Table S1) [two-factor ANOVA, M. vaccae × CSC, F(1, 43) = 2.3, P = 0.13; CSC, F(1, 43) = 10.1, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae-immunized, CSC-exposed mice spent more time exploring the aversive open arms of the EPM relative to M. vaccae-immunized, SHC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, when a 2-wk interval was used between the final immunization with M. vaccae and the onset of the CSC procedure, M. vaccae immunization induced a strong anxiolytic response when CSC-exposed mice were tested on the EPM on day 20 (Fig 1E, Fig S1C, and Table S1) [Students t test, t(1, 14) = 3.9, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our previous data (28), CSC exposure did not increase anxiety-like behavior in vehicle-treated mice (Fig 1D), probably representing a floor effect (vehicle-treated mice spent very little time exploring the open arms); vehicle-treated mice in the current study received multiple subcutaneous injections and were older at the time of testing, relative to previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences may explain the high baseline anxiety in vehicle-immunized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, CSC exposure had an anxiogenic effect in the social preference/avoidance test, decreasing time spent in the contact zones of the novel object and novel conspecific (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1D and S2L) [LMM, CSC, F(1, 43.3) = 7.3, P less_than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was an overall preference for social contact, relative to the novel object (Fig S2L) [LMM, social, F(1, 45.8) = 11.1, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no effects of M. vaccae, or M. vaccae × CSC interactions, on conflict anxiety in the social preference/avoidance test, and there were no effects of either M. vaccae immunization or CSC exposure on locomotor activity (Fig S2M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no effects of either M. vaccae immunization or CSC exposure on conflict anxiety or locomotor activity in the light/dark box test (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1D and S2 N and O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with previous studies, CSC exposure increased adrenal weight (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1B and S2P) and in vitro adrenal insensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1B and S2Q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. vaccae immunization did not prevent these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that CSC exposure was physically and/or psychologically stressful for both vehicle- and M. vaccae-immunized groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Persistent_Effects_of_M_vaccae_Immunization_on_Brain_Serotonergic_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because chronic exercise alters brain serotonergic gene expression (2931) and because this may be relevant to the stress resistance effects of chronic exercise, we examined the effects of CSC exposure and M. vaccae immunization on serotonergic gene expression in the brainstem raphe nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we analyzed expression of tph2, encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin, and slc6a4, encoding solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter), member 4, the high-affinity, low-capacity, sodium-dependent serotonin transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae increased tph2 mRNA expression selectively in the rostral region of the dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal part (rDRD) (Fig S3 AD and Table S1) [LMM, M. vaccae × region, F(8, 715.6) = 7.4, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunization with M. vaccae also prevented a stress-induced decrease in slc6a4 mRNA expression, also in the rDRD (Fig S3E) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 27) = 6.5, P less_than 0.05], further supporting long-term effects of M. vaccae immunization on this subset of serotonergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broader implications of these findings include the capacity for bioimmunomodulatory approaches to alter gene expression patterns in highly specific neural systems in the brain across a long timescale, at least 4 wk, effects that may influence stress coping strategies and stress resilience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influence_of_M_vaccae_Immunization_on_Microglia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the potential role of inflammatory mediators in determining behavioral coping responses to psychosocial stressors (32) and recent findings that the gut microbiota and peripheral immune activity continuously control maturation and function of microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) (33, 34), we investigated the effects of M. vaccae immunization on microglial density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether M. vaccae immunization altered the number or morphological properties of microglia within the brain, we performed immunohistochemical staining of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), a 17-kDa actin-binding protein specifically and constitutively expressed in microglia (35, 36) that is an immunohistochemical marker for both ramified and activated microglia (35, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iba1 immunostaining was evaluated in brain regions implicated in control of anxiety and fear states (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we were interested in effects of M. vaccae on activated microglia, we conducted analyses using CSC-exposed mice only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density and morphology of microglia were analyzed using image analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, among CSC-exposed mice, immunization with M. vaccae selectively increased microglial density in the prelimbic part of the medial prefrontal cortex (PrL) (Fig S3 G and I) [Students t test, t(1, 24) = 2.4, P less_than 0.05], which plays an important role in fear expression (38) and provides the main cortical input to the dorsal raphe nucleus controlling stress-induced anxiety states (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no effects in the infralimbic part (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex or other regions studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed cumulative densitometric threshold analysis revealed that there was 8% more Iba1 immunostaining in the PrL in M. vaccae-immunized CSC-exposed mice compared with vehicle-immunized CSC-exposed mice (Fig S3 H and I) [Students t test, 56.1 ± 2.3 versus 48.1 ± 2.4, respectively, t(1, 24) = 3.1, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm the long-term effects of M. vaccae immunization on the microglial phenotype in the PrL, a forebrain structure critical for control of fear expression, in CSC-exposed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stress_Promotes_Colitogenic_Dysbiosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that stress alters the composition of the gut microbiome (14) and, consequently, the homeostatic balance between the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system, with important consequences for mucosal inflammation (15) as well as emotional behavior, including anxiety-like behavior (16), we conducted next-generation sequencing to characterize the effects of stress on the composition of the gut microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we investigated whether or not prior immunization with M. vaccae had any impact on stress-induced changes in the gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In microbial ecology, there are two principal measures of species diversity, with -diversity assessing diversity within a sample and -diversity assessing diversity between samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were strong overall declines in -diversity over time, particularly evident at the onset of the CSC procedure (Fig S4 AC) [LMM, day, phylogenetic diversity, F(5, 28.1) = 11.0, P less_than 0.0001; observed species, F(5, 28.5) = 10.9, P less_than 0.0001; Shannon index, F(5, 35.9) = 13.9, P less_than 0.0001], suggesting that the CSC procedure was stressful for all mice, which were housed in the same room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed with other stressors (15), CSC exposure increased -diversity, relative to SHC conditions (Fig S4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on analysis of all samples across all time points, -diversity was higher and -diversity was lower in M. vaccae-immunized mice compared with vehicle-immunized mice (Fig S4 AE) [LMM, -diversity, M. vaccae, phylogenetic diversity, F(1, 26.9) = 5.9, P less_than 0.05; observed species, F(1, 31.1) = 5.4, P less_than 0.05; Shannon index, F(1, 37.0) = 11.8, P less_than 0.01; M. vaccae × CSC × day, phylogenetic diversity, F(16, 36.1) = 2.1, P less_than 0.05; observed species, F(16, 36.1) = 2.1, P less_than 0.05; Shannon index, F(16, 47.5) = 1.3, P = 0.27], indicating that M. vaccae immunization had a stabilizing effect on the gut microbiota throughout the study, consistent with recent studies demonstrating that host adaptive immunity modulates the gut microbiota (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, multiple linear regression showed that 11% of the variation in the gut microbiota was explained by the histological damage score in the colon, reflecting intestinal immune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detailed analysis of the microbial composition, conducted using analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) (41), revealed main effects of CSC to increase the abundance of Proteobacteria (percent relative abundances are plotted in Fig S4F), including Helicobacter, and an unidentified genus of Helicobacteraceae, as well as Paraprevotella (Bacteroidetes) on day 8 or 15 [ANCOM, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P less_than 0.05] (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 GJ and S5 AC and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in microbial community structure over time were evaluated using ANCOM over all six time points, followed, when appropriate, by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing days 1 versus 8 and days 1 versus 15, using Bonferroni correction (Fig S4K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the analysis of the main effects of CSC exposure above, time-dependent increases in Helicobacter, two unidentified genera of Helicobacteraceae, and Paraprevotella were seen on days 8 and 15 in both vehicle-immunized and M. vaccae-immunized CSC mice but not SHC mice (Fig S5 MO and S and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, decreases in Mucispirillum were observed on days 8 and 15 in both vehicle-immunized and M. vaccae-immunized CSC mice but not SHC mice (Fig S5Q and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed a main effect of M. vaccae to stabilize the abundance of several genera on day 8 or 15, including an unidentified genus of Desulfovibrionaceae (Proteobacteria) (Fig S5X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are consistent with a CSC-induced gut dysbiosis and a shift toward a gut microbiota with increased potential for inflammation (Fig S4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Psychological stress increases Helicobacter abundance through glucocorticoid actions on glucocorticoid receptors (18), and previous studies have found that Helicobacter abundance predicts intestinal inflammation scores specifically in mice with impaired immunoregulation (IL-10/ mice; r = 0.58) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these previous findings, relative abundances of both Proteobacteria and Helicobacter predicted histological damage to the colon in our study (Fig S4 L and M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, expansion of Paraprevotella, as observed in our study (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 H and I and S5S), has been associated with multiple murine models of experimental autoimmunity (43), consistent with a stress-induced autoimmune-like response to dietary, microbiota, or self-antigens in the absence of adequate immunoregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, decreases in the abundance of Mucispirillum over time, as observed in our study in both vehicle/CSC and M. vaccae/CSC mice (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 H and J and S5Q and Table S3), have been identified as a biological signature of gut infection (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decline of Mucispirillum is associated with early disruption of the colonic surface mucus layer and a prolonged delay to recovery after the period of pathogen clearance (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

M_vaccae_Prevents_Stress-Induced_Colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence suggests that anxiety and depression are more common in IBD patients and that the symptoms of these conditions are more severe during periods of active disease (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral or intraperitoneal administration of immunomodulatory bacterial products have been shown to both prevent and treat experimental colitis in animal models (46, 47), suggesting that these substances can act through gut-dependent and gut-independent mechanisms to attenuate chemically induced colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic subordinate colony housing exposure reproducibly induces spontaneous colitis and aggravates chemically induced colitis (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, although immunization with M. vaccae did not prevent the CSC-induced increase in colitogenic Helicobacter spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4H and S5 B and MO and Table S3), it did prevent CSC-induced spontaneous colitis [Fig 2 A and B; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, two-factor ANOVA, M. vaccae × CSC, F(1, 29) = 6.7, P less_than 0.05; Fig 2B, Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, Students t test, t(1, 14) = 5.4, P less_than 0.05], and decreased plasma concentrations of kynurenine, a biomarker of inflammation (48) (Fig S2R) [LMM, M. vaccae, F(1, 24) = 5.6, P less_than 0.05], suggesting increased immunoregulation (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CSC exposure decreased tryptophan concentrations (Fig S2S) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 27) = 4.705, P less_than 0.05], whereas M. vaccae immunization had no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, M. vaccae pretreatment prevented the CSC-induced aggravation of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 1% for 7 d)-induced colitis (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) (Fig 2 CI and Fig S1D) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 26) = 4.6, P less_than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in the model of DSS-induced colitis, M. vaccae immunization attenuated the CSC-induced increase in the number of viable mesenteric lymph node cells (Fig 2E) [two-factor ANOVA, M. vaccae, F(1, 24) = 4.8, P less_than 0.05; CSC, F(1, 24) = 76.4, P less_than 0.0001] and attenuated the CSC-induced IFN- (Fig 2F) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 24) = 8.5, P less_than 0.01] and IL-6 secretion [Fig 2G; two-factor ANOVA, M. vaccae × CSC, F(1, 24) = 14.9, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic subordinate colony housing exposure increased IL-10 secretion from anti-CD3stimulated mesenteric lymph node cells assessed in vitro (Fig 2 H and I) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 24) = 12.7, P less_than 0.01], an effect that was only evident in M. vaccae-immunized mice, indicating an antiinflammatory bias in M. vaccae-immunized, CSC-exposed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data suggest that, in the absence of adequate immunoregulation, CSC exposure led to activation of the host immune response toward Helicobacter spp., other elements of the CSC-induced colitogenic microbiota, or dietary or self-antigens, resulting in colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these data suggest that immunization with M. vaccae restored immunoregulation and prevented colitogenic effects of CSC, despite stress-induced development of a gut microbiota with colitogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, immunization with M. vaccae, or similar bioimmunomodulatory approaches, may be useful for prevention of chronic stress/repeated trauma-induced inflammation and subsequent development of somatic and mental disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treg_Dependence_of_M_vaccae_Effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Psychosocial stress decreases Treg in mice and humans (50, 51), and Treg depletion increases anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in mice (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, PTSD subjects (9) and subjects with major depressive disorder (53) have reduced Treg, which is reversed 1 y following effective narrative exposure therapy (54) or treatment with antidepressants, respectively (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these findings and studies showing that CSC reduces Treg in peripheral lymph nodes (26) and M. vaccae immunization induces Treg (22), we investigated a potential role for Treg in the stress-protective effects of M. vaccae (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we were primarily interested in the effects of depletion of Treg in M. vaccae-immunized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, all mice were immunized with M. vaccae and on day 4 treated intraperitoneally with either anti-CD25 antibody [PC-61.5.3; administration of this anti-CD25 antibody is an effective means of depleting Treg in mice in vivo (55, 56)] or control antibody [rat IgG1 isotype control; anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRPN)] (Fig S1E; for confirmation of the efficacy of Treg depletion, see Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, we assessed dominantsubordinate interactions during CSC exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 19 of CSC, mice were tested on the EPM, and then, on day 20, mice were euthanized for collection of adrenals, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among M. vaccae-immunized mice, treatment with anti-CD25 antibody had no effect on stress coping behaviors during CSC (Fig S6 DI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of M. vaccae-immunized mice with anti-CD25 antibody had no effect on tph2 or slc6a4 mRNA expression in the rDRD (Table S1), suggesting that both the effects of M. vaccae on behavioral coping strategies during CSC exposure and brain tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression are independent of Treg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, treatment with the anti-CD25 antibody, which would be expected to increase proinflammatory signaling in the periphery, increased tph2 mRNA expression in the interfascicular part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRI) (Fig S6L) [two-factor ANOVA, anti-CD25, F(1, 22) = 4.7, P less_than 0.05], a subpopulation of serotonergic neurons that we have shown previously is activated by acute proinflammatory stimuli (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stress-induced adrenal hypertrophy was evident in M. vaccae-immunized CSC mice treated with either control or anti-CD25 antibody (Fig S6J) [two-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 27) = 29.7, P less_than 0.0001], as was the stress-induced adrenal ACTH insensitivity (Fig S6K) [three-factor ANOVA, CSC, F(1, 52) = 33.2, P less_than 0.0001], consistent with results from Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, indicating that CSC exposure was aversive for all animals and that M. vaccae does not affect CSC-induced changes in hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-CD25 antibody treatment of M. vaccae-immunized, CSC-exposed mice prevented the permissive effect of M. vaccae immunization on CSC-induced reductions in anxiety, as assessed by the percentage of time spent on the open arms of the EPM (Fig 3A; Table S1) [two-factor ANOVA, anti-CD25 × CSC, F(1, 21) = 7.4, P less_than 0.05], suggesting that the anxiolytic or fear-reducing effects of M. vaccae are dependent on Treg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, there was also no CSC-induced colitis in M. vaccae-immunized mice pretreated with control antibody, whereas M. vaccae-immunized, CSC-exposed mice pretreated with anti-CD25 antibody responded to CSC exposure with development of spontaneous colitis (Fig 3 BG) [based on anti-CD25 × CSC interactions using two-factor ANOVAs for histological damage score: F(1, 23) = 14.6, P less_than 0.01; number of viable mesenteric lymph node cells: F(1, 27) = 6.2, P less_than 0.05; and anti-CD3stimulated cytokine secretion from mesenteric lymph node cells in vitro, IFN-: F(1, 28) = 20.8, P less_than 0.0001; IL-6: F(1, 27) = 4.9, P less_than 0.05; and IL-10: F(1, 26) = 8.6, P less_than 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was a main effect of CSC to reduce the IL-6/IL-10 ratio, due to the exaggerated release of IL-10 in these M. vaccae-immunized, CSC-exposed mice (Fig 3G) [CSC, F(1, 28) = 31.8, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data support the hypothesis that stress-protective effects of M. vaccae to prevent colitis and promote anxiolytic/fear-reducing responses are dependent on activation of Treg and an antiinflammatory bias, whereas the shift toward a more proactive emotional coping response to stress is not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, brain mechanisms driving proactive emotional coping responses may already be established by the time of Treg depletion, and are not reversible or are reversed over a longer time frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diagrammatical illustration of the overall hypothetical model is presented in Fig S6M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice were housed in groups of four or five in polycarbonate mouse cages [width (W) × depth (D) × height (H): 27 cm × 42 cm × 15 cm] during the 2-wk period of Mycobacterium vaccae or vehicle injections (for details, see below) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adolescence in mice consists of early adolescence [prepubescent or juvenile, postnatal day (pnd) 2134], middle adolescence (periadolescent, pnd 3446), and late adolescence (pnd 4659) time periods (85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, because 19- to 22-g male C57BL/6NCrl mice are 5 wk of age (supplier information), these mice were in the middle-adolescence period (pnd 35) upon arrival and initial treatment with M. vaccae or vehicle, late adolescence (pnd 59) at the start of the chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC) stressor, and adulthood (pnd 78) at the time of behavioral testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the last immunization, all experimental mice were individually housed in polycarbonate mouse cages (W × D × H: 21 cm × 27 cm × 14 cm) for 1 wk (or 2 wk; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) before exposure to CSC or single-housed control (SHC) conditions started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male offspring (weighing 3035 g) from the mating of a high anxiety-related behavior female mouse (kindly provided by R. Landgraf, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany) and a C57BL/6NCrl male mouse were used as dominants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were kept under standard laboratory conditions (12-h light/dark cycle, lights on at 0600 hours, 22 °C, 60% humidity) and had free access to tap water and standard mouse diet (ssniff Spezialdiäten).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experimental protocols were approved by the Committee on Animal Health and Care of the local government, and were performed according to international guidelines on the ethical use of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_Experimental_Procedures_for_the_CSC_Paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Day 1 is defined as the first day of the CSC exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the CSC procedure, four experimental CSC mice (intruder mice) were housed together with a larger dominant male (resident) for 19 consecutive days, to induce chronic psychosocial stress/traumatization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the CSC procedure, the future dominant males were tested for their aggressive behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males that started to injure their opponents by excessive and harmful bites during testing were not used in further tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid habituation during the chronic stressor exposure, intruder mice were moved to the cage of a novel dominant aggressor male on days 8 and 15 at 1000 hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unless otherwise specified, after arrival (day 23), experimental mice were housed in groups of four or five mice per cage and received subcutaneous injections of either M. vaccae (n = 97, Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14; note: All intruder mice of Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 received injections of M. vaccae; i.e., there were no vehicle-injected mice in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) or vehicle (n = 66, Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) on days 21, 14, and 7 (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 3, and 4) or 28, 21, and 14 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after the final immunization injection on day 7 or 14, all experimental mice were housed individually for 1 wk (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 3, and 4) or 2 wk (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, we performed intraperitoneal injections of either anti-CD25 (PC-61.5.3; n = 16) or control antibody (rat IgG1, HRPN; n = 16) (both from Bio X Cell) on day 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, an additional set of SHC (n = 8) and CSC (n = 8) mice was used, which was neither injected with M. vaccae or vehicle nor with anti-CD25 or control antibody, as uninjected controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_Experimental_Procedures_for_the_CSC_Paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The general experimental procedures for the CSC paradigm are illustrated in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 1, experimental M. vaccae- and vehicle-treated mice were exposed to CSC [19 d; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 (M. vaccae, n = 24; vehicle, n = 24; one mouse of each group died during the experiment); Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 (M. vaccae, n = 8; vehicle, n = 8); Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 (M. vaccae, n = 8; vehicle, n = 8; one vehicle-CSC mouse died during the experiment); Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 (M. vaccae/anti-CD25 antibody, n = 8; M. vaccae/control antibody, n = 8; uninjected CSC, n = 8)] or kept as single-housed controls [19 d; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 (M. vaccae, n = 9; vehicle, n = 10); Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 (M. vaccae, n = 8; vehicle, n = 8); Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 (M. vaccae/anti-CD25 antibody, n = 8; M. vaccae/control antibody, n = 8; uninjected SHC, n = 8)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our previous data indicating pronounced social hierarchy effects on physiological and behavioral parameters when group housing nonfamiliar same-size male conspecifics, single housing and not group housing is considered to represent the most appropriate housing condition for controls in this paradigm (28, 86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_Procedures_for_Immunization_with_M_vaccae_and_Vehicle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental mice received either subcutaneous immunization with 0.1 mg whole heat-killed M. vaccae suspension [10 mg/mL solution; strain NCTC 11659, batch ENG 1, provided by Bio Elpida diluted to 1 mg/mL in 100 µL sterile borate-buffered saline (BBS)] using 21-gauge needles or injections of 100 µL of the vehicle, BBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose used in these experiments (0.1 mg) was 1/10 of the dose used in human studies (1 mg) (46) and identical to the dose used in previous studies in mice (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_with_Anti-CD25_or_Control_Antibody  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We injected experimental mice of Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, which were all immunized subcutaneously with M. vaccae on days 21, 14, and 7, with 1 mg of either anti-CD25 antibody (intraperitoneal PC-61.5.3; n = 16) or control antibody (intraperitoneal rat IgG1, HRPN; n = 16) (both from Bio X Cell) on day 4 of the experimental protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Induction_of_DSS_Colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On day 22 (as described in detail above), an acute colitis was induced in SHC and CSC mice of Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 (vehicle-SHC, vehicle-CSC, M. vaccae-SHC, M. vaccae-CSC) by administering 1% DSS (50 kDa; cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.16011036, ICN Biomedicals) in drinking water ad libitum for 7 d (days 2229).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Observation_During_CSC_Exposure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the intended dominant (resident)/subordinate (CSC mice) hierarchy within each CSC arena and to assess possible treatment (M. vaccae vs. vehicle and anti-CD25 antibody versus control antibody) effects on the behavioral coping strategy (proactive versus reactive coping) of experimental mice during 19 d of CSC exposure, mice of each CSC colony were videotaped for 1 h in the morning (10001100 hours; immediately after formation of the CSC groups) and in the evening (17001800 hours; 7 h following CSC group formation) on days 1, 8, and 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their defensive behavior was individually analyzed in terms of reactive emotional behaviors (submissive upright behavior, flight, avoiding) and proactive emotional coping behaviors (attacking, chasing) (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of all different behaviors was scored individually for each of the five mice forming one colony (four CSC mice plus one resident mouse), and a dominance index was calculated (the sum of proactive behavioral elements minus the sum of reactive behavioral elements) for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse with the highest dominance index within each colony was assessed as dominant; in all cases this was the resident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the percentage of CSC mice showing any kind of proactive behavior toward the resident in their CSC colony was calculated for both M. vaccae- and vehicle-treated CSC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Body_Weight_Gain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae and/or CSC) effects on body weight gain, all experimental mice were weighed on days 23, 21,14, 7, 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17 (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), day 19 (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 2, and 4), day 20 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 only), and days 22 and 29 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, delta body weight gain between day 23 and day 1 (the pre-CSC period; Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 3, and 4), between day 30 and day 1 (the pre-CSC period; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), between day 1 and day 19 (time of CSC exposure; Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 2, and 4) or day 1 and day 20 (time of CSC exposure; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), and between day 22 and day 29 (time of DSS treatment; Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 only) was calculated for each individual mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data reported represent the mean + SEM of delta body weight gain of all experimental mice per treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Euthanasia_and_Tissue_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trunk_Blood_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood collection for each mouse was finished within 3 min after entering the animal room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trunk blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes (41.1504.005; Sarstedt) on ice and centrifuged at 4 °C (5,000 × g, 10 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma samples were stored at 20 °C until assayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Plasma_Kynurenine_and_Tryptophan_Concentrations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasma concentrations of l-kynurenine and l-tryptophan were measured at the University of Colorado Boulder using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma was thawed on ice and 50 µL was diluted with 50 µL 2 M perchloric acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diluted plasma was filtered with a Microcon 10-kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 Membrane (MRCPRT010; EMB Millipore) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was loaded onto an ESA model 542 autosampler with ESA model 582 HPLC system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a mobile phase of 10% methanol (34885-2L-R), 70 mM K2H2PO4 (7778-77-0), and 1 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid (5324-84-5) (pH 3.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rate was 1 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five microliters of supernatant was injected using a partial fill and flush volume of 20 µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until injection, the plasma was kept at 4 °C throughout all procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was separated on a 250 mm × 4.6 mm 5-µm Ultrasphere ODS column (235329; Hichrom) at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-tryptophan and l-kynurenine concentrations were measured using an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The guard cell was set to 500 mV with 100 µA gain, the first electrode was set to 500 mV with 2 µA gain, and the second (detection) electrode was set to 900 mV with 200 nA gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatograms were analyzed using EZChrom Elite software (Agilent Technologies), and peak heights were used to calculate concentrations based on known standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Adrenal_Weight  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) effects on adrenal weight in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 4, the left and right adrenal glands of each nonperfused (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) experimental mouse were removed after decapitation on day 20, pruned of fat, and weighed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data represent the mean + SEM of the sum of the left and right absolute adrenal weight of all experimental mice per treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adrenocorticotropic_Hormone_Stimulation_of_Adrenal_Explants_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) effects on adrenal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responsiveness, basal and ACTH-induced corticosterone (CORT) secretion from adrenals of all experimental mice killed on day 20 was quantified in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adrenal in vitro stimulation was performed as described recently (88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after weighing, left and right adrenals were stored in ice-cold Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (12634-028; DMEM/F-12; Life Technologies) containing 0.1% BSA until all mice were killed and adrenals were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, each left and right adrenal gland was cut into halves, each half containing cortical and medullary tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, adrenal halves were weighed and preincubated in 200 µL DMEM/F-12 for 4 h (37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, culture medium was replaced and each half of one adrenal was incubated with either medium containing saline (basal) or medium containing ACTH (100 nM) for 6 h at 37 °C (95% O2, 5% CO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, supernatants were carefully removed and stored at 20 °C until they were analyzed using a commercially available CORT ELISA (RE52211, IBL International).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CORT concentrations were calculated in relation to the weights of the respective adrenal explants (i.e., relative CORT secretion) and expressed as ng/mLmg1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate treatment effects (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) on in vitro adrenal CORT secretion on a more organismal level, relative CORT secretion from the left and right adrenal gland of each mouse was summed (total CORT secretion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown represent the mean + SEM of total CORT (basal and ACTH-stimulated) secretion of all experimental mice per treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_the_Histological_Damage_Score_of_the_Colon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) effects on histological markers of the distal part of the intestinal tract in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14, the colon of all experimental mice killed on day 20 (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, 2, and 4) or day 29 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) was removed and mechanically cleaned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, 1 cm of the distal third of the colon was cut longitudinally, laid on a filter paper, and fixed in 10% formalin overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next day the fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut longitudinally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three 3-µm hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections taken at 100-m distances from each other were evaluated by histological scoring performed by an investigator blind to treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistics, each individual score represented the mean of the three sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histology was scored as follows:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total histological damage score of each mouse represents the sum of the epithelium and infiltration scores and ranges from 0 to 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown represent the mean + SEM of the histological damage score of all experimental mice per treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colonic tissue of three mice of the M. vaccae/control antibody-SHC group and of one mouse of the M. vaccae/control antibody-CSC group (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) were lost during paraffin embedding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_and_Incubation_of_Mesenteric_Lymph_Node_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) effects on anti-CD3stimulated cytokine secretion from isolated lymph node cells in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4, mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested under sterile conditions from all experimental mice killed on day 20 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) or day 29 (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) and collected on ice in cell-culture medium [RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (A15-151; PAA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (P11-010; PAA), and 3 × 105 M -mercaptoethanol (M6250; Sigma-Aldrich)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymph nodes were mechanically disrupted and filtered through a cell strainer (70-µm nylon, Falcon, 352350; Becton Dickinson Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, cells were washed three times in cell-culture medium and adjusted to a concentration of 106 cells per mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two × 105 (200 µL) lymph node cells were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate and stimulated by precoating the wells with 200 µL of 2.5 µg/mL anti-CD3 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four wells containing 2 × 105 lymph node cells were prepared for each mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2), IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10 concentrations were measured in the supernatants by ELISA [EM10012 (IFN-), EM2IL62 (IL-6), EM2IL102 (IL-10); Thermo Fisher Scientific) using two wells per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data among duplicate/quadruplicate measures of each mouse were averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown represent the mean + SEM of all experimental mice per treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN- secretion data from one mouse of the M. vaccae/anti-CD25 antibody-SHC group (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) had to be excluded due to technical problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

tph2_and_slc6a4_in_Situ_Hybridization_Histochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae, CSC, or anti-CD25 antibody) effects on tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression in different subregions of the DR in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 4, in situ hybridization histochemistry was performed as previously described (89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After decapitation, brains of all experimental mice were removed, snap-frozen in isopentane, cooled on dry ice for 24 s, and then put in aluminum foil on dry ice until all animals were euthanized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, brains were stored at 80 °C before being shipped to the University of Colorado Boulder for subsequent in situ hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen brains were blocked into forebrain and hindbrain pieces with a cut in the coronal plane at the caudal border of the mammillary bodies (approximately 3.40 mm bregma) using a mouse brain matrix (RBM-2000C; ASI Instruments) to ensure a consistent coronal plane of sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, brains were individually wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 80 °C until sectioning for tph2 and slc6a4 in situ hybridization histochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were sectioned throughout the midbrain and pons using a Leica 1900 cryostat (North Central Instruments; five alternate sets of microscope slides with 12-µm sections) and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Semiquantitative_Analysis_of_Gene_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Digital autoradiography images were analyzed with ImageJ (NIH) by an experimenter blind to the treatment groups to measure gray value × area (as a measure of tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression) using matrices in the shape of each subdivision of the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Area (mm2) was defined as the area (within each matrix) that fell above a gray value threshold that was kept consistent throughout analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 12 rostrocaudal sections, designated levels +6 to 5, containing seven major subdivisions of the DR, were analyzed [rostral aspect of the dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal part (rDRD), 4.303 to 4.554 mm bregma; rostral aspect of the dorsal raphe nucleus, ventral part (rDRV), 4.303 to 4.544 mm bregma; caudal aspect of the dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal part (cDRD), 4.604 to 4.724 mm bregma; caudal aspect of the dorsal raphe nucleus, ventral part (cDRV), 4.604 to 4.784 mm bregma; dorsal raphe nucleus, ventrolateral part/ventrolateral periaqueductal gray region (DRVL/VLPAG), 4.544 to 4.784 mm bregma; dorsal raphe nucleus, caudal part (DRC), 4.784 to 4.964 mm bregma; dorsal raphe nucleus, interfascicular part (DRI), 4.784 to 4.964 mm bregma].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An average, above-threshold mean gray value was computed for the DRVL/VLPAG using values from both the left and right hemispheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background mean gray value of each image, measured in the surrounding midbrain tegmentum devoid of tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression, was subtracted from each value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the 12 rostrocaudal levels, values for each of the seven DR subdivisions were averaged, and average tph2 or slc6a4 mRNA expression levels in the entire DR were also calculated for each mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown represent the mean + SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_the_Severity_of_DSS-Induced_Colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess treatment (M. vaccae and/or CSC) effects on the severity of DSS-induced colitis, all experimental mice of Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 (vehicle-SHC, vehicle-CSC, M. vaccae-SHC, M. vaccae-CSC) were euthanized following 1 wk of DSS (1%) treatment between 0800 and 1100 hours on day 29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One vehicle-SHC mouse died during DSS treatment and was excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The colon of all experimental mice was removed and mechanically cleaned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, 1 cm of the distal third of the colon was treated as described in detail above for quantification of the histological damage score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mesenteric lymph nodes from each experimental mouse were individually harvested under sterile conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, mesenteric lymph node cells were isolated, counted individually for each mouse, and treated as described in detail above for quantification of anti-CD3stimulated IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence-Activated_Cell-Sorting_Analysis_of_Mesenteric_Lymph_Node_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effects of antibody-mediated depletion (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3; M. vaccae/control antibody-SHC, M. vaccae/anti-CD25 antibody-SHC, M. vaccae/control antibody-CSC, M. vaccae/anti-CD25 antibody-CSC, uninjected SHC, uninjected CSC) on subsets of CD25+ T cells, flow cytometric analysis of isolated mesenteric lymph node cells of all mice was performed as described previously (93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cell isolation was performed exactly as described above (Isolation and Incubation of Mesenteric Lymph Node Cells) and in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-surface staining was performed using rat anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5; eBioscience), rat anti-mouse CD25 (clone PC61; eBioscience), and rat anti-mouse CD62L (clone MEL-14; BD Biosciences) antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detection of intracellular Foxp3, the Treg staining kit (eBioscience) was applied according to the manufacturers instructions using isotype-matched phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled IgG2a as control (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using DIVA software (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All staining profiles were based on live-gated cells, as determined by forward and sideward scatter properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exclusion of doublet cells was performed by side scatter (SSC) area  SSC width gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were further subdivided into different subpopulations according to CD4, CD25, Foxp3, and CD62L expression, and the percentage of specific subtypes with respect to a single cell gate is given in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scanning_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scanning electron microscopy images of the heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae (NCTC 11659) (Fig S2A) were conducted as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were postfixed in a mixture of 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8) for 1 h, rinsed quickly in distilled water, and deposited on a filter with a porosity of 1 m. Samples were dehydrated by the method of bypassing the critical point and metallized with gold palladium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations were performed on a Quanta 250 FEG (FEI) scanning electron microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ultra-High-Throughput_Microbial_Community_Analysis_on_the_Illumina_MiSeq_Platform  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PCR and sequencing were performed using a modified version of the protocol presented in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  94, adapted for the Illumina MiSeq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was amplified with region-specific primers that included the Illumina flow cell adapter sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse amplification primer also contained a 12-base barcode sequence that supports pooling of up to 2,167 different samples in each lane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cluster formation on a MiSeq instrument, the amplicons were sequenced with custom primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sequencing primers were designed to be complementary to the V4 amplification primers to avoid sequencing of the primers, and the barcode is read using a third sequencing primer in an additional cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification primers were adapted from the published protocol (94) to include nine extra bases in the adapter region of the forward amplification primer that support paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplification and sequencing primers additionally contain a new pad region to avoid primerdimer formation with the modified adapter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quality filtering of reads was applied as described previously (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were truncated at their first low-quality base (defined by an A or B quality score).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads shorter than 75 bases were then discarded, as were reads whose barcode did not match an expected barcode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the experimental samples, the MiSeq run also contained a control library made from phiX174, which, in this run, accounted for 47% of reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phiX control was used because of the limited sequence diversity among the 16S amplicons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA encoding rRNA (16S) sequences was extracted using the EMP protocol (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were barcoded and multiplexed for sequencing on a MiSeq platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sequencing, raw reads were quality-filtered and demultiplexed using the QIIME 1.8 (96) script split_libraries_fastq.py, leaving 35,741,149 reads, with samples having on average 121,569 reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were clustered at 97% similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using an open reference picking approach (97) with clustering and taxonomy assignment via UCLUST (98) using the Greengenes August 2013 reference set (99, 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were aligned with PyNAST (101), and phylogeny was constructed with FastTree v2.1.3 (102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Default parameters for pick_open_reference_otus.py were used, which filters out singleton OTUs and OTUs that represent less than 0.0005% of the total sequence count.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To explore correlations among the different genera present in the samples, compositional biplot analyses were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multiplicative zero replacement technique was used to determine pseudocounts for zeros (111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A center log transformation (112) was conducted to transform the data, and a singular value decomposition was performed to obtain a two-rank approximation of the genera and the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vectors correspond to different generathe angle between any two lines approximates the correlation between any two genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The points are samples and the Euclidean distance between them approximates the dissimilarity between each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of a vector corresponds to the variance of the samples explained by that genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conditional_Density_Estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the correlations among the genera shown in the biplot, a conditional density estimator was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a pair of genera, zero abundance data points were disregarded and their abundances were log-transformed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A conditional kernel density estimation was then applied on the log-transformed abundances (113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Linear_Regression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze how colon damage affects microbial communities, a multiple linear regression was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multiplicative zero replacement strategy was used to replace zeros with small pseudocounts (111), and an isometric logratio transformation (ilr) (114) was used to transform the genera abundances from the Aitchison simplex onto the real space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiple linear regression was conducted with these transformed data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regression showed that 11% of the variation in the gut microbiota was explained by the histological damage score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Composition_of_Microbiomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effects of M. vaccae and CSC on abundances by taxonomic rank were analyzed using analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) and an FDR of 0.05, and a KruskalWallis test was used within ANCOM to test for significant differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANCOM analysis for M. vaccae/CSC main effects was conducted on days 8 and 15 only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANCOM analysis of effects of time within each treatment group was conducted, followed, when appropriate, by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to identify differences between day 1 versus day 8 and day 1 versus day 15, using Bonferroni correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our design was a repeated measurement design, data on very few animals were available at all time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the M. vaccae/CSC group, microbiome data were available on only 3 out of 23 animals at all six time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, microbiome data on only 4 out of 23 animals in the vehicle/CSC group were available at all six time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for all practical purposes, these data can be regarded as independent sample data rather than longitudinal data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we applied the independent sample ANCOM to analyze the time course microbiome data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_CSC_Model_as_a_Model_of_Repeated_Psychosocial_Traumatization_or_PTSD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we used the CSC model in adult male C57BL/6NCrl mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CSC model involves introducing four experimental mice into the home cage of a larger, dominant male mouse for 19 d; on days 8 and 15 of the procedure the experimental mice are moved to the cage of a novel dominant male, resulting in reestablishment of dominant/subordinate hierarchies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the CSC paradigm combines repeated/chronic, psychological, and social aspects of stress/trauma and, therefore, represents a potent animal model to mimic the type of health-compromising stressors/traumata faced by humans (high face validity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support, mice exposed to the CSC procedure share multiple pathophysiological outcomes with PTSD (high predictive validity), a stress-related mental disorder diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Ed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  when the following criteria are fulfilled: reexperiencing of aversive details of the traumatic events, avoiding of trauma-related external reminders, negative cognitions and mood, and hyperarousal (115).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, CSC mice are repeatedly reexposed to the psychosocial trauma of social defeat, and show social deficits toward unfamiliar male conspecifics (3), persisting negative emotions (e.g., fear and anxiety) (116, 117), as well as indications of increased arousal, including increased locomotor activity during the active phase of the light cycle (117) and elevated plasma norepinephrine (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PTSD is associated with gastrointestinal pathology (118), an association that may be due to acute trauma exposure rather than to PTSD per se (119).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CSC exposure induces development of spontaneous colonic inflammation as measured by increased: (i) histological damage score (28, 120, 121), (ii) bacterial translocation as a consequence of disturbed colonic barrier functions (120, 121), (iii) numbers of colonic macrophages and dendritic and T cells (121, 122), and (iv) proinflammatory cytokine secretion from isolated lamina propria mononuclear (121, 122) and mesenteric lymph node cells (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CSC exposure results in an aggravation of DSS-induced colitis, a model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in PTSD (124), CSC exposure is associated with basal hypocorticism (125) that, in the case of CSC exposure, may be due to adrenal ACTH nonresponsiveness (28, 88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both conditions are associated with a flattened diurnal cortisol/corticosterone rhythm (28, 126), increased dexamethasone suppression of ACTH (127, 128), and increased HPA axis reactivity toward novel stressors (88, 129).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important finding in both PTSD (9, 130, 131) and the CSC model (132) is a reduction in the percentage of Treg in plasma or peripheral lymph nodes, respectively, likely contributing to the overall increased inflammatory state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the suppression of Treg in PTSD is reversed 1 y following effective narrative exposure therapy (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the above findings, the CSC paradigm seems to be an adequate animal model for PTSD (133), complex PTSD (C-PTSD) (134), and research domains outlined in the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) relevant to these disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results support the conclusion that immunization with a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae increases resilience to stress-related pathologies in part through the induction of Treg and an antiinflammatory bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae decreased submissive behavioral displays, as well as flight and avoiding behaviors, during an initial encounter with a dominant male aggressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following exposure to the chronic psychosocial stressor for 19 d, mice immunized with M. vaccae, but not vehicle-immunized mice, responded with decreased anxiety- or fear-like behaviors when tested on the EPM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behavioral responses were associated with altered gene expression in serotonergic systems previously implicated in stress resilience and changes in microglial density in brain structures implicated in control of fear expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae also prevented stress-induced spontaneous colitis and stress-induced exaggeration of chemically induced colitis, a model of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of immunization with M. vaccae on anxiety- or fear-like behaviors in stressed mice, as well as its effects on stress-induced exaggeration of spontaneous colitis, were prevented by depletion of Treg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there were no effects of Treg depletion on M. vaccae-induced changes in behavioral responses to a dominant aggressor, suggesting multiple different mechanisms through which immunization with M. vaccae alters stress-related behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunization with M. vaccae can prevent stress-induced exaggeration of colonic inflammation and downstream effects on anxiety- and fear-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, immunization with heat-killed preparations of immunoregulatory bacteria may have utility in prevention of anxiety and affective disorders and their medical comorbidity, including exaggerated autoimmunity (11, 59) and exaggerated symptoms of IBD (12, 11, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When challenged with a dominant aggressor 12 wk following the final immunization with M. vaccae, mice showed a robust decrease in submissive upright posture and decreases in reactive behavioral coping responses, such as flight and avoiding behaviors, relative to vehicle-immunized controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that a reactive emotional coping strategy during social defeat, as measured by a short latency to display submissive postures, predicts vulnerability to subsequent development of anxiety- and depressive-like behavioral responses (25, 27, 60, 61) and that inflammatory factors within the CNS drive the vulnerability to depressive-like behavioral responses in individuals with reactive coping responses (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the decreased submissive behaviors in M. vaccae-immunized mice are consistent with a stress-resilient behavioral phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms underlying the shift in behavioral strategy during psychosocial stress are not clear, but do not seem to depend on Treg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of potential importance, M. vaccae-immunized mice had altered tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression specifically in the dorsal parts of the rostral to midrostrocaudal dorsal raphe nucleus, a subregion of the dorsal raphe nucleus that has previously been implicated in stress resilience (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of immunization on tph2 mRNA expression were observed in both SHC and CSC mice and were therefore independent of the stress-induced differences in peripheral inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Factors that are known to influence individual variability in stress coping behaviors during psychosocial stress include endocrine factors, such as testosterone, or increased sympathetic reactivity, which are both associated with a more proactive behavioral coping strategy (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the microbiome generally (63) and the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri specifically have been shown to increase testosterone in mice, effects that could be mimicked by interfering with IL-17A signaling, a proinflammatory cytokine (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoregulatory microbes act on regulatory dendritic cells, which in turn bias T-cell differentiation toward Treg and away from IL-17producing T helper 17 (Th17) cells (65, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testosterone in turn increases serotonin transporter mRNA expression and binding in rats and humans in brain regions innervated by the rostral dorsal raphe nucleus (67, 68), an effect consistent with our finding that immunization with M. vaccae prevented stress-induced decreases in slc6a4 mRNA expression specifically in the rostral dorsal raphe nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, testosterone increases the neuronal firing rates of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of testosterone on serotonin transporter mRNA, binding, and serotonergic neuronal firing are thought to be dependent on aromatization of testosterone to 17-estradiol (68, 69); 17-estradiol induces anxiolytic effects on the EPM, in association with increases in tph2 mRNA expression, specifically in the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (70), as observed in our studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, immunoregulatory microbes can increase plasma testosterone concentrations, and testosterone or its metabolite, 17-estradiol, replicates the effects of M. vaccae immunization on behavioral coping strategies during social defeat, performance on the EPM, and slc6a4 and tph2 mRNA expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should explore these potential endocrine mechanisms, as well as their interactions with the microbiomegutbrain and behavior axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of M. vaccae immunization to decrease submissive behavioral displays and decrease flight and avoiding behaviors were long-lasting, evident at least 12 wk following the final immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the effects of M. vaccae immunization to induce anxiolytic responses (measured on day 19) and prevent CSC-induced exaggeration of colitis (measured on day 20) were observed 45 wk following the final immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated using anti-CD25 antibody experiments, the effects of M. vaccae immunization to induce anxiolytic responses and prevent stress-induced exaggeration of colitis appear to be dependent on Treg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timeline is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a long half-life of Treg in C57BL/6 mice, estimated to be 27 d (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-lasting protection following immunization with the same heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae has been observed in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation, where protective effects last up to 12 wk (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistent effects of M. vaccae in this model may depend in part on Treg derived from memory T cells (72), as mice are repeatedly exposed to the allergen antigen, ovalbumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely, however, that repeated immunization would be necessary in adults to induce persistent immunoregulatory effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stress-protective effects of M. vaccae immunization appear to be independent of the changes in the diversity or community structure of the gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies, exposure of mice to chronic psychosocial stress resulted in decreased diversity of gut microbial communities, as measured by -diversity, and altered gut microbial community structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-induced changes in gut microbial communities were driven by expansion of Helicobacter spp., which have been shown to induce colitis in hosts with impaired immunoregulation, such as IL-10/ mice, through induction of IFN- and IL-12 (73, 74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, preinoculation with immunoregulatory L. reuteri and Lactobacillus paracasei reduced intestinal inflammation in Helicobacter hepaticus-challenged mice, despite failing to alter the quantity of H. hepaticus in cocolonized mice (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L. reuteri primes dendritic cells to drive the development of Treg, through interactions with the C-type lectin DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results parallel these previous studies, in that Helicobacter spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  relative abundance was correlated with colitis scores in vehicle-treated mice, whereas M. vaccae-immunized CSC mice, characterized by abrogated release of IFN- and IL-6, together with exaggerated release of IL-10 from freshly isolated mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated in vitro, were protected against both development of spontaneous colitis and aggravation of chemically induced colitis in a murine model of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stress-protective effects of M. vaccae immunization also appear to be independent of the changes in the functionality of the HPA axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucocorticoid hormones, acting at glucocorticoid receptors, have been shown to induce expansion of Helicobacter spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with other studies showing that glucocorticoid hormones decrease IgA (which normally inhibits bacterial adherence to intestinal epithelial cells), increase bacterial adherence to the intestinal epithelium over twofold, and increase bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice exposed to the CSC procedure experience a profound activation of the HPA axis, with persistent adrenal hypertrophy that is evident within 24 h and persists through days 2, 7, 14, and 20 of the CSC procedure, exaggerated ACTH and corticosterone release to novel stressors, and in vitro adrenal insufficiency, as measured by decreased sensitivity to ACTH (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucocorticoid insensitivity of effector immune cells, as indicated by glucocorticoid insensitivity of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated splenocytes and anti-CD3stimulated T cells, may contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory responses in CSC mice (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with M. vaccae had no effect on the CSC-induced adrenal hypertrophy or the in vitro adrenal insensitivity, suggesting that, although HPA axis changes may contribute to stress-induced exaggerations of inflammation, they do not mediate the protective effects of M. vaccae immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously demonstrated for allergic airway inflammation (22), the beneficial effects of M. vaccae on colitis and measures of anxiety appear to be dependent on induction of Treg and enhanced immunoregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of CSC exposure on colitis and anxiety may be linked, as DSS-induced colitis (7678), or chronic gastrointestinal inflammation induced by Trichuris muris infection, is sufficient to induce anxiety-like behavioral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect may be mediated in part by afferent signaling of the vagus nerve, as prior vagotomy prevents the anxiogenic effects of DSS-induced colitis (77), although this is not the case for T. muris infection (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, specifically M. vaccae (80), and probiotics including Bifidobacterium breve 1205 (81), Bifidobacterium longum 1714 (81), and B. longum NCC3001, have been shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of probiotics belonging to the phylum Firmicutes also have been shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors in mice, including Lactobacillus helveticus ROO52 (82) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) (83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anxiolytic effects of B. longum 1714 (81) and L. rhamnosus (JB-1) (83) are prevented by vagotomy, suggesting that signaling via the vagus nerve may be particularly important in the anxiolytic effects of some probiotics administered via the mucosal route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, immunization with M. vaccae reduced spontaneous colitis and stress-induced exaggeration of chemically induced colitis and, in CSC mice, induced anxiolytic effects, effects that may involve both vagus-dependent and vagus-independent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, these data suggest that exposure to environmental microorganisms, administration of probiotics with immunoregulatory actions, or immunoregulation-promoting immunizations with heat-killed preparations of these organisms or antigens derived from these organisms may confer health benefits, including mental health benefits in subjects with stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and major depression, at least partly through prevention of stress-induced intestinal inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a broader perspective, immunoregulatory approaches such as that demonstrated here may prove useful in both prevention and treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and affective disorders, in which inadequate immunoregulation, resulting in chronic, low-grade inflammation, is a risk factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not specifically addressed here, immunoregulatory approaches may also prove useful in prevention of neurodevelopmental and other somatic and neuropsychiatric disorders in which elevated inflammation contributes to disease vulnerability (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of exposure to old friends through reduced contact with healthy soils and healthy animals in modern urban settings may partly explain the increased rates of immune-mediated diseases, including psychiatric disorders, in these settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoring exposure to these old friends, through immunization or other routes, may decrease inflammation-associated disease vulnerability in modern urban societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
