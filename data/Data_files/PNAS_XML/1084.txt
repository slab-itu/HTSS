High fire-derived nitrogen deposition on central African forests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric N deposition affects productivity and biodiversity of forests worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, field-based estimates of atmospheric N deposition for tropical forests are extremely sparse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results from a monitoring network in the central Congo Basin exceed current regional N deposition simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and modeling techniques reveal that savannah biomass burning is the main source for this elevated atmospheric N deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a large fraction is deposited as organic N, which is typically not simulated or measured in monitoring networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These high levels of N deposition have clear ramifications for the ecology and biogeochemistry of the Congo Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is an important determinant of N availability for natural ecosystems worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased anthropogenic N deposition shifts the stoichiometric equilibrium of ecosystems, with direct and indirect impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current simulation data suggest that remote tropical forests still receive low atmospheric N deposition due to a lack of proximate industry, low rates of fossil fuel combustion, and absence of intensive agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present field-based N deposition data for forests of the central Congo Basin, and use ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the organic N fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we use satellite data and modeling for atmospheric N source apportionment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that these forests receive 18.2 kg N hectare1 years1 as wet deposition, with dry deposition via canopy interception adding considerably to this flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that roughly half of the N deposition is organic, which is often ignored in N deposition measurements and simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of atmospheric N is predominantly derived from intensive seasonal burning of biomass on the continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high N deposition has important implications for the ecology of the Congo Basin and for global biogeochemical cycles more broadly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Monitoring N deposition throughout a hydrological year in the remote forest of the central Congo Basin, we found a high total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) open-field (bulk) deposition of 18.2 kg N ha1 yr1, of which 70% was organic N. Throughfall, the precipitation collected under the forests canopy, amounted to 53.1 ± 3.2 kg N ha1 yr1 in mixed forest, and 37.5 ± 4.2 kg N ha1 yr1 in monodominant forest, with roughly 50% organic N in both cases (mean ± SD) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time series of deposition showed a consistent series of peaks at the onset of the rainy seasons in March and September, suggesting a strong contribution from previous dry deposition (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This elevated deposition was not expected at this remote site, because there is no industrial activity or intensive agriculture in the vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these measured N deposition rates already surpass the simulated deposition rates for 2030 (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain further insight into the source and composition of the organic fraction (5070% of total N deposition) (Table S1), we characterized the compound classes of the organic components using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the three sample types (i.e., open-field rainfall, mixed forest, and monodominant throughfall) showed a striking similarity (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample type, the absolute and subgroup relative abundances of N-containing compounds were consistent (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual average molecular composition plotted in van Krevelen space also yielded, overall, very similar distributions (Fig 2 DF and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a high number of assigned molecular formulae in all sample types, with an average of 17,096, 16,955, and 15,627 for the open-field rainfall, mixed forest, and monodominant forest throughfall, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these formulae, 52% contained at least one N atom on average, resulting in a large number of N-containing compounds with similar composition in all sample types (Fig S1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One question that arises from these data is to what extent the increased organic N load in throughfall is caused by dry deposition versus canopy leaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundances of compound classes in the three sample types, with a high percentage of unsaturated phenolics, closely resembles a previous study of glacier DOM on the Tibetan plateau, where atmospheric deposition was identified as the main source (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall molecular similarity of the two forest types suggests that the throughfall enrichment of N is due to canopy interception of dry deposition rather than canopy leaching, as canopy leaching would be expected to result in a divergent compositional signature between the two forest types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we found only 2,811 and 2,459 unique formulae in the mixed and monodominant forest throughfall samples, respectively, that were not found in the open-field rainfall samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these formulae, only 1,380 and 1,039 contained at least one N atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unique formulae only contributed 0.94% and 0.86% relative abundance to the total DOM signature for the mixed and monodominant forest samples, respectively (Fig 2 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this qualitative compositional evidence suggests that the vast majority of N found in our forest throughfall samples was from atmospheric deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitatively measuring the contribution of canopy exchange and dry deposition in throughfall samples has proven to be a challenging task, especially in the tropics where appropriate methods still need to be developed (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than using Na+ or Cl as an inert tracer (Materials and Methods), we calculated an average condensed aromatic content using FT-ICR-MS data as proxy for fire-derived N deposition component of the organic fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Condensed aromatics are formed only through combustion and are therefore not a canopy leaching product (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) deposition loads increased linearly with increasing average condensed aromatic content, which suggests that fire-derived dry deposition controls organic N loads in the throughfall (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in N deposition and condensed aromatics content between mixed lowland and monodominant forests might be due to the increased heterogeneity of the mixed forest, which would lead to differing levels of aerosol interception of the canopies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, the monodominant species constituting a minimum of 60% of the basal area, is characterized by large leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothetically, the combination of a homogenous canopy and large leaves might render them less efficient for dry deposition removal from the air, much like the described differences in fine dust removal efficiency between tree species (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that organic N deposition found at all sites is predominantly sourced from biomass burning and not the forest canopy itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that at least part of the inorganic deposition comes from dry deposition as well, but there are no satisfactory techniques to further confirm this using the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the abundance of fires on the savanna borders has been shown before (16), our data suggest that the impact on central African forests in terms of N addition is much higher than expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this link, we crossed existing datasets of daily fire pixels (recorded by MODIS satellites and processed through NASAs FIRMS system) with daily backward wind-trajectories as simulated for the study period by the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories (HYSPLIT) model of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gave rise to an empirical fire load index (FLI) (Fig 1A), which represents the number of fires that the winds directly above our sites passed over during the week before the sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A striking seasonality in this FLI showed that the local dry season is the peak season for fire arrivals for the central African rainforests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed by extracting the black carbon column mass density (BCCMD) from NASAs Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA 2) model (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black carbon is a known combustion product, originating from either fossil fuel combustion or biomass burning (20), and hence can also serve as a proxy for the fire load of the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shifts from the southern savanna border in January to the northern savanna border in July, inducing shifts in the rainy seasons for the savanna borders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the dry seasons oscillate inversely from the north to the south, in January to July, and back.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these shifts, the ITCZ passes over the central Congo Basin twice, inducing a bimodal rainfall pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that the location of the ITCZ and the interoceanic confluence on the African continent causes biomass combustion products from the savanna borders to be transported in the direction of the equator during the dry season, and shifts of the ITCZ introduce seasonality in fire regime with latitude (Fig 1) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These field-based observations, combined with molecular signatures of fire-derived organic compounds that correspond well with model-based fire inputs from the atmosphere, raise substantial questions as to the overall impact of high N deposition in central African forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fire abundance on the African continent has been chronically high during the last millennia (23, 24), suggesting that N deposition to the Congo Basin has also been high over this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, given the agreement between the FLI and the BCCMD (Fig 1), annual and monthly deposition maps and aerosol transport models suggest that the entire Congo Basin is subject to similar, if not higher, deposition loads (Fig S3 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently available global simulation maps, which are used by modelers for reactive nitrogen loads, predict values for central Africa between 4 and 10 kg dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) ha1 yr1 (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these estimates correspond well with the DIN loads we found in the open field, they dramatically underestimate total N deposition because organic N is not accounted for, which was also shown by recent simulations (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the bioavailability of this organic N is still being studied (12, 29), the discrepancy between simulations and our data raises questions about the consequences of this high N deposition on forest functioning, biodiversity, and the regional C budget of central African forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is of particular importance given that African forests currently represent one of the largest sources of uncertainty for the global CO2 budget (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally assumed that productivity in lowland tropical forests is not N-limited (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, symbiotic N fixation by canopy trees is usually down-regulated in mature central African forests, confirming that N is cycled in excess (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear to what extent reactive N loads affect N and C cycling and biodiversity in tropical forests (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the delivery of reactive N impacts forest structure, functioning, and biodiversity via effects on taxa, functional groups, and size classes (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest an urgent expansion of the monitoring efforts in the Congo Basin, to adjust and improve global and regional estimates of reactive nitrogen loads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study was carried out in an old-growth tropical forest of Yoko, roughly 30-km south of Kisangani (N00°17; E25°18), in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetation at the study site is classified as semideciduous rainforest, and the climate falls within the Af-type (tropical rainforest climate), following the KöppenGeiger classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soils in the region are typical deeply weathered and nutrient-poor Ferralsols, with very limited elevation differences and gentle slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site has two dominant forest types: mixed lowland tropical forest and Gilbertiodendron-dominated forest, where 60% of the basal area consists of one species, G. dewevrei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughfall was sampled at three study plots of 40 × 40 m per forest type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we collected bulk precipitation in one location in the open field at a nearby deforested site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were collected from September 19, 2015 to September 10, 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughfall and bulk precipitation was collected using polyethylene funnels supported by a wooden pole of 1.5-m height, on which a polyethylene tube was attached to drain into a 5-L polyethylene container.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nylon mesh was placed in the neck of the funnel to avoid contamination by large particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The container was buried in the soil and covered with black plastic to prevent the growth of algae and to keep the samples cool to minimize microbial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each plot, we installed eight throughfall collectors in two rows of four, with 8-m distance between all collectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All plots were sampled every fortnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each sampling occasion, the water volume in each collector was measured in the field, and used recipients, funnels, and mesh were replaced by new ones, rinsed with distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A volume-weighted composite sample was made per plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume-weighted biweekly composite samples were filtered using a nylon membrane filter of 0.45 µm before freezing, and then immediately stored in a freezer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the samples were sent in several batches to Ghent University (Belgium) for chemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chemical_Analysis_and_Empirical_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After transport to Belgium, NH4+ was determined colorimetrically by the salycilatenitroprusside method (38) on an autoanalyzer (AA3; Bran and Luebbe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO3 was determined colorimetrically using the same auto-analyzer as NO2 after reduction of NO3 in a CdCu column, followed by the reaction of the NO2 with N-1-napthylethylenediamine to produce a chromophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DON can only be determined indirectly via measurement of TDN and subtraction of DIN, leading to additional analytical uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed elaborately by Cornell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40), there are three methods that are often used to determine TDN in water samples: Kjeldahl digestion, persulfate oxidation, and high-temperature catalytic oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least for marine samples, no systematic biases have been found in method intercomparisons (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a risk of underestimating DON, because the main source of error of TDN determination is the incomplete conversion of DON to DIN (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used persulfate oxidation for the determination of TDN in the water sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, a 1:1 oxidizing solution of NaOH, H3BO3, and K2S2O8 is added to the sample, which is subsequently placed in an autoclave at 121 °C for 1 h to convert NH4+ and dissolved DON into NO3 (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a subset of samples was taken for bulk precipitation (n = 12), for one of the mixed lowland plots (n = 23), and for one of the monodominant plots (n = 19) for further analysis by electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled with FT-ICR MS. Before extraction for FT-ICR MS, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, samples were thawed under refrigeration (4 °C), acidified with 12N HCl to a pH of 2, and measured via high-temperature catalytic oxidation on a TOC-analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOC concentrations were determined as the mean of at least three replicate injections, for which the coefficient of variation was less_than2% (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were prepared for ESI-FT-ICR MS analysis by the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of DOM method (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, filtered samples were acidified to pH 2.3 with HPLC-grade HCl before solid phase extraction on 100-mg Bond Elut PPL (Agilent Technologies) cartridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample volume was adjusted depending on original DOC concentration to obtain 40 µg C per milliliter of methanol eluate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative ions produced by ESI from direct infusion of the methanol extracts at a concentration of 50 µg C mL1 were analyzed with a 21 T FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Florida State University, Tallahassee) (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each signal 6 RMS baseline noise was assigned a molecular formula with EnviroOrg (45), and classified as condensed aromatic [modified aromaticity index (AImod)  0.67], polyphenol (0.67  AImod  0.5), unsaturated, low oxygen (AImod less_than 0.5, H/C less_than 1.5, O/C less_than 0.5), unsaturated, high oxygen (AImod less_than 0.5, H/C less_than 1.5, O/C  0.5), aliphatic (H/C  1.5, n = 0), and peptide (H/C  1.5, n  0) (18, 46), as defined in the Python script used in the analysis (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used plot-averaged values for the bulk rainfall and throughfall volume data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water flux for bulk rainfall and throughfall was calculated by dividing the average water volume by the surface area of the collector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogen deposition (TDN, DIN, and DON) was calculated by multiplying the water volume with the element concentration in that volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the most widely used methods to disentangle dry deposition from canopy leaching is the canopy budget model, which assumes that a natural tracer ion (most commonly Na+) is inert when deposited on the canopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the method is based on the calculation of an ion charge balance based cation deposition and computes canopy exchange interactions of NH4+, NO3 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several assumptions underlying this model seem to be challenged in tropical forest canopies, not least the apparent uptake of Na+ in some cases (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the model offers no theoretical basis for the calculation of organic N compounds from the canopy, other than the assumption that they are equally deposited on the canopy as the tracer ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these factors, we chose not to apply this model here (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Satellite_and_Wind_Trajectory_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated a FLI, representing the theoretical number of fires that were passed by the wind parcels that arrive above the experimental site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we crossed a daily fire pixel dataset with backward wind trajectories ending at the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fire pixel dataset covering the entire African continent was obtained from NASAs MODIS Collection 6 NRT (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backward wind trajectories were generated using the HYSPLIT model provided by the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (5154) with the GDAS half-degree archive meteorological dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the entire study period, we generated one trajectory every 6 h, ending above the study site pixel for five different target altitudes (respectively: 40-, 500-, 1,000-, 2,500-, and 5,000-m above ground level), going back 1 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To cross the datasets, we counted fires within a 25-km zone around the modeled air parcels at each time point going back 24 h. The 24-h period was considered to take into account smoke from smoldering fires that might not have been detected by the VIIRS system at the time point in question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fire counts were cumulated along the trajectory, resulting in a fire count per trajectory, and hence four fire counts per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated the daily fire counts for every fortnight, resulting in the FLI for the concurrent sampling dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we extracted the hourly simulated BCCMD from above our study site from the MERRA-2 from the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, v5 (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently calculated the average over this time series for all sample dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
