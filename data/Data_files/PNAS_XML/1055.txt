Lymphocytes eject interferogenic mitochondrial DNA webs in response to CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides of class C  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Release of pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) contributes to inflammatory responses and antiviral signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent DAMP molecule observed in blood circulation of trauma, autoimmune, HIV, and certain cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a previously unrecognized lymphocyte feature that CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides of class C promptly induce release of mtDNA as extracellular web-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymphocyte mtDNA webs provoked antiviral type I IFN production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells but were devoid of bactericidal proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cells remained viable after the release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings imply an alternative role for lymphocytes in antiviral signaling by utilizing their mtDNA as a rapid signaling molecule to communicate danger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is receiving increasing attention as a danger-associated molecular pattern in conditions such as autoimmunity, cancer, and trauma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that human lymphocytes [B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells], monocytes, and neutrophils derived from healthy blood donors, as well as B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, rapidly eject mtDNA as web filament structures upon recognition of CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides of class C. The release was quenched by ZnCl2, independent of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, autophagy), and continued in the presence of TLR9 signaling inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B-cell mtDNA webs were distinct from neutrophil extracellular traps concerning structure, reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependence, and were devoid of antibacterial proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA webs acted as rapid (within minutes) messengers, priming antiviral type I IFN production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our findings point at a previously unrecognized role for lymphocytes in antimicrobial defense, utilizing mtDNA webs as signals in synergy with cytokines and natural antibodies, and cast light on the interplay between mitochondria and the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

B_Lymphocytes_Release_Extracellular_DNA_Webs_After_Sensing_GC-Rich_Oligonucleotides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural antibodies recognizing modified epitopes on proteins, lipids, and DNA are produced by innate B1-like B cells and by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA released into circulation is a potentially harmful DAMP, and its removal is essential to avoid autoimmune reactions (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the process of studying binding of natural autoantibodies derived from CLL B cells (26, 27) to NET structures, we observed that these CLL B cells not only produced antibodies to NETs, but also could release ET-like structures themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This finding prompted us to search for potential inducers of B-cell ETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, in a panel of 18 known NET inducers and B-cell activators (Fig 1 and SI Materials and Methods), CpG oligonucleotide of class C (ODN 2395; hereinafter referred to as CpG-C, unless otherwise stated) was the only stimuli that induced release of ET-like structures (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These webs were sensitive to DNase treatment, implicating DNA content (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untreated cells or CpG-C treatment of isolated cell supernatants, in which cells were removed by centrifugation, did not generate these fibrous DNA structures (Fig 1 E and F and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These B-cell DNA webs were flexible and fragile, that is, sensitive to paraformaldehyde fixation, compared with PMA-induced NETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, onward analyses of B-cell DNA webs were performed by live-cell fluorescence microscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Released DNA isolated from cell culture media revealed a distinct large-sized DNA fragment exclusively found in CpG-Cexposed cultures as analyzed in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expanded the analysis to a panel of CD5+/CD19+ leukemic B-cell samples isolated from 14 treatment-naive CLL patients, as well as to six CD19+/CD20+ and two B1-like CD5+/CD19+ B-cell samples from healthy blood donors and found all to produce DNA webs in response to CpG-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, DNA release was not restricted to leukemic B cells or B1-like B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In expanded analyses to other PBMC subpopulations, we found that all tested cells (B cells, T cells, NK cells, and monocytes) released DNA webs in response to CpG-C (Fig 1H and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, neutrophils also released CpG-Cinduced DNA webs that appeared different from PMA-induced NETs (Fig 1 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the electrophoretic migration pattern of CpG-Cinduced DNA webs in agarose gels was compared with PMA-induced NETs and found to be markedly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA released upon CpG-C treatment migrated as a uniform-sized fragment, while PMA-induced NETs consisted of large-sized DNA with strongly retarded gel entry, implicating a different and larger structural composition (Fig 1K, lanes 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin did not prevent CpG-Cstimulated neutrophils from releasing DNA webs, whereas PMA-induced NETs were abolished, indicating a different release mechanism (Fig 1K, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether nonimmune cells could generate webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CpG-C did not trigger web release from primary foreskin fibroblasts, HepG2 liver carcinoma epithelial cells, and HEK 293 embryonic kidney epithelial cells (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we decided to study the DNA release from B cells in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Released_B-Cell_Webs_Are_of_mtDNA_Origin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA sequencing of the characteristic fragment observed in Fig 1G disclosed high abundance of mtDNA, a finding that was verified by PCR using primers specific for mitochondrial or nuclear DNA (Fig 2A and Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent size of the released mtDNA was, however, significantly larger than expected for mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of released DNA by removal of cell culture media components, changed the apparent size to that of purified mtDNA (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reverse-step experiment was performed in which purified mtDNA was added to cell culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in a retarded migration and an apparent size similar to that of uncleaned webs (Fig 2B), suggesting that presence of cell culture media affects mtDNA mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that DNA migration was hampered by presence of SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, PCR analysis of DNA isolated from collected supernatant, using nuclear DNA-specific primers, did not show presence of any nuclear DNA (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mtDNA could be amplified in less_than1% of the sample (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous release of mtDNA fragments has been previously reported (28), and we also observed that mtDNA was amplified in untreated samples, albeit to a significantly lower extent (mean ratio of CpG-C treated/untreated, 2.0; SD, Â±0.4; P less_than 0.005; n = 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since no large-size DNA was observed in supernatants of untreated cells (Fig 1G), our results show that CpG-C specifically induce release of webs consisting of full-size mtDNA rather than fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copy number analysis of DNA remaining in cells after CpG-C treatment, using droplet digital PCR, did however not reveal any significant change in mtDNA copy number compared with untreated cells (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing concentrations of CpG-C resulted in dose-dependent release of mtDNA from B cells (Fig 2E and Fig S2E), and kinetic analysis revealed increase of mtDNA webs within cell supernatants over time (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, CpG-C was localized rapidly in the cells (Fig S2F) but appeared not to align with the released mtDNA as analyzed with FITC-labeled CpG-C (Fig S2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mtDNA_Web_Casting_in_B_Cells_Is_Uncoupled_from_Cytokine_Release  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CpG-ODNs are known ligands of TLR9, but interestingly CpG recognition by TLR9 differs between immune cells depending on the ODN class (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These classes differ both in the primary and secondary structure (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells are known to release cytokines in response to ODNs of B and C classes (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we only found CpG of the C class to induce mtDNA-web ejection from B cells, we wanted to analyze the involvement of TLR9 in this event further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secretion of different cytokines, IL-10, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-2, and TNF (Fig 3B and Fig S3 AD), after stimulation of CLL B cells with CpG-A, CpG-B, and CpG-C for 6 h, was compared with mtDNA web release data described in Fig 1G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpG-A neither generated IL-10 nor webs, whereas both CpG-B and CpG-C provoked IL-10 secretion, but remarkably only CpG-C induced mtDNA webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative controls of TLR9 pathway signaling, ODNs lacking the CpG structural motif (non-CpG; e.g., GpC-B and GpC-C), did not induce IL-10 secretion compared with untreated cells (Fig 3B), indicating the importance of the CpG-structural motif for cytokine production via TLR9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroquine, an inhibitor of TLR9 signaling, abolished IL-10 secretion from CpG-B and CpG-Cstimulated cells, verifying TLR9 pathway block (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, chloroquine did not compromise CpG-Cinduced mtDNA release (Fig 3C), suggesting an endosomal TLR9-independent pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mtDNA_Webs_Are_Induced_in_a_TLR9-Independent_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation that CpG-B induced TLR9-dependent cytokine secretion, but not mtDNA web release, prompted us to carefully analyze different CpG ODN classes for the ability to induce mtDNA webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of released webs from CLL B cells treated with 1.25 Âµg/mL (180 nM) CpG-C for 2 h was used as a reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLL B cells were also treated at 180 or 360 nM with CpG-A, CpG-B, GpC-C, and the inhibitory ODN TTAGGG (A151) known to block CpG signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the nonCpG-C control, GpC-C, induced mtDNA release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3D and Fig S3D), emphasizing that the CpG-motif per se is not crucial for mtDNA web release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No web release was observed for CpG-A, CpG-B, and A151, as shown by gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence (Fig 3D and Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since only C-class ODNs were found to stimulate webs, two additional C-class ODNs (ODN D-SL03 and ODN M362) as well as a P-class ODN (ODN 21798) were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-class ODN 21798 is similar to the CpG-C ODN 2395 used in our previous experiments, but holds an extra CpG motif and one additional stem-loop motif (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ODN D-SL03 and ODN 21798 induced web release, while no or very low amounts of webs could be observed after stimulation by ODN M362 (Fig S3 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ODN sequences and secondary structures (Fig 3A and Fig S3F) indicate a common GC-rich stem-loop motif at the 3 end for the stimulating ODNs, reminiscent of certain viral G-rich Y-form DNA motifs (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combination of ODNs of the other classes with CpG-C did not reduce web release compared with stimulation by CpG-C alone (Fig S3J), indicating that CpG-C targets a unique sensor to which no competitive binding of CpG-A, CpG-B, nor A151 occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A TLR9-independent pathway is further supported by the finding that additional inhibitors of TLR9 signaling, rolipram and wortmannin (31, 32), also did not prevent the release of mtDNA upon CpG-C treatment (Table 1 and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to endosomal expression, B cells express TLR9 on the plasma membrane (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed no inhibitory (or stimulatory) effect of B-cell DNA web formation in the presence of anti-TLR9 antibodies (Fig S4A), despite the fact that both CpG-C and the TLR9 antibody did bind to cell surface (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that B cells and T cells produced mtDNA webs at similar levels (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TLR9 is known to be expressed at higher levels in B cells (10) and immunoblotting using a TLR9-specific antibody revealed much less TLR9 in T cells and neutrophils compared with B cells (Fig 3E), also suggesting a TLR9-independent mechanism of web release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B-Cell_Webs_Induce_Release_of_Type_I_IFN_from_PBMCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mtDNA has been reported to act as a DAMP molecule with interferogenic and proinflammatory properties, we wanted to examine whether B-cell mtDNA webs also could elicit a similar response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Webs from GpC-Ctreated CLL B cells were collected and incubated with PBMCs (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBMCs exposed to webs for 16 h released significant amounts of type I IFN (IFN-) (P less_than 0.005; Fig 4A) but not IL-1 (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, B-cell supernatants devoid of webs (i.e., supernatants from CLL cells not exposed to GpC-C; untreated) could not induce IFN- secretion (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, DNase treatment of webs amplified the IFN- production (P less_than 0.0005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the characteristic web fragment in agarose gels could not be observed after DNase treatment, the gene for mitochondrial cytochrome b could still be amplified by PCR (Fig S5 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNase digest DNA into oligonucleotides and mononucleotides, and obviously these smaller web fragments were more interferogenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GpC-C control induced detectable IFN- secretion but to a significantly lower extent than webs (webs vs. GpC-C control, P less_than 0.05), most likely due to GpC-C retention in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GpC-C is not known to induce IFN- by itself, but as GpC-C stimulate PBMCs to release webs, GpC-C contamination within the web sample could contribute to the observed IFN- (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant of GpC-Cexposed CLL B cells used for PBMC stimulation contained no IFN- (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mtDNA_Web_Casting_Is_Inhibited_by_Zn2+_and_Hypothermia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Potential mechanisms behind B-cell mtDNA web release were investigated by intervening cellular pathways with appropriate inhibitors (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we analyzed their capacity of inhibiting PMA-induced NETs in parallel (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are presented in Fig 3F and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, although several inhibitors effectively inhibited NET release, only treatment with ZnCl2 prevented CpG-Cinduced B-cell webs (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, cell viability was not compromised by ZnCl2 (Fig S4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothermia (+4 Â°C) showed similar inhibition of web formation (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mode of action of inhibitors along with affected pathways is illustrated in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To summarize, we found no effect on web release by blocking BCR, TLR9, cGAS/STING, and AIM2 inflammasome signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, autophagy), ROS formation, and endocytosis were also ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclosporin A, previously reported to inhibit release of mtDNA fragments (28), did not affect web release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although hypothermia and zinc sensitivity specify active biological processes, both treatments intervene with multiple cellular processes and insight in mechanistic details of mtDNA web casting renders further studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mtDNA_Web_Casting_Is_Not_Accompanied_by_ROS_Reactive_Nitrogen_Species_nor_Cell_Death  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inhibitors and scavengers of ROS had no effect on mtDNA release (Table 1), which argues for a ROS-independent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this, various reactive species, that is, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxy radicals, were probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, neither CLL B cells nor neutrophils were found to increase ROS/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) after CpG-C stimulation (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as expected, high ROS levels were observed in PMA-stimulated neutrophils, used as a positive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of mitochondrial superoxide was analyzed using MitoSOX Red, which specifically targets mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No production of mitochondrial superoxide was observed in CpG-Cstimulated cells, while PMA induced an intense formation of superoxide in neutrophils (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
mtDNA web release could not be blocked by inhibitors of cell death (Q-VD-OPh, necrostatin-1, and wortmannin; Table 1 and Fig S4A), and analysis of necrosis revealed no effect after CpG-C exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in clear contrast to PMA treatment of neutrophils, which had a potent cytotoxic effect (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring cell viability and apoptosis within the same sample did not reveal any effect on cell viability upon CpG-C treatment (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant variations in caspase 3/7 activity were observed, in contrast to staurosporine-exposed cells that had a high caspase 3/7 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, active metabolism was not affected by CpG-C compared with untreated cells, while metabolism in staurosporine-exposed cells was hampered (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, cellular ATP levels were not compromised compared with untreated and CpG-Btreated cells, suggesting no mitochondrial dysfunction (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by antimycin A or rotenone did, however, completely abolish ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B-Cell_Webs_Are_Devoid_of_Bactericidal_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that the fragile nature of released mtDNA may preclude isolation of mtDNA web-associated proteins using methods previously described for NET protein isolation (34), we developed an extracellular DNA isolation method taking advantage of the interaction between DNA and silicate glass beads (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allowed identification of the majority of the PMA-induced NET-associated proteins previously described (34), including several bactericidal proteins (Table S1), thus verifying the reliability of our method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed isolated webs from 10 CpG-Ctreated CLL B-cell cultures and 10 control samples [e.g., untreated (n = 7) and CpG-A treated (n = 3)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the proteins associated with NETs could be found within B-cell mtDNA webs (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins presented in Dataset S1 represent those proteins that were found to differ in spectral counts by a factor of  greater than 1.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the samples overall contained very small amounts of proteins, and some of the identified proteins should possibly be regarded as contaminants (e.g., keratin and complement C4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the webs are clearly devoid of proteins with antimicrobial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of antibacterial proteins in the webs underline the difference to NETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibacterial properties of NETs and mtDNA webs were also tested on Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Released B-cell webs were incubated with E. coli DH5 and found not to compromise the number of colony-forming bacteria (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that B-cell mtDNA webs are unique and differ from previously reported NETs of nuclear DNA or mtDNA origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM regulates the degree of mtDNA packing into nucleoids (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mass spectrometry did not reveal any TFAM associated with the webs, we made a more dedicated analysis of TFAM using immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not detect any TFAM in the extracellular fraction (cell supernatant-containing webs) measured after 4 h of CpG-C treatment, indicating low, if any, amounts of TFAM to be released along with the webs (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed an intense increase of intracellular TFAM levels in CpG-Cexposed cells compared with untreated cells (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CpG-C treatment and/or loss of mtDNA stimulate the cell to increase the levels of TFAM, which have a strong impact on mitochondria biogenesis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physiological importance of cell-free circulating mtDNA as a pathogenic factor and DAMP molecule in inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity, cancer, trauma, and bacterial and viral infections, is extensively reviewed in recent publications (3, 7, 24, 3740).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report on a previously unrecognized feature of human immune cells: B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils release interferogenic mtDNA webs extracellularly upon exposure to short CpG and non-CpG ODNs of class C. Previously described NET stimuli, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or PMA, did not generate mtDNA webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Webs were rapidly released from viable cells, independently of ROS, and were devoid of proteins that trap and kill bacteria, such as granule proteins observed in NETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the inducing stimuli and effector cell function, our results suggest that lymphocytes utilize mtDNA webs as rapid extracellular messenger molecules and provide alternative roles for mtDNA in antimicrobial signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Derived from a bacterial ancestor, mitochondria share many features with bacteria, including a circular DNA genome with unmethylated CpG motifs (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the innate immune system recognizes conserved bacterial molecules, mitochondrial constituents are similarly immunogenic (38, 40, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously reported that proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines are produced by activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells in response to unmethylated CpG-containing DAMP motifs (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  West and Shadel (40) discuss that unique aspects of mtDNA, such as its length, conformation, sequence, and degree of oxidation, govern its differential agonist activities, which may explain why mtDNA release does not uniformly activate both proinflammatory and type I IFN responses (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In accordance, we found that the lymphocyte-derived mtDNA webs effectively primed type I IFN production in PBMCs and that enzymatic cleavages of webs into shorter lengths amplified type I IFN response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding underlines the interferogenic characteristics of mtDNA previously reported by others (5, 6, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, mtDNA is recognized by more than one immune signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) found that mtDNA, released into circulation after injury, activated neutrophils and caused inflammatory responses via TLR9, White et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5), Rongvaux et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6), and West et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) showed that mtDNA escaping mitochondria during apoptosis or herpes simplex virus 1 exposure, engaged the cGAS/STING signaling pathway to induce type I IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, oxidized mtDNA binds to, and activates, the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to production of IL-1 (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA also promotes neutrophil adhesion and, noteworthy, acts as a potent inducer of NETs that further raise the inflammatory pressure (3, 20, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  West et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) highlight the role of mtDNA as a participant in cell-intrinsic triggering of innate immune responses and antiviral signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, based on these observations, studies by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7), and our findings, we propose that mtDNA also acts as an extrinsic trigger of innate immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
mtDNA is highly susceptible to oxidation, and oxidized mtDNA is enriched in NETs from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or IFN-primed healthy neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oxidized mtDNA induce mRNA expression and secretion of type I IFN, TNF, and IL-6 (24, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autoimmune conditions, besides SLE, increased oxidized mtDNA was found in synovial fluids and plasma of rheumatoid arthritis (45), and in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pivotal study by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) showed that circulating mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides and DNA are causing inflammation in response to injury, advocating that the release is a key link between trauma, inflammation, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated levels of circulating mtDNA in plasma have also been found in patients during HIV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of mtDNA did not correlate with number of T cells nor with markers of immune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant correlation was, however, observed with plasma virus load, potentially contributing to the chronic inflammatory state observed in the disease (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial infections, for example, by Streptococcus pneumoniae, increase mtDNA in circulation via TLR9 in acute kidney injury patients (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased mtDNA plasma levels are also observed in cardiovascular conditions, in diseases of aging, and in malignancies (38, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our initial observations on mtDNA release were seen in B lymphocytes derived from CLL patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were recently shown to have significantly increased mtDNA copy number (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, circulating DNA constitute a potential risk for autoantibody induction if not rapidly cleared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presence of anti-DNA autoantibodies in CLL and SLE (25) underlines the importance of further studies in understanding the impact of mtDNA in the pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, it was reported that fragments of mtDNA escaped from mitochondria into the cytosol by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a release that could be blocked by cyclosporin A (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found that CpG-C stimulated release of full-size mtDNA (e.g., not as fragments) and that discharge was insensitive to cyclosporin A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mtDNA was ejected, cell viability, mtDNA copy number, and mitochondrial ATP levels seemed uncompromised in the B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondria holds more copies of mtDNA than required to sustain oxidative phosphorylation, implicating additional roles for mtDNA, possibly related to mitochondrial signaling and immune functions, as suggested (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High TFAM levels have been shown to correlate with increased mtDNA copy number (35, 4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we observed unaltered mtDNA copy number along with intense increase of TFAM levels upon CpG-C treatment, it is possible that mitochondria are compensating for the release by mtDNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, our results suggest that release is an active process and not a result of cell damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are also supported by the fact that apoptotic pathways, as a rule, do not generate IFN production, whereas we found that CpG-C and GpC-C generated type I IFN production via the release of mtDNA webs, reminiscent of viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, White and Kile (52) also noted that virally induced mtDNA stress, causing release of mtDNA into the cytosol, is distinct from apoptotic mtDNA release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may suggest that the GC-rich stem-loop ODNs used in our study are recognized in a pathway that induces mtDNA stress in analogy to certain viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite recent observations, the mechanism of mtDNA release is still to be clarified, as pointed out recently by West and Shadel (40) and others (4, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not known how the two levels of mtDNA discharge, first into cytosol then into extracellular space, are regulated (3), but cellular stress is discussed as a primary factor for liberation of mitochondrial DAMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral infection priming mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-signalosome located on the outer mitochondrial membrane is probably one of these potent stressors as discussed in detail by Jin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another mechanism was proposed by Caielli et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (44) who suggested that release of mtDNA requires fusion of mitochondrial membranes with plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis has, however, yet to be proven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We speculate that only mitochondria that replicate or transcribe their DNA at the time of CpG-C exposure can eject their DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA is not associated with histones, but organized into compact DNAprotein complexes, nucleoids, which are composed of proteins for mtDNA packaging as well as transcription and replication factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TFAM plays a key role in the packing of mtDNA into nucleoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low levels of TFAM generate a loosely packed nucleoid, while high levels result in a compact state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription of mtDNA occurs when the nucleoid is loose and elongated, while it is inhibited in the compact state (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both our mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analyses showed no concomitant TFAM release along with webs, this implicates that the level of TFAM physically associated with the mtDNA to be released is lowreminiscent of the loose and elongated nucleoid observed during transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What are the features of the ODNs used in this study?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that webs were released independently of TLR9 was surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is puzzling why three C-class CpG ODNs, both CpG and non-CpG, as well as P-class ODN 21798 generate intense mtDNA web release but not A- and B-classes nor C-class ODN M362.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CpG-motifs are required for cytokine release via TLR9 (53), the CpG motifs are apparently redundant for mtDNA web release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One similarity between web-stimulating ODNs is the predicted GC-rich stem-loop structure present at the 3, not found in CpG-A, CpG-B, A151, nor ODN M362 (Fig 4A and Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this 3 duplex formation is needed for recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Herzner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) revealed that unique G-rich stem-loop structures, named Y-form DNA, present in endogenous retroviruses and HIV-1, trigger innate cGAS-dependent responses and type I IFN production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GC-rich structures used in our study contain unpaired guanosines in the closed loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures are not identical but are reminiscent of the short G-rich viral ODNs in Herzner et al.s study, in which unpaired guanosines are flanking the dsDNA stems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find that the ODNs in our study are devoid of cGAS/STING-stimulatory activity; GpC-C did not induce IFN production and the cGAS/STING inhibitor quinacrine could not inhibit web release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, albeit the initial signaling routes are distinct, the final outcome in terms of antiviral IFN production, as triggered by webs in our study, is comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zinc and hypothermia treatments were the only conditions found to prevent liberation of mtDNA webs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both treatments affect several cellular processes, clues regarding the release mechanism are limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc is predicted to bind 3,000 human proteins (54), and zinc treatment severely impeded mitochondrial functions (i.e., altered metabolism and less ATP production) by inhibiting several mitochondrial enzymes (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc has also been shown to impair the nucleotide binding ability of a viral-RNA binding protein associated with regulation of MAVS antiviral signaling (56, 57), implicating that zinc similarly may affect recognition of CpG-C and GpC-C by certain DNA sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The web-triggering ODN structures used in the present study render further detailed examination including identification of nucleic acid origin (be it modified self-DNA, viral or bacterial DNA) of the stimulating GC-rich ligand and its receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results contribute to an understanding that the immune system may utilize many different cell populations, a variety of inducing stimuli, and release of mtDNA with discrete compositions/structures to signal danger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA functions and interactions are still to be explored concerning mode of release and role in antiviral regulation, which are important aspects for understanding mitochondrial interactions with the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our findings that B cells, T cells, and NK cells, as well as monocytes and neutrophils, release mtDNA webs extracellularly in response to certain short GC-rich ODNs, highlight the role of mtDNA as a rapid extrinsic antiviral messenger molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings accentuate the importance of lymphocyte-derived mtDNA DAMPs in innate immune signaling and should be taken into account when examining the excessive type I IFN production seen in different autoinflammatory diseases and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
