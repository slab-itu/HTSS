Nouns slow down speech across structurally and culturally diverse languages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we speak, we unconsciously pronounce some words more slowly than others and sometimes pause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such slowdown effects provide key evidence for human cognitive processes, reflecting increased planning load in speech production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study naturalistic speech from linguistically and culturally diverse populations from around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show a robust tendency for slower speech before nouns as compared with verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though verbs may be more complex than nouns, nouns thus appear to require more planning, probably due to the new information they usually represent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding points to strong universals in how humans process language and manage referential information when communicating linguistically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By force of nature, every bit of spoken language is produced at a particular speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this speed is not constantspeakers regularly speed up and slow down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in speech rate is influenced by a complex combination of factors, including the frequency and predictability of words, their information status, and their position within an utterance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use speech rate as an index of word-planning effort and focus on the time window during which speakers prepare the production of words from the two major lexical classes, nouns and verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, when naturalistic speech is sampled from languages all over the world, there is a robust cross-linguistic tendency for slower speech before nouns compared with verbs, both in terms of slower articulation and more pauses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this slowdown effect to the increased amount of planning that nouns require compared with verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike verbs, nouns can typically only be used when they represent new or unexpected information; otherwise, they have to be replaced by pronouns or be omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions on noun use appear to outweigh potential advantages stemming from differences in internal complexity between nouns and verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that, beneath the staggering diversity of grammatical structures and cultural settings, there are robust universals of language processing that are intimately tied to how speakers manage referential information when they communicate with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results are summarized in the effect displays in Fig 3, showing that all nine languages exhibit a significant slowdown before nouns compared with verbs with respect to at least one of our two ways of measuring slowdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one language (English) exhibits a significant slowdown before verbs, and only when measured in terms of pause probability (see SI Appendix, Supplementary Text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall tendency for slowdown before nouns is striking because the culturally and linguistically vastly diverse populations in our sample display remarkable differences in many respects; for example, in overall speed and the range of variation (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Hoock speakers articulate more slowly and pause more often in the context of both nouns and verbs than Dutch speakers do.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Language or culture-specific facts may also mask the observed effect in individual studies for individual languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Nng words are so short (on average 4.61 segments per word) that there is little room for differences in articulation rate within words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have presently no explanation for the exceptional behavior of English regarding pauses, except for speculating that English noun planning might be easier because the gap option (as opposed to the pronoun option) is far less common than in the other languages, reducing choice efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that our English corpus is based on telephone rather than face-to-face interactions, but evidence so far suggests that speakers are not strongly influenced by the visual presence of listeners in reference production (9, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whatever the reason, this result highlights the need for a diverse sample, such as that represented here, including languages other than English, which has been found to be exceptional in other studies also (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall results, based on models with data from all nine languages taken together, show that, across our diverse sample, the slowdown effect before nouns prevails: Regarding articulation, the effect is small but robust, causing around 3.5% slower articulation rate before nouns than before verbs, despite strong variation overall and a few exceptions found in specific utterance positions in individual languages (see SI Appendix, Supplementary Text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding pauses, across all nine languages, the probability of pauses before nouns is about 60% greater than before verbs, and, in the majority of languages, the odds of pauses before nouns are about twice as high than before verbs (see SI Appendix, Supplementary Text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other factors, the effect of word class is also surprisingly strong: In statistical models of all our data taken together, this effect is about two times stronger than the effect of a target words length and more than eight times stronger than the effect of its position within the utterance (SI Appendix, Tables S9, S20, S33, and S44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results from naturalistic speech contradict experimental studies showing faster planning of nouns (18, 19) and thus suggest that the effect of referential information management overrides potential effects of higher processing costs of verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these results resonate with earlier findings of cross-linguistic parallels in the timing of turn taking (5, 41) and point to strong universals of language processing that are grounded in how humans manage information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But our present findings indicate that speech rate variation is universally constrained also at a fine-grained level, within turns and depending on which kinds of content words are used: Pragmatic principles of noun use and the slowdown associated with new information converge to create a uniform pattern of speech rate variation across diverse languages and cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding has several implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, models of language processing need to more systematically incorporate aspects of information management in interactive speech (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, while speech rate in corpora is mostly studied in terms of the articulation of a word, speech rate variation before words of different types is a measure with great potential to gain insights into the mechanisms of language production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, naturalistic corpus studies on widely diverse languages allow detection of signals that do not suffer from the sampling bias in much of current theorizing about language and speech (33, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most such work is still largely based on educated speakers of a small number of mostly Western European languages, and it remains unclear whether findings generalize beyond this (40, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, by revealing patterns linked to specific word classes, our finding opens avenues for explaining how grammars are shaped through the long-term effects of fast pronunciation, such as phonological reduction (47) and the emergence of grammatical markers (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, slower speech and more pauses before nouns entail a lower likelihood of contraction of independent words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the fact that cross-linguistically fewer function words become fused as prefixes to nouns than as prefixes to verbs, a fact so far little understood (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corpus_Characteristics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data were collected, transcribed, and annotated by experts during on-site fieldwork on the languages (see Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptions in the language documentation corpora use established orthographies or orthographies developed during fieldwork and in consultation with native speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these orthographies are fairly shallow by generally applying one-to-one mappings of phonological segments to orthographic characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analyses, we used these orthographic characters as proxies for phonological segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is furthermore justified by the fact that correlations between word length in orthographic characters and word length in phonological segments are extremely high, even for languages with relatively deep orthographies, such as English and Dutch (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we control for multicharacter representations, such as English less_thansh - // or Dutch less_thanoe - /u/ in the models below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were manually time-aligned during transcription at the level of annotation units (such as in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annotation units correspond to turn construction units as analyzed in conversation analysis (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are stretches of speech, which are intonationally, grammatically, and pragmatically complete and may comprise an entire turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The end of such units marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker or the present speaker may continue with another such unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our largely monological corpora, the end of such units is often characterized by minimal feedback from the listener.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They represent easily recognizable major discourse boundaries (32) rather than potentially more controversial minor boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain accurate timing information for the beginning and end of words and pauses, we applied semiautomatic segment-level time alignment (51, 52), followed by manual corrections (the English and Dutch corpora already included word-level time alignment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the identification of pauses, we set a minimum of 150 ms because most silent intervals in natural speech shorter than this correspond to articulatory pauses; for example, before stop consonants, as previous studies have shown (5355).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Algorithm_for_Determining_Preword_Windows  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the term preword window for the immediate context before individual (target) words in which we measured speech rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the time frame known to be relevant for word planning (31), we chose a preword window size of 500 ms; that is, relatively local windows containing at most a few (context) words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We only consider preword windows occurring within utterances (i.e., annotation units, as in Fig 2) and exclude windows at the beginning of utterances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ensures that changes in articulation rate and pauses can be attributed to the target word and not to phenomena occurring outside of utterances; for example, to turn-taking constraints, parallel nonlinguistic activities, conceptual planning of an utterance as a whole, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If there is silence within an annotation unit at 500 ms before the onset of the target word, the preword window is exactly 500 ms long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of preword windows is adjusted when there are context words that are only partially included in the 500-ms window because we consider articulation rate information from whole words, not parts of words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which of these context words should be included in the preword window, we define a words midpoint as (word start time + word end time)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a context words midpoint occurs within a 500-ms preword window before the target word, the whole word is included in this preword window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this words start time is outside the 500-ms preword window, the preword window size is enlarged to include the whole context word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such cases, the preword window is slightly larger than 500 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the midpoint of a context word preceding the target word is outside the 500-ms window but its endpoint is within the 500-ms window, this context word is not counted as part of the preword window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the start time of the preword window is set to the end time of this excluded context word, and the window is shortened.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preword window in such cases may still contain pauses as well as words of which the midpoints fall inside the 500-ms interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 illustrates both shortened and enlarged context windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A preword window can also be shortened if the target word occurs near the beginning of the annotation unit since we do not consider pauses between annotation units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a target word has only one or two words before it, it can be the case that the 500-ms window extends to before the first word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such cases, the preword window start time is set to the start time of the first word, and the length of the preword window is shortened accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean length of preword windows is 456 ms (SD 164 ms) and thus slightly shorter than 500 ms, but roughly comparable for all languages (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our algorithm of defining preword windows resulted in variably sized windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, window length does not systematically covary with parts of speech (SI Appendix, Table S3), and this justifies averaging the length per window when computing articulation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We also considered explicitly modeling the window length variation, but the truncations induced by our algorithm would have necessitated overly complex and nonstandard models, which were, moreover, not equally applicable to the analysis of articulation rate and the analysis of pause probability.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Verbs_and_Auxiliaries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some languages, like English, distinguish a category of functional verbal elements (auxiliaries, AUX) from ordinary content verbs (V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded all known auxiliaries from the analysis reported here, in line with our semantically based identification of verbs (see main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exclusion is based on the preexisting word class annotation of auxiliaries in our subcorpora of English, Even, Hoock, and Texistepec.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The languages Baure, Bora, Chintang, and Nng do not have any auxiliaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, auxiliaries are not annotated differently from content verbs in the corpus we used for Dutch, despite the strong similarity with English.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make sure that excluding auxiliaries in some languages but not others did not lead to spurious differences between languages, we also carried out alternative analyses in which all verbal target words, including auxiliaries, were included in the category of verbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these alternative analyses are summarized in SI Appendix, Supplementary Text and fully converge with the results in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses_of_Articulation_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the analyses of articulation rate, we discarded all preword windows that contained disfluencies (filled pauses such as uh or um or false starts) or only consisted of a silent pause (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both studies of articulation rate, the dependent variable was the articulation rate in a given preword window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Articulation rate was calculated as the number of characters in the preword window divided by the length of the preword window in seconds (excluding silence between words).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Tables S6 and S7 provide detailed descriptive statistics on articulation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main predictor in our models was the word class of the target word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Language-specific word class tags were converted to a common set of categories across all nine corpora: N[oun], V[erb], AUX[iliary], and OTHER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analyses, we only kept target words of the categories N, V, and AUX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also excluded compound words containing both a nominal (N) and a verbal root (V or AUX) (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for potential utterance-final slowdown of the articulation rate, we included the position of the target word in the utterance as a covariate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized the position by the length of the utterance so that it ranged from 0 (first word in the utterance) to 1 (last word in the utterance) (see Fig 2 for an illustration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized position of the ith word (counting from 1) in an utterance containing n words is defined as (i  1)/(n  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In preliminary studies, we found that longer words tended to exhibit a higher articulation rate than shorter words, consistent with earlier observations that syllable durations shrink as their number increases within a word (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we also included the length of the target word as a covariate in our models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We z-normalized word length per language by subtracting from each words length (approximated by the number of characters in it) the mean length of word tokens in the respective corpus and by dividing the result by the SD of word token length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure accounts for differences in phonological inventories (clicks, for example, exist only in Nng), as well as for different orthographic conventions, like the use of multicharacter representations of segments, as in English less_thansh - // or Dutch less_thanoe - /u/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the cross-linguistic stability of effects on articulation rate, we also included the factor language (coding the nine different subcorpora: Baure, Bora, Chintang, Dutch, English, Even, Hoock, Nng, and Texistepec) in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to these fixed factors, we included several random factors in our models as controls: (i) the speaker of the utterance, (ii) the text/recording in which the utterance occurred, and (iii) the specific word type of the target word (defined as a specific word form with a specific morphemic structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included word type to model differences between individual target words, such as their meaning associations, polarity, emotional values, their complexity, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The word type factor also captures the effect of a words frequency on preceding pauses and articulation rate (12) since a crucial property of a word form is its frequency and thereby the extent to which a speaker is familiar with it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for dealing with frequency and familiarity in this manner, rather than using frequency counts for each word form, lies in the nature of the language documentation corpora used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for Chintang, Dutch, English, and Even, our corpora effectively represent the entirety of text material available for a given language in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that frequency counts can only be obtained from the relatively small corpora under investigation themselves, and such counts would not reflect the accumulated experience of a speaker, thus invalidating estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the statistical models of articulation rate, we used linear mixed-effects regression models (57), as implemented in the lmer function provided by R package lme4 (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model comparison with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and (two-sided) likelihood ratio tests revealed a significant interaction between word class and language (SI Appendix, Tables S8 and S9), and so we created models for the individual languages based on the structure of the best-fitting cross-linguistic model (SI Appendix, Tables S10S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This choice ensures the comparability of the language-specific models in terms of the magnitude and direction of the observed word class effects in the different languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We additionally confirmed that results did not change substantially when models for individual languages were further reduced in complexity by additional model comparisons within each language.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P values in SI Appendix, Table S9 are based on likelihood ratio tests that compare the final model to alternative models where the relevant factor was dropped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control the false discovery rate (FDR), we also adjusted P values based on the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method (60), using Rs p.adjust function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect plots in Fig 3A were produced using the effect function from the R library effects (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They show significance based on adjusted P values (BH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models based on an alternative dataset that included the known auxiliaries of English, Even, Hoock and Texistepec in the category of verbs (SI Appendix, Tables S19S24) followed exactly the same procedure as the main study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better assess effect sizes, we furthermore calculated the predicted articulation rate difference between nouns and verbs, distinguishing between positions at the beginning and at the end of utterances (SI Appendix, Table S25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Pause_Probability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the probability that a preword window before a noun versus before a verb contained at least one silent and/or filled pause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore also included preword windows that contain only pauses as well as preword windows that contain a disfluency, such as a filled pause (hesitation) or a false start (SI Appendix, Tables S26 and S27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in the articulation rate study, our main analysis excluded auxiliaries from verbs while an additional alternative analysis included auxiliaries as verbs in corpora where auxiliaries were identified as such (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text and Tables S43S48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a Boolean variable to code the existence of a (silent or filled) pause in a given preword context window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined silent pauses as periods of silence between two words (uttered by the same speaker as part of one utterance) that were at least 150 ms long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Tables S28S31 give descriptive statistics on pause probability, as well as confidence intervals estimated with an exact binomial method (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same predictor variables and random factors as in the study on articulation rate but now with a logit link function and assuming a binomial distribution (as implemented in the glmer function in the lme4 package) (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model comparison with likelihood ratio tests and AIC revealed again a significant interaction between language and word class (SI Appendix, Tables S32 and S33), and so we fit models separately for each language based on the structure of the best-fitting cross-linguistic model (SI Appendix, Tables S34S42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values and effect plots (Fig 3B) were based on the same procedure as in the articulation rate study, to ensure comparability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect sizes were derived as probability ratios (relative risks) and odds ratios, both when including and excluding auxiliaries (SI Appendix, Table S49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
