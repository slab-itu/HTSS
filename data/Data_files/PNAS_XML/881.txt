Subnational mobility and consumption-based environmental accounting of US corn in animal protein and ethanol supply chains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Companies and society alike are increasingly concerned with environmental impacts across complex supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppliers engaged in upstream intermediate transactions commonly contribute over 75% of the carbon and water impacts of products ultimately consumed by users.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These impacts pose risks to downstream customer-facing companies in the form of firm image, supply disruptions, and regulatory action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Policymakers and nonprofit advocacy organizations are increasingly looking to engage actors across supply chains to encourage conservation and environmental impact reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, traceability across complex, heterogeneous supply hinders these efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide a method for estimating mobility of corn from farms through feed and fuel supply chains, making it possible to characterize the variable environmental impacts of US corn inputs into animal protein and ethanol production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corn production, and its associated inputs, is a relatively large source of greenhouse gas emissions and uses significant amounts of water and land, thus contributing to climate change, fossil fuel depletion, local air pollutants, and local water scarcity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As large consumers of this corn, corporations in the ethanol and animal protein industries are increasingly assessing and reporting sustainability impacts across their supply chains to identify, prioritize, and communicate sustainability risks and opportunities material to their operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so, many have discovered that the direct impacts of their owned operations are dwarfed by those upstream in the supply chain, requiring transparency and knowledge about environmental impacts along the supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been used to identify hotspots of environmental impacts at national levels, yet these provide little subnational information necessary for guiding firms specific supply networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, our Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model connects spatial, firm-specific demand of corn purchasers with upstream corn production in the United States through a cost minimization transport model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a means to link county-level corn production in the United States to firm-specific demand locations associated with downstream processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model substantially improves current LCA assessment efforts that are confined to broad national or state level impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In drilling down to subnational levels of environmental impacts that occur over heterogeneous areas and aggregating these landscape impacts by specific supply networks, targeted opportunities for improvements to the sustainability performance of supply chains are identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate US corn mobilityfirst as a primary commodity, then as an embedded input (e.g., upstream corn consumed in intermediate animal agriculture operations)from on-field crop production through the supply chain to primary processing (e.g., animal slaughter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We separate the supply chain into two broad stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 1 encompasses the movement of corn from the county of production to the county of direct consumption, and includes the entire supply and demand of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumption includes corn processed into ethanol and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), consumed as animal feed (corn and DDGS), exported to international markets, and processed for other uses such as in wet mills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 2 incorporates the movement of animalswith embedded corn from feedfrom animal farms and feedlots to final processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches are presented as an integrative Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model (see www.foods3.org for more information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FoodS3, as described below, includes a data accounting component, a spatially explicit environmental impact LCA, and a transportation optimization component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data accounting component estimates the supply and demand of corn at the county level in stage 1, and the supply of animals on farms at the county level and the demand for animals for each individual processing facility in stage 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LCA component estimates the environmental impacts of corn production in each county.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the transportation optimization solves the system by connecting suppliers and demanders in stages 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is a link between the processing facilities of animals and ethanol and the locations and environmental impacts of the corn supplied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Environmental_Impact_LCA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By linking the movement of corn from regions of production to downstream animal processing facilities, it is possible to characterize spatially explicit environmental impacts of animal protein supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many environmental indicators could be evaluated with this methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine GHG emissionsas CO2 equivalents (CO2e)and irrigated (blue) water consumption of corn production for each county in the continental United States, using a streamlined hotspot approach as an illustration of the methods application (4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the transaction orientation of a supply chain approach, the unit of analysis is the environmental impacts per bushel of corn produced and consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Corn_Mobility_in_the_United_States  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some corn moves a long distance, because local corn production cannot often meet local demand (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the substantial availability of agricultural data in the United States, information associated with particular commodity mobility, including corn, at subnational levels is scarce (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this deficiency, we developed a two-stage spatial cost minimization model to estimate corn mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, stage 1 estimates county-level supply networks meeting primary corn demand (ethanol, animal feed, exports, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 2 estimates embedded corn mobility associated with animal transportation from counties of production to processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model the optimal allocation in both stages 1 and 2 to minimize the systems transportation costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Costs were based on existing transport lines, using railways and roads for corn movement and roads for animal movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Corn Mobility Optimization Model has a detailed description of the transportation model.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge, no publicly available data exist that report or estimate the movement of corn from county to county.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the state level, the Freight Analysis Framework Version 4 (FAF4) produced by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has survey responses of the movement of animal feed from origin to destination (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the results of FoodS3, we compare the combined quantity of corn and DDGS that we estimate are transported from state to state for use as animal feed to the survey results from FAF4 for 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FAF4 data are an imperfect comparison with our model because it includes several additional categories of feed, which may explain some of the difference in the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, corn and DDGS for animal feed travels 334 miles in FoodS3, and all animal feeds travel, on average, 285 miles in the FAF4 survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Stage 1: Corn Mobility from County of Production to County of Primary Demand includes a comparison of state-to-state movement of animal feed between FoodS3 and FAF4.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Environmental_Indicators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial variability associated with estimated GHG emissions and water use intensity of a bushel of corn produced across the United States in 2007 and 2012 is presented in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our estimates reflect variability of key hotspot fertilization (for GHG emissions) and irrigation processes (for water use and GHG emissions) currently implemented across the US corn production system as well as spatial variation in corn yield outputs, which together drive the differences in intensity estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results suggest that despite year-over-year changes in agricultural output, the underlying trends associated with production, consumption, and environmental consequences remained relatively stable between 2007 and 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The substantial heterogeneity of corn production impacts is illustrated in Fig 2 where, for example, GHG emissions associated with a bushel of corn produced in western South Dakota is estimated to be 34 times more carbon intensive than a similar bushel of corn produced in southern Minnesota (21 kg CO2e per bushel vs. 6 kg CO2e per bushel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without estimating the subnational variation of environmental impacts, we would have only a single national estimate of GHG impacts for each bushel of corn of 9.9 kg CO2e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to spatial variation in GHG emissions, our results are also sensitive across growing years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, drought conditions in 2012, most severely impacting the central region of the United States, are reflected in the high estimates of GHG emissions per bushel of corn produced in these regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with 2007, corn yields in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, in particular, were significantly lower in 201231%, 46%, 40%, and 36% lower, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the impact intensities of a bushel of corn produced in these areas were estimated to be significantly higher in 2012 because relatively fixed inputs (e.g., fertilizer application, farm equipment emissions, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were allocated across fewer harvested bushels of corncorn yields in 2012 were a significant outlier to the trend of increasing yields over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of the spatial heterogeneity in GHG emissions per bushel is largely from the differences in yield, whereas the differences in nitrogen fertilizer type and application rate provide important, but less variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Irrigated water used in corn production also varied significantly across the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, 86% of US corn acres were not irrigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonirrigating counties are largely in the Corn Belt and east into the Ohio River Valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest users of water tend to be in the western plains region and the few corn producing counties in the West.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western Kansas and Nebraska tended to rely heavily on irrigationas high as 28 m3 per busheland Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana used very little irrigation97.5% of corn acres in these states did not use irrigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results of irrigation water intensity were much less sensitive to changes in yield from 2007 to 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was largely due to the regions most impacted by the 2012 drought tending not to have irrigation equipment installed and being therefore unable to respond to the drought by irrigating their fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GHG emissions associated with irrigation average 4% of total corn production emissions, with large variability between states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Iowa, 0.1% of total emissions are related to irrigation, whereas in Nebraska and Kansas, irrigation emissions are 14% of the total, suggesting the potential for irrigation to be a hotspot in certain production locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stage_1__Corn_Mobility_and_Environmental_Impacts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results of our stage 1 corn mobility model are presented in Fig 1 for years 2007 and 2012, showing the interstate transportation of corn and the associated environmental impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a consumption-based environmental accounting perspective, each of the states illustrated played an important role in the US corn system, in that they produced or used substantial quantities of corn and/or high-intensity corn: Iowa is a dominant state in the corn system, producing and consuming largely nonirrigated corn; Illinois and Indiana are typically high CO2e intensity producing states with significant exports; Nebraska is a high-producing, exporting state of irrigated corn; and Minnesota is a high-producing, exporting state of low CO2e intensity, nonirrigated corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Iowa was the largest producing and consuming state in the United Statesproducing 1.9 billion bushels and importing another 400 million bushels from other states in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exports to other states from Iowa are estimated at less than 2% in 2012, but were nearly 19% of production in 2007, due to stronger relative production in 2007 and greater ethanol demand in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total GHG emissions associated with Iowas production and imports were the highest in the country19 billion kg CO2e from the total quantity of corn consumed in the state in 2012whereas irrigated water use was minimal at 0.2 billion m3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Illinois were major producers of corn, but their consumption is roughly half that of Iowas, and their embedded CO2e and irrigated water varied significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2007 and 2012, these three states exported 42% of their corn production, but growing conditions significantly shifted the share of exports across yearsfor example, Illinois exported 67% of production in 2007 and 34% in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, these three states also exported a significant share of their CO2e impacts18.2 and 12.6 billion kg in 2007 and 2012, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nebraskas corn production was water intensive, using 12.1 and 10.8 billion m3 of water in 2007 and 2012exporting 32% and 25% of irrigated water use each year, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Louisianas large imports of corn across the United States were primarily for international export from the Port of South Louisiana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across the United States, we estimate that 75% of corn was consumed in the state of production for 2012, an increase from 63% in 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, corn traveled 220 miles from the county of production to the county of primary demand in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corn exported across state lines often traveled much greater distancese.g., corn exports from North Dakota traveled 1,700 miles, on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance corn traveled for imports varied substantially by state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iowas largest interstate trade partners are the neighboring corn-belt states of Illinois and Minnesota, and these imports traveled an average of only 44 miles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imports to North Carolina, however, traveled over 900 miles, primarily from Michigan and Ohio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stage_2__Embedded_Corn_Mobility_and_Supply_Chain_Impacts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For stage 2 of the model we display the results only for the 2012 data environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 illustrates the network of facilities associated with the key downstream sectors of ethanol production and animal protein processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each facility, the colored arcs display counties from which animals are estimated to be sourced, and green arcs depict where embedded corn is estimated to be sourced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As commodities are produced farther from consumption, delivered prices increase, reflecting higher transport costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the optimization, minimizing transportation costs of corn, some corn will likely travel large distancesoften shipped across the countygiven the regional differences in corn production and demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional differences in corn sourcing from the FoodS3 model, presented in Fig 3, reflect the structural spatial differences of corn supply and demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corn embedded in ethanol is relatively tightly sourced from the Midwest production regions, whereas beef supply chains tend to be more dependent on corn produced in the western plains of the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broilers are thought to be more dependent on corn production from the Southeast, and porks corn supply is dominated by Midwestern and north-central production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our FoodS3 model estimates that corn for ethanol travels, on average, 90 miles from the farm to the facility, whereas corn for animal feed traveled much longer distancescorn for pigs, cattle, and broilers travels, on average, 160, 240, and over 500 miles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minnesota, unintuitively, was the largest source of corn for broilers, despite producing less than 1% of US broilers, helping to explain the long distance corn traveled to meet broiler corn demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 2 of our model estimates the distance animals on farms or feedlots travels to processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate broilers travel the shortest distance, 48 miles, on average, whereas pigs and cattle for beef travel 115 miles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animal distances fall within the range of travel distances found in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small livestock operations (representing 40% of total US farms), the 25th to 75th percentile range for poultry (1260 miles) and pigs (25180 miles) encompass our modeled results (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 25th to 75th percentile range for cattle was below our average at 1540 miles; however, another study of 21 large feedlots found that cattle travel an average of 434 miles (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, the four sectors examined account for the majority (59%) of 2012 corn used in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After allocating the US corn embedded in DDGS, ethanol consumed 25%, pork consumed 12%, beef consumed 14%, and broilers consumed 8% of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2e emissions and irrigation water embedded in the supply chains of these four sectors accounted for 59% of corn system emissions and 68% of corn systems use of irrigation water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 provides a consumption-based accounting summary of GHG emissions and irrigation water use for each of the major downstream sectors examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GHG emissions per bushel of corn consumed are highest for the pork industry, but differences across sectors are small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the substantial variability in CO2e emissions per bushel of corn grown across counties (illustrated in Fig 2) tends to balance out when summarized at the sector level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irrigated water use at the sector level, however, varies substantially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corn for beef production is substantially more water-intensive than the other major sectorsfour and a half times greater than corn for pork production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are largely explained by beef sourcing nearly half its corn from the high-irrigating states of Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas, whereas pork sourced a majority of its corn from Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 also displays the environmental impacts of corn sourced by each company in the ethanol and animal protein sectors that consumed more than 100 million bushels of corn in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although results are based on commodity mobility simulations, and do not necessarily reflect actual sourcing locations and supply networks, the FoodS3 model can help identify locations and the related environmental impacts that are more likely to be associated with company-specific supply chains based on the heuristic of minimizing economic costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 11 largest corn-sourcing companies listed accounted for 37% of total US corn consumption in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with sector averages, GHG emission intensity of corn consumption across companies is substantialranging from as low as 8.1 kg CO2e per bushel for Flint Hills (who, we estimate, obtained 72% of their corn from the low-impact, high-yield corn in Iowa) to as high as 11.6 kg CO2e per bushel associated with Cargills corn inputs (where all three animal protein sectors were included, with their highest GHG impact from Illinois- and Kansas-sourced corn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Irrigated water use intensity also exhibited greater variability among the top companies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The least-irrigated corn was used in ethanol production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, corn estimated to be sourced by POET biorefineries consumed only 0.2 m3 of irrigated water per bushel91% below the national average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model estimated that the largest irrigation water user per bushel of corn was National Beef Packing, sourcing three quarters of their corn inputs from Kansas and Nebraska and consuming more than four times the irrigated water per bushel than the national average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Stage_1__Corn_Supply_and_Demand_Data_Accounting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The corn allocation model begins at the scale of the United States, and works to finer scale where data are available, often at the county level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal of the model was to produce spatially explicit supply and demand of corn in the United States to understand the movement of corn from suppliers to demanders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure internal consistency within the model between producers and demanders of corn, a single national dataset from the ERS of the USDA is used (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ERS feed grains database was used to account for both total supply and demand of corn in the United States, but also as a benchmark value that must be matched exactly for each category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the ERS database provides the total bushels of corn consumed as feed by pigs in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In later stages in the model we require that the sum of corn consumed by pigs in each county equals this value, as opposed to calculating corn consumption based on feed requirement at pig farms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the national numbers from ERS are paramount and supersede county- or state-level data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We feel this reduces estimation error as the model is less dependent on the assumptions in and across sources, such as animal feed requirements in different regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model allocates national totals of corn consumption based on a variety of methods and data that is described in the sections below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ERS data consists of US totals for supply and demand for corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative quantities of corn supply and demand by category are demonstrated in Fig S1 by the area of the circles, and the arrows indicate subgroups that together combine to equal the whole group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model uses data for 2007 and 2012 to be consistent with the most recently available data containing county-specific information from the COA, which is required to obtain spatially explicit supply and demand (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supply is separated into current year production, imports, and the change in carryover stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total supply of 11.1 billion bushels of corn in 2012 was matched by the total demandthe sum of demand from several categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We grouped corn demand into five categories: ethanol, feed, exports, wet mills, and other demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major focus for this analysis is corn used for ethanol production and feed for animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethanol and feed use of corn comprise 42% and 39% of total demand, respectively, totaling 81% of total corn grain use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most corn is used for ethanol and feed, it is necessary to account for the rest of the corn demand to reflect the real-world condition of competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following steps describe the process of taking the national totals from ERS and allocating them to counties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corn_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corn production data at the county level was obtained from the COA through the National Agricultural Statistics Service.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The COA censors certain data points that have too few farms or facilities in a geographic unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For corn production in 2012, 304 counties were censored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The censored counties accounted collectively for only 0.15% of US total corn production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For other data in the COA, a large share of county data is sometimes censored, as we document in the sections below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used various methods to estimate the censored data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For corn production, the censored counties are estimated from the unaccounted-for total at the state level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Colorado there are five censored counties, and the difference between the state total production and the sum of the counties with data in Colorado is 403,000 bushels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each censored county in Colorado is allocated an equal share of this quantity: 80,600 bushels (403,000/5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total supply of corn at each county is equal to production, imports, and the net change in carryover stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 2012, there were net withdrawals of corn stocks, with beginning stocks exceeding ending stocks by 170 million bushels of corn, or 1.5% of total supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the small contribution of change in stocks to total supply, and in the absence of better information, we assumed that the change in stocks in each county is proportional to production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imports accounted for 1.4% of total supply, with 37% of imports from Canada, which is assumed to enter through Chicago (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining imports are assumed to enter the Port of South Louisiana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Corn_Demand  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The national total demand for each demand category (e.g., ethanol, feed, wet mills, and exports) is allocated to counties based on the location of facilities and their corresponding ethanol and wet mill capacities, the location of livestock animal populations on corn feed, and port locations for exports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total corn demand at each county is simply the sum of demand from each category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distiller_s_Dried_Grains_and_Solubles_Supply_and_Demand  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distillers dried grains and solubles (DDGS) are important for the movement and consumption of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDGS are a significant coproduct from corn ethanol production as well as a key supplemental feed ingredient for cattle, pigs, and poultry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dry-milling operations, each bushel of corn produces 2.8 gallons of ethanol and 17 pounds of DDGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  County-level production of DDGS is calculated in the model given the location and quantity of corn consumed by dry milling ethanol facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total US DDGS production in 2012 was 34.3 million tons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was an additional 0.4 million tons of DDGS imported into the United States, which we assumed were imported at the same ports and in the same proportion as corn (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total supply of DDGS is the sum of imports and those produced at ethanol facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Demand for DDGS is separated into exports and domestic use as a feed supplement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exports accounted for 24.4% of total demand, or 8.4 million tons (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with imports, we assumed that DDGS exports were shipped from the same ports and in the same proportion as corn exports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining supplies of DDGS are consumed as feed for dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, and poultry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2011, beef cattle consumed 56.4% of DDGS for feed, dairy cattle consumed 26.9%, pigs consumed 10.2%, and poultry consumed 6.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied these same percentages to 2012 for DDGS demand for each animal type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For beef cattle, dairy cattle, and pigs, the US total DDGS demand for each animal type were allocated proportionately to the county level based on animal populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DDGS for poultry were allocated to each type of poultry according to their relative consumption of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Environmental_Impact_LCA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By linking the movement of corn from regions of production to downstream animal processing facilities, we make it is possible to characterize spatially explicit environmental impacts of animal protein supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many environmental indicators can be evaluated with this methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine GHG emissionsas CO2eand irrigated (blue) water consumption of corn production for each county in the continental United States, using a streamlined hotspot approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit of analysis is the environmental impacts per bushel of corn produced or consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GHG_Emissions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To represent total GHG emissions associated with the material and energy inputs and outputs of corn production, we use the GREET model (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GREET model represents US average corn production processes and impact factors, which are used to calculate the life cycle GHG emissions of producing a bushel of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the corn-farming stage, inputs into GREET include quantities and types of N-P-K fertilizers, lime, herbicides, insecticides, and energy sources, such as diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity, as well as the types of equipment used that consume the various fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of nitrogen fertilizers and energy for irrigated water use, we applied the default quantities and types of inputs from GREET, and assumed a yield of 150 bushels of corn per acre to understand input requirements on a per acre basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 shows the emissions inventory, separating CO2e impacts by category in the corn production process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nitrogen fertilizer inputs are treated separately because of their enormous share of GHG emissions from corn farming, accounting for 70% of total corn GHGs (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of nitrogen fertilizers emits large quantities of GHG, where each type of nitrogen fertilizer has a different emission profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the production of ammonium nitrate emits 9.3 kg CO2e per kg nitrogen, compared with 2.8 kg CO2e per kg nitrogen from the production of urea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use nitrogen fertilizer inputs parameterized for each county instead of the national average inputs in the GREET model by applying a different mix of nitrogen fertilizer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For every state, we apply a different nitrogen fertilizer application rate per acre of corn planted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
State-level nitrogen fertilizer application rates on corn were obtained from the USDA ERS Fertilizer Use and Price dataset (72), which includes the percent of corn acres that received nitrogen fertilizer (table 9 in dataset) and the rate of fertilizer application per acre that received nitrogen (table 10 in dataset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate per acre of corn multiplied by the percent of acres receiving nitrogen produces the state average nitrogen application for all fertilized corn acres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These state averages were applied to counties in each state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nitrogen fertilizer mix by county is derived from data in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NEI produced estimates of emissions at each county using data from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the NEI data, we derive quantities of nitrogen fertilizer applied in every county, separated by type of fertilizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because these estimates represent total fertilizer quantities applied across all farm acres in a county, we instead use this data to estimate only the nitrogen fertilizer mix (the share of nitrogen in a county from each fertilizer type), and use the state-level nitrogen fertilizer application rates to estimate quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method assumes that the nitrogen fertilizer mix on corn acres is the same as the mix for all crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each county, we estimate the quantity of irrigated water used per acre of corn (described in Blue Water Consumption).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We multiply this quantity of irrigated water by the GREET emission factor per cubic meter of water from electricity use in irrigation systems, to get the county specific irrigated water impacts per bushel of corn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the quantity of nitrogen fertilizer per acre, the mix between nitrogen fertilizer types for every county, the quantity of irrigated water per acre, and the default rates from GREET for all other inputs, we calculated the GHG emissions per acre of corn produced in every county.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, using county yield data for 2012, the GHG emissions per bushel of corn were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spatial distribution of GHG impacts are shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an illustration of the source of the spatial variability in impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two key factors that determine the differences in impacts by location are the mix and quantity of nitrogen fertilizer and the corn yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With both of these factors removed there would be little spatial variability and most counties would be near the mean value of 9.85 kg CO2e per bushel (bu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply each factor individually to isolate the impact of each, and show the distribution of impacts in each case in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are four distributions (weighted by the quantity of corn production in 2012) shown in Fig S2: (i) no county adjustments; (ii) adjusted by fertilizer mix and quantity only; (iii) adjusted for differences in yield only; and (iv) adjusted for both fertilizer mix and quantity and yield differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we only apply a different fertilizer mix and quantity by county but keep the corn yield the same for each county, the distribution of impacts is relatively tightly centered on the median with a 10th90th percentile range of (7.811.2) kg CO2e/bu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we apply yield adjustments to each county but assume the same mix and quantity of nitrogen fertilizers in each location, the distribution is wider with a 10th90th percentile range of (6.613.8) kg CO2e/bu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, when we adjust both the differences in nitrogen fertilizer and yield by county, the distribution is wider still with a 10th90th percentile range of (5.714.3) kg CO2e/bu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 shows that the greatest source of spatial variability in CO2e impacts per bushel is based on differences in yield, and the differences in nitrogen fertilizer type and quantity contribute to relatively less variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blue_Water_Consumption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our water analysis focuses on corn irrigation water consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use blue water irrigated hectare raster geographic information system (GIS) data and irrigated hectares of corn raster GIS data from Siebert and Doll (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ArcGIS, we summed up both datasets to county levels, providing average water consumption per irrigated hectares of harvested corn between 1998 and 2002, per county.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the COA we obtained 2012 county-level acres of corn grain irrigated, and applied the average water consumption per irrigated acres of harvested corn for 19982002 to estimate total blue water consumption of irrigated corn in 2012 for each county.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Corn_Mobility_Optimization_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We develop a two-stage spatial cost minimization model to estimate corn mobility in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, stage 1 estimates county-level supply networks meeting primary corn demand (ethanol, animal feed, exports, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 2 estimates embedded corn mobility associated with animal transportation from counties of production to processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stage_1__Corn_Mobility_from_County_of_Production_to_County_of_Primary_Demand  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A simulation model was built using the Gurobi Optimizer 6.5 for the optimal allocation to minimize the total delivered corn costs, including the corn price and transportation cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results identify the quantity of corn that moves between each pair of counties in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The county-specific unit price, Pij, of corn ($/kg) at its destination, j, from origin county, i, incorporating the cost of transportation is defined asPij=min{cR(DijR),cT(DijT)}+pi,where cR() and cT() are transport cost function ($/kg) by rail and truck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transport cost function dictates which mode of transportation is least costly from any origin county to any destination county, with truck generally more cost-effective for short distances and rail preferred for longer distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DRij and DTij are transportation distances (km) between centroids of counties by rail and truck, respectively (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, pi is the average farm-gate price of corn from county i (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using linear programming, we estimate a US optimal allocation for direct corn consumption by each of r = 1, , R demand sectors for all n counties:Minimize{r=1Ri=1nj=1nPij×Cr,ij}subject toi=1NCr,ij=Cr,jD,forr=1,,Randj=1,,nr=1Rj=1nCr,ijCiS,fori=1,,nCr,ij0,forr=1,,R,i=1,,nandj=1,,n,where, C*r,ij is the quantity of corn (kg) transported from the origin county i to the destination county j in sector r. CDr,j is the quantity of corn demanded for sector r at the destination county j and CSi is the supply of corn at the origin county i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the outputs from stage 1 of the transportation model, we compare the state-to-state movement of corn and DDGS consumed as animal feed with the state-to-state movement of animal feed as reported in the FAF4 survey results for 2012 (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FAF4 data are an imperfect comparison with our FoodS3 results because it includes several categories of animal feeds in addition to corn and DDGS, it is only at the state level, and only includes animal feed, and no other buyers of corn; however, it is the most comparable data to our results available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our comparison, for each of the five largest corn-producing states, we examine the correlation of animal feed movement to every other state between the two sets of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlations are very high (correlation coefficient of interstate animal feed movement between FoodS3 and FAF4 for top five states: Iowa 0.99, Minnesota 0.94, Illinois 0.94, Nebraska 0.96, Indiana 0.85); these values are largely influenced by the large share of animal feed that is consumed in the same state that it is produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also report the correlation coefficient when we take the log of the animal feed values from each dataset, which greatly removes the influence of intrastate animal feed movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coefficients with the logged values are much lower (correlation coefficient of log of interstate animal feed movement: Iowa 0.63, Minnesota 0.25, Illinois 0.45, Nebraska 0.62, Indiana 0.43), indicating that there is less agreement between the datasets regarding animal feed movement between states than within states; however, two thirds of animal feed is estimated to be consumed within the state of production in both datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stage_2__Embedded_Corn_Mobility_to_Processing_Facilities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In stage 2 of the model we estimate the movement of animals from farms or feedlots to processing facilities, moving only cattle, pigs, and broilers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animals have embedded corn from their consumption of feed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this stage we connect large animal protein processing facilities with the source of their corns production, through the animals they purchase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transportation model operates separately for each animal type, and minimizes the total cost of transporting animals from counties of production to processing facilities while meeting each individual facility demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this stage, animals are restricted to movement by truck only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allocation procedure is similar to the first stage model, but the second stage allocates animals to meet processing facility demand at all K facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each animal type we solveMinimize{j=1nk=1KcT,A(DjkT)×Ajk}subject toj=1nAjk=AkD,fork=1,,Kk=1KAjkAjS,forj=1,,nAjk0,forj=1,,nandk=1,,K,where, A*jk is the number of animals transported from the supplying county j to the demanding facility k. cT,A(DTjk) is the transport cost ($/head) of moving animals from demand county j to facility k by truck, given the truck distance, DTjk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADk is the demand for animals by processing facility k, and ASj is the supply of animals in county j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The approaches and results provided make two primary and significant contributions to the environmental accounting and footprinting literatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using publicly available production and consumption data, we develop a unique cost-minimization approach to approximate subnational mobility of US corn from production to major primary and secondary consumptive activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we make several simplifying assumptions (e.g., supply and demand balance annually, costs minimized are restricted to regional commodity price and transport, operational limitations such as transport congestion or organizational and regional preferences are ignored, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), the findings provide a reasonably robust approximation of spatial supply networks for a key commodity input of significant environmental impact to downstream fuel and animal protein sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across the 2 y examined (2007 and 2012), our results suggest that the structural relationships of supply networks across subregions may be rigid, despite significant variability between production years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the physical and natural capital requirements of productionconsumption systems and long-term investments in transportation and capital infrastructure serve to lock in subregional supply relationships, leading to relatively stable supply chains across time and geographies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research is needed to further explore the robustness of estimated supply network relationships over time and its impact on food and energy systems ability to adapt to changing climate, water stresses, or market shocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By linking geographically heterogeneous indicators of environmental impact to commodity supply chain networks, we expand upon the largely country-level approaches of environmental LCA and consumption-based accounting to subnational product and organizational supply chain scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this work contributes to the growing call for greater transparency and accountability of sustainability performance across diverse product supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a hotspot approach, we have focused on key processes significantly contributing to geographic variability in environmental impactsnamely, fertilizer type and application rates, and irrigation water use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, estimates of spatial variability are rarely reported on a production output basisa critical metric for the assessment of supply chain consumption-based accounting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps more important is how these embedded indicators are aggregated through the consumption of downstream ethanol and animal protein supply chain actors, providing the transparency necessary to begin managing these impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is often reported that US ethanol and animal protein products contain significant volumes of embedded corn, and that corn inputs are major drivers of these products emissions and water use profiles, our findings illustrate significant variability across these broad-brushed heuristics, depending upon the location of sourced corn (25, 27, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with many other commodity inputs, consumed corn is pulled through complex supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, beef processed and packed in the Texas panhandle likely sources its cattle from east Texas and Oklahoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models results suggest that feed for cattle in these regions is most cost-effectively sourced from local farmers, but these same cattle producers will also likely purchase corn feed from as far away as Nebraska and South Dakota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these cattle will likely consume significant amounts of corn produced in Iowa and Minnesota, indirectly, in the form of DDGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the same beef product processed in eastern Nebraska may source, directly and indirectly, very little corn from Nebraska due to significant local competition for corn from other sectors (e.g., ethanol, pork, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the supply networks for a Nebraska beef processor are much more dependent on cattle and feed from the Dakotas and Minnesota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Managing sustainability performance and regulating environmental burdens require a more sophisticated understanding of the sources and uses of high-impact commodities through supply networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results shift the unit of analysis from geographic footprinting at regional or national scales to a spatially explicit consumptive-based metric for complex supply networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although consumption-based accounting methods have made significant contributions in the footprinting literatureattributing embedded impacts based on global country-to-country trade relationshipsthe approaches described in this paper attribute subnational consumptive impacts at a geographic scale more closely aligned with the heterogeneity of environmental impacts across landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research is required to improve commodity mobility models, advance sustainability indicator measures, and develop marginal characterization factors to better assess shifts in field management or procurement decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this research takes an important step toward estimating supply chain environmental impacts of a key commodity input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expanded to include additional heterogeneous inputs across a production system, it could potentially reduce the occurrence of wildly disparate LCA study results currently observed in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a public policy and managerial perspective, the results presented in this paper are important spatially explicit estimates of environmental and economic performance for a major US commodity embedded in downstream consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implications of these data are numerous because they provide supply chain managers with critical information for intervention strategies addressing upstream impacts important to the environmental performance of their products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These impacts are often identified in strategic and stakeholder-engaged materiality assessments as high-priority aspects of corporate sustainability planning; however, information and operational constraints identifying and targeting specific opportunities is difficult (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FoodS3 model allows downstream firms to address sustainability performance of key input commodities through two broad strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our results can assist firm efforts to target interventions and collaborations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A growing number of large food manufacturing firms have recently made commitments to work with farmers to reduce the use of fertilizers, water use, and transport emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results help these companies and their partnersoften environmental nongovernmental organizationsidentify where significant carbon and water risks occur within their supply chains and where efficient solutions might reside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, downstream firms can use the FoodS3 model to shift commodity sourcing strategies away from high-impact regions to lower-impact ones as a cost-effective way to improve their relative sustainability performance vis-à-vis competitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that this strategy may produce little or no environmental benefit to the overall corn productionconsumption system in the short term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it does facilitate paths for future research to explore the economic effects of large-scale demand shifts away from high-impact cropping systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased demand for corn from the most ecoefficient production regions may bolster prices, supporting increased investments in improved management practices (e.g., precision fertilizer application, drip irrigation, or the adoption of cover crops through financial or purchasing agreement mechanisms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our model stops at processors who are mid-supply chain actors, it does allow decision-makers to aggregate consumption-based impacts across facility, business unit, enterprise, and geopolitical boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides new information for publicprivate partnerships addressing environmental and economic development efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, results can assist companies and local policymakers when considering the closing or acquisition of production facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating indirect economic, CO2e, and water impacts, policymakers may be able to leverage resources across multiple political jurisdictions in seeking to provide economic development incentives for new facilities in locations sourcing low-impact inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, far-reaching unintended consequences of aggressive economic development incentives currently made in areas of high-risk sourcing could potentially be avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the FoodS3 modeling approach allows companies and local governments with aligning risk and opportunity profiles to explore innovative approaches toward improved ecoefficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a large corn-producing state like Minnesota may find new opportunities to engage the broiler industry in developing conservation strategies, given that a large percentage of its corn production is used to feed broilers, even though very few broiler farms reside in that state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another important consideration for policy and decision-making is that our approach allows for improved environmental characterizations that link domestic and global productionconsumption systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The United States, along with central Europe and small portions of South America and Asia, are the only areas operating at close to 100% yield potential (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it may be that high-impact corn in the United States is low relative to other regions, and thus a decrease in US production of corn could lead to a global increase in impacts if corn production increases elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the United States and world struggle to deal with environmental challenges, our model provides a starting point for reducing barriers to transparency within commodity supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work improves upon the existing methods for consumption-based environmental footprinting and creates a new tool for decision-makers seeking to target interventions for environmental improvements within supply chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stage_2__Animal_Supply_and_Demand  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stage 2 of FoodS3 connects animals from farms and feedlots to primary processing facilities, tracing the quantity of embedded cornas corn and DDGSand the associated environmental impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage 2 was restricted to beef, pork, and broiler chicken primary processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data for stage 2 accounts for the supply of animals on farms and feedlots to meet the demand for animals in processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each of these markets are characterized by a relatively few companies owning a large share of the processing facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the beef market, 25.4 million cattle were allocated to 43 processing facilities, with 21 of the facilitiesaccounting for approximately three quarters of all cattleowned by Cargill, Tyson, and JBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pork market, 113.6 million pigs were allocated to 74 processing facilities, with 17 facilitiesaccounting for an estimated 56% of pigsowned by Smithfield, Tyson, and JBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the broiler market, 8.4 billion chickens were allocated to 158 processing facilities, with 70 facilitiesaccounting for approximately half of all broilersowned by Tyson, Pilgrims Pride, and Perdue Farms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary processing facility locations and processing capacities were derived from industry reports, state-level slaughter totals from the 2012 COA, satellite images of facilities, and adjustments to obtain consistent results between data sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the methods and data sources used separately for each animal type below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beef_Processing_Facilities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained data on beef cattle slaughter facilities in a report from Cattle Buyers Weekly, listing the top 30 beef-packing companies in the United States (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The report includes the number of facilities and quantity slaughtered in 2012 for each company.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual facility information was obtained from the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service meat and poultry inspection (MPI) directory (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MPI directory was used to identify the location of facilities for each company listed in the Cattle Buyers Weekly report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the slaughter production of each facility by allocating the company total to the individual facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimation process required several steps, which involved making initial estimates based on the size of the facility, comparing state totals of estimated production with COA state slaughter totals, and finally making adjustments to reconcile differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified 56 processing facilities for the top 30 beef-packing companies and using the knowledge of an industry expert, we split those facilities into 30 facilities that process corn fed cattle, 13 that process dairy and beef cattle only (a distinction that is important when modeling the movement of cattle to processing facilities as described in Stage 2: Embedded Corn Mobility to Processing Facilities), and 13 facilities that process multiple categories of cattle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each facility was located on Google Earth Pro, and the size of the facility was estimated using the polygon ruler tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement included all structures connected or clearly associated with the slaughter facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slaughter production at each facility was estimated using the facilitys share of the company total facility areasum of area of all facilities for the companymultiplied by the total slaughter for the company.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure produced an initial estimate of the processing capacity of each facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the top 30 companies, only five had multiple facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this estimation technique was unnecessary for 25 companies where the facility total is also the company total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compare our individual facility estimates, summed to the state level, with the COA slaughter totals by state for cattle (excluding calves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the uncertainty associated with our initial facility-level capacity estimates using satellite images, we determined that facility totals should be adjusted to match COA state totals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adjustment procedure was conducted with three hierarchical principles that were sometimes in conflict with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest priority was that the sum of facility production for each state must match COA state totals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the company total production should be preserved whenever possible (i.e., when it does not conflict with the state total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the initial facility-level estimates should be adhered to as closely as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The adjustment procedure followed these steps: (i) for all states with a single facility, the entire state total was allocated to that facility; (ii) all companies with a single (remaining) facility had the entire company total (or remaining total after step 1 allocated to this facility); (iii) two companies with 24 remaining facilities each were allocated the remaining company total according to the facility size estimate; and (iv) the largest three companies (Tyson, JBS, and Cargill) were allocated the remaining production in each state according to their proportion of facility area in each state for these three companies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure results in the state total of the facilities equaling the state total from the COA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all companies, except the largest three (and several smaller companies with a single facility in a state with a single facility), the company total equaled the company total from the Cattle Weekly Report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, adjustments were made within several states between the largest three companies that maintained the state total while reallocating between the largest three companies to ensure that these company totals were met exactly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The largest cattle slaughter companies are displayed in Table S2, showing that the top three companies control approximately two thirds of the market.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pig_Processing_Facilities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Locations and production of pig processing facilities were obtained through similar methods as those used for cattle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pig processing facilities by company were identified in the 2014 Pork Stats report from Pork Checkoff (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pork Stats report lists 52 pig slaughter companies in the United States, the location of the facilities associated with each company (74 total facilities accounting for 99.1% of all pig production), and the estimated daily slaughter capacity for each facility for 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The report also provides an annual total for all pig production in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adjusted the facility numbers to COA numbers by multiplying the percent of total production in each facility times the 2012 COA total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared our estimated state totals with COA state totals and adjusted facility capacities to match the COA state totals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average adjustment for each facility was 8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adjustments to facility production were made to perfectly match COA state slaughter totals following a similar procedure as was used to adjust cattle facility production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S3 identifies the largest pig slaughter companies, annual production, and market share.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With pigs, the top five companies combine to process 73% of the pigs in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Broiler_Processing_Facilities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data on broiler slaughter facilities comes from the 2012 poultry processing plants directory from WATT PoultryUSA, which identifies the location and associated company of all 158 broiler processing facility in the United States (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WATT PoultryUSA also produced a report of the top broiler processing companies in 2012, which provides the estimated annual broilers slaughtered by each of 37 companies (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with cattle, it was necessary to allocate the company total production to facilities under each company.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of each broiler slaughter facility was estimated using Google Earth Pro, and the company total production was allocated to each facility proportionally based on area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The facility production estimates were adjusted to match state totals using the same method as with cattle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the larger number of facilities for many of the companies, it was possible to match state totals exactly with the USDA Census state slaughter totals, and match nearly every company total with the company totals from the WATT PoultryUSA 2012 top company report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S4 lists the largest broiler processing companies for 2012, where the largest four companies process 55% of the US total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Systems_Boundaries_and_Stages_of_Supply_Chain_Not_Modeled  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FoodS3 accounts for and tracks several stages of the corn supply chain, but environmental impacts are only estimated for corn farming and its inputs upstream impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impacts of ethanol and DDGS only include the embedded impact from corn farming, but not the ethanol production and transportation stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, emissions associated with manure at livestock facilities and the energy inputs at the primary processing facilities are not included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 demonstrates the system boundaries included (and excluded) for this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Company_Corn_Supply_Chain_Visualizations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S4 illustrates the estimated company-specific corn sourcing supply chain network and the associated life cycle GHG emissions and water use for three major protein suppliers: Tyson, Cargill, and JBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diverse supply chain networks and the heterogeneous environmental impacts of corn production (only partially captured in the current assessment) results in substantial variation in company-specific corn grain sourcing emission factors (e.g., kg CO2e/bu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
