ABA receptor PYL9 promotes drought resistance and leaf senescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified transgenic plants that are extremely resistant to drought from a large-scale screening of transgenic plants overexpressing the pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYL) family of abscisic acid (ABA) receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explored how these plants resist drought by examining both short-term responses, such as stomatal closure, and long-term responses, such as senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological roles of ABA-induced senescence under stress conditions and the underlying molecular mechanism are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that ABA induces senescence by activating ABA-responsive element-binding factors and Related to ABA-Insensitive 3/VP1 transcription factors through core ABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that PYL9 promotes drought resistance by not only limiting transpirational water loss but also, causing summer dormancy-like responses, such as senescence, in old leaves and growth inhibition in young tissues under severe drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Drought stress is an important environmental factor limiting plant productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we screened drought-resistant transgenic plants from 65 promoter-pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYL) abscisic acid (ABA) receptor gene combinations and discovered that pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines showed dramatically increased drought resistance and drought-induced leaf senescence in both Arabidopsis and rice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggested that ABA promotes senescence by causing ethylene production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that ABA promotes leaf senescence in an ethylene-independent manner by activating sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s), which subsequently phosphorylate ABA-responsive element-binding factors (ABFs) and Related to ABA-Insensitive 3/VP1 (RAV1) transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylated ABFs and RAV1 up-regulate the expression of senescence-associated genes, partly by up-regulating the expression of Oresara 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pyl9 and ABA-insensitive 1-1 single mutants, pyl8-1pyl9 double mutant, and snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant showed reduced ABA-induced leaf senescence relative to the WT, whereas pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants showed enhanced ABA-induced leaf senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that leaf senescence may benefit drought resistance by helping to generate an osmotic potential gradient, which is increased in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants and causes water to preferentially flow to developing tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results uncover the molecular mechanism of ABA-induced leaf senescence and suggest an important role of PYL9 and leaf senescence in promoting resistance to extreme drought stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Screening_Transgenic_Arabidopsis_for_Drought-Stress_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Arabidopsis, the expression of many PYLs is down-regulated by osmotic stress, which may constitute a negative feedback loop that reduces drought responses (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, expression modifications that allow general, tissue-specific, or stress-inducible overexpression of PYLs should amplify ABA signaling and increase drought resistance in transgenic plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this assumption, the following five promoters were used for PYL overexpression: the 35S CaMV promoter, the stress-inducible RD29A promoter, and the tissue-specific promoters GC1, ROP11, and RBCS-1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic plants from a total of 65 different promoter-PYL combinations were generated and evaluated for drought-stress resistance (Fig 1A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicated that drought resistance was increased by PYLs driven by 35S, pRD29A, and pGC1 promoters but not by the pRBCS-1A promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pGC1-driven lines performed better than the lines driven by the other guard cell-specific promoter, pROP11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the combinations, survival was highest for 35S::PYL3/9/13, pRD29A::PYL7/9, and pGC1::PYL3/5/6/7/11 lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These top drought-resistant lines preferentially cluster on the monomeric PYLs, especially PYL7 and PYL9, which have very high affinities to ABA (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also evaluated the PYLs in a transient expression assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly ABA-induced 1 (HAI1), HAI2, and HAI3 PP2Cs interact with only a few of these PYLs, even in the presence of 10 µM ABA (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfections of HAI1 inhibited RD29B-LUC expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PYL3, PYL4, PYL6, or PYL13 did not inhibit HAI1, whereas cotransfections of HAI1 with PYL5, PYL7, or PYL9 strongly enabled the ABA-dependent induction of RD29B-LUC expression (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cotransfections of PYL9 together with each of the PP2Cs strongly enabled the ABA-dependent induction of RD29B-LUC (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the ABA-independent inhibition of ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1) by PYL10 (16, 25), PYL9 can partially inhibit HAI3 activity in the absence of exogenous ABA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that PYL9 strongly inhibits the phosphatase activities of clade A PP2Cs in plant cells, an inhibition that activates the core ABA signaling pathway and is presumably involved in the drought resistance of pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PYL9 transcripts were significantly more abundant in pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in the WT under drought stress (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of ABA after water was withheld for 12 d significantly increased the drought resistance of the pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants after flowering (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delayed wilting and drying in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants was correlated with a reduction in water loss from the soil, indicating a reduction in transpiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result revealed that PYL9, when driven by the pRD29A promoter, is useful for generating transgenic plants that are extremely resistant to drought when treated with ABA or ABA-mimicking compounds (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines for additional study (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

pRD29A__PYL9_Confers_Drought_Resistance_to_Both_Arabidopsis_and_Rice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Arabidopsis pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines also exhibited increased drought resistance before flowering under short-day conditions (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater drought-stress survival of pRD29A::PYL9 lines was associated with reduced water loss (Fig 2B), reduced cell membrane damage (Fig 2C), reduced transpiration rate and stomatal conductance (Fig S3 C and D), enhanced photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency (Fig S3 E and F), reduced accumulation of toxic hydrogen peroxide, and enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes (Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the total biomass was greater in pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in the WT after drought treatment but did not differ statistically from the WT in the absence of drought treatment (Fig S3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that the pRD29A::PYL9 transgene confers drought resistance to Arabidopsis in at least two ways (i.e., by reducing water loss and by reducing oxidative injury).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether pRD29A::PYL9 may confer drought resistance in crop plants, we generated pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the japonica variety Zhonghua 11 (ZH11), in which PYL9 expression was dramatically induced by drought stress (Fig S3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic rice exhibited increased drought resistance (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 2-wk drought treatment, nearly 50% of pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic rice growing in soil survived, but only about 10% of the ZH11 WT plants survived (Fig S3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although pRD29A::PYL9 increased survival, total biomass, and cell membrane integrity of transgenic rice under drought conditions, the transgene did not adversely affect plant growth and development under well-watered conditions (Fig S3 H and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that pRD29A::PYL9 increases drought resistance in rice without retarding growth under well-watered conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PYL9_Promotes_ABA-Induced_Leaf_Senescence_in_Both_Arabidopsis_and_Rice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the drought treatment in our experiments, it was evident that older leaves of pRD29A::PYL9 lines became yellow, sooner than in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) WT (Fig 2A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA-induced leaf yellowing was also accelerated in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with its visible phenotypes, pRD29A::PYL9 lines had a lower chlorophyll level than the Col-0 WT after treatment with 20 µM ABA (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAGs are molecular markers of senescence and especially, ABA-induced senescence (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the elevated PYL9 expression (Fig S4B), both SAG12 and SAG13 were more strongly induced after ABA treatment in mature leaves of pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in those of the WT (Fig 3C and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result showed that pRD29A::PYL9 accelerates ABA-induced leaf senescence of older leaves in Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enhanced drought survival and senescence are both associated with ABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that PYL9 mediated these responses by making the plants hypersensitive to ABA, we analyzed the leaf yellowing of the pyl9 transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant after ABA treatment of plate-grown seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA-induced leaf yellowing was lower in the pyl9 mutant than in the WT under low light (3045 µmol m2 s1) (Fig 3 D and E) but not under normal light (80100 µmol m2 s1) (Fig S4D) because of genetic redundancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the pyl8-1pyl9 double mutant was less sensitive than the pyl9 mutant to ABA-induced leaf yellowing, indicating that PYL9 and PYL8 function together in ABA-induced leaf senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, PYL9 is highly expressed in senescent leaves and stamens according to the Arabidopsis electronic fluorescent pictograph (eFP) browser, which is consistent with the expression of SAG12 (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm that PYL9 functions in both ABA-induced drought survival and senescence by hypersensitizing Arabidopsis to ABA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABA-induced leaf yellowing was also accelerated in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic rice (Fig 3F and Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After ABA treatment, severe yellowing was evident in the third oldest leaves of the pRD29A::PYL9 lines but not those of the ZH11 WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, two SAGs, Osh36 and Osl85 (9), were more strongly induced after ABA treatment in the third-oldest leaves of pRD29A::PYL9 rice lines than in those of the ZH11 WT (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that PYL9 also mediates ABA-induced leaf senescence in rice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ABA_Induces_Leaf_Senescence_Through_the_Core_ABA_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether ABA induction of senescence requires ethylene, we treated protoplasts with the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that AVG treatment decreased SAG12-LUC expression in the absence of ABA (Fig S6A), consistent with the known role of ethylene in promoting senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AVG treatment did not inhibit either ABA-induced or PYL9-enhanced SAG12-LUC expression (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ABA-induced leaf yellowing was not reduced in the ethylene-resistant mutants ein2-1 and ein3-1 (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ABA-induced and PYL9-enhanced SAG12-LUC expression was not blocked in ein2-1 mutant protoplasts (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the induction of senescence by ABA is not mediated through ethylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing HA- and YFP-tagged PYL9 under the native PYL9 promoter (ProPYL9:PYL9-HA-YFP) (Fig S7A) and isolated PYL9-associated proteins using tandem affinity purification (Fig S7B and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associated proteins mainly included several PP2Cs, such as HAB2, PP2CA, and ABI1, in an ABA- or osmotic stress-enhanced manner (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PYL9 interacted with all PP2Cs tested in an ABA-independent manner in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays (Fig S7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fused the 788-bp fragment of the SAG12 promoter (SAG12-LUC) (Fig S7E) to the LUC reporter gene and used the construct as a senescence-responsive reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 788-bp SAG12 promoter contains the 9-mer sequence T(TAG)(GA)CGT(GA)(TCA)(TAG), which is the preferred binding site of ORE1 (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All PP2Cs decreased SAG12-LUC expression in the presence of ABA (Fig S7 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of SAG12-LUC expression by ABI1 can be released by coexpression of PYL9 (Fig S7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ABA-induced leaf yellowing was weaker in the abi1-1 mutant than in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) WT (Fig 4A and Fig S7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abi1-1 mutant is ABA-resistant and contains a G180D point mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PYLs do not interact with or inhibit ABI1G180D, even in the presence of ABA (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that PP2Cs inhibit ABA-induced senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that PYL9 may promote leaf senescence by activating SnRK2s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant was insensitive to ABA-induced leaf yellowing (Fig 4B and Fig S7I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SAG12-LUC expression was not enhanced by ABA treatment in snrk2.2/3/6 triple-mutant protoplasts, but ABA induction of SAG12-LUC expression in such protoplasts could be recovered by transfection of SnRK2.6 (Fig 4C), suggesting that ABA-induced SAG12 expression depends on the SnRK2s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of SAG12-LUC expression by PYL9 was abolished in snrk2.2/3/6 triple-mutant protoplasts, but such expression was also recovered with transfection of SnRK2.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of SAG12-LUC expression by SnRK2.6 was blocked by transfection of ABI1, which can be released by PYL9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that PYL9 promotes ABA-induced leaf yellowing and SAG12 expression through core ABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphorylation_of_ABFs_by_SnRK2s_Facilitates_ABA-Induced_SAG12_Promoter_Activity_in_Leaf_Protoplasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABA-activated SnRK2s phosphorylate ABF transcription factors, which activate these factors and enable them to regulate expression of ABA-responsive genes (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the transcription factors involved in ABA-induced leaf senescence, we cloned several ABFs, including ABF2, ABI5, enhanced EM level (EEL), and AREB3, and coexpressed them with SAG12-LUC in Col-0 leaf protoplasts (Fig 4D and Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that SAG12-LUC expression in protoplasts was dramatically increased by ABF2, was less dramatically but significantly increased by ABI5 and EEL, and was not increased by AREB3 (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylation of ABF2 at amino acid residues S26, S86, S94, and T135 is important for stress-responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis, and these sites are putatively phosphorylated by SnRK2s (15, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of SnRK2.6 significantly enhanced the ability of ABF2 to increase SAG12-LUC expression in the presence of ABA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ABF2S26DS86DS94DT135D constitutively increased SAG12-LUC expression in the snrk2.2/3/6 triple-mutant protoplasts (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that phosphorylation of ABFs by SnRK2s promotes activity of the ABA-induced leaf senescence pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leaf senescence is promoted by several NAC transcription factors, such as ORE1 (5), ORS1 (6), and AtNAP (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA-induced leaf senescence was reported to be delayed in ore1 mutant leaves (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAG12-LUC expression was clearly increased by ORE1 and AtNAP and slightly increased by ORS1 (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORE1 and AtNAP promoter regions contain several abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) motifs and RAV1 binding sites (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABRE motifs are the binding sites for the ABF transcription factors, which our results suggested to be positive regulators of senescence (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA-activated SnRK2s phosphorylate RAV1 (30), which positively regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the Arabidopsis eFP browser, expression of ORE1, ORS1, and AtNAP is enhanced by ABA (Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA treatment, indeed, induced the expression of ORE1 and AtNAP in mature leaves, and the expression levels were higher in pRD29A::PYL9 lines compared with those of the WT (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fused a 3,984-bp fragment of the ORE1 promoter to the LUC reporter gene (ORE1L-LUC) (Fig S8E) to use as a senescence-responsive reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the AthaMap, the 3,984-bp ORE1 promoter contains multiple RAV1(1) [gCaACA(g/t)(a/t)] and RAV1(2) [caCCTG(a/g)] motifs, which are the preferred binding sites for RAV1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORE1L-LUC expression was enhanced by RAV1 and SnRK2.6 and repressed by ABI1 (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of PYL9 released the inhibition of ABI1 on ORE1-LUC expression in an ABA-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that ABA core signaling up-regulates expression of SAGs through phosphorylation of both ABFs and RAV1 transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stressed_pRD29A__PYL9_Transgenic_Plants_Display_Enhanced_Osmotic_Potential_Gradients_Between_Senescing_Leaves_and_Buds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants are hypersensitive to ABA-induced leaf senescence (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these plants, leaf yellowing spreads from older to younger leaves (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaf wilting in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants was observed after 3 d of continuous ABA treatment, even in plants that were well-watered (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual event suggests that water transport to senescing leaves was reduced or blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water moves from areas of high water potential to areas of low water potential, and plants control water potential, in part, by regulating osmotic potential ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ABA treatment reduced the osmotic potential in the developing bud tissue but not in the old leaves (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The osmotic potential was lower in developing tissues of pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in the WT but did not differ in old leaves of the transgenic plants vs. the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the osmotic potential gradient was greater in pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, this gradient would cause water to move preferentially to developing tissues but not to senescing leaves, especially in pRD29A::PYL9 lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescence, which is associated with the remobilization of carbohydrate and nitrogen from the senescing tissue to the developing or storage tissues, contributes to osmotic potential regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbohydrate is transported as sucrose to sink tissues through the phloem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key step for phloem loading is sucrose efflux, which is mediated by SWEET proteins (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined that SWEET15/SAG29 is induced in senescing Arabidopsis leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of SWEET15 expression is greater in mature leaves of pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in those of the WT after ABA treatment (Fig 5C), suggesting that pRD29A::PYL9 lines have an increased ability to mobilize sucrose from senescing leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Core_ABA_Signaling_Promotes_Growth_Inhibition_and_the_Expression_of_Cuticular_Wax_Biosynthesis_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To help plants survive extreme environmental conditions, ABA promotes growth inhibition and dormancy (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pRD29A::PYL9 lines showed a stronger seed dormancy and growth inhibition than the Col-0 WT under ABA treatment (Fig S9 AC), whereas the seed dormancy and rosette growth of pyl8-1pyl9 and snrk2.2/3/6 were less sensitive to ABA treatment (Fig S9 A, D, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pRD29A::PYL9 rice lines also showed a more severe growth inhibition than the ZH11 WT in response to the ABA treatment (Fig S9F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that PYL9 promotes, through the core ABA signaling pathway, ABA-induced seed dormancy and growth inhibition of buds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABA promotes stomatal closure to reduce water loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To protect plants from nonstomatal water loss, ABA induces the accumulation of cuticular wax by up-regulating wax biosynthetic genes (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthetase 2, ECERIFERUM 1, lipid transfer protein 3, and wax ester synthase 1 were more strongly induced after ABA treatment in pRD29A::PYL9 lines than in the WT (Fig S9G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression of wax biosynthetic genes was reduced in both abi1-1 and snrk2.2/3/6 than in those of the WT in either the absence or presence of ABA (Fig S9H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with PYL9 promotion of ABA-induced wax biosynthesis through the core ABA signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of cuticular wax may be especially relevant in very young leaves, where stomata have not developed fully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To escape extreme environmental conditions, plants use a dormancy phase to survive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two major forms of dormancy are seeds and dormant buds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These forms of dormancy are determined genetically and affected by environmental changes (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA increases plant survival in extreme drought by inducing short-, such as stomatal closure, and long-term responses, such as senescence and abscission, and different forms of dormancy (2, 10, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants close stomata in response to drought by producing ABA, which is a rapid response that blocks most water loss and gains time for long-term responses to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants developed an important long-term defense against limited water by favoring water consumption in only newly developed organs and eventually, inducing strong dormancy in meristems or buds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nonobvious part of this defense in its early stages is the premature senescence and/or abscission of old organs (Fig S10), which are easily mistaken as drought sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Leaf senescence and abscission are forms of programmed cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They occur slowly and are associated with efficient transfer of nutrients from the senescing leaves to the developing or storage parts of plants (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promotion of leaf senescence and abscission by ABA is a long-term response that allows survival of extreme drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By selection of the best transgenic survivors of extreme drought conditions, our study reveals that ABA mediates survival by promoting leaf senescence through the ABA receptor PYL9 and other PYLs, PP2C coreceptors, SnRK2 protein kinases, and ABFs and RAV1 transcription factors (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABFs and RAV1 are positive regulators of ABA-induced leaf senescence (Fig 4) (31) and overall survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of ABFs and RAV1 by SnRK2s is important for their functions in ABA-induced leaf senescence (Fig 4) and increased survival (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When phosphorylated by SnRK2s, RAV1 and ABFs increase the expression of NAC transcription factors through ABRE motifs and/or RAV1-binding motifs (Fig S8C) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These NAC transcription factors promote the expression of downstream SAGs, which in turn, control leaf senescence (57, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAGs are involved in transcription regulation, protein modification and degradation, macromolecule degradation, transportation, antioxidation, and autophagy (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association of senescing leaves with provision of nutrients to sink tissues during drought suggests that drought survival and leaf senescence are linked by ABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This common connection through the core ABA pathway finally uncovers the underlying molecular mechanism of drought- and ABA-induced leaf senescence and its association with the ability to survive extreme drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It must be remembered that many injury responses to drought may resemble senescence symptoms but are mediated by separate signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABA promotes dormancy and growth inhibition through core ABA signaling (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeds can live for many years in a deep dormancy, escaping extreme environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many plants, especially perennials, have a bud-to-bud lifecycle in addition to a seed-to-seed cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bud dormancy is less extreme and more flexible than seed dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perennial plants can temporarily cease meristematic activity in response to the inconsistent or unusual timing of unfavorable environmental conditions (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA accumulates in polar apical buds during short-day conditions, which may contribute to growth suppression and maintenance of dormancy (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 146 BRC1-dependent bud dormancy genes that are putatively involved in shade-induced axillary bud dormancy, 78 are regulated during senescence (35, 37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, master positive regulators of senescence, such as ORE1, AtNAP, and MAX2/ORE9, are also up-regulated during bud dormancy, suggesting that bud dormancy is coordinated with leaf senescence to contribute to stress resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these bud dormancy genes contain a CACGTGt motif in their promoters (37), which is recognized by ABA-related basic region-leucine zipper (b-ZIP) transcription factors (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water flows from tissues with higher water potential to those with lower water potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During drought stress, the young sink tissues but not senescing leaves can steadily decrease their water potential through osmotic adjustment, which ensures that water flows to these sink tissues (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under drought conditions, senescence of sources is, however, accompanied by growth inhibition and dormancy or paradormancy (23) in sinks, which elevate the osmolyte concentration in sinks (passive osmotic adjustment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the water potential of the atmosphere is extremely low under drought conditions, a relatively sealed plant surface is required to limit nonstomatal water loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sealing of the plant surface requires the accumulation of cuticular wax (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA up-regulates wax biosynthesis genes through the core ABA signaling pathway (Fig S9 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The promotion of wax biosynthesis by ABA in buds entering dormancy may also contribute to the improved survival of pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines under drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our data and previous findings suggest that the ABA core signaling pathway plays a crucial role in survival of extreme drought by promoting stomatal closure, growth inhibition, bud dormancy, and leaf senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ABA-induced dormancy-related genes and the ABA-induced senescence-related genes are largely the same genes, which are simultaneously regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescence occurs in source tissue and leads to death, whereas dormancy occurs in sink tissue and maintains life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of death and life is similar to a triage strategy, and it is consistent with plant survival and therefore, species persistence during episodes of extreme environmental conditions during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our research has generated drought-resistant pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants from a large-scale screening of transgenic lines and illustrated the mechanism and important role of ABA-induced leaf senescence under severe drought stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both Arabidopsis and rice in extreme drought conditions, the pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines exhibited reduced transpirational water loss, accelerated leaf senescence, reduced cell membrane damage, reduced oxidative damage, increased water use efficiency, and finally, increased survival rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being more efficient than the 35S promoter for engineering drought-resistant transgenic plants, the RD29A promoter lacks undesirable phenotypes, including retarded growth under normal growth conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced drought survival of pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants can be further enhanced by the external application of ABA or its analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined use of pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants and applications of ABA or its analogs represents an effective way to protect crops from severe drought stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The ORFs of the PYLs were amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 WT cDNA and cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA 991 under the control of the original CaMV 35S promoter or other promoters, including the RD29A promoter (At5g52310), GC1 promoter (At1g22690), RBCS1A promoter (At1g67090), and ROP11 promoter (At5g62880) (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used are listed in Dataset S3, and the amplified fragments were confirmed by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
pGADT7-PP2Cs, pGADT7-MYB44, pBD-GAL4 Cam-PYLs, pHBT-PYL9, pHBT-PP2Cs, pHBT-SnRK2.6, pHBT-ABF2, ABF2S26DS86DS94DT135D, and RD29B-LUC were the same as reported (13, 18, 19, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZmUBQ::GUS was provided by J. Sheen, Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate SAG12-LUC and ORE1L-LUC constructs, the 788-bp SAG12 and 3,984-bp ORE1L promoter fragments amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA with primers SAG12proF/R and ORE1LproF/R (Dataset S3) were cloned into the BamHI and NcoI of the RD29B-LUC vector, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABI5, EEL, AREB3, ORE1, ORS1, AtNAP, and RAV1 were cloned into pHBT95 using transfer PCR with pHBT genes primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate the ProPYL9:PYL9-HA-YFP construct, the 2,566-bp PYL9 promoter fragment amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA with the primers pPYL9F and PYL9genoR (Dataset S3) was cloned into the SalI and ApaI sites of the modified pSAT vector with YFP and 3HA tags at the C terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coding region of PYL9 from pCAMBIA99-1-PYL9 was then subcloned between the PYL9 promoter and the HA-YFP coding sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole insertion cassette was digested with PI-Psp1 and reinserted into pRCS2-htp binary plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pyl8-1 mutant (SAIL_1269_A02) (19), the pyl9 mutant (SALK_083621) (17), and the snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant (10) are in the Col-0 background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pyl8-1, pyl9, and abi5-1 mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pCAMBIA 991-PYLs and ProPYL9:PYL9-HA-YFP plasmids were transformed into Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 and rice cultivar ZH11 using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All transgenic plants were screened for hygromycin resistance and verified by PCR or Northern blot assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T2 generation plants were used for the drought-stress resistance test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 20% (vol/vol) bleach for 10 min and then, rinsed four times in sterile-deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sterilized seeds were grown vertically on 0.6% Phytagel (Sigma) or horizontally on 0.3% Phytagel medium containing 1/2 Murashige and Skoog nutrients (PhytoTech) and 1% sucrose (pH 5.7) and kept at 48 °C for 3 d. Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d before transfer to medium with or without the indicated concentrations of ABA (A1049; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the seedlings were transferred to the control medium, the plates were sealed with micropore tape (3M), and the seedlings were grown horizontally in a Percival CU36L5 Incubator at 23 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protoplast analysis, seedlings were grown under a relatively short photoperiod (10 h light at 23 °C and 14 h dark at 20 °C) as reported (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For drought-stress analysis, Arabidopsis plants were grown in a growth room at 22 °C/18 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 µmol m2 s1, and rice plants were grown at 26 °C/22 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod and 75%/70% relative humidity with a light intensity of 600 µmol m2 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transient_Expression_Assay_in_Arabidopsis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assays for transient expression in protoplasts were performed as described (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All steps were performed at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAG12-LUC and ORE1L-LUC were used as the senescence-responsive reporters, and ZmUBQ-GUS was used as the internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transfection, protoplasts were incubated in washing and incubation solution without ABA or with 5 µM ABA under light for 16 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Drought-Stress_Treatments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The T2 generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants was subjected to a first-round drought-stress resistance test in soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All seeds were imbibed at 4 °C for 2 d and planted directly in soil in 18-cm-diameter pots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five days after seedlings emerged, each pot was thinned to eight seedlings of uniform size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drought treatment was imposed for 20 d beginning at 10 d after seedlings emerged by withholding water; after 20 d of drought, most WT plants had died.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least three transgenic lines from each promotertransgene combination and five pots for each line were used in this test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of pots were exchanged every day to minimize the effect of environmental variability in the growth chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plants were rewatered on day 31 (1 d after the 20-d drought treatment) and assessed for survival 2 d later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second round of screening was carried out in the same manner using only those transgenic lines that were found to be relatively drought-resistant in the first round of screening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For testing the drought resistance of transgenic rice lines, rice plants at the four-leaf stage were subjected to drought treatment for 14 d and then rewatered as needed for 14 d. To minimize environmental variability, the pots were rotated daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survival rate of stressed plants was recorded at 14 d after rewatering began.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soil_Water_Content_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil water content percentage during drought treatment in Arabidopsis was measured as described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 591-mL pots (487214; 04.00 SQ TL TW; Myers Industries) with 130 g (62 g oven dry weight) Fafard Super-Fine Germinating Mix Soil (Sungro Horticultures) per pot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being saturated with water, the total weight of the wet soil was 440 g per pot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pots were covered with plastic film to reduce water loss from soil surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-week-old plants (four plants per pot) were subjected to drought stress by withholding water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were sprayed with 2 mL 10 µM ABA plus 0.2% Tween-20 per pot after water was withheld for 12 d. Soil water content percentage was computed as total weight minus dry soil weight divided by water weight before drought according to the work in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For drought treatment on rice, we measured the relative water content using the Soil Temperature/Moisture Meter L99-TWS-1 (Shanghai Fotel Precise Instrument Co., Ltd) following the work in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before drought treatment, the mixed vermiculite and sandy soil (Zhongfang Horticulture Co.) for rice was saturated with water, and the relative soil water content before drought was set as 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rice plants at the four-leaf stage were subjected to drought by withholding water for 14 d, and the relative soil water content after the drought treatment was 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Photosynthesis_Parameters_and_Water_Loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photosynthesis parameters were measured as reported (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least four independent plants were used for each transgenic line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fresh weight of the aerial part of each plant was recorded before rewatering, and dry weight was measured after 2 d at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water was withheld from 2-wk-old plants for 20 d, and the aboveground materials were collected and weighed before and after drying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For determination of water loss, whole rosettes of 18-d-old plants were cut from the base and weighed at indicated time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Electrolyte_Leakage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the determination of electrolyte leakage, about 0.1 g plant leaves were placed in a flask containing 10 mL deionized water and shaken on a gyratory shaker at room temperature for 6 h at about 150 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial conductivity (Ci) was measured with a conductivity meter (Leici-DDS-307A), the samples were boiled for 20 min to kill the leaf tissues and completely release the electrolytes into the solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the samples had cooled to room temperature, the conductivity of the killed tissues (Cmax) was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative electrolyte leakage was calculated as (Ci/Cmax) ×100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Hydrogen_Peroxide_Level_and_Activities_of_Antioxidant_Enzymes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content measurement, water was withheld from 2-wk-old plants for 14 d, and the leaves were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For antioxidant enzyme activities, water was withheld from 3-wk-old plants for 10 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For H2O2 content quantification, 1 mL plant extract in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was mixed with 1 mL 0.1% (wt/vol) titanium sulfate [in 20% (vol/vol) H2SO4] for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation at 15,294 × g for 10 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 410 nm using a standard curve generated with known concentrations of H2O2 as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of proteins was quantified using the Bradford method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), and peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) activities were analyzed as described previously (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Chlorophyll_Content  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants in soil were sprayed with 20 µM ABA plus 0.2% Tween-20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rice plants in soil were sprayed with 100 µM ABA plus 0.2% Tween-20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the fresh weight of samples was determined, samples were quick-frozen, ground in liquid nitrogen, and then, homogenized in extraction buffer containing ethanol, acetone, and H2O in a ratio of 5:5:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorbance of the clear supernatant was measured at wavelengths of 645 nM (D645) and 663 nM (D663) using a plate reader (Wallac VICTOR2 Plate Reader) with filters at 642 and 665 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrations of chlorophyll pigments were calculated as follows: concentration (milligrams per liter) = 20.2 × D645 + 8.02 × D663.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tandem_Affinity_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ten-day-old seedlings of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing ProPYL9:PYL9-HA-YFP (Fig S7A) were used for tandem affinity purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seedlings (34 g fresh weight) were treated for 1 h with 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium containing 100 µM ABA or 30 min with 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.8 M mannitol; for the control, seedlings were treated with 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium for 1 h. After treatment, samples were quickly frozen, ground in liquid N2, homogenized in an equal volume of 2× immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2× protease mixture; Roche), and then, centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was passed through a 0.2-µM filter and centrifuged again at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, the supernatant was incubated with 40 µL 50% (vol/vol) slurry of monoclonal anti-HA agarose with antibody produced in mouse (A2095; Sigma), which was prebalanced with 1× IP buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was inverted for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agarose was then washed four times with 1× IP buffer, three times with high NaCl buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), and finally, three times with 1× IP buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein that had bound to the anti-HA agarose was eluted by HA peptide (ab13835; Abcam) with a concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in 200 µL 1× IP buffer overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was then incubated with 20 µL 50% (vol/vol) slurry of GFP-Trap Agarose (gta-20; Chromotek), which was prebalanced with 1× IP buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was inverted for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP-Trap Agarose was washed four times with 1× IP buffer and then, five times with 1× PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the PYL9-associated proteins on the GFP-Trap Agarose were identified by MS analyses (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Northern_Blot_and_Real-Time_PCR_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Northern blot and real-time PCR were performed as reported (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Northern blot analysis, the probe was labeled with the PCR-DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RD29A-F and PYL9-R were used for the PCR (Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For real-time PCR, reactions were performed with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used are listed in Dataset S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted on mature leaves of 4-wk-old Arabidopsis plants that were growing in soil and sprayed with 20 µM ABA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rice plants in soil were sprayed with 100 µM ABA plus 0.2% Tween-20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted on third oldest leaves of rice plants that were growing in soil and sprayed with 100 µM ABA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Y2H_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Y2H assays were performed as described (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pBD-GAL4-PYLs were the same as reported (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PYL9 and PYL8 fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain were used as baits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PP2Cs and MYB44 fused to the GAL4-activating domain were used as prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequence_Comparison  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ABF2 homologs were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0.5 with the default settings (Dataset S1) and viewed using GeneDoc software (www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Osmotic_Potential_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant samples were collected in a plastic centrifuge tube filter (without membrane; Corning Costar Spin-X) and then, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After thawing, the sap was collected by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 4 min to remove insoluble material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10-µL volume of cell sap was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Model 5200; Wescor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solute concentration was converted to osmotic potential () using the vant Hoff law:  = RTc, where c is the molar solute concentration (osmolality; moles kilogram1), R is the gas constant (0.08314 L Bar mol1 K1), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
