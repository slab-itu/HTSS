Decoding and disrupting left midfusiform gyrus activity during word reading  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A central issue in the neurobiology of reading is a debate regarding the visual representation of words, particularly in the left midfusiform gyrus (lmFG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct neural recordings, electrical brain stimulation, and pre-/postsurgical neuropsychological testing provided strong evidence that the lmFG supports an orthographically specific visual word form system that becomes specialized for the representation of orthographic knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Machine learning elucidated the dynamic role lmFG plays with an early processing stage organized by orthographic similarity and a later stage supporting individuation of single words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that there is a dynamic shift from gist-level to individuated orthographic representation in the lmFG in service of visual word recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nature of the visual representation for words has been fiercely debated for over 150 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used direct brain stimulation, pre- and postsurgical behavioral measures, and intracranial electroencephalography to provide support for, and elaborate upon, the visual word form hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis states that activity in the left midfusiform gyrus (lmFG) reflects visually organized information about words and word parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with electrodes placed directly in their lmFG, we found that disrupting lmFG activity through stimulation, and later surgical resection in one of the patients, led to impaired perception of whole words and letters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using machine-learning methods to analyze the electrophysiological data from these electrodes, we found that information contained in early lmFG activity was consistent with an orthographic similarity space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the lmFG contributed to at least two distinguishable stages of word processing, an early stage that reflects gist-level visual representation sensitive to orthographic statistics, and a later stage that reflects more precise representation sufficient for the individuation of orthographic word forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide strong support for the visual word form hypothesis and demonstrate that across time the lmFG is involved in multiple stages of orthographic representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Verification_of_Orthographic_Selectivity_at_lmFG_Electrode_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify their seizure foci, four patients with medically intractable epilepsy underwent iEEG, which included insertion of multicontact electrodes into or on their ventral temporal cortex (VT) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the word sensitivity and specificity of lmFG, we used a Gaussian na√Øve Bayes classifier to decode the neural activity (single trial potentials) while participants viewed three different categories of visual stimuli: words, bodies, and phase-scrambled objects (30 images per category, each repeated once).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each patient in electrode contacts in lmFG, we observed a strong early sensitivity to words at 100400 ms (Fig 2 A and B), which was verified using a classifier model (Fig 2C; averaged peak d = 1.26, at 245 ms after stimulus onset, P less_than 0.001; see Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4 for each individual contact on the electrodes from each participant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the lmFG electrode contacts in the anterior end of the posterior fusiform sulcus is consistent with the putative visual word form area described in the functional neuroimaging literature (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the timing of the category selective response is consistent with evoked potential findings obtained from scalp electrodes (25) and previous iEEG studies (23, 2628), which have described orthographic-specific effects 200 ms after stimulus onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After completion of the iEEG study, in P1 a focal resection in the posterior basal temporal lobe was performed, which included removal of tissue at the location of the implanted VT electrode (Fig S5), leading us to predict that P1 would exhibit postsurgical changes in visual word recognition consistent with acquired alexia (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuropsychological assessments of naming times were conducted pre- and postsurgery at 1.5 wk (acute), 6 wk, and 3 mo to assess the impact of the resection on his perception of visual stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P1 was asked to name words (three, five, or seven letters) (14) and a mixed set of stimuli (words, letters, single digits, three-digit numbers, famous faces, objects, music notes, and guitar tabs) aloud as rapidly and accurately as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removal of the area surrounding the VT electrode, P1 showed the characteristics of acquired alexiaspecifically, letter-by-letter reading (Fig 3C), and longer naming times, particularly for letters and words (Fig 3D), as predicted based on the role of this area in orthographic processing (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, orthographic processes were impacted to a greater degree than phonological processes by the resection (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Results for further description and elaboration on P1s postresection reading deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The anatomical locus and category specificity of the recorded iEEG response in P1P4, and the postresection alexia in P1, were highly consistent with our localization of lmFG electrodes to tissue that is central to the visual word form debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested specific putative indicators of the visual word form hypothesis using data obtained from cortical stimulation (P1 and P2) and iEEG (P1, P3, and P4) from these electrode sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disrupting_lmFG_Activity_Impairs_Both_Lexical_and_Sublexical_Orthographic_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One indicator of whether the lmFG functions as a specialized visual word form system is whether disrupting its activity using electrical stimulation impairs the normal perception of both printed words and sublexical orthographic components (26, 27), but not other kinds of visual stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of presurgical language mapping, P1 and P2 underwent an electrical stimulation session where they named two kinds of orthographic stimuli [words (P1 and P2) and letters (P1)], as well nonorthographic objects [faces (P1) and pictures (P2)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that high stimulation (610 mA) to the lmFG electrodes would cause greater disruption to reading orthographic stimuli than low stimulation (15 mA) due to the observed category specificity of the iEEG response, but no disruption would be seen for stimulation during object (face or picture) naming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, P1 and P2 were significantly slower at reading words at high stimulation than low stimulation [Fig 3 A and B; P1: mean RTlow stim = 967 ms, mean RThigh stim = 1,860 ms, t(18) = 2.42, Cohens d = 1.14, P = 0.026; P2: mean RTlow stim = 1,586 ms, mean RThigh stim = 8,700 ms, t(7) = 11.28, Cohens d = 5.15, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P1 also misidentified 5% of words (naming number as nature) under high stimulation on the lmFG electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P2 did not misidentify any words, but was generally unable to name words until the stimulation had ceased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Her self-report suggested an orthographic disruption rather than speech arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for the word illegal, she reported thinking two different words at the same time, and trying to combine them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the word message, she reported thinking that there was an N in the word (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P1 was also asked to name single letters during stimulation in lmFG electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With limited letter trials during stimulation (two low stimulation and five high stimulation), there was no significant difference in reaction time in letter naming between high and low stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, P1 responded incorrectly to two letter stimuli, initially responding A for X, and responding F and then H to the visual stimulus C, both of which he had previously named accurately during the stimulation session (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, naming times for nonorthographic stimuli were not significantly affected by stimulation in lmFG electrodes [P1, faces: mean RTlow stim = 1,211 ms, mean RThigh stim = 1,246 ms, t(12) = 0.11, Cohens d = 0.05, P = 0.92; P2, pictures: mean RTlow stim = 1,350 ms, mean RThigh stim = 1,490 ms, t(10) = 0.18, Cohens d = 0.13, P = 0.86].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Naming times for pictures did not differ between low- and high-stimulation picture trials in P2 despite evidence of afterdischargesabnormal activity that continues after stimulation is turned offon three of four high-stimulation trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No afterdischarges were seen during word naming.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results are consistent with previous reports of selective impairments due to stimulation in the lmFG for reading orthographic stimuli (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the category-specific perceptual alteration seen in P1 and P2 reveals visual feature distortions that are similar to those reported for faces when stimulating right mFG (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stimulation results indicate that disruption of lmFG function impairs both the skilled identification of visual words and sublexical components of word forms (i.e., letters), supportive of the visual word form hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiological_Evidence_for_a_Visual_Word_Form_Representation_in_the_lmFG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next used techniques from machine learning in iEEG data from P1 and P4 to assess the sensitivity of lmFG to sublexical, orthographic statistics (bigram frequency) that has been hypothesized as an indicator for a visual word form system (16, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the dynamics of orthographic statistic sensitivity, we used a multivariate temporal pattern analysis (MTPA) classification procedure to test how the lmFG represents aspects of orthographic knowledge critical to the word form hypothesis at different stages of the time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure sublexical sensitivity as a test of the word form hypothesis, P1 and P4 performed a covert naming task with high- and low-bigram frequency words, controlled for lexical frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MTPA classifier was sensitive to differences between high- and low-bigram frequency during a relatively early time window in both participants (Fig 4; P1: peak accuracy = 58.6%, P less_than 0.05 at 200330 ms after stimulus onset; P4: peak accuracy = 60.2%, P less_than 0.05 at 210310 ms after stimulus onset; all classification analyses were tested using permutation tests to correct for multiple comparisons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with early discrimination in the basal temporal cortex between words and pseudowords in Kanji, which differ in the likelihood and order of cooccurrence of two characters within a word (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been noted that testing the visual word form hypothesis requires examining the representation in lmFG that results primarily from feedforward input from earlier parts of the ventral visual processing stream (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the result that sublexical aspects of orthographic information begin at a relatively early time point in processing is supportive of the word form hypothesis (5, 6, 16, 21, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temporal_Dynamics_of_Word_Individuation_in_lmFG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further elucidate the dynamic nature of orthographic representation, we next looked at the sensitivity of lmFG to different aspects of individual words in P1, P3, and P4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using words that varied in their degree of visual similarity (e.g., words that differed by one letter vs. all letters), we determined at what similarity level an MTPA classifier could discriminate between any two items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that at an early time window after stimulus onset, an MTPA classifier could significantly discriminate between words that did not share any letters (e.g., lint vs. dome; P1: peak classification accuracy = 59.6%, P less_than 0.05 from 120 to 250 ms; P3: peak classification accuracy = 58.3%, P less_than 0.05 from 180 to 360 ms; P4: peak classification accuracy = 60.3%, P less_than 0.05 from 100 to 430 ms, all P values were corrected for multiple time comparisons; Fig 5), but could not discriminate between words that only differed by one letter (e.g., lint vs. hint; P1: peak classification accuracy = 52.7%, P  0.1; P3: peak classification accuracy = 53.7%, P  0.1; P4: peak classification accuracy = 56.6%, P  0.05; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result demonstrates an organization governed by an orthographic similarity space at the sublexical level, a finding consistent with our observation of bigram frequency effects in a relatively early time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, within a later time window, an MTPA classifier could discriminate between any two words (Fig 5); notably, this includes word pairs with only one letter difference (P1: peak classification accuracy = 57.1%, P less_than 0.05 from 360 to 470 ms; P3: peak classification accuracy = 57.3%, P less_than 0.05 from 470 to 640 ms; P4: peak classification accuracy = 59.2%, P less_than 0.05 from 490 to 620 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
P1 showed no difference in reading times based on word length presurgery (mean reading times for three-, five-, and seven-letter words were 583, 589, and 582 ms, respectively; Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1.5 wk, 6 wk, and 3 mo postsurgery, P1 showed a linear increase in reading times as a function of word length after surgery and lmFG resection (mean latency: 1,583 ms), and there was a consistent letter-by-letter reading pattern in each session, with longer latencies for longer words (slopes of 277, 317, and 310 ms per letter in each session; see SI Methods for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2 √ó 3 ANOVA was conducted with session (pre- and postsurgery mean latencies) and word length (three, five, and seven letters) as repeated measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant main effect of session, F(1, 39) = 557.75, 2 = 0.94, P less_than 0.001, with longer latencies in the postsurgery session, and a significant main effect of word length, F(2, 78) = 21.47, 2 = 0.36, P less_than 0.001, with longer words having greater latencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, there was a significant interaction between session and word length, F(2, 78) = 23.33, 2 = 0.37, P less_than 0.001, such that the word length effect was greater postsurgery than presurgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significant increases in naming times from presurgery to postsurgery (average of all three postsessions) were observed for words t(28) = 4.63, d = 1.74, P less_than 0.001, and letters, t(32) = 3.87, d = 1.35, P less_than 0.001, in addition to three-digit numbers, t(35) = 3.49, d = 1.18, P less_than 0.001 (t tests assuming unequal variances and df adjusted based on Levenes test for equality of variances for all three conditions; Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest magnitude increase in naming times was observed with words (103%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of slower numeral naming after removal of the lmFG is consistent with a weaker left hemisphere visual number form area that is also sensitive to letters and words (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant changes were not found for any other categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selectivity of P1s deficits confirms that the resected tissue was an integral component of a symbolic orthographic processing network that operates at both the sublexical and lexical levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings, which indicate that orthographic representation within the lmFG qualitatively shifts over time, provide a novel advancement on the debate about the visual word form hypothesis (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we demonstrated that lmFG meets all of the proposed criteria for a visual word form system: early activity in lmFG coded for orthographic information at the sublexical level, disrupting lmFG activity impaired both lexical and sublexical perception, and early activity reflected an orthographic similarity space (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early activity in lmFG is sufficient to support a gist-level representation of words that differentiates between words with different visual statistics (e.g., orthographic bigram frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, the results in the late time window suggest that orthographic representation in lmFG shifts from gist-level representations to more precise representations sufficient for the individuation of visual words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this late window, the lmFG became nearly insensitive to orthographic similarity as shown by similar classification accuracy for word pairs that differed by one letter compared with word pairs that were completely orthographically different (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of unique encoding of words is required to permit the individuation of visual words, a necessary step in word recognition (see Table 1 for summary).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time window in which this individuation signal is seen suggests that interactions with other brain regions transform the orthographic representation within the lmFG in support of word recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interactivity could function to integrate the orthographic, phonological, and semantic knowledge that together uniquely identifies a written word (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of spatiotemporal resolution to detect dynamic changes in lmFG coding of orthographic stimuli using fMRI may help to explain competing evidence for and against the visual word form hypothesis in the literature (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamic shift in the specificity of orthographic representation in the lmFG has a very similar time course as the coarse-to-fine processing shown in face-sensitive regions of the human fusiform (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that only an gist-level representation is available until 250 ms, and that saccade planning and execution generally occur within 200250 ms during natural reading (34), the gist-to-individuated word-processing dynamic has important implications for neurobiological theories of reading; it suggests that when visual word form knowledge first makes contact with the language system, it is in the form of gist-level information that is insufficient to distinguish between visually similar alternatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the early gist-level representation is consistent with evidence that readers are vulnerable to making errors in word individuation during natural reading, but contextual constraints are normally sufficient to avoid misinterpretations (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, in most cases, accurate individuation is achieved through continued processing that likely involves mutually constraining orthographic, phonological, semantic, and contextual information, resulting in a more precise individuated word representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another notable pattern in the gist-to-individuation temporal dynamic is that during the later time window when individuation is significant (300500 ms; Fig 5), we found that the power to detect category-level word selectivity (i.e., words vs. bodies and scrambled images; Fig 2), which arguably only requires gist-level discrimination, weakened and the event-related potential (ERP) response waned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is also consistent with a temporal selectivity pattern described for faces (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential explanation for this selectivity and power shift could be that individuation is achieved by relatively few neurons (sparse coding) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sparse coding would imply that relatively few word-sensitive neurons were active, and that the summed approximate word-related activity in this time period therefore would be weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the neurons that were active encode for more precise word information, which would explain the significant word individuation reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism underlying the representational shift from gist to individuation could have implications for models of reading disorders, such as dyslexia, where visual word identification is impaired (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the effects of lmFG stimulation, especially slower reading times, are suggestive of acquired (14) and developmental reading pathologies (38), which have been linked to dysfunction of lmFG (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which individual word reading may be impaired by excess noise in the visual word form system, or the inadequate ability to contextually constrain noisy input into the language system, is for future research to untangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our results provide strong evidence that the lmFG is involved in at least two temporally distinguishable processing stages: an early stage that allows for category-level word decoding and gist-level representation organized by orthographic similarity, and a later stage supporting precise word individuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unanswered question is how the representation in the lmFG transitions between stages in these local neural populations and how interactions between areas involved in reading may govern these transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the current results suggest a model in which lmFG contributes to multiple levels of orthographic representation via a dynamic shift in the computational analysis of different aspects of word information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four patients (two males, ages 2545) undergoing surgical treatment for medicine-resistant epilepsy participated in the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study, under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods for demographic and clinical information about each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Paradigm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment paradigm and the data preprocessing method were similar to those described previously by Ghuman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paradigms were programmed in MATLAB using Psychtoolbox and custom-written code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stimuli for the Category Localizer, Covert Naming, Word Individuation, and Stimulation were presented on a 22-inch LCD computer screen placed 2 m from the participants head at the center of the screen (10 √ó 10¬∞ of visual angle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stimuli for P1P3 were identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to a considerable delay in testing, the covert naming and word individuation stimuli were modified and updated for P4 to address additional questions beyond the scope of the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the critical characteristics of the stimuli and contrasts in the analyses remain consistent across all four patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The category localizer was identical for all patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Multivariate_Temporal_Pattern_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that the size of the training set was smaller than the data dimensionality, a low-variance classifier (specifically, Gaussian na√Øve Bayes) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to lower the dimensions in the case of multiway categorical classifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found the dimensionality reduction method was not plausible in the pairwise words classification case, because the smaller number of trials made the estimation of covariance unreliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all classification analyses, the Gaussian na√Øve Bayes classifier was trained based on the data from each time point of 100-ms windows from single trials in the training set (the time course pattern from 100 ms of single-trial potentials) and was used to label the condition of the corresponding data from that time window from the testing trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classification accuracy was estimated by counting the correctly labeled trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was then repeated for all time windows slid with 10-ms steps between 100 and 600 ms relative to the presentation of the stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the multiway categorical classifications with K categories (here, K = 2 or 3), the classification accuracy was estimated through nested leave-P-out cross-validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first level of cross-validation, single-trial potentials were first split into training (80% of the trials) and testing set (20% of the trials) randomly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each random split, PCA was trained based on the training set to lower the dimensionality down to P. Then, LDA was used to project the data into K  1 dimensional space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a Gaussian na√Øve Bayes classifier was trained based on the projected training set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selection of the model parameter P was achieved by finding the P that gave greatest d for Bayes classification based on an additional level of random subsampling validation with 50 repeats using only the training set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After training, true positive and false alarm rates of the target condition were calculated across all of the test trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The d was calculated as d = Z(true positive rate)  Z(false alarm rate), where Z is the inverse of the Gaussian cumulative distribution function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random split was repeated 200 times, and the classification accuracy was estimated by averaging across results from these 200 random splits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the pairwise classification in the word individuation task, the pairwise classification accuracy was estimated through leave-one-out cross-validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for each pair of words, each trial was left out in turn as the testing trial, with the remaining trials used for the training set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the overall pairwise classification accuracy was estimated through averaging across all 190 word pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classification accuracy for each specifically controlled condition was estimated by averaging the corresponding word pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
See SI Methods for details regarding statistical testing of classification accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Patient_Medical_History  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient P1 was a 25-y-old right-handed man with medically intractable epilepsy since the age of 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical onset of his partial complex, secondary generalizing seizures was characterized by behavioral arrest and inability to speak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-3-Tesla (T) MRI was negative for any visible lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had undergone two surgeries before the current one, first a partial anterior temporal lobectomy (7 y prior), and then a second surgery to complete the resection of residual mesial structures (1 y prior).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient exhibited baseline low average to moderately impaired skills on IQ measures, but exhibited stable performance after his first and second surgeries, with the exception of a decline on a verbal memory task after the first surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following further evaluation that included repeat video EEG and magnetoencephalography, the multidisciplinary epilepsy team recommended that the patient undergo intracranial monitoring via stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to attempt to definitively delineate the seizure focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ictal intracranial EEG suggested a seizure focus in the posterior left inferior temporal gyrus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Language mapping was performed for surgical planning purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epilepsy board recommended resection of the presumed seizure onset zone that included portions of the middle, inferior and fusiform gyri, to which the patient consented, after discussion of the potential risks and benefits of surgery, including the eventuality of a reading impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient had a period of seizure freedom for 10 wk following surgery, but subsequently has continued to experience seizures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient P2 was a 31-y-old female with a 4-y duration of medically intractable epilepsy, with seizures occurring several times per week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seizures began as alteration of awareness, progressing to generalized convulsions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patients highest level of education is college coursework, and neuropsychological testing revealed impairment in verbal greater than visual memory, with an estimate of overall intelligence in the low-average range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 3T MRI was normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She underwent left frontotemporal SEEG, which revealed seizure onset in the left anterior mesial temporal lobe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She underwent a left anterior temporal lobectomy and has remained seizure-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient P3 was a 41-y-old-man with a 3-y duration of medically intractable epilepsy, with seizures occurring several times per week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seizures began with automatisms and alteration of awareness, progressing to alterations in speech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patients highest level of education is a high school degree, and neuropsychological testing revealed deficits in verbal learning and memory skills, with overall intelligence estimated in the average range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 3T MRI was normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He underwent bilateral frontotemporal SEEG, which predominately revealed a left anterior temporal neocortical onset zone, with a possible smaller, independent focus in the right frontal operculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He underwent a left anterior temporal lobectomy and has remained seizure-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patient P4 was a 45-y-old female with an 11-y duration of medically intractable epilepsy, with seizures occurring several times per month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seizures began with an aura of anxiety, progressing to automatisms, alteration of awareness, and tongue-biting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patients highest level of education is a master of science, and neuropsychological testing revealed no lateralizing findings, with an estimate of overall intelligence in the high-average range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 3T MRI revealed a lesion in the left inferior temporal gyrus consistent with low-grade glioma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She underwent intracranial monitoring via implantation of left temporal subdural grids and depth electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings were consistent with perilesional seizure onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  She underwent resection of the lesion, found to be a ganglioglioma, and has remained seizure-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
