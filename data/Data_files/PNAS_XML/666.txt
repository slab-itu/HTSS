Regulating plant physiology with organic electronics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hormones play a crucial role in the coordination of the physiological processes within and between the cells and tissues of plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to a lack of capable technologies, direct and dynamic interactions with plants hormone-signaling systems remains limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the use of an organic electronic devicethe organic electronic ion pumpto deliver the plant hormone auxin to the living root tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, inducing differential concentration gradients and modulating plant physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronically regulated transport of aromatic structures such as auxin in an organic electronic device was achieved by synthesis of a previously unidentified class of dendritic polyelectrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such bioelectronic technology opens the door for precise, electronically mediated control of a plants growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The organic electronic ion pump (OEIP) provides flow-free and accurate delivery of small signaling compounds at high spatiotemporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the application of OEIPs has been limited to delivery of nonaromatic molecules to mammalian systems, particularly for neuroscience applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many long-standing questions in plant biology remain unanswered due to a lack of technology that precisely delivers plant hormones, based on cyclic alkanes or aromatic structures, to regulate plant physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the employment of OEIPs for the delivery of the plant hormone auxin to induce differential concentration gradients and modulate plant physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fabricated OEIP devices based on a synthesized dendritic polyelectrolyte that enables electrophoretic transport of aromatic substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of auxin to transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in vivo was monitored in real time via dynamic fluorescent auxin-response reporters and induced physiological responses in roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a starting point for technologies enabling direct, rapid, and dynamic electronic interaction with the biochemical regulation systems of plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we report on the cross-over of molecular delivery technology to plant applications and the capability of transporting aromatic compounds by an OEIP device, enabled by the dendrolyte material system (Fig 1 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OEIP devices were prepared by photolithographic patterning of the cationically functionalized dendrolyte film (2 µm thick) on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape and dimensions of the resulting OEIP device structure are illustrated and pictured in Fig 1 A and C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mass spectrometry was used to quantify the capability of dendrolyte-based OEIPs to transport IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, IAA played the dual role of biologically relevant plant hormone and model aromatic substance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OEIP was operated continuously at 1 µA and samples were collected at 15-min intervals for 135 min (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, OEIPs achieved an averaged IAA delivery rate of 0.45 ± 0.16 pmolmin1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a finite element analysis method (24), based on this measured delivery rate and a basic diffusion model for IAA [that uses the diffusion rate of IAA (34) but neglects potentially biologically relevant parameters such as exogenous uptake and transport within the root], we calculated the expected concentration evolution of delivered IAA as a function of distance from the OEIP outlet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calculation shows that micromolar [IAA] is rapidly established in close proximity to the OEIP delivery tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothetically, plant tissue located 50 m away from the delivery tip would be exposed to 30 M IAA after 60 s whereas tissue located at a distance of 200 m would be exposed to 5 M. Further, it can be observed from the calculation that a near-linear concentration gradient across the lateral position of the root is formed within 515 min of OEIP operation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the cationic dendrolyte material system is capable of transporting IAA in biologically active quantities (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trace amounts of 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid (oxIAA), a known IAA catabolite (36), were also detected during mass spectrometry measurements, typically in concentrations 1001,000 times lower than the measured IAA (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxIAA detected was likely formed by nonenzymatic oxidation of IAA during the OEIP experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, oxIAA has been reported to be inactive in bioassays (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We proceeded to use the dendrolyte-based OEIPs for in vivo experiments on a highly accessible model plant system suitable for live-cell imaging in the intact organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the apical root meristem and early elongation zone of 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings positioned on agar gel were targeted for delivery of IAA via the OEIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root tips were monitored using a horizontally oriented spectral macroconfocal laser-scanning microscope system schematically illustrated in Fig 1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this arrangement, seedlings were positioned and imaged vertically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the OEIP devices we targeted the root apical meristem of Arabidopsis seedlings with IAA (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that IAA can either stimulate or suppress processes such as organ growth in plants, depending on its concentration and the tissue in question (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root growth was used as a rapidly accessible parameter to demonstrate the physiological activity of OEIP-delivered IAA, because it is well established that high IAA concentrations inhibit root elongation (35, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, as a negative control, benzoic acid (38) was delivered by the OEIP device operated in the same configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3A shows bright-field images taken of the OEIP device and seedling root tips at the beginning and after 60 min of delivery of IAA or benzoic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root tip position was measured at 15-min intervals and averaged over five trials, and the growth rate of roots targeted with IAA was compared with benzoic acid negative control and nontargeted Arabidopsis seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For seedlings targeted with IAA, a rapid decrease in growth rate was observed starting at 15 min of delivery, from 4.7 ± 1.0 µmmin1 to 2.4 ± 0.7 µmmin1 after 60 min, whereas both benzoic acid and nontargeted control seedlings maintained their growth rates (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in growth rate of plant seedlings by delivery of IAA via the OEIP is consistent with previous findings on exogenous application of IAA (35, 37) (images of IAA and benzoic acid growth rate trials are available in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To detect, visualize, and monitor IAA delivery in near real time we used two widely used engineered transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the semiquantitative 35S::DII-Venus (39) reporter or DR5rev::GFP (5) marker, both of which show a dynamic fluorescence response in the presence of IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DII-Venus is a negative reporter; IAA causes quenching of the Venus yellow fluorescent protein, leading to an inverse relationship between fluorescence signal and IAA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in DR5rev::GFP, IAA triggers transcription of new GFP, yielding a direct relationship between fluorescence signal and transcriptional response to IAA, which might be correlated to IAA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative IAA abundance is therefore visualized faster and more accurately by DII-Venus than by DR5 (38), because the DII-Venus signal relies on a protein degradation mechanism in direct correlation with IAA concentration rather than the slower transcriptional and translational production mechanisms of DR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using Arabidopsis DII-Venus seedlings, we monitored fluorescent signal intensity and observed onset of strong fluorescence reduction between 3060 min (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar roots targeted with the control molecule benzoic acid preserved their fluorescence (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analyses comparing normalized fluorescent intensities of DII-Venus seedlings targeted with IAA or benzoic acid, as well as nontargeted controls, revealed a strong and significant decrease in fluorescence only after IAA delivery via the OEIP (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second experiment we used the dendrolyte-based OEIP to target the elongation zone of DR5rev::GFP reporter seedlings with IAA (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal images of the root elongation zone cells revealed the onset of fluorescence in plant tissues after 1 h and the signal continued to increase between 2 and 3 h (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the image sequence and lateral intensity profile, significant variation in the lateral fluorescent intensity of the roots can be observedwith cells on the left side (OEIP side) of the root being brighter than those on the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lateral intensity variation is consistent with the [IAA] gradients calculated from the diffusion model (Fig 2B) and was observed in most DR5 trials (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roots targeted with the control molecule benzoic acid did not display alterations in fluorescent intensity of the DR5 reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a dendrolyte-based OEIP device, we were able to demonstrate delivery of an aromatic compoundthe plant-signaling hormone IAA (auxin)to a living plant model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of dynamic auxin-response alterations was visualized in near real time using two different fluorescent auxin reporters in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this method, we elicited rapid physiological changes in the growth rate of developing Arabidopsis roots and observed induced differential lateral [IAA] gradients across root tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results were made possible by the dendrolyte material, a hyperbranched dendritic core-shell polyelectrolyte system that addresses many of the previous limitations of OEIPs and other iontronic technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hyperbranched polyglycerol dendrolyte system, used as the ion transport channel of the OEIP, enables the controlled transport of larger and more rigid ionic compounds while overcoming the limited control of important polyelectrolyte materials parameters such as porosity, swelling, and processability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in addition to the natural auxin hormone IAA, the capability of the dendrolyte-based OEIP devices to deliver other aromatic substances was also verified using the synthetic auxin analog 1-NAA (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the dendrolyte system was rationally designed to address materials parameters such as porosity, swelling, and processability, in this study no systematic optimizations were made of the many tailorable parameters of the polyelectrolyte (i.e., size of the dendritic core shell, length of the cross-linking polymer, degree of cross-linking, and degree or type of functionalization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fully expect that these parameters will have a significant role in the polyelectrolytes transport characteristics and corresponding influence on organic electronic device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, given that the majority of plant hormones such as abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, gibberellins, and cytokinins are all of comparable size and similar cyclic or aromatic molecular structure, this work provides the foundation for organic electronic devices that are capable of delivering a wide assortment of biomolecules to directly interact with many fundamental chemical signaling systems in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seedling root growth rate was used as an easily accessible physiological parameter to demonstrate OEIP-mediated delivery of IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies can leverage the larger ion transport capabilities afforded by the dendrolyte materials for more detailed investigations of the role that auxin plays during many growth and behavioral process such as cellular morphogenesis, cell elongation and planar polarity, regulation of cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and cell wall formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, by coupling dendrolyte materials with other recent advancements in OEIP technology, such as multiple addressing points and rapid onoff speeds (40), it will become possible to create more sophisticated tools to produce complex, electronically controlled hormone concentration gradients with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OEIP-based technologies were envisioned and developed primarily for mammalian systems, ultimately as therapeutics for humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that this study serves as a reminder that chemical signaling plays a fundamental role in all biological systems, and such an anthropocentric focus has overlooked many complimentary and potentially important application areas for organic electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate this technology to be the starting point for precise regulation of chemical signaling networks inand betweenplants and other living systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dendrolyte_Membrane_and_OEIP_Device_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Circular PET substrates (Policrom screens) with diameter 101.6 mm (4 inch) were washed with acetone and water and subsequently dried at 110 °C for 10 min before they were treated with 02 plasma (150 W for 60 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activated substrates were spin-coated with a 2-mL solution of 5% (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS; Alfa Aesar) in water at 500 rpm (Photo Resist Spinner Model 4000; Electronic Micro Systems) for 30 s and allowed to rest in open air for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surfaces were washed with ethanol (EtOH) and dried at 110 °C for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treated surfaces were spin-coated with 2 mL MeOH stock solution containing 264 mg of dendrolyte material [Compound C in Dendritic Polyglycerol-Allyl-Butyltrimethylphosphonium Chloride (Compound C)], 18 mg Thiocure 1300 (Bruno Bock Chemische Fabrik GmbH & Co), and 18 mg Irgacure 2959 (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV cross-linking was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box and the films were exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ion channels were patterned using photolithography of Microposit S1818 photoresist and developed for 60 s in MF319 (both supplied by Shipley).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unpatterened, cross-linked dendrolyte material was removed using a CF4 + O2 reactive ion etch (150 W for 90 s) and remaining photoresist was removed with acetone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate ion exchange, patterned wafers were soaked in 1 M NaCl(aq) for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OEIPs were encapsulated with 2× 10-m bar-coated DuPont 5018 UV curing ink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual OEIP devices were cut out and packaged in ADW-400 heat-shrink tubing containing sealant glue (Kacab Teknik AB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OEIP delivery tips were shaped by hand using a scalpel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To hydrate the dendrolyte channel, OEIP devices were soaked and stored in deionized water before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to reduce the amount of unreacted polymers and chemical compounds remaining in the polyelectrolyte after the above processing steps, OEIP devices were preconditioned by operating the device with 0.1 M KCl(aq) in both the target and source reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the KCl flushing, OEIP devices underwent a loading phase to exchange the Cl ions in the polyelectrolyte with IAA; OEIPs were operated continuously at 250 nA until steady voltage characteristics were observed (12 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_Material_and_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. thaliana seedlings expressing the auxin-responsive fluorescent markers 35S::DII-Venus (39) or DR5rev::GFP (5) were used to monitor the response to IAA delivered via OEIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, seeds of both genotypes and wild-type Col-0 were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, incubated in pool cleaner (550 mg/g trichloroisocyanuric acid, one tablet per 2,000 mL H2O; Biltema) for 12 min and washed four times with sterile, distilled water (dH2O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seeds were plated on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) (Duchefa Biochemie), 0.5 g/L MES (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% sucrose, and 0.7% plant agar (Duchefa) growth medium, pH 5.6 (120- × 120-mm square Petri-dishes; Gosselin), and vernalized for 3 d at 4 °C in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were then placed in a growth chamber in vertical orientation and the seedlings were grown at 23 °C with 16 h of light per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve hours before the start of the experiments, 5 d postgermination, seedlings were positioned onto fresh plates of identical MS media composition additionally supplemented with 0.01 M KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescent_Imaging_Protocol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A custom reoriented macro confocal laser-scanning microscope with a vertical stage was used to acquire images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The macro confocal consisted of a horizontally placed AZ100 macroscope (Nikon and Bergman-Labora) adapted with a specially built XYZ motorized stage (Prior Scientific fitted by Bergman-Labora) and supplied with diascopic white light and episcopic fluorescence light (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A climate enclosure with passive humidification was designed to surround the stage area to keep plants in a humid, dark environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AZ100 macroscope was connected to a C2+ confocal laser scanning system (Nikon) equipped with lasers for 405-nm, 457/488/514-nm, and 561-nm excitation and a transmitted light detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A coarse manipulator, MM-89 (Narishige), was attached to the stage for placing and keeping the OEIP at a specific position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An agar-growth plate from which the lid was removed was placed vertically on the macroconfocal stage and an OEIP loaded with IAA was placed with the delivery outlet in the growth agar in close proximity of the seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imaging, a 2× AZ Plan Fluor objective (N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.2, WD 45 mm; Nikon) or a 5× AZ Plan Fluor objective (N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.5, WD 16 mm; Nikon) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation was at 488 nm and emission detected with a 525/50 filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DII-Venus fluorescence intensities from a single confocal image layer were normalized to initial intensity, averaged, and compared (standard deviation of the mean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DR5rev::GFP image intensities were summed from 16 z-stack layers with 3-µm spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral fluorescent intensity, plotted at the bottom of each image (Fig 5C), was summed along the y axis and normalized to the maximum intensity of the image sequence (the image sequence for all root trials is shown in Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the OEIPs ability to deliver the synthetic auxin 1-naphthalene acetic acid (1-NAA) and observed similar dynamic fluorescence quenching in DII-Venus reporter seedlings (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

OEIP_Operation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immediately before the experiments, the OEIPs were operated in a target solution of 105 M KCl(aq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Keithley 2612b SourceMeter (Keithley Instruments Inc.) and custom LabVIEW (National Instruments Corp.) software were used to source current and record voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OEIP device was turned on immediately before the first imaging sequence and operated at a constant electrical current of 1 A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, the OEIP delivery tip was submerged in the MS media in close proximity (100200 m) to the root epidermal tissue (Fig 3 B and C) and was held at a fixed position in the growth MS media for the duration of each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mass_Spectrometry_Measurement_Protocol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The OEIP reservoir was loaded with 80 µL of 10% methanol in dH2O containing IAA at 105 M concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OEIP outlet tip was submerged in target solution of 50 µL of 1/2 MS media, pH 5.7 (Plant Material and Growth Conditions) without agar and containing 0.01 M KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes on a PET substrate (cut from Orgacon F-350 film; AGFA-Gevaert) were used in the source reservoir and the target solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OEIP pump was operated sourcing a constant current of 1 µA using a Keithley 2612b SourceMeter and custom LabVIEW software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target solution was collected and replaced with fresh solution every 15 min, at time intervals of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, and 135 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In between the analyses, the pump was washed with methanol/dH2O and stored in dH2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was repeated five times with the same OEIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the amount of IAA (and oxIAA) pumped into the target solution, IAA quantification was performed according to Novák et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42) with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 20 µL from each target solution was mixed with 500 µL of dH2O and purified by solid phase extraction using hydrophiliclipophilic balance reversed-phase sorbent columns (Oasis HLB, 1 cc/30 mg; Waters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before purification, 4 pmol of [13C6]-labeled IAA and 4 pmol of [13C6]-labeled oxIAA were added to each sample as internal standards to validate the quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified samples were analyzed using an LC-MRM-MS (liquid chromatographymultiple reaction monitoringmass spectrometry) system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LC-MS system consisted of 1290 Infinity Binary LC System coupled to 6490 Triple Quad LC/MS System with Jet Stream and Dual Ion Funnel technologies (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatograms were analyzed using MassHunter software version B.05.02 (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Milli-Q deionization unit (Millipore) was used for preparation of the purified water for mobile phases and solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2-oxo-[indole-13C6]-IAA was obtained from Olchemim Ltd., and [indole-13C6]-IAA was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other chromatographic solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade or higher purity from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To estimate the amount of IAA pumped into the target solution, IAA quantification was performed according to Novák et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42) by an injection of 20 µL from target solution directly into an LC-MRM-MS system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LC-MS system consisted of 1290 Infinity Binary LC System coupled to 6490 Triple Quad LC/MS System with Jet Stream and Dual Ion Funnel technologies (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatograms were analyzed using MassHunter software version B.05.02 (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Milli-Q deionization unit (Millipore) was used for preparation of the purified water for mobile phases and solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other chromatographic solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade or higher purity from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
