Vibrations of a molecule in an external force field  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vibration of a molecule adsorbed on a surface contains essential information on the moleculesurface bond, which is important to understand the surface reactions that occur, e.g., in catalytic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessing the vibrational energies of a single molecule is possible by combining scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tip of a microscope exerts a force on a nearby molecule, and possibly even induces slight structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study this problem, we have further incorporated atomic force microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between the exerted forces and vibrational energies is well reproduced by a classical mechanical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combined technique opens the possibility to study the atomic-scale interaction of a molecule on a surface with unprecedented precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oscillation frequencies of a molecule on a surface are determined by the mass distribution in the molecule and the restoring forces that occur when the molecule bends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoring force originates from the atomic-scale interaction within the molecule and with the surface, which plays an essential role in the dynamics and reactivity of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1998, a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic tunneling spectroscopy revealed the vibrational frequencies of single molecules adsorbed on a surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the probe tip itself exerts forces on the molecule, changing its oscillation frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine atomic force microscopy with inelastic tunneling spectroscopy and measure the influence of the forces exerted by the tip on the lateral vibrational modes of a carbon monoxide molecule on a copper surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the experimental data to a mechanical model of the vibrating molecule shows that the bonds within the molecule and with the surface are weakened by the proximity of the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of techniques can be applied to analyze complex molecular vibrations and the mechanics of forming and loosening chemical bonds, as well as to study the mechanics of bond breaking in chemical reactions and atomic manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurements of the vibrational energy of the CO molecule under the force field of the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic images of FT mode (Left) where the C and O atoms deflect in the same direction and FR mode (Right) where they deflect in opposite directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Schematic image of an experimental setup, where a CO molecule on a Cu(111) surface is investigated with a single atom tip by combining AFM and STM-IETS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both measurements, the tip is oscillated at a zero-to-peak amplitude of A = 20 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbol of 2 × A in the figure stands for peak-to-peak height of the amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical distance z is defined to be the distance between the average position of the oscillating tip and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At z = 0, the conductance of a nonoscillating tip (A = 0) would reach the conductance quantum G0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and D) Typical constant-height (C) current and (D) frequency images on a CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Constant-height frequency shift (f) with sweeping the tip along the x direction while changing the vertical distance z by 5 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample bias is 0 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (F) The vertical force (Fz) is acquired by deconvoluting the frequency shift f (x, z) distribution in the z direction, where the long-range background force is subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (G) The tipsample interaction potential extracted by integrating Fz(x, z) in the z direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (H) Lateral force acquired by differentiating the potential energy with respect to the x axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H (Inset) shows that a lateral restoring force with force constant kx acts between the tip and the CO molecule when the latter is located beneath the tip apex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (I) Tip-height-dependent normalized IETS of the FT modes measured at the lateral potential minimum of the attractive force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (J and K) Tip-height-dependent normalized IETS of the FR mode (J) at negative bias and (K) at positive bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (L) Tip-height-dependent vibrational energy of the FT and FR modes at positive bias (solid lines), negative bias (dotted lines), and average values (squares).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, the tip is laterally scanned above a CO molecule at constant height, obtaining a single dip in the current image (Fig 1C) as well as in the frequency-shift image (Fig 1D), confirming that the tip apex consists of a single atom (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, to determine the vertical and lateral force acting between the tip and CO molecule, the tip is scanned laterally along the x direction while changing the vertical position of the sensor z by 5 pm between subsequent scans, as shown in Fig 1E (15, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deconvoluting the frequency-shift distribution f(x, z) in the z direction yields the vertical force, which includes both short-range and long-range forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short-range force, Fz(x, z), can be estimated by subtracting the long-range force measured on the Cu surface far from the CO molecule, which is shown in Fig 1F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integration of Fz(x, z) in the z direction yields the potential energy U(x, z) between the CO molecule and the tip, as shown in Fig 1G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation of the potential energy with respect to x provides the lateral force Fx(x, z) shown in Fig 1H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zero of the z axis is chosen at the point contact, where the tunneling conductance would reach the conductance quantum G0 = 2e2/h  (12,906 )1 with a nonoscillating sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1E, z denotes the average vertical position of the oscillating sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1 IK displays the normalized IET spectra for the frustrated translational (FT) modes and the frustrated rotational (FR) modes for a distance range from z = 270 to 130 pm, where the normalized IET spectra denote the second derivative of the IV curve (d2I/dV2) divided by the conductance (dI/dV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (During the IETS measurements, the tip oscillates with an amplitude of A = 20 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1 IK, z denotes the average vertical position of the oscillating sensor.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra were taken at the centers of the CO images which coincide with the position of the potential minima (Fig 1 C and D) and the background IETS, measured on the Cu substrate (21), has been subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1L displays the energy shifts extracted from Fig 1 IK as a function of distance z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the FT mode increases almost by 30% for the closest tipsample distances, the FR mode decreases in energy by a few percent only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effect of the tip position on the vibrational modes of the molecule, the effect of the vertical (Fz) and lateral (Fx) forces exerted by the tip on the CO molecule needs to be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As elaborated in SI Appendix, these forces are simply related by the actionreaction law to the forces (Fx, Fz) exerted by the molecule on the tip, shown in Fig 1 F and H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 A and B shows a schematic model describing CO lateral and vertical vibration modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lateral modes, the vibrations are described by a classical double-pendulum model with arms l1 and l2, and the C and O atoms have masses m1 and m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential energy of the pendulum is U = D112/2 + D2(2  1)2/2, where 1 is the angle between the CuC bond and the surface normal and 2 is the angle between the CO bond and the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D1 is the angular force constant that keeps the CuC bond upright (at 1 = 0) and D2 is the angular force constant that keeps the bonds CuC and CO in line (at 2 = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a semiclassical approach similar to the calculations of phonons in crystals (22) with the Lagrange formalism (23), we solve the equation of motion for small oscillations of the double pendulum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the vibrational energies EFT = 4.2 meV and EFR = 35.4 meV (8, 9, 21, 24) and the bonding lengths l1 = 187 pm and l2 = 115 pm (25), the two angular force constants are calculated to be D1 = 135 zNm and D2 = 216 zNm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantization must be taken into account to estimate the zero-point amplitude of the vibrations: The FT mode has an energy spectrum given by (nFT) = (1/2 + nFT) × FT, where  is Plancks constant and  is the angular frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation number nFT is an integer and FT = 4.2 meV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FR mode is described by an analogous expression with FR = 35.4 meV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account that the measured temperature of 4.4 K times Boltzmanns constant (kBT = 0.38 meV) is considerably smaller than the vibrational energies, the ground state can be assumed to be fully populated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the uncertainty in the x position of the CO molecule due to Heisenbergs uncertainty principle is estimated as (/2mCOFT)1/2 = 14 pm with the CO mass of mCO = 28 × u, where u is the unified atomic mass unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FR mode has an even smaller spatial uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the lateral displacement is well below 100 pm for both modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these small displacements, the CO molecule approximately feels a linear restoring force with the force constant kx = dFx/dx from the tip when the tip is located on the potential minimum (see Fig 1H, Inset) along with vertical force Fz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we introduce the perturbation potential induced by the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the influence of the tipsample force on that potential, we assume that the force only acts on the O atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasoning behind this assumption is that while attractive forces between atoms typically decay by a factor of 10 per 100 pm (= 1 Å), repulsive forces decay typically even faster and the O atom is at least 100 pm nearer to the tips front atom than the C atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the hypothetical case where the force acts only on the C atom in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The force between the tip and the O atom alters the potential, introducing a perturbation Utip, neglecting terms beyond second order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left column in Fig 2C shows the deflection of the CO molecule in the frustrated translational mode and the corresponding energy scale below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second column (lateral Fts) in Fig 2C shows the influence of the lateral force gradient between tip and O atom at close distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As outlined in the energy parabola below, the influence is quite large, comparable to the influence of an attractive vertical force shown in the third column (vertical Fts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth column (bond elongation) illustrates the influence of bond lengthening due to the normal forcewhen the tip pulls at the CO molecule, the bonding lengths l1 and l2 become slightly longer for the vertical spring constants of K1 = 208 N/m and K2 = 1,690 N/m (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will lower the frequency, but only by a minute amountthe influence on the potential had to be magnified by a factor of 10 to be noticeable in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stronger effect occurs when we assume that the presence of the tip directly influences the strength of the bonds between the Cu surface and carbon atom (decrease of D1) and the bond angle of CuCO (decrease of D2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2D discusses the various effects of the tipsample force on the FR mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the FT mode is mainly influenced by kx, Fz and the decrease of D1, the FR mode is mainly affected by Fz and the decrease of D2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 summarizes the experimental results and the comparison with the classical double-pendulum model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3A, the experimental energy-shift values from Fig 1L are compared with the results from the model with unchanged angular force constants D1 and D2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the FT mode shows a reasonable agreement between experiment and model, the FR mode experimentally drops slightly in energy, but should rise sharply according to the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy can be explained by the influence of the tip on the bonds between the oxygen atom, the carbon atom, and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While an ideal spring has a constant spring constant when elongated, a chemical bond is generally weakened when stretched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bond softening (or hardening for reducing the bonding length) is already modeled in the widely used Morse potential (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, several previous studies indicate that the proximity of the tip during measurement changes the strength of the bonds between the CO molecule and the Cu surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bartels et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) have found experimentally that CO adsorbed on Cu can be picked up by the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the CO molecule has to flip around by 180° during pickup, the bond between CO and Cu surface must become weaker first, probably induced by the proximity of the biased tip and its associated electrostatic field (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hofer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27) also find quite substantial relaxations of surface atoms at close tip proximity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a recent refined measurement of the force needed to move a CO molecule across a Cu surface has shown that this force is only about half as big as expected from the surface diffusion potential (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have to consider that the presence of the tip weakens the bond within the molecule and between the adsorbate and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model this effect, we use the vertical force Fz as a parameter that describes the strength of the perturbation and introduce an empirical parameter  that is a measure of the weakening of angular force constants D1,2, yielding perturbed angular force constants D1,2 = D1,2 × (1   × Fz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fit to experiment yields D1 = 143 zNm, D2 = 219 zNm, and  = 0.033%/pN, amounting to a maximal weakening of 5% for D1,2 at the maximal attractive force of Fz = 150 pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, the introduction of the bond softening effect yields an excellent fit between theory and experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tip-induced energy shift and its interpretation are further investigated with a tip presenting a different apex, which we call tip 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to the tip used for the data in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 as tip 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The force curves acquired by these two tips are shown in Fig 4A, where we see that the maximum attractive force for tip 2 is 235 pN, i.e., 50% larger than that the case of tip 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the z position showing the attractive force maximum is larger than that for tip 1 by 30 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z-dependent vibrational energies of the FT and FR modes for tip 2 (SI Appendix) is plotted in Fig 4B with the data by tip 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to the case of tip 1, we see a small change in the FR mode energy and a large change in the FT mode energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we see a prominent change of the FT mode energy for tip 2 than that of tip 1, which is consistent with the feature of the vertical force in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model calculation with and without the bond weakening (SI Appendix) supports the preference of the latter model as shown in Fig 4C, where the best fitting is acquired by the following parameters: D1 = 145 zNm, D2 = 219 zNm, and  = 0.029%/pN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters are almost identical to the values in the case of tip 1: The validity of our model considering the bond elongation is confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The idea of bond elongation also enables us to explain the dependence of normalized IETS intensity on tip height, shown in Fig 5A: The intensity increases sharply when reducing z from 270 to 170 pm, flattens around z = 150 pm, and finally decreases again for z approaching 130 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To interpret this trend of the intensity, we note that there are two important factors in the IETS intensity (21): (i) the ratio of current passing through the CO molecule compared with through space tunneling, and (ii) the probability of the inelastic process per electron passing through the CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5B, the ratio of the tunneling current on the CO molecule to that on the Cu substrate (ICO/ICu) is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that a CO molecule is less electrically conductive than a vacuum gap (28)it appears as a dip in a constant-height STM imagethe minimum value of ICO/ICu observed at the z position marked by the asterisk indicates that the fraction of electrons tunneling through the CO molecule is maximized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5A, the IETS intensity also reaches its maximum at this z position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coincidence of the trend between the IETS intensity and ICO/ICu indicates the importance of the first factor (i) outlined above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why does the ratio ICO/ICu show the dependence of Fig 5B?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the reasons is the structural change of the CO molecule by the short-range force shown in Fig 5C, which can be separated into four distance regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In regime I, the tip is so far from the molecule that the force is negligibly small, in II the force is attractive, III indicates maximal attraction, and in IV the force becomes less attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the force from the tip pulls on the CO molecule, the CO molecule and the Cu atom it is bonded to are pulled out of the surface, indicated by the schematic drawings in Fig 5D (Right), which should contribute to the increase of the solid angle viewed from the tip to the CO molecule and result in the decrease of ICO/ICu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the reason of the increase of ICO/ICu after the point marked by the asterisk is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further theoretical studies of both elastic and inelastic transport based on combined DFT and nonequilibrium Greens function calculations (2931) are needed to fully understand the z-dependent elastic current and IETS intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we would like to discuss the points which should be addressed in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we described in the Introduction, there are previous studies using STM-IETS that have reported a tip-induced vibrational energy shift for the same CO/Cu(111) system as here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 are located between our data by the two different tips (SI Appendix): Both data are consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the significant decrease of the FT mode and FR mode energies observed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 for their smallest z is not confirmed in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the lower limit of z is restricted in our present setup: Large currents induce uncontrolled tip oscillations for the very small z values that are expected to be needed to access the region of very strong energy decrease of FT and FR modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the uncontrolled tip oscillation, we intentionally oscillate the tip during the IETS measurements, which leads to additional broadening of the IETS signal on top of the conventional broadening sources of the temperature and the modulation voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Even when the feedback control of the amplitude is active, the uncontrolled oscillation occurs for a very small z.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This broadening prevents us from observing the lifting of the two degenerate vibrational modes of a CO molecule on a Cu(111) surface which is expected to occur when placing the tip on an asymmetrical position of the potential (i.e., off-center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experimental hurdle should be overcome in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have measured the potential energy between a CO molecule on a Cu(111) surface and an apex of a metallic tip and its influence on the vibrational energy of the CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data clearly show that bond elongation and bond weakening occur, because the mere addition of the perturbation force is insufficient to precisely reproduce the changes of the vibrational energies under the force field of the approaching tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that if we use a CO functionalized tip as an atomically sized cantilever without an external oscillation source, we have to consider that this cantilever (32, 33) does alter its stiffness k due to tipsample interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not the case for mesoscopic or macroscopic cantilevers that show a constant stiffness k independent of the tipsample interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of AFM with STM-IETS allows us to precisely quantify these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All measurements were carried out at 4.4 K by an ultrahigh vacuum low-temperature STM and AFM (LT-SPM by ScientaOmicron GmbH) with custom-made qPlus force sensors (34) and custom-made filters for radio-frequency noise attenuation in spectroscopy measurements and for the frequency shift measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qPlus sensor has a stiffness of k = 1,800 N/m, a resonant frequency of f0 = 55,031 Hz, and is oscillated with a zero-to-peak amplitude of A = 20 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample substrate was a Cu(111) surface that was cleaned by repeated sputtering and annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clean sample was then dosed with CO gas to create a low coverage of CO molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tip was made from a cut iridium wire, cleaned by field evaporation and poked into the copper surface several times in situ to prepare the tip, which was sharp and consisted of a single atom on its apex as confirmed by constant-height current and f images (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S9) (carbon monoxide front atom identification) (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the oscillating tip comes close to the sample, an average force gradient less_thankts acts between tip and sample that shifts the resonant frequency of the sensor by f = f0less_thankts/2k (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this frequency shift f is measured from a minimal z value (zmin) up to a z value where f is essentially zero (a few nanometers are usually sufficient), the vertical force can be recovered from f by first calculating the force gradient less_thankts and then, e.g., by using the SaderJarvis method (36), taking into account recent limitations of its applicability (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short-range force between the tip and the CO molecule, Fz(z), is derived by subtracting the force curve on the Cu(111) surface from that on the CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further integral of Fz(z) yields the potential energy U(z).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2D force components along the vertical (z) and lateral (x) direction were measured by consecutively scanning the tip along the x direction, and decreasing the vertical distance for every scanline by 5 pm (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting 2D distribution of frequency shift f(x, z) is converted to the 2D distribution of the vertical force by the SaderJarvis method (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D short-range vertical force, Fz(x, z), is acquired by subtracting the vertical force on the Cu(111) away from the CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of Fz(x, z) along the z direction results in the 2D distribution of the potential energy U(x, z) (15, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation of the potential energy with respect to x provides the 2D distribution of the lateral force Fx(x, z).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tunneling current (I) is averaged over many cycles of the sensor oscillation, as the bandwidth of the current acquisition is smaller than f0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the conductance (dI/dV) and IET signal (d2I/dV2), a modulation voltage (2,338.7 Hz and 1-mVrms amplitude) is added to the sample bias, and the first and second harmonics in the current are detected by a lock-in amplifier (HF2LI; Zurich Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the text, the IETS signal is normalized to the conductance (6, 21), i.e., (d2I/dV2)/(dI/dV) has been plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete set of the IETS are shown in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3, S4, and S10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
