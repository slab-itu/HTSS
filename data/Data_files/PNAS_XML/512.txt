Neutrophils induce proangiogenic T cells with a regulatory phenotype in pregnancy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophils are typically known as short-lived cells that act as the first line of defense in response to pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, emerging data indicate that neutrophils have wider implications in the immune system and have a direct influence on the ensuing immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishment of successful pregnancy requires immune tolerance at the maternalfetal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrations in normal placental development can lead to complications, including preeclampsia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we examined a role for maternal neutrophils in maintaining normal pregnancy through their interactions with T cells, resulting in a population of T cells that are both regulatory and proangiogenic and are required for normal placental development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interactions are absent in patients with preeclampsia, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for pregnancy-related pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although neutrophils are known to be fundamental in controlling innate immune responses, their role in regulating adaptive immunity is just starting to be appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that human neutrophils exposed to pregnancy hormones progesterone and estriol promote the establishment of maternal tolerance through the induction of a population of CD4+ T cells displaying a GARP+CD127loFOXP3+ phenotype following antigen activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophil-induced T (niT) cells produce IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF and promote vessel growth in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophil depletion during murine pregnancy leads to abnormal development of the fetal-maternal unit and reduced empbryo development, with placental architecture displaying poor trophoblast invasion and spiral artery development in the maternal decidua, accompanied by significantly attenuated niT cell numbers in draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CD45 congenic cells, we show that induction of niT cells and their regulatory function occurs via transfer of apoptotic neutrophil-derived proteins, including forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), to T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike in women with healthy pregnancies, neutrophils from blood and placental samples of preeclamptic women fail to induce niT cells as a direct consequence of their inability to transfer FOXO1 to T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, neutrophil-selective FOXO1 knockdown leads to defective placentation and compromised embryo development, similar to that resulting from neutrophil depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data define a nonredundant function of neutrophilT cell interactions in the regulation of vascularization at the maternalfetal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Healthy_Volunteer_and_Patient_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All volunteers provided informed consent before participating in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For in vitro experiments, blood was collected from healthy male volunteers (aged 2135 y) between 10 and 11 AM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This collection was approved by the East London and The City Local Research Ethics Committee (QMREC2014.61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patient samples, blood and placental samples from healthy and preeclamptic women were collected at University College, under approval from the London and South-East Research Ethics Committee (13/LO/0287).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient demographic information is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both healthy volunteer and patient blood samples were collected in 3.2% sodium citrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neutrophil_Depletion_and_Reconstitution_During_Allogeneic_Pregnancies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All in vivo experiments were conducted under the Home Office regulation following approval by the Queen Mary University of London Ethics Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here 8- to 12-wk-old Balb/C male mice were mated with aged-matched C57 BL/6 females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following identification of a vaginal plug, circulating maternal neutrophils were depleted at days 5 and 8 using a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (Biolegend, clone IA8; 50 g i.v.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils were reconstituted at indicated times during the pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils were made from bone marrow progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progenitors were isolated via negative selection (Stem Cell Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following an initial lentiviral transduction (24 h) to knock down forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), cells were washed and incubated in Iscoves modified Dulbeccos medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 100 ng/mL recombinant murine GCSF for 5 d. Female CD45.1 (Ly5.1) mice were kindly provided by Andrew Cope, Kings College London.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were originally obtained from Charles River Italy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check for congenic markers after adoptive transfer of donor CD45.1 neutrophils, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse CD45.1 (Biolegend; clone A20), along with Alexa Fluor 450-conjugated CD45.2 (eBioscience; clone 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophils and autologous T cells were cocultured as described above in Nunc Lab-TekII Chamber Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After coculture, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then blocked for 3 h with PBS containing 0.1% fish skin gelatin and 1% FCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-human MRP8 (Abcam; clone CF-145) at 4 °C overnight, followed by staining with secondary antibodies mouse Alexa Fluor 555 and mouse Alexa Fluor 488 along with nuclear stain DAPI (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human cells were labeled with mouse anti-human FOXO1/FKHR MAb (R&D Systems; clone 597554).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse placentas were embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectional sections were made and imaged to identify all placental layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antigen retrieval was carried out using sodium citrate buffer and staining for H&E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some placental sections were also stained for CD31 (AbD Serotec; clone ER-MP12), cytokeratin-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FITC-conjugated, clone RCK-105), and DAPI (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E images were acquired on a Pannoramic 250 high-throughput scanner (3DHISTECH) at 43× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence images were acquired on a Leica Ariol System at 20× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image analysis was performed using ImageJ, and scale bars were added onto the overlaid images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferronis post hoc test using GraphPad Prism 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, several experiments were analyzed by Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as mean ± SEM, and a P value less_than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human_Neutrophils_Exposed_to_Pregnancy_Hormones_Induce_T_Cells_with_a_Regulatory-Like_Phenotype_and_Proangiogeneic_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study a potential role for neutrophils in maternal tolerance, we tested whether neutrophils exposed to pregnancy hormones could affect T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils from healthy male donors were used to minimize any effects from endogeneous progesterone and estrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male cells express the same levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors on leukocytes as females (17), and thus respond to both hormones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils (SI Appendix, Fig S1A) were incubated with either progesterone (P; SI Appendix, Fig S1B) or the placental estrogen estriol (E3), or in combination (hereinafter E3P), at 100 ng/mL, physiological pregnancy levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of neutrophils for 30 min with E3P led to a distinct CD16loCD62LloCD11bloAnxA1hi phenotype (Fig 1A), typical of an anti-inflammatory/quiescent neutrophil status (14, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of E3P neutrophils to autologous carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled T cells (+ anti-CD3, anti-CD28 mAbs), enhanced T-cell proliferation (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These T cells produced significant levels of IL-10, IL-17, IL-2, and IL-5, but not of IFN-, compared with T cells activated in the presence of vehicle-treated neutrophils or on their own (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils cultured alone did produce cytokines, confirming their purity and the absence of contaminating monocytes (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the increased levels of regulatory cytokines detected in E3P-treated neutrophilT-cell cocultures, we defined their phenotypic and functional characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant increase in the proportion of total CD4+CD45RO+ T cells expressing high levels of FOXP3 was quantified in the divided T-cell population, with low levels of CD127 and high levels of the latency-associated peptide receptor Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant (GARP) (Fig 1D and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1D and S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of Tregs by E3P-treated neutrophils relied on TCR stimulation, given that neutrophils failed to induce FOXP3 expression in unstimulated T cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coculture with neutrophils led to equal expansion of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells from the starting naïve T-cell population, regardless of neutrophil hormone treatment (Fig 1E, Left); however, expression levels of FOXP3 and GARP were induced in CD45RO+ T-cells selectively when cocultured with E3P neutrophils (Fig 1F, Right), indicating that this pathway of differentiation occurs during T-cell priming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further analyses revealed that these neutrophil-induced T (niT) cells coexpressed GARP and PD1 (SI Appendix, Fig S2C), a phenotype typical of functionally suppressive human TCR-activated FOXP3+ Tregs (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression assays revealed that niT cells were also functionally suppressive, which was cell contact-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig S2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggested signaling of neutrophils to T cells during activation, either by direct cellcell contact or through the release of large cell material ( greater than 0.4 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hormone effect on neutrophils was specific to E3P; treatment of neutrophils with third trimester levels of estrone, 17--estradiol, or -human chorionic gonadotrophin (in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL progesterone) did not induce niT cells following coculture (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils from healthy female donors (regardless of stage of menstrual cycle) induced niT cells even without stimulation with E3P (SI Appendix, Fig S3 B and C), likely owing to continued exposure to high levels of progesterone, given that this hormone on its own was sufficient to induce niT cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further analyses revealed that niT cells produce IL-10 and IL-17 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-17producing Tregs have been described previously (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-17 has been shown to have proangiogenic functions by inducing the release of growth factors, including VEGF (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants from T cells cocultured with E3P neutrophils also contained significant levels of VEGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the VEGF production in our system was induced by IL-17, we used an antiIL-17 neutralizing strategy, which impaired VEGF production (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, intracellular staining confirmed VEGF production by niT cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the proangiogenic function of niT cells in vitro using Matrigel-based assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2D shows that supernatants from niT cells (E3P), but not controls, significantly augmented both vessel length and number of branch points, and was inhibited on IL-17 or VEGF neutralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Depletion_of_Neutrophils_During_Pregnancy_Leads_to_Impaired_Embryo_and_Placenta_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although activated neutrophils have been implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (22), very little is known about the physiological role of quiescent neutrophils in pregnancy, despite their increased circulating numbers during gestation (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations in the human system in vitro indicate a potential protective role for quiescent neutrophils in pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we sought to validate this hypothesis in murine pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnant C57BL/6 females previously mated with BALB/c males were treated with anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody (clone IA8, 50 g i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; SI Appendix, Fig S3) to deplete maternal neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletions were performed on days 5 and 8 of pregnancy, a time of active placental development in the mouse (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of pregnant mice at day 12 revealed systemically fewer Ly6G+ neutrophils in neutrophil-depleted mice compared with isotype control-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, neutrophil depletion led to a significant reduction in the numbers of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs retrieved in the draining lymph nodes (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological role of niT cells in pregnancy was confirmed by our finding of significantly smaller fetuses (Fig 3 B and C) and placentas (Fig 3 C and D) of neutrophil-depleted pregnancies compared with control pregnancies, a phenotype typical of preeclampsia in humans (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological analyses of placentas in neutrophil-depleted mice revealed a disorganized structure with reduced thickness of the maternal decidua, which contains the maternal spiral arteries (decidua basalis; Db) (Fig 3E), coupled with poor trophoblast invasion into the maternal layer (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both fetal and placental size are determined by maternal uteroplacental perfusion of the placenta, which requires coordinated trophoblast invasion and recruitment and remodeling of the maternal spiral arteries (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that IL-17 can promote trophoblast invasion in vitro (27), it is conceivable that niT cell-derived IL-17 might play a role in this event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of peripheral (induced) Tregs is known to hinder placental development (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this evidence suggests that maternal neutrophils are required for efficient uteroplacental circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transfer_of_Neutrophil-Derived_FOXO1_Is_Required_for_niT_Cell_Induction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophils can regulate specific host responses through the release of microstructures, including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) (29), apoptotic bodies, and microvesicles, which contain a variety of immune-modulatory proteins (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to E3P induced a proapoptotic neutrophil phenotype with low surface expression of CD16 (31) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the cytokine GM-CSF, which promotes leukocyte survival (32), attenuated the proportion of late apoptotic neutrophils (annexin-V+, PI+) by 30% and 50% in control and E3P-treated neutrophils, respectively (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-course analyses indicated that neutrophil apoptosis following exposure to E3P begins at 24 h of coculture (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain insight into the mechanism of niT-cell induction, we investigated the ability of E3P- and/or GM-CSFtreated neutrophils to transfer cytoplasmic material [monitored through myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) staining] to T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas treatment of neutrophils with E3P significantly promoted the transfer of neutrophil proteins to T cells, leading to the generation of niT cells, this response was reduced and/or inhibited when neutrophils were treated with GM-CSF (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, induction of FOXP3 expression was specific to neutrophil-derived apoptotic bodies, as demonstrated by the ineffective coculture of T cells with monocytic apoptotic bodies (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to identify the molecular interactions mediating niT-cell induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first interrogated the role of the neutrophil-abundant protein Annexin-A1 (AnxA1), because its up-regulation is a feature of an anti-inflammatory neutrophil phenotype as promoted by female sex hormones (14, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment of freshly isolated human neutrophils with recombinant AnxA1, at an optimal concentration of 3 nM, reproduced E3P exposure and subsequent niT-cell induction; however, direct addition of AnxA1 to T-cells failed to do so (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These observations were confirmed by experiments with neutrophils and T cells from AnxA1 KO (33) and WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils from AnxA1 KO or WT mice were treated with E3P and cocultured as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E3P-treated neutrophils from WT animals induced FOXP3 expression equally in WT T cells and AnxA1 KO T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neutrophils from AnxA1 KO mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression in T cells irrespective of hormone treatment (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that AnxA1 does not directly induce differentiation of niT cells, but it may facilitate the transfer of neutrophil-derived signaling proteins necessary for niT-cell formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transcription factor FOXO1 is the master regulator necessary for FOXP3 expression in inducible Tregs (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, FOXO1 is expressed by neutrophils, where it is endowed with proapoptotic functions (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both estrogen and progesterone can up-regulate FOXO1 in the placenta during pregnancy, and this transcription factor is important for normal placental development and decidualization (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested whether E3P exposure up-regulates FOXO1 expression in neutrophils, which on apoptosis could then transfer the transcription factor via apoptotic bodies to induce FOXP3 expression in the targeted T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy revealed an 30-fold increase in FOXO1 expression in neutrophils treated with E3P compared with untreated cells (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, EP3 neutrophils were labeled with anti-FOXO1 antibody by brief osmotic shock and kept overnight in serum-free media to generate neutrophil apoptotic bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feeding these apoptotic bodies to autologous T cells effectively transferred substantial amounts of neutrophil-derived FOXO1 to T cells (Fig 5D) and FOXP3 expression (Fig 5E), whereas this transfer did not occur with apoptotic bodies from control neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a causal link between FOXO1 transfer via apoptosis and niT-cell induction, pharmacologic inhibition of FOXO1 significantly inhibited their ability to undergo apoptosis (SI Appendix, Fig S7B) and failed to induce Tregs (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutralization of AnxA1 on E3P-derived neutrophil apoptotic bodies significantly attenuated the transfer of FOXO1 via neutrophil apoptotic bodies on induction of FOXP3 (Fig 5G; compare with 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activated_Neutrophils_from_Preeclamptic_Pregnancies_Fail_to_Induce_niT_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many of the pathological features that we observed in our in vivo model are compatible with those previously reported in preeclamptic pregnancies, including loss of neutrophil quiescence (22) and reduction of circulating Tregs (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preeclampsia is a multiorgan syndrome of pregnancy that most commonly affects first-time pregnancies in the second trimester of pregnancy (27%) and it is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower levels of estriol have been associated with this pathology (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the vascular alterations occurring in pre-eclampsia are well established (43), the impact of immune components in its pathogenesis is less clear (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we next interrogated the role of neutrophils in niT-cell induction in women with preeclampsia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant attenuation in plasma levels of both progesterone and estriol in preeclamptic women compared with healthy pregnancies (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared neutrophil phenotypes in healthy and preeclamptic patients (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated CD11b expression in neutrophil from preeclamptic patients has been reported previously (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present analysis demonstrated that blood and placental neutrophils from preeclamptic patients displayed an activated phenotype, with high levels of CD16, CD62L, and CD11b but lower levels of AnxA1 (Fig 6A and SI Appendix, Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we note how defective AnxA1 signaling has been associated with preeclampsia, because it may result from autoantibodies to the protein or from reduced placental expression of its receptor FPR2/ALX (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make a direct comparison with the observed attenuation in fetal size following our in vivo neutrophil depletion model during pregnancy (Fig 3), we could quantify that offspring born to our preeclamptic group had a significantly lower median birth weight percentile compared with offspring born to mothers in our healthy group [preeclampsia: 22nd percentile (range, 11th35th percentile) vs. healthy: 52nd percentile; range, 44th68th percentile], suggesting fetal growth restriction in our preeclamptic population, akin to that seen in our mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found that a lower proportion over 24 h of neutrophils from preeclamptic patients entered apoptosis (10% vs. 20% of healthy) (Fig 6C), suggesting attenuated apoptotic body formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this hypothesis and congruent with the data in human neutrophils and T cells, we found a significant reduction in the transfer of neutrophil-derived MRP8 and AnxA1 in preeclamptic patient-derived T cell/neutrophil cocultures compared with cocultures of cells from healthy pregnancies (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was also associated with attenuated FOXO1 transfer to T cells from neutrophils from preeclamptic patients compared with their healthy counterparts (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In line with previous reports (40, 46), we observed a significant reduction in circulating and placental CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs in our preeclamptic patients (SI Appendix, Fig S9 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we compared the ability of neutrophils isolated from preeclamptic and healthy donors to induce niT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coculture of freshly isolated neutrophils and T cells from healthy samples (blood and placenta) led to the induction of functionally suppressive niT cells (SI Appendix, Fig S10 A and B), which produced both IL-10 and IL-17 (SI Appendix, Fig S10 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neutrophils from preeclamptic patients failed to induce niT cells, and the minute proportion of these cells found in the cocultures displayed low levels of IL-10 and IL-17 (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treatment of neutrophils from preeclamptic patients with E3P rectified their defect and led to the induction of niT cells and ensuing production of IL-10 and IL-17 (Fig 6E and SI Appendix, Fig S9 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of IL-17 by niT cells may deliver important functions, including microbial defense and promotion of angiogenesis (21), both of which are vital during pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FOXO1-Deficient_Neutrophils_Fail_to_Induce_niT_Cells_and_to_Restore_Embryo_and_Placental_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the mechanistic importance of neutrophil-derived FOXO1 transfer to T cells, we investigated whether neutrophil-derived protein could be transferred to T cells in vivo, and whether loss of neutrophil-derived FOXO1 was responsible for the pregnancy defects observed following neutrophil depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the former question by injecting CFSE-labeled neutrophils at day 6 of pregnancy, following an initial neutrophil depletion at day 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spleen, uterine-draining para-aortic lymph nodes, and nondraining brachial lymph nodes were harvested 48 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S11A, T cells from draining lymph nodes expressed high levels of CFSE, whereas spleen and nondraining lymph node T cells did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, a large proportion of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells expressed Ly6G+ CFSE+ (SI Appendix, Fig S11B), suggesting transfer of neutrophil-derived products to T cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the relevance of the FOXO1/FOXP3 axis to niT-cell generation in pregnancy, we selectively knocked down FOXO1 in murine neutrophils using lentiviral delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific for FOXO1 (FOXO1 30 and FOXO1 42) and a nonspecific control were transduced into bone marrow progenitor cells (SI Appendix, Fig S12 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, progenitor cells were stimulated with GCSF for 5 d to develop into Ly6G+ neutrophils (80% after puromycin treatment; SI Appendix, Fig S12C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, FOXO1-sufficient neutrophils were capable of inducing niT cells when cocultured with naïve T cells, whereas FOXO1-deficient neutrophils were ineffective (SI Appendix, Fig S13A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlated with a reduced ability to induce IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF (SI Appendix, Fig S13 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a final series of experiments, we wished to establish the physiological relevance of this mechanism in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we reconstituted neutrophil-depleted pregnant mice with either FOXO1-sufficient (nonspecific) or FOXO1-deficient (FOXO1 30 or FOXO1 42) neutrophils (3 × 106 i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at days 6 and 9 of pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophil depletion was performed at days 5 and 8 as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnant mice were analyzed at day 12 of gestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar numbers of Ly6G+ neutrophils were present in the uterine-draining lymph nodes following reconstitution with either FOXO1-sufficient or FOXO1 knockdown neutrophils (Fig 7A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, there was no difference in the number of CD4+ T cells (Fig 7A, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the number of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells was significantly decreased (75%) following reconstitution with FOXO1-deficient neutrophils compared with FOXO1-sufficient neutrophils (Fig 7A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by a diminished proportion of cells making IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF following reconstitution of FOXO1 knockdown neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To conclusively establish the effects of reconstituted donor neutrophils on Treg induction and to confirm the results shown in SI Appendix, Fig S11, we used neutrophils from CD45.1 congenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of injected donor CD45.1+ neutrophils is shown in SI Appendix, Fig 13E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone marrow progenitors from these mice were transduced, cultured into neutrophils, and finally injected into pregnant CD45.2 recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the presence of donor CD45.1+ neutrophils at two distinct time points after injection: 16 h and 3 d later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed two distinct populations of neutrophils within the draining lymph nodes at 16 h postinjection: CD45.2+ resident neutrophils and CD45.1+ donor neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of neutrophils did not change significantly despite FOXO1 knockdown, suggesting that FOXO1 is not required for migration of neutrophils to the draining lymph nodes; however, we did not find any CD45.1+ donor neutrophils in nonpregnant controls (Fig 7B, contour plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 3 d postinjection (day 12 of pregnancy), we failed to see any live CD45.1+ donor neutrophils (Fig 7B, dot plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was expected, given that neutrophils need to undergo apoptosis to induce Tregs in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, despite the low number of CD45.1 Ly6G+ neutrophils identified in the draining lymph nodes, we still observed no difference in total number of Ly6G+ neutrophils in the draining lymph nodes (Fig 7A, Left), suggesting that migration of endogenous neutrophils to the draining is not affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be related to the IL-17 made by T cells in the draining lymph nodes (SI Appendix, Fig S13C) following reconstitution of nonspecific transduced neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, FOXO1 knockdown neutrophils, because this cytokine has been shown to promote neutrophil migration into draining lymph nodes (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we did not detect CD45.1 neutrophils in the drainage, we did detect a CD45.1+ signal within the CD4+FOXP3+ T cell population (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this effect was observed only when mice were injected with CD45.1 neutrophils transduced with nonspecific virus, and not with FOXO1-depleted CD45.1 neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CD45.1+ signal within the Treg population was of neutrophil origin, because it was accompanied by Ly6G staining (which was not seen on CD45.2+ cells; Fig 7C for histograms and SI Appendix, Fig 13F for singlet gating).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this phenomenon was pregnancy-specific, because injection of CD45.1 neutrophils into nonpregnant females did not yield a CD45.1 signal in the Treg population recovered from the draining lymph nodes, and was not seen in the nondraining lymph nodes or spleens of pregnant mice (Fig 7C and SI Appendix, Fig 13G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the foregoing data conclusively demonstrate that neutrophils are able to transfer their protein content directly to T cells in vivo to induce Tregs during pregnancy and is hindered in the absence of neutrophil-derived FOXO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both embryo and placenta sizes from pregnant mice reconstituted with FOXO1-sufficient neutrophil were analogous to those in mice that did not undergo neutrophil depletion (Fig 7 DF, Left), coupled with an organized placental structure and normal trophoblast invasion into the maternal layer (Fig 7G, Left and SI Appendix, Fig 13H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnant mice reconstituted with FOXO1-knockdown neutrophils yielded significantly smaller embryos and placentas (Fig 7 DF, Middle and Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The placental layers of these mice displayed a disorganized morphology with poor trophoblast invasion and were comparable to placentas following neutrophil depletion (Fig 7G, Middle and Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in placental phenotype between total loss of neutrophil (depletion) and selective loss of neutrophil FOXO1 suggests that, in addition to niT-cell induction by FOXO1 transfer, maternal neutrophils might exert other direct effects (i.e., niT cell-independent) on placental development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of neutrophils to impact adaptive immunity has recently emerged (10), although it has not been considered in the context of a regulatory/tolerant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a role for a specific neutrophil functional phenotypeconsequent to exposure to maternal and placental hormonesin the induction of a population of proangiogenic T cells with regulatory properties in pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiation of niT cells is reliant on AnxA1-facilitated transfer of FOXO1 contained in neutrophil apoptotic bodies to T cells during activation; niT cells are required to maintain normal pregnancy outcomes as depletion of neutrophils during pregnancy leads to smaller embryo sizes and abnormal placentation in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the presence of activated neutrophils in the maternal circulation has been reported to be detrimental in pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia (22, 48), our observations suggest that a regulatory nonactivated proapoptotic neutrophil phenotype promoted by pregnancy hormones might be essential for normal placentation, including its vascular development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytokine milieu that results from niT-cell generation could favor the establishment of a proangiogeneic environment, with both IL-10 and IL-17 promoting vessel development (21, 49) and IL-17 promoting trophoblast invasion (27, 50), both key processes in spiral artery remodelling (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, and more specifically, we have shown that niT cells make IL-17dependent VEGF, lending further support to their proangiogenic function within the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses carried out in samples from women with preeclampsia provide pathological relevance to this mechanistic work, identifying defects in this physiological circuit that may be contributory to poor pregnancy outcomes of preeclampsia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During healthy pregnancy, the maternal immune system adapts to allow survival of a partially histoincompatible fetus, and failure of this adaptation contributes to poor placental invasion that predates the clinical onset of preeclampsia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have suggested that impaired expansion of inducible Treg (iTreg) cells (40, 51), particularly in the decidua, might represent a pathogenic defect in preeclampsia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key feature of the niT-cell population that we describe is its ability to produce IL-17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas there is general agreement that in healthy pregnancy, there is a preferential differentiation of iTreg cells over Th17 cells systemically, the functional significance of Th17 cells in the decidua is controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased decidual Th17 cell percentage in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages compared with those with healthy pregnancies has been described previously (52); however, another study reported higher percentages of Th17 cells in the decidua in healthy pregnancies (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations suggest that IL-17producing niT cells rather than conventional Th17 effectors in the placenta might in fact be required to support vascular development in healthy pregnancy, given that IL-17 is known to promote angiogenesis and tissue growth (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neutrophil-derived FOXO1 plays an important role in niT-cell induction and the maintenance of embryo size and normal placentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOXO1 is a known important transcription factor that promotes FOXP3 expression in T cells; however, FOXO1 has broader implications in placentation and indeed is necessary for normal placental development, as indicated by the abnormalities observed in FOXO1-null mice (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the role of Tregs in pregnancy might not be confined to regulating immune responses; broader effects of Tregs on the maternal vasculature have been reported, with downstream relevance in controlling hypertension and other cardiovascular events (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Tregs can modulate cell surface proteins on endothelial cells, leading to an anti-inflammatory endothelial cell phenotype (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is tempting to speculate that failure to promote appropriate niT-cell generation might prevent the establishment of a proangiogenic environment within the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The induction of niT cells by neutrophils likely occurs physiologically in the uterine-draining lymph nodes during the presentation of paternal antigens to circulating allospecific T cells, as reported previously (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we have shown that neutrophils can access lymph nodes where they exchange cellular material with T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, neutrophil protein transfer occurs selectively in the uterine-draining lymph nodes, the only likely site of active immunity during pregnancy in otherwise healthy mice, suggesting that T-cell activation is also required for the transfer of neutrophil materialas we have shown in our in vitro studiesand that TCR triggering likely induces a permissive status for the acceptance of neutrophilic proteins into T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular features of this permissive status remain to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, as the induction of this neutrophil phenotype occurs in the absence of other signals (e.g., inflammatory) as a consequence of exposure to circulating hormones, it is conceivable that this functional status might arise in neutrophils systemically during pregnancy and might affect ongoing T-cell activation in sites other than the fetal-maternal unithence the well described remission of antigenically unrelated autoimmune responses during pregnancy (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we report a cell-to-cell cross-talk whereby E3P programs neutrophils to induce proangiogenic T cells, thus enabling sustainable placenta/fetus interface development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that neutrophil regulatory properties in several facets of the adaptive immune response, tolerance in particular, can be further identified to decipher the way in which innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate, providing both opportunities for defining new pathogenic mechanisms and novel modes for therapeutic interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
